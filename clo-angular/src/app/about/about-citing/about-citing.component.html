        <h6>Citing the <i>CLO</i></h6>
        <p>
          Although the <i>CLO</i> is an electronic version of the
          <i>Collected Letters</i>, differences between the two editions make it
          imperative that scholars and students cite the <i>CLO</i> when using
          it.
        </p>

        <h6>MLA citation style, works cited:</h6>
        <p>
          Carlyle, Thomas, and Jane Welsh Carlyle.
          <i>The Carlyle Letters Online</i> [<i>CLO</i>]. Ed. Brent E. Kinser.
          Duke UP, 2007-2016, www.carlyleletters.org.
        </p>

        <h6>MLA citation style, parenthetical documentation:</h6>
        <p>
          In quotations of letters and other texts published in the <i>CLO</i>,
          full attribution should be provided in the writer&#8217;s text,
          including the correspondents, the date written, and the title (if
          quoting an introduction, an appendix, and/or the footnotes to a text).
          If the writer&#8217;s use of attribution provides enough information
          that the reader can easily find the material being cited, then all
          that is necessary for parenthetical documentation is
          &#8220;(<i>CLO</i>).&#8221;
        </p>

        <p>
          If, however, the writer cites a letter or a text with an ambiguous
          date, or one that does not provide enough information to enable the
          reader to find the text easily, then the DOI (Digital Object
          Identifier) of the text to which the writer refers should be copied
          and pasted into parenthetical documentation, (<i>CLO</i> 10.1215/lt-
          18141200-TC-TM-01).
        </p>

        <p>
          DOIs, which will eventually allow the <i>CLO</i> to connect to similar
          electronic projects, can be found on the table of contents page and in
          the bibliographic header for each letter. The parenthetical use of the
          DOI may be shortened, since all DOIs in the <i>CLO</i> begin with the
          prefix 10.1215/. Writers who elect to shorten the DOI should remember
          to provide the universal DOI prefix of the <i>CLO</i> in the works
          cited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bibliographers who require a higher degree of detail should also cite
          the DOI. In addition, the <i>CLO</i> features individual document
          URLs, which make it possible to create hyperlinks to specific texts as
          a method of direct citation.
        </p>

        <h6>Organizing Citations</h6>
        <p>
          Users may keep track of the citations they use in essays manually via
          the &#8220;Add to My Carlyle Folder&#8221; feature (registered users
          only) or via the &#8220;Download to citation manager&#8221; feature
          (useful also for users following citation styles other than MLA), both
          of which appear in the &#8220;Services&#8221; box on letter-view
          pages.
        </p>

        <h6>Permissions</h6>
        <p>
          For permission to publish excerpts from the <i>CLO</i> that exceed the
          dictates of fair use policy, please see the &#8220;Permissions and
          Reprints&#8221; link in the Services box on the <i>CLO</i> home page.
        </p>

        <h6>Using the CLO</h6>
        <p>
          The <i>CLO</i> is designed to be as user-friendly as possible.
          Suggestions to improve or to correct functionality and content are
          always welcome. To submit these suggestions, please see the
          &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; link in the footer of the home page.
        </p>

        <p>
          When viewing an individual letter, users will note two boxes on the
          right side of the screen. The &#8220;Services&#8221; box includes
          features that will help users manage their search of the <i>CLO</i>.
          Clicking on the &#8220;Add to My Carlyle Folder&#8221; link allows
          registered users to create, to name, and to manage folders in which
          they may store letters according to their own research and discovery
          objectives. These folders remain available as long as the user is
          registered to use the <i>CLO</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below the &#8220;Services&#8221; box on the letter-view page, users
          will see the &#8220;Subject / Recipient Indices&#8221; box. The
          results displayed in this box are generated from the subject and
          correspondent indices of the print edition. The intent is to transform
          the role of the index as a rather cumbersome tool for searching into a
          proactive tool for discovery.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because the results are generated from analog indices that never
          professed to be comprehensive in a digital sense, users concerned with
          conducting a full search of the <i>CLO</i> should take advantage of
          the multiple search tools available, including searches by keyword, by
          recipient, by date, and by subject.
        </p>

        <h6>Encoding and Proofreading</h6>
        <p>
          The <i>CLO</i> has been designed and encoded in XML in order to
          conform fully to the guidelines set forth by the Text Encoding
          Initiative Consortium (TEI;
          <a href="http://www.tei-c.org/">www.tei-c.org</a>). Each document has
          been assigned a registered DOI to establish the means for future
          connectivity and to ensure the sustainability of the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          The encoding guidelines for the original <i>CLO</i> were developed in
          2001 by Paolo Mangiafico, Perkins Library, Duke University; David
          Southern, managing editor of the
          <i>The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</i>, Duke
          University Press; and Brent E. Kinser, at the time an editorial
          assistant for the project. The initial encoding of the first
          thirty-two volumes was completed by DNC Data Systems of Mumbai, India
          (<a href="http://www.dncdata.com/index.html">www.dncdata.com</a>). The
          first twenty-seven volumes were keyboarded into digital form using a
          double-entry validation system. Volumes 28&#8211;32 were encoded from
          extant, electronic typesetting files.
        </p>

        <p>
          All of the volumes then underwent a thorough two-phased process of
          proofreading under the direction of the coordinating editor to correct
          errors both in transcription from the print edition and in the XML
          encoding of the data. For more detailed histories of the print and
          electronic editions, follow the links in the <i>CLO</i> footer.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the new version of <i>CLO</i> the encoded volumes have been
          updated from TEI P2 to TEI P5, the most recent version available.
          Also, registered users may now download the XML code (available in the
          Services box).
        </p>

        <h6>Past Editorial Procedures</h6>
        <p>
          Arguably, the most useful justification of editorial process in the
          print edition occurs in Charles Richard Sanders&#8217;s article
          &#8220;A Brief History of the
          <i>Duke-Edinburgh Edition of the Carlyle Letters</i>&#8221;,
          <i>Studies in Scottish Literature</i> 17 (1982): 1&#8211;12. Sanders
          discusses the collection of the letters (Sanders requested and
          received thousands of facsimiles from libraries around the world) and
          the method by which they were organized and stored at Duke:
        </p>

        <p>
          All the facsimiles and even references to the letters not yet found
          are listed on 4x6 cards, a card for each letter. . . . We also put on
          the card all that we know about the letter: where the original letter
          is if we have found it, where it had been printed if it has, whether
          or not there are omissions in the printed text, whether we have the
          letter on microfilm or in a facsimile, and a topical analysis of
          particularly interesting details in the letter. These cards, filed in
          chronological order, our guide to all the Carlyle letters that we know
          about in the world, are kept in a fire-proof filing cabinet.
          (9&#8211;10)
        </p>

        <p>
          Although much has changed since Sanders wrote this description in
          1982, this filing cabinet (no longer fire-proof) remains at the
          Carlyle Letters Office at Duke University Press, and it also remains a
          treasured and valuable resource for the current editors. In his
          article Sanders also discusses the process of editing the letters:
        </p>

        <p>
          The editorial process with each letter begins at Duke, where the
          master file is kept. After a typewritten transcript with a carbon copy
          has been made, the transcript is carefully proofread against the
          facsimile. It is then ready for the Duke editor to write draft notes.
          . . . From time to time collections of the carbon copies are sent to
          the editors in Edinburgh. There the text of the letter is carefully
          read against the original manuscript of the letter if it is in
          Edinburgh. The editors then work through the draft-note sheets
          carefully, altering, adding, and answering queries so far as possible.
          The notes are then re-typed and returned to Duke with the carbon
          copies of the text and the draft notes. After the Duke editors have
          gone through the notes one more time, they are sent to Duke University
          Press, where Mrs. Joanne Ferguson, Mrs. Myrna Jackson, and sometimes
          other copy-editors work with the text and notes before they are ready
          for the printer. (10)
        </p>

        <p>
          According to Sanders, the editors would then reread the typeset text
          in galley proof to check for errors and to add as much new material as
          possible before the beginning of the production phase. Then, as now,
          new letters and insights were being discovered too late for proper
          chronological placement in the print volumes.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the great editorial advantages of the <i>CLO</i> is that newly
          discovered materials no longer suffer from being &#8220;too
          late&#8221;; they now appear in their proper chronological place. This
          change has brought new vigor and relevancy to the editors&#8217;
          search for misplaced and unknown letters and manuscripts of the
          Carlyles.
        </p>

        <h6>Present Editorial Procedures</h6>
        <p>
          In substance, the editorial process outlined by Sanders remains in
          place today, and the editors still routinely check the typescripts of
          the letters against the original manuscripts whenever possible. With
          the passing of time, however, the order of the processes has shifted.
        </p>

        <p>
          The American editors, working from the typescripts already checked
          multiple times according to the process outlined by Sanders, now write
          preliminary draft-notes that are checked and completed by the editors
          in Edinburgh.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Edinburgh editors then also recheck the typescripts against
          manuscript or facsimile versions (the letters retain their form in
          typescript in order to prevent the introduction of new errors) and
          submit them to Duke University Press, along with the electronic files
          of the notes and the editorial apparatus.
        </p>

        <p>
          Duke University Press directs the copyediting of the letters, after
          which they are sent to the Edinburgh editors for penultimate review
          and then to the typesetters for electronic typesetting and printing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The American and the Edinburgh editors are then given the opportunity
          to suggest changes and to correct errors at the proof stage, with the
          Edinburgh editors directing the final steps to publication. The entire
          process for each volume takes approximately three years.
        </p>

        <h6>Correction and Revision History</h6>
        <p>
          Although the source text for the <i>CLO</i> is the
          <i>Collected Letters</i>, the electronic version does not represent an
          attempt simply to re-create the print edition. Because of the
          exigencies of digital searching, for example, silent corrections have
          been made to incorrect references to other letters and texts in the
          <i>Collected Letters</i>. Similarly, typographical mistakes clearly
          not made by the Carlyles, such as missing periods or quotation marks
          in footnotes, have also been corrected silently.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other changes to the print edition are documented at the end of the
          &#8220;Sourcenote&#8221; in square brackets, as in the case of the
          letters published too late for chronological placement in the print
          edition that have been moved in the <i>CLO</i> to their correct date
          position.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div
        class="d-flex flex-column justify-content-start align-items-start p-2 w-50"
      >
        <p>
          Whenever a change is made to the original text of the print edition,
          those revisions are retained in the raw XML files through the use of
          (not displayed) and (displayed) tags, as well as in XML comments.
        </p>

        <p>
          Letters that have been superseded and removed from the collection can
          be found in the &#8220;Revision History,&#8221; a data supplement that
          documents earlier versions of print-edition texts that are no longer
          available in the normal data flow of the <i>CLO</i>. An example is TC
          to JAC, 30 May 1826, a letter that was initially published in volume 4
          from a published version and in volume 7 from a more definitive
          manuscript transcription. The two different versions of the letter had
          the same DOI, which adversely affected the functionality of the
          <i>CLO</i> (especially in terms of the indices). The definitive
          manuscript version has been moved to volume 4, its proper place in the
          chronology of the letters, but the version it superseded is also
          available as a PDF image in the &#8220;Revision History.&#8221;
        </p>

        <p>
          Utilizing the &#8220;Revision History&#8221; in this way allows the
          editor to maintain both the textual history of the edition and the
          functionality of the <i>CLO</i>. And maintaining the provenance of the
          text without diminishing functionality serves as the foundational
          directive for the inclusion of new materials in the <i>CLO</i>.
        </p>

        <h6>Ambiguous Dates</h6>
        <p>
          The primary organizational principle of the <i>CLO</i> is the date of
          composition. Every letter is supplied with an XML tag, docDate, which
          contains the regularizing attribute, &#8220;value.&#8221; For example,
          docDate value="1856-04-30" identifies 30 April 1856. The letters of
          the collection are ordered by means of the docDate value.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the Carlyles do not provide an exact date and when the editors
          are unable to postulate an exact date via context, docDate has been
          assigned a value of &#8220;00&#8221; in the month and/or date
          position, docDate value="1856-04-00" identifies late April 1856.
          Without benefit of human intuition, the database system automatically
          reads &#8220;00&#8221; as &#8220;01&#8221;; the computer, therefore,
          reads and orders late April incorrectly as 1 April.
        </p>

        <p>
          To maintain the sequence established by the editors of the <i>CL</i>,
          all letters that contain a docDate month and/or day value of 00 that
          causes incorrect ordering have been assigned exact document dates.
          These assignments are noted in square brackets at the end of the
          &#8220;Sourcenote.&#8221;
        </p>

        <h6>A Note on the Text</h6>
        <p>
          The textual notes that began to appear with volume 19 of the print
          edition as &#8220;A Note on the Text&#8221; outline philosophical
          justifications for editorial procedures in the print volumes and
          continue to evolve over time as conventions change. Because they
          direct the editorial approach to the copy text for the <i>CLO</i>, the
          textual notes published for the print volumes remain essentially
          relevant to the <i>CLO</i>. &#8220;A Note on the Text&#8221; from
          volume 32 encapsulates the editorial guidelines for the first
          thirty-two volumes of the print edition:
        </p>

        <p>
          Within our editorial conventions we have tried to show as nearly as
          possible what the Carlyles actually wrote. Commas and periods in TC
          and JWC&#8217;s letters have been regularized within quotation marks.
          Anything with square brackets that is not noted indicates
          illegibility, tears, or stains in the manuscript. Damage to
          manuscripts is normally noted in the headnote. All square brackets by
          TC or JWC are normalized to round brackets to avoid confusion with
          editorial square brackets. With TC, who composed carefully, omissions
          of words and letters and occasional misspellings or other errors are
          normally indicated by notes. With JWC, who often wrote hurriedly and
          carelessly, errors are usually unnoted, except when editorial comment
          is necessary to make the text clear, or confirmation is needed that
          such and such was what she set down. Titles cited frequently in the
          notes are abbreviated (see Key to References); others are listed with
          date and place of publication, with the exception of titles published
          in London, which give only the date.
        </p>

        <p>
          In using the <i>Collected Letters</i> as copy text, the text of the
          <i>CLO</i> adheres to that of the print volumes. Because of
          differences in medium, the primary editorial goal of the <i>CLO</i> is
          similar to but different from that of the print edition; it is to
          display texts that represent a complete and accurate reflection of the
          content of the Carlyles&#8217; letters as far as the limitations of
          digital typography and technology allow.
        </p>

        <h6>Square Brackets and Abbreviations</h6>
        <p>
          In the <i>CLO</i>, the editorial use of square brackets as defined in
          the print-edition textual notes has been retained, with a significant
          addition. Letters in the print edition are introduced in a headnote
          that begins with the correspondents and dates of the letter, TC-JWC, 4
          April. The headnote of the print edition has become the
          &#8220;Sourcenote&#8221; in the <i>CLO</i>; it is displayed at the
          bottom of each letter. In the interest of functionality,
          correspondents of the Carlyles in the <i>CLO</i> are required to have
          a unique abbreviation associated with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the limitations of digital searching is that it cannot
          distinguish what to the human eye seems logical. Thus John Forster and
          John Fergus, both JF in the print edition, are now JF and JOFE in the
          <i>CLO</i>. This change was effected because without unique
          correspondent abbreviations the web of hyperlinks that connects the
          letters within the <i>Collected Letters</i> would not
          function&#8212;the computer cannot distinguish between JF (John
          Forster) and JF (John Fergus).

          In the <i>CLO</i> &#8220;Sourcenote,&#8221; when the
          <i>CLO</i> correspondent abbreviation differs from that of the print
          edition, it appears after the print-edition version, in square
          brackets. In the footnote hyperlinks, however, which automatically
          take the user to other letters and texts published in the collection,
          only the <i>CLO</i> abbreviations are displayed, without square
          brackets, unless there is a question as to the identity of the
          correspondent (as in the print edition).

        <h6>Special Textual Entities</h6>
        <p>
          Differences in the typographical capability of the analog and digital
          worlds have changed the way editors and publishers reproduce letters.
          Although the editorial goal of re-creating as closely as possible the
          experience of reading the letters in manuscript form remains central
          to both the digital and the analog projects, one of the strengths of
          analog typography, the re-creation of special textual instances such
          as math notation and Greek writing, proves to be a significant
          weakness of digital display.
        </p>

        <p>
          Simply put, the encoding tools necessary to make unique textual
          entities a seamless part of the data flow are not yet available. This
          weakness, however, is offset by a clear strength, the ability to
          include actual images of manuscripts within the digital resource
          easily.
        </p>

        <p>
          For now, where possible, inline images of special textual instances
          re-created in the print edition&#8212;such as math notation, Greek,
          and the Carlyles&#8217; descriptive squiggles and drawings&#8212;have
          been included. Clearly, the manuscript version of unique textual
          entities carries more editorial worth than typographical attempts to
          re-create them. And initially, users must excuse the rather inelegant
          manner in which some of the print edition&#8217;s typographical
          entities are displayed. Further, in a few instances, such as the
          occasional insertion of large braces that enclose addresses in
          postscripts of letters, the <i>CLO</i> is unable to render a
          satisfactory display at this time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fortunately, such entities are rarely if ever required for scholarly
          citation; they are, however, of great interest from the standpoint of
          providing users with an accurate vision of the Carlyles&#8217;
          creative intent. Additions of &#8220;Manuscript&#8221; views of the
          letters that contain such unique textual entities, therefore, will be
          given top priority as new material is added to the site.
        </p>

        <h6>ODNB Links and Page Numbers</h6>
        <p>
          The <i>ODNB</i> after the birth and death dates of figures links to
          their biography in the <i>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</i>.
          Unlike the print edition, in the <i>CLO</i> all references to other
          letters in the collection use a correspondent and date string (i.e.,
          &#8220;see TC to JWC, 29 Sept. 1847&#8221;) instead of volume and page
          numbers. The page numbers, although not displayed, are retained in the
          raw encoding by means of a wrapper. Each letter and text in the
          collection contains a bibliographic slugline that appears at the top
          of the viewing window of letters and other texts. In addition to the
          DOI, this slugline also identifies the artifact's location in the
          print edition.
        </p>

        <h6>Editorial Philosophy</h6>
        <p>
          The Carlyle Letters Project is one that both benefits and suffers from
          multiple editorial layers. Beginning with the Carlyles themselves,
          through the various collectors of the letters, through the various
          editors of those letters, and through the first fifty years of the
          Duke-Edinburgh edition, editorial conventions and objectives have
          inevitably changed.
        </p>

        <p>
          For instance, in citations of Shakespeare and Milton, users will note
          inconsistencies in format across volumes. Editors of the early
          volumes, following the established conventions of that time, used
          Roman numerals to indicate acts and books. In later volumes, editors
          used Arabic numerals to denote acts and books, a convention that
          remains in place. This shift represents not editorial inconsistency
          but the changing of conventions over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          As necessary corrections and additions are made to the <i>CLO</i>, a
          primary goal of the editorial approach will be to create as much
          consistency as possible across the volumes while recognizing that as
          the coordinating editor endeavors to accomplish this task, editorial
          conventions and the capabilities available to the <i>CLO</i> will
          continue to evolve, which will in turn necessitate changes in the
          editorial approach.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rather than a fatal editorial problem that dooms their future,
          however, the instability of electronic editions, which will also allow
          the correction of textual inaccuracies, the inclusion of newly
          discovered letters in their appropriate locations, connection with
          other electronic resources as they become available, and the expansion
          of the scope and functionality of the resource as technologies
          develop, stands as the greatest potential strength of digital
          collections such as the <i>CLO</i>&#8212;that is, their infinite
          capacity for improvement.
