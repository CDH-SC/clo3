<p>The editors wish to repeat their thanks to all those listed in the Acknowledgements in the opening pages of volumes <ref target="volume-01/ed-01-acknowledgements">1</ref>, <ref target="volume-05/ed-05-acknowledgements">5</ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/ed-08-acknowledgements">8</ref>. A special word of renewed gratitude is owing to the staff of the National Library of Scotland, including Professor E. F. D. Roberts, the Director, and William Ritchie, Stanley Simpson, Margaret Deas, Alison Harvey Wood, and Elspeth Yeo. In addition, the editors would like to express their appreciation to Dr. William Baker; Professor Murray Baumgarten, University of California, Santa Cruz; Dean Betty T. Bennett, Pratt Institute; Rita Bottoms and Jerry James, Library of the University of California, Santa Cruz; Alastair Cowper; Professor Emeritus David Daiches, Institute for Advanced Studies, University of Edinburgh; Elizabeth Deis; Darcel Drew; Ellen S. Dunlap, Humanities Research Center, University of Texas, Austin; Professors Frank Borchardt, Francis Newton, Leland Phelps, and Keith Stanley, Duke University; Margaret Knoerr, Duke University Library; Professor Horst W. Drescher; the late Col. James Edgar, Curator, Carlyle House, Chelsea, and Mrs. Edgar; Elizabeth Ann Falsey, Houghton Library, Harvard University; Kirsty Ferguson; John Green and John Hall, Edinburgh University Library; Professor Joseph Hamburger, Yale University; Professors Fred Kaplan and Michael Timko, City University of New York, Queens; Philip Kelley; Eleanor de Selms Langstaff; the authorities of the London Library; Victor Luftig; Claire McGann, University of Kentucky Library; David Mitchell; Roy M. Pinkerton; Jane Roberts; Pamela Royston; Professor Arthur Sherbo, Michigan State University; William Slayton; Doris M. Sommer; Professor Knud S&#xf8;rensen, Aarhus University; Virginia Surtees; Professor Rodger L. Tarr, Illinois State University, Normal; Professor Martha S. Vogeler, California State University, Fullerton; Sir Allan Walker, Q.C.; Nancy Walter, Carlyle&#x2019;s Birthplace, Ecclefechan.</p>
<p>The title pages of volumes 10&#x2013;12 carry for the last time the name of Charles Richard Sanders. Professor Sanders retired from the Department of English at Duke University in <date when="1972-00-00">1972</date>, but for the next eight years continued as General Editor. Intending to turn his attention to other scholarly projects which he wished to complete, he retired from the Carlyle Letters Project in late <date when="1980-00-00">1980</date>.</p>
<p><pb id="lastpage-10-viii" n="10:viii"/>Professor Sanders was, of course, the initiator of the Project. It was he who collected the letters after a worldwide search, organized the editorial enterprise, and found funding for publication. Without him the <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> would not have begun and would not have proceeded to volumes 10&#x2013;12. The deep gratitude due him cannot be adequately expressed. Happily, he remains a consultant and guide for the project. Professor Sanders has provided an account of the Project, from its inception in <date when="1952-00-00">1952</date> to his stepping down as General Editor in <date when="1980-00-00">1980</date>, in &#x201C;A Brief History of the Duke-Edinburgh Edition of the Carlyle Letters,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Studies in Scottish Literature</hi> 17:1&#x2013;12.</p>
<p>The basic procedures outlined in the <ref target="volume-01/ed-01-introduction">Introduction</ref> to volume 1 continue by and large along the same lines. In an effort to simplify the notes, the editors have adopted most of the style of documentation approved in <date when="1982-00-00">1982</date> by the Modern Language Association of America. In general, this means that arabic instead of roman numerals are used throughout and that, <foreign>inter alia</foreign>, a number of commas employed in previous practice are now omitted. A new principle concerning postmarks is also here introduced for the first time. The date and place of the postmark are given only when it is of significance to the letter itself. For instance, when the postmark can serve as a guide to the dating of a letter, it is provided in simplified form; or when the postmarks indicate something important about the time taken between the posting of a letter and its receipt, they may likewise be given.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We received very thankfully your kind, quaint and cheery Letter, recording your establishment in the new way of life at Ecclefechan. It was doubly welcome, as we had got no news of you, of any distinctness, till it came. You seem to be doing as well as one could expect for the time. &#x201C;There is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">dub</hi></foreign> [puddle] at the end of every town,&#x201D; says the <pb id="pg-10-4" n="10:4"/>Proverb, &#x201C;and a <foreign><hi rend="italic">loch</hi></foreign> at the end of this.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had set up shop in Ecclefechan; for the proverb, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340408-TC-MCA-01"><sic>7:129</sic><corr>TC to MCA, <date when="1834-04-08">8 April 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> In fact one great doctrine everywhere inculcated among men is this, The necessity of <hi rend="italic">cheerful perseverance</hi>. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">brawest</hi></foreign> [finest] new coat we get from the tailor sits not easy at first. We must wear it a while, and then it begins to be easy. I like very well the humour you seem to be in. Joyfulness of hope cannot well be looked for at our time of life, and after so many bitter mistakes; it is enough if one can compose himself, and with quiet diligence endeavour to make his task do for him.&#x2014; Well; you must just persevere there, studying in all ways what will really advance your undertaking, not much disappointed if you see little fruit for a while; by and by you will begin to see fruit. Nay, it seems, your profits already do about suffice to meet your household outlay: this, I think, is great work. It is few trades that will do as much for a man in these days. I have seen many men&#x2019;s trades, including those of statesmen, orators and high-famed persons; and it seems to me the longer I live, the trades of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men look more and more alike: the happiest of all men I think is he who can keep himself the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi>. Be of good cheer then, my dear Brother; and go heartily along there, thinking your task as good as any task, so it be followed faithfully. I will hope to find you quietly progressive when I come back to Annandale; not making any shine, for that is not necessary to the son of Adam, nor good for him; but jogging along, in more and more tranquility of mind, making day and way somewhat alike, among your <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign> and other blessings; growing always the quieter the older you grow. One of the chief things I look towards in increasing age is that of getting quieter. Allan Cunningham tells me &#x201C;a man never gets healthy till he is five-and-forty&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau noted in her Journal, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date>, that &#x201C;Leigh Hunt tells Carlyle that his troubles will cease at five-and-forty; that men reconcile themselves, and grow quiet at that age&#x201D; (Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> [London, <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>] 3:218).</note> That surely is rare news.</p>
<p>Jack, twice over, in his Letters, has insisted much on the necessity of your applying yourself to penmanship in your leisure hours. I report his counsel; and really think it will be worth your while. The main thing you have to aim at is getting to write <hi rend="italic">fast</hi>, and with ease. You have the elements already of a very sufficient hand: <hi rend="italic">throw it out</hi>, I would say; you will find yourself get along better and better. There is nothing else in the world but <hi rend="italic">practice</hi>, continued practice, that will teach any one to write. Jamie Aitken has got himself a capital hand, you see. Rob Hanning even is pointing that way. Go and do likewise! One of the usefullest helps, I may add, is to have a good pen. Can you make a pen to your mind? Try that withal.&#x2014; Why man, if you had a <pb id="pg-10-5" n="10:5"/>free flowing hand, and were perfectly <foreign><hi rend="italic">sicker</hi></foreign> [sure] in the spelling, who knows what all you might write! I have seen a man with less natural wit, do&#x2014;I will not say what.</p>
<p>The only other thing I will say about Ecclefechan at present, is to hope that the poor little <foreign>Bairn</foreign> whom I remember well is not coughing any more. Get flannel for her and the rest, poor little objects; keep them warm, and be kind to them; they will be a blessing to you yet. Jane I find is a speller; that is right: she is a cleverish <foreign>lass</foreign>, or I am mistaken. Tom also must arouse his somewhat sleepy faculty;&#x2014;or on the whole, he is perhaps just as wise to keep himself quiet for the present. To them and their Mother and all of you, we send our best new-year; and pray, as poor Irving used to do, &#x201C;May the worst of our years be <hi rend="italic">past</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 134.</note></p>
<p>As to London and me, there is little stirring since I wrote last. I persist in my old determination to be at rest. I will be a quieter man, tho&#x2019; all the Devils should tempt me otherwise. This I fancy is the main conquest I have made after all; and a great conquest I do find it to be. For the rest, things all go successfully enough. I hear some inklings of a <hi rend="italic">second edition</hi> of the Book; a thing which I suppose will come, tho&#x2019; one cannot well say when, for our Fraser will now have money to pay.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had already arranged for an American edn. of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> (Little &#x26; Brown, Boston, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; in fact, pbd. <date when="1837-12-25">25 Dec. 1837</date>).

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You will be content with a very small Letter today, having heard from me so lately. Indeed, the weather is so frosty that here, with my table turned away from the fire (Jane and I being <hi rend="italic">both</hi> at work), writing is not a good job at all. But the inclosed Letter from Rome came to hand almost a week ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-01-02">2 Jan.</date> TC has trans. three Italian phrases for his mother.</note> and I will not send it off without a line to go with it.</p>
<p>Jack is well, as you will find; has not got his Book-parcel yet; that seems to be his only news. No news, in such a case, is good news. As to the Book-parcel, it has really been a vexatious thing: it was sent off, according to Jack&#x2019;s direction, not very far from a year ago; he expected to have it directly were it once at Paris; to Paris it went without delay; and yet we perceive how it is circulating over the world, not arrived, to this hour!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:173</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-03-21">21 March 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> The man that has it is the Neapolitan Prince you may remember reading of who married an English Miss Smith, greatly to the scandal of his royal brother.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles, prince of Capua (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>), brother of Ferdinand II (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), king of Naples. Charles had been a candidate for the Greek (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) and Belgian (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>) thrones. There seems to have been tension between the two brothers even before Charles met an Irish girl, Penelope Smyth (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), in Naples in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>. The couple eloped and were married in Rome by Cardinal Weld, <date when="1836-04-05">5 April 1836</date>; then in Madrid; then in Gretna Green and London, <date when="1836-05-07">7</date> and <date when="1836-05-23">23 May 1836</date>. Ferdinand II remained hostile though he granted Penelope the title of Duchess of Villalta, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; the couple lived nomadically until the unification of Naples with Italy, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, when Victor Emmanuel II allowed their return and granted them the title of Mascali.</note> <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> and he have doubtless other things to think of than parcels.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had told him that Charles and Penelope &#x201C;did not halt in Rome&#x201D; but had gone straight to Charles&#x2019; villa at Gensano.</note> However, one may hope it will arrive by and by. I want Jack to see it in Rome; both because it will amuse him, and also because I imagine there are many things in the Book that he will object to at first and afterwards reconcile himself to,&#x2014;which process I want to be completed before he comes home rather than after it. He has no Practice this winter, as you will see; but what then? He has good wages without any. We ought to be very thankful that all is so well with him.</p>
<p>Two days after the arrival of Jack&#x2019;s Letter there came one from Jean at Dumfries;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> addressed <hi rend="italic">both</hi> to Jack and me: I knew not well what to make of it at first; but decided for breaking it up; it then appeared <pb id="pg-10-8" n="10:8"/>that I was meant to read it and then forward it; thereby according to a cunning plan had the goodwife succeeded in <hi rend="italic">saving</hi> herself a Letter to me, which she had owed me for some time! I filled up the margins, with any small tidings I had, and sent off the Letter; engaging to write again, so soon as I had sent off the <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His review-essay &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:311</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> as Jack desired which I thought would be in some ten days.&#x2014; Jean is very particular, and affords us a very authentic-looking picture of Dumfriesshire things. She and her household are well; James busy gathering in monies; he expects to be in Manchester some time in <date when="1838-02-00">February</date>. The little Boy seemed to be very brisk, tho&#x2019; a little affected in the digestion at times. You should impress upon her the necessity of keeping the little <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> warmly clad, and attending to what he eats. She said there had a Letter come from Manchester &#x201C;on Thursday last,&#x201D; representing all right. It was partly her notion, you and Jenny might come over when James returned: however, as to this, you will see how the weather &#x26;c is, and what your own notions are. If Robert see you on board the Steamboat in tolerable weather, there is no difficulty farther. As to the Annandale people Jean informed us that all were in good health; that Alick was sticking steadily to his shop, very much confined by it, and had sent to James to &#x201C;buy him some oranges and barley&#x201D;; he was keeping &#x201C;<foreign>mall in shaft</foreign>,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Keeping things going&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290305-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:9</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1829-03-05">5 March 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note> he said; which was fair work for the time. The Austins were very much wearied of Annan and the carting trade; which surely I think is no wonder. James Austin and Jamie of Scotsbrig were going up, she said, to Drumpark (on the Puttock road, you remember),<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Four mi. S of Dunscore on the road to Dumfries.</note> to look at a little farm there. I infer there has nothing turned up about Stennybeck yet; I have asked several times, but nobody has answered me.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:310</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> Jean said there were very many small farms to be let this very season; I could like much indeed to hear that poor Austin had got one of them so that he could live in it. I imagine Mary and he would be as industrious and as thrifty a pair as could well try: there really ought to be an effort made; some way or other we would not fail to get them set up in it. I do hope there will be some effectual trial made; I am uneasy to think of the sore work and small wages and general discouragement of Annan. In a Letter that Jane was writing to Mary I said something about it, I do not well remember what: if you can forward the business in any way, by reporting me or otherwise, no doubt you are anxious enough to do it.&#x2014; This is enough about Annandale news.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-9" n="10:9"/>Here at London everything in [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] <hi rend="italic">froze in</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>8:271</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> as they call it; one has no news but of frost. What becomes of you my dear Mother in these bitter days and nights? Many a time I think of you; for even I, who usually care nothing about cold, now suffer from it. I hope the new house is close and tight; I know you have coals enough. Do you wrap yourself in flannel from head to foot; do you take a warm bottle to bed with you? There is nothing unwholesomer in the world than cold. I think Jenny and you ought hardly ever to go out: the streets are slippery, you cannot walk fast for falling; and without walking fast there is no heat. Our London houses, and coals at 30 or 40 shillings a ton, are not made for frost. From the first night of the business everything has been frozen in every room here where there are not fires. One&#x2019;s towel is frozen in the morning; the water-jug, is an ice-jug; to get your hands washed is a problem. Jane never goes out at all; she keeps very well hitherto. Keep close you too; it will be thaw by and by!</p>
<p>I think I told you about sending off the list of my Writings to America and that it seemed likely they would be reprinted there first. Since then poor Fraser has grown sicker and sicker, and never stirs out; I really begin to fear he is not in a good way. It is a dangerous disease; the same that old Fletcher&#x2019;s wife died of, if you remember.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371207-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:357&#x2013;58</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-12-07">7 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371223-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:375&#x2013;76</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-12-23">23 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref> Mrs. Fletcher is unidentified.</note> Poor Fraser! I am heartily sorry for him; but still hope it may not be so bad.</p>
<p>For the rest, I am reading; reading, and walking, and musing in various moods. I should decline writing anything more at present even if I were pressingly asked. One of these days, I mean to get into &#x201C;a place by mysel&#x2019;,&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date>, TC noted, &#x201C;I determined like James Aitken&#x2019;s mad Joiner to have &#x2018;a place by mysel&#x2019;.&#x2019; Yesterday accordingly I got great store of paper, batter, &#x26;c with hammers tacks and wood wedges; and have pinned up the folding-doors.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> and begin seriously meditating my <hi rend="italic">Course of Lectures;</hi><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC drew up the syllabus for it on <date when="1838-02-16">16 Feb.</date></note> for it becomes more and more apparent that a Course must be delivered, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">what</hi> course is still almost as obscure as ever. At the same time, I am far <hi rend="italic">cooler</hi> and quieter now than I was last year, or even when I parted with you; so I have hopes we shall get tolerably thro&#x2019; some way or other, &#x201C;after all Mother.&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech: &#x201C;Poor fellow, after all!&#x201D; was a phrase of John&#x2019;s that became a family joke (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:119).</note> The difficulty is in getting a name and form for the thing; for as to substance of it, I could talk to the people for a month, were my <hi rend="italic">jaw</hi> once loosed. We must commence, and gird ourselves together; for the time draws nigh.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-10" n="10:10"/>But see what a length I have run to; saying mere nothing!&#x2014; You must try to convey some intelligence of the Doctor&#x2019;s new Letter over into Annandale; I wrote thither, as you heard, when <hi rend="italic">your</hi> last turn was.</p>
<p>You will get the <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott</hi> I hope about the beginning of the month. It is to be out next week; I will do what I can to have it sent off in time.&#x2014; No news more. I am cold everywhere but in the <hi rend="italic">head</hi>, which is covered with a whole fleece of hair, not having been cropt or meddled with since it was done in Dumfries. Think what it must be like! I go always in my cloak; I got a new hat last night: a shaggy almost dangerous-looking man!</p>

After his deposition from the Church of Scotland ministry in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, he had pursued an independent ministry at Woolwich, a dockside borough S of the Thames.

<salute>My dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>You are a very cunning old <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi> to save yourself the trouble of writing me a Letter, and make one do for both Jack and me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref> Jean&#x2019;s letter not found.</note> However, it is all right: after a moment or two of hesitation, I opened the <pb id="pg-10-12" n="10:12"/>sheet, and read it, very glad to hear all the news: I filled up the margins, and sent it duly off to Jack; promising that I would write to him on my own footing in a few days. A Newspaper that came from him shortly after that, I despatched to you with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke, as you requested; so I hope you understood on your side too that all was right.&#x2014; You give us, as usual, a very faithful-looking picture of all that is going on among the <foreign>clan</foreign>; let us be thankful that there is nothing worse to report. And so, as there is a frank for Mrs Welsh in the wind, I will add a line for you today, and bring matters up to the level between us.</p>
<p>About the time your Letter came there had been news from Manchester;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Janet and Mrs. Carlyle, <date when="1838-01-02">2 Jan.</date></note> to the same purport as those you yourself had: That all was well, our Mother in good heart, and calculating on Scotsbrig along with Jenny when the spring weather came. She had heard from Jack at Rome, and wrote me mainly on that account.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1837-12-16">16 Dec. 1837</date>, not found. Margaret Carlyle also wrote: &#x201C;I have read your Sarter Resartes and like the proffeser better than ever he is such a lover of truth I hope he will yet prosper and do well.&#x201D;</note> Jack was well: but indeed very shortly after that Manchester Letter came, there arrived one here from Jack himself to the same effect:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-01-02">2 Jan.</date></note> I despatched it to our Mother just about the time yours was sent off towards Rome. Our Doctor, as I say, was well; settled in his N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 189, Corso, Rome; his Lady well, and languid-polite as usual: he had got no practice, and expected none, the English being all frightened off by the cholera in Autumn; he was reading, writing; and expecting patiently his time of return in the beginning of summer. His main article of tidings, a very small one, was about a Parcel containing the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> and some other book-trash, which had been sent off almost a year ago by me according to his order, and had never yet arrived; much to his disappointment there. He seemed to have lost temper at last; and talked of a desire to give some poor little Frenchman &#x201C;a beating&#x201D; if he could get hold of him.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. B. Zangolli; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:173</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-03-21">21 March 1837</date></corr></ref>. John had written: &#x201C;the little <hi rend="italic">haddock</hi> of a landlord at 5 Place Vend&#xF4;me deserves a beating for having been so negligent and having lied so often.&#x201D;</note> However, he said there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> now a near prospect of the Parcel coming, and he would send me a Newspaper with three strokes when it did come:&#x2014;accordingly the Paper you got <hi rend="italic">had three</hi> strokes on it, and had given me the appointed signal before you got it as a signal with one stroke. You can fancy the Doctor therefore sitting reading the Book in these days, with mixed indignation and admiration like the rest of the world; and on the whole going on very tolerably in the fashion we have understood of old.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-13" n="10:13"/>Your news of Alick was very welcome.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> I had heard from him some time before, and had written him in answer. I pray Heaven he may prosper in that new enterprise. If he could quiet his indignant temper (too strong in all of us), and stand to the business in simplicity, in cheerfulness and perseverance, I should think there would be no fear. He has had much to endure; like some others of us too, he is too proud, and has a <hi rend="italic">dibble of a temper</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230326-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:316</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-03-26">26 March 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> Ah me! It is hard to get along in that case. The pride has to be tamed out of one; were it with many stripes and scourges.&#x2014; Has Austin made anything of that Farm at Drumpark?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> I would give something to hear that he had got it, or another he could live in. I will beg James and you to do all in your power towards forwarding them. If a little money would accomplish it for them, we could contrive to make that up somehow among us.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> Annan and the life they have there is very disheartening. Another thing I had to speak about was your <hi rend="italic">little</hi> James. It is clear to me the little creature is of a <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> constitution; as to which there are two princip<supplied>[les]</supplied> you should never leave out of view: To keep the poor little body <hi rend="italic">warm</hi>, warm with light flannel clothing, and by every fair method; <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi>, to attend at all times strictly to the nature of the food eaten. Sugary things, indeed most of the things children are fondest of are decidedly unwholesome. You must watch, and see and ascertain. Above all things I must insist on heat. My astonishment is how children ever live at all considering how they are clad.</p>
<p>As to London, we are well; Jane is better than she has been this twelvemonth, in spite of the rigorous frost; she keeps herself close within doors. For my share I cannot complain either;&#x2014;except it be of the want of work; of the inability to work. All writing has grown a disgusting matter to me. I must even wait till I rally again! Fraser the Bookseller, I am afraid, is in a very bad way as to health; not a word can be said at present about our enterprise: they are going to print the things, however, it seems, in America.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> Very curious! Also the clear likelihood is that I shall be <hi rend="italic">lecturing</hi> within three months hence; tho&#x2019; on what subject neither I nor any man yet knows. I am canvassing it in my head; I am <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> for it; but nothing is yet shaped. I live very quiet; sometimes happy, at other times in bad spirits and unhappy; it all depends on what is within myself: I ought to &#x201C;work mostly in a place by mysel&#x2019;.&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-14" n="10:14"/>A copy of the Article <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> will be sent off for James by M&#x2019;Kie&#x2019;s<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John McKie, Dumfries bookseller.</note> parcel: I think you ought to get it about the Wednesday after this comes. There is only one for you and one for Mrs Welsh: the people have mismanaged it all, as they often do: however, you will get it to read, and can then lend it to Alick, or to any of the rest that want to see it. My Mother gets a copy; and Jack specially requested one, tho&#x2019; perhaps it is doubtful whether it ever reach him. The people praise the Article; but it deserves no praise; it deserves only to be paid for and forgotten.&#x2014; Well, I must end here, and set to my daily task of reading. I expect a Letter from some of you before long. I have never got into right trim for writing yet to anybody. Jane sends her kind love to you all. Remember me to everybody by name.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Unluckily or luckily this notion of writing on the Working Classes has in the interim died away in me; and I have altogether lost it for the present. I have got upon Thuycidides, Johannes M&#xfc;ller, the Crusades, and a whole course of objects connected with my Lectures; sufficient to occupy me abundantly till that fatal time come.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first lecture, <date when="1838-04-30">30 April</date>, dealt with the Greeks, for whose history TC used Thucydides: &#x201C;this is all told by Thucydides&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi>, ed. Greene 8). The second, <date when="1838-05-04">4 May</date>, began with Homer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Iliad:</hi> &#x201C;Johannes von M&#xfc;ller says of them that they are the oldest books of importance after the Bible&#x201D; (17). J. von M&#xfc;ller, <hi rend="italic">Vier und zwanzig B&#xfc;cher allgemeiner Geschichten</hi>, 3 vols. (T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), trans. as <hi rend="italic">Universal History</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>). In the fourth lecture, <date when="1838-05-11">11 May</date>, TC referred to the Crusades as &#x201C;a strange phase of the healthy belief, the deep belief of the time&#x201D; (72).</note> We will <pb id="pg-10-15" n="10:15"/>commit my Discourse on the Working Classes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The germ of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.</note> once more to the chapter of chances.</p>
<p>I do not know that my train of argument would have specially led me to insist on the question you allude to: but if it had&#x2014;! In fact it were a right cheerful thing for me could I get to see that general <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> were going on there; and I think I should in that case wash my hands of Radicalism forever and a day. Ah me, it is a bitter mockery to talk of &#x201C;improvement&#x201D; to the men I have known! Ebenezer Elliot is with me; Machinery, and Population increasing 1200 a day, are with me. Francis Place is against me, a man entitled to be heard. As to &#x201C;Commissioners&#x201D; and their evidence I do verily take it all to be worth almost nothing in that matter;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill was anxious to appeal to &#x201C;the more reasonable &#x26; practical of the working classes&#x201D; (Mineka 13:380) and keep TC as a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref>). He had clearly asked TC for an article about the working class sometime in <date when="1837-12-00">Dec. 1837</date> or soon after. But though TC was attracted by the idea, he refused to accept the belief that conditions were improving. He saw Place, a Benthamite and neo-Malthusian, as against him; Elliot, against the Corn Laws, as with him; and the commissioners of the new Poor Law and their statistics as irrelevant. All this was to be made explicit in &#x201C;Chartism&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:118&#x2013;204).</note> your answer is according to your question, and your questionee,&#x2014; &#x201C;as the fool thinks the bell clinks,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf. also &#x201C;As the <hi rend="italic">statist</hi> thinks, the bell clinks&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29:124).</note> and all things whatsoever can be demonstrated if you choose your man.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Some week or ten days ago, I sent you off a Letter from our Sister Jean, with the margins filled by myself: the promise was given there that I would write on a sheet of my own so soon as the Article <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott</hi> was fairly got under way towards you according to your request. The Article, in a very rude condition, came into my hands on Saturday last; Cavaignac has now got it lying on his mantel-piece, wrapt up as you prescribed, like a newspaper of four sheets, which he will assure me shall be lodged safely, by one of his comrades, in the <hi rend="italic">Bureau des Diligences</hi> at Paris, thereafter to take its fate. There are two covers on it, like what your Newspaper have; one of them can be abstracted at Paris, its function being finished there: you will know my hand; and can refuse it, if charged above sixpence, for it is not worth more. Cavaignac cannot <hi rend="italic">assure</hi> me of a conveyance within a fortnight, he <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have one tomorrow or any day. So stands it. And now according to engagement I write. The only other good news about Rome is a Newspaper with three strokes that came last Monday (they almost always come on Monday); indicating that the Revolution Book-packet has actually got to hand; that probably you have it all read by this time, and are grumbling at it and rejoicing over it, and contemplating <pb id="pg-10-17" n="10:17"/>the huge Orson-structure of it in such humour as you can.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;The F. R. I knew from the first to be <hi rend="italic">savage</hi>, an orson of a book.&#x201D; Cf. also <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:72</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-12-20">20 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:320</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> This Newspaper was, as you may fancy, very welcome to us. And now if you had <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi>, all will be right, and you will find yourself on a level with your age on that side. Much good may it do you! I add only that the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> packet does not shew any sign of Scott, but only I think of one Arnott and &#x201C;Thermometer Stoves,&#x201D; that being the final sheet, put on the surface to suffer the wearing.</p>
<p>Nothing has occurred since I wrote, at least nothing bad. All was well when Jean&#x2019;s Letter went; there have been no tidings since then. Our horrid frost is off during these four days; succeeded by blackness of fogs, by bitterness of east winds.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC described the weather on <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;A frost has now lasted for some five weeks, making the most inclement weather, which even I greatly dislike. Our Thames was like an Arctic river; all full of tumbling ice-masses, and till a day or two ago absolutely without boats. One day I saw two men crossing it on foot; they seemed to have a little plank of wood, and so bridged themselves over the weak places: about high-water the icebergs were all tumbled together, and made a continuous flow of frost. Today still it is rime and fog, ice-dust were there wind.&#x201D;</note> Jane nevertheless holds out in good order, chiefly by dint of keeping herself quiet and in the house. I too am about as well as usual; my main complaint is a huge head of hair, which I cannot get cropt till the weather grow warmer. Were it not for the tyranny of fashion, I would bend it all back, tie it in a knot behind, and never crop it more, whistling at all barbers for ever thenceforth. We live very quiet, fewer visiters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] than usual in the fierce weather; more especially as the Frenchmen have now gone all elsewhither,&#x2014;Marrast wedded, to one unknown to us;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:368</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> Cavaignac busy writing a book<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:368</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> and preparing for an Irish tour; Garnier<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350527-TC-JSM-01"><sic>8:125</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1835-05-27">27 May 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> invisible; Pepoli lecturing at Brighton.

The Maurices are also wearisome, and happily rare; all invitations &#x201C;to meet the Maurices&#x201D; I, when it is any way possible, make a point of declining.

One of the most entirely uninteresting men of genius that I can meet with in society is poor Maurice to me. All twisted, screwed, wiredrawn; with such a restless sensitiveness; the uttermost inability to let Nature have fair play with him! I do not remember that a word ever came from him betokening clear recognition or healthy free sympathy with any thing. One must really let him alone; till the prayers one does always offer for him (purehearted, earnest, humane creature as he is) begin to take <hi rend="italic">effect</hi>. Did you ever see Thomas Erskine (Evidence Erskine, <foreign>Laird</foreign>, Advocate &#x26;c), the Scotch Saint?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>) of Linlathen, nr. Dundee; became an advocate, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>, practicing until his brother&#x2019;s death, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>, and a religious writer who believed in universal salvation. He was staying for three months in London before a continental trip lasting until <date when="1839-00-00">mid-1839</date>. He had known Alexander Scott since <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>. On this visit he first met F. D. Maurice, whom he later admired, Hensleigh Wedgwood, and Dunn. TC called him &#x201C;Evidence Erskine&#x201D; after his <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Internal Evidence for the Truth of Revealed Religion</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>). He was universally liked, and he became TC&#x2019;s firm friend. Erskine wrote to his sister, <date when="1838-02-06">6 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;it is good &#x2026; to be brought in contact with a mind like Carlyle&#x2019;s, so unconventional in all matters&#x201D; (Hanna 1:301).</note> I have seen him several times lately, and like him as one would do a draught of sweet rustic <hi rend="italic">mead</hi> served in cut glasses and silver tray. One of the gentlest, kindliest, best-bred of men. He talks greatly about &#x201C;symbols&#x201D; and other Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckhiana; seems not disinclined to <hi rend="italic">let</hi> the Christian Religion pass for a kind of Mythus, provided men can retain the spirit of it well. Likewise I have seen Scott, Edward Irving&#x2019;s Scott;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. A. J. Scott.</note> a man much sobered now, tho&#x2019; not at the end of his fermentations yet; who, for one thing, &#x201C;has read the French Revolution four times over, every word of it&#x201D;! What think you of that? He lives at Woolwich, and lectures twice weekly to thirteen persons, the rich portion of whom maintain him for doing it. He has a good laugh in him; and brings one in mind of several good things. On the whole I take up my old love for the Saints.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;This Erskine reconciles me to the Saints, after a long abeyance; he is one of the most humane polite men I have ever seen. Strange that they can tolerate me.&#x201D;</note> No class of persons can be found in this country with as much humanity in them; nay with as much tolerance as the better sort of them have. The tolerance of others is but doubt and indifference; touch the thing they do believe in and value, their own self-conceit, they are rattlesnakes then!

One Erasmus Darwin, a grandson of the great Darwin, is a friend of theirs; comes often here,&#x2014;driving his cab; an Italian, German travelling University sort of man, who <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;kept a cab&#x201D;</hi> if you know what that means: a very polite, good, quiet man.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:148</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb. 1837</date></corr></ref>.

Very strange if my first payment for this work should reach me out of Yankee-land, as possibly enough it may do!&#x2014; Under these circumstances I lead a strange dreamy <foreign><hi rend="italic">daunering</hi></foreign> [aimless] Life at present; in general not a little relieved and quieted; yet with all the old features of Burton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Melancholic Man</hi>,<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Burton, <hi rend="italic">The Anatomy of Melancholy</hi> (<date when="1621-00-00">1621</date>).</note> today full of peaceable joy (ah no, not peaceable entirely, there is a <hi rend="italic">black</hi> looks thro&#x2019; it still!), then tomorrow for no assignable cause sunk into sadness and despondency. But verily the Book has done me great good. It is like a load of fire burning up my heart, which by Heaven&#x2019;s favour I have got thrown <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of me. I feel as if in some quiet place, with bread to eat, with books to idle over, and a horse to keep me tolerably peptic, I could live in singular tranquillity for a good many years now. Nay even in my blackest despondencies, when utter Obstruction and Extinction seems to threaten me, I say, Well, it shall take my life, but my quiescence it shall spare!&#x2014; Consider therefore, O Jack, what thou withal art meaning to do! If ever at all for practicing in London, next year I think will be the time for it. Years, a few years at your time of life, do singularly unfit one for new situations. One sees to the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of it; answers languidly to many a problem, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cui bono</hi></foreign> [of what use]? I cannot advise <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> but I think it is a pity we did not live more within call of one another. Perhaps we shall be able to decide something in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>; perhaps not: we shall see what time and we will decide about it. I cannot pretend to say that your Italian position contents me; but it is more tolerable than a thousand others. My own life has been always and still is a fierce fight with manifold falls and risings again, such as it were not wise in any one to join himself to. London I could live in, had I something to live with; tho&#x2019; I do not see that I could ever <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> it as a place to live in. My feeling of domestication in it does not seem in the least to increase; there is little or nothing I could not leave in it tomorrow morning with dry eyes; much that I should rejoice to leave: its soot, for instance, its dust and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud], <pb id="pg-10-21" n="10:21"/>its tumult, quackery, dupery and loud inanity; ah me, one would sing <foreign>Te deum</foreign> on leaving all that. Yet I can stay here. We shall see.</p>
<p>The distinguished female<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau.</note> has entirely consumed my time; and I had thoughts of going into the City; to get <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> reduced into <hi rend="italic">cash</hi>, among other purposes: &#xa3;45 is all they have given me draught for; really it is enough. At any rate I must finish <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. You will write of course the very first hour you have. I hope a Newspaper in the interim. Jane sits by me, reading Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine; sends love and assurance that she has &#x201C;been borne thro&#x2019; the winter with an honourable through-bearing.&#x201D;<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:243</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> Enjoy your beautiful Italian Spring.

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>In a Note just written, to Mr Adamson Factor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson, lawyer, agent, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>, for the British Linen Bank, Irish St., Dumfries. Of this letter and its arrangements for Craigenputtoch TC remarked in his Journal, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date>, &#x201C;a job I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like.&#x201D;</note> for the farm of Craigenputtoch, which place he has advertised for letting on lease, I have referred him, in so far as anything might turn up in respect of the house and park, to you as my <foreign>factotum</foreign> in the matter. You must act for me in regard to it, and decide for me; I have told Adamson that your decision was to be regarded as mine. In all probability he will consult you. I will now recapitulate to you what I have stated to him as the gist of my purpose about it; much the same, or perhaps altogether the same as my last directions to you on the road from Ecclefechan to Scotsbrig that day you drove me over.</p>
<p>Our special properties at Craigenputtoch, as you know, are the house with garden, offices, woods, the cow-park, and right of cutting what peats are needed on the moor there. I have told Mr Adamson that I am ready to let the favoured tenant, provided he be not a savage man likely to ruin the house, have the whole premises there for &#xa3;20 additional rent. That it was understood M&#x2019;Queen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John MacQueen, who had rented Craigenputtoch with his mother, Nanny MacQueen, in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340522-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:179&#x2013;82</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-22">22 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> would offer both for <pb id="pg-10-24" n="10:24"/>farm and house; and that if he will come up to these terms, he has <hi rend="italic">my</hi> consent; but for the rest that there is to be no cramping of the farm-letting by this of the house, but the house is to be left to its fate, if a tenant eligible for the farm prove unsuitable for <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. M&#x2019;Queen I have rather commended; M&#x2019;Adam discommended (as he deserves):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph M&#x2019;Adam, who had rented Craigenputtoch farm in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320629-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:180</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-06-29">29 June 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340522-JWC-TC-01"><sic>7:180</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-22">22 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> they will decide as they like about that. And now suppose M&#x2019;Queen should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be preferred, or should not incline to give the &#xa3;20 (which is but &#xa3;10 or &#xa3;8 for the house, since M&#x2019;Adam I remember offered &#xa3;12 for the park itself), it will rest with you, in that case, to determine what is to be done; and really I have no doubt you are far better qualified to do it than I here, hundreds of miles off the place, and thousands of miles off the sort of business connected with it. It strikes me however that if no <hi rend="italic">un</hi>destructive tenant will give anything, say so much as &#xa3;8 for the house, then in very deed it is worth something more than <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to ourselves, standing there empty, ready to be let to any game-destroyer; ready to be lived in any summer, should such a notion come upon us. I suppose Nanny M&#x2019;Queen would be willing to live in it for nothing as she now does, on the clear understanding, which ought to be made <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> to her, that she was bound to admit reasonable game-destroyers to a reasonable share of it without farther <foreign>fash</foreign> [trouble] like that of last summer.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370818-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:292</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1837-08-18">18 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> Or if Nanny preferred taking herself away, then I suppose Peter Austin<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Carstammon.</note> or some honest neighbour would for a small sum consent to look after it, so that it could be let in shooting time. The field in that case might be let to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, if he wanted it; or it might be let to the tenant with the understanding that at any time he would surrender it, on a deduction of &#xa3;10, or whatever the rent he gave for it was. In short, dear James, it is a confused, contingent business; which can only be decided on the spot. I shall request you to put yourself in my place, and to decide for me. You can consult with Alick if you are in any doubt. I add only that in case Nanny M&#x2019;Queen goes away, there is a long list of furniture and lumber (not valuable, but yet rendering the house <hi rend="italic">habitable</hi>) which she got for &#xa3;30, with this stipulation that we were to have the power (not the obligation, at all, at all) of purchasing them back for the same money at her departure. Whether it may be of any use to insist on this, or at all go into it, I do not in the least know; I do not even know, nor is it <hi rend="italic">written</hi> anywhere to my knowledge, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the things purchased <hi rend="italic">were:</hi> however, Alick does know, and will assist you with his counsel, or with more active <pb id="pg-10-25" n="10:25"/>help on the spot if that be needed. Jane is clearly of opinion that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> matter ought to be left where it is; and truly seems to be right. Therefore, let it lie.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Not the obligation, at all, at all)&#x201D; and from &#x201C;Jane is&#x201D; to &#x201C;let it lie&#x201D; were added later by TC; see postscript. All words in square brackets between &#x201C;Puttoch&#x201D; and the end of the para. are conjectural, owing to a torn MS.</note> The chance of our soon coming to bury ourselves for a few weeks in the summer at Puttoch is certainly not <supplied>[grea]</supplied>t. It may be doubted likewise whether &#xa3;30 worth of furniture, laid out for the cha<supplied>[nce of g]</supplied>ame-shooters were not very much of the nature of money ill spent. Alick and you <supplied>[discuss i]</supplied>t; you will know how to decide. I beg you <hi rend="italic">to</hi> decide, with the best wit you <supplied>[have and]</supplied> in the spirit of mercy to keep me free of farther <foreign>fash</foreign> [bother] on the subject. And so <supplied>[good be with y]</supplied>ou. Do your best; and reckon that the best can do no better, <supplied>[and]</supplied> that you <supplied>[have]</supplied> well deserved my thanks, go as it will.</p>
<p>It is but short while since I wrote Jean all my news. Today I sent you a Roman Newspaper, which had just come with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes; indicating that Jean&#x2019;s Letter had got to hand safely, and that all was well. The Article <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> was duly sent off; and I conjecture would arrive duly. I have not heard a whisper from Annandale or Scotland since Jean&#x2019;s Letter. I must write to my Mother tomorrow.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; We are tolerably well, in spite of the horrid grimness of this frost; which afflicts me, fond as I am of cold, and keeps Jane close prisoner these many weeks. Tell your goodwife to wrap that bit boy in flannel; I am sorry for him and all short-skirted creatures, poor little thing. The people here are all begging; very ill off many of them; without work, and coals near &#xa3;2 a ton! It cannot last always thus.</p>
<p>My great outlook for the present is getting something ready in the shape of <hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi>. I know not what it is to be; but I have yesterday taken possession of a separate room, with intent to continue there till I ascertain what. Like your half-frantic Joiner, I <foreign><hi rend="italic">aye maistly</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">work in a place by mysel&#x2019;;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> finding a great convenience in that. There is little doubt but something will come out of me by and by. In the mean while all goes tolerably enough; I am as much praised &#x26;c as is good for me, or perhaps more: I have assurance that if I muster impudence and anything to say, there will be people to hear me. The Review Articles are to be printed in America; the F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I have just learned <hi rend="italic">is</hi> printed again there: I am to have a little money, it means, from both those enterprises; it will be curious enough,&#x2014;were it once come.</p>
<p>I beg a thousand kind remembrances to all the kindred: I should like well and very well to hear that all was well with you, that Mary &#x26; her James had got a farm, that Alick&#x2019;s new trade was prospering, that <pb id="pg-10-26" n="10:26"/>you were all in your usual course with progress more or less. I think Alick too is in my debt as to letters. Jane writes with me in kind love to you and yours;&#x2014;advises withal that you &#x201C;keep yourselves quiet, close and snug during this wild weather.&#x201D; I hope your accounts have been moderately well paid up; that you are fronting the new-year under fair auspices. Be steady, be active, patient. The hand of the diligent will not even yet be entirely foiled. Good be with you <supplied>[and yo]</supplied>ur friends! <closer><salute>So prays, your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have come down here into a room of my own, all fettled, heated, the seams stuffed with paper &#x26;c; with intent to set myself steadfastly to work to consider what and how these Lectures of mine are to be. Jane and I have been sitting together all winter in the room we call <hi rend="italic">the Library</hi> up stairs, which is our warmest large room; but now by aid of paper-stuffing, as I say, and shutting of folding-doors, I have made myself a very snug place down here; and am to work, and to prosper if the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gea</hi></foreign> [vigor] of life be in me. Before beginning, however, I find it will be better to fling you off a short line, merely to assure you that we are well, and to ask how you are.</p>
<p>There has little in the shape of news come from the North country since I wrote last: Jean sent, thro&#x2019; me, a long Letter to the Doctor; which I read as it passed, and filled up some blank spaces in it: all was going on well at that time, as she very pointedly recorded; Austin looking after a farm; Alick ordering new goods from Dumfries, and so on: since that there has nothing reached me except the Newspaper weekly, which always carries its two strokes hitherto. Neither has anything come from Jack except Newspapers. One Newspaper arrived not long after I wrote, with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes on it; which I took as a clear <pb id="pg-10-27" n="10:27"/>token that the Revolution volumes and pamphlets, so long lingering on the way, had actually got to hand; a thing you may fancy I was very glad of: Jack, no doubt, will have read them by this time. A few days ago there was another Newspaper, which I forwarded to you, with the <hi rend="italic">stamp</hi> very visible upon it, for the benefit of Postmen. Jean&#x2019;s Letter had gone off, and in it I engaged the Doctor not to reply till he had a Letter from myself, which letter I would send him so soon as the Article <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott</hi> was fairly under way. Accordingly I have written at great length, some ten days ago or more, and the Article must be about over the Alps before now: we need not look for any answer however for some fortnight or three weeks yet. But just yesterday there came a new Roman Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">three strokes</hi>, to signify, as I conclude, that Jean&#x2019;s Letter had arrived at Rome; that the Doctor was well, waiting for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> letter, and would write forthwith when it came. So it is all right; and if I had news from Manchester and Annandale, I should be very fairly off on that side. I oblige myself to believe that you are not ill in any respect; there was a Manchester Newspaper lately to that effect; a sign also, as I suppose, that the <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> of an <hi rend="italic">article</hi> which I sent to you had arrived safe. Send another newspaper when you get this; with two strokes, if you can; I shall then keep myself as quiet as may be till Jenny and you muster another letter for me.&#x2014; Many times, my dear Mother, have I thought what was becoming of you in this stern weather. How you keep yourself in heat, or what way you turn yourself against the grim influences of the time! Have you a flannel dress-gown to wrap yourself in at night? Do you take warm bottles? Happily it is a country of cheap coal-fuel you are in, and a household of careful friends. Nothing like keeping oneself <hi rend="italic">warm</hi>, by whatever means! The skin all day in a shivery state deranges every function of the body, for they are all connected with the skin. There is no doubt, many thousands are miserably off at present, without fuel, without food. The &#x201C;poor gardeners all frozen out&#x201D; are bawling and begging under my window, few minutes ago, with a frozen cabbage on a pole: what they do in this five-weeks frost I know not, for I have seen them in former years begging on the first <hi rend="italic">day</hi> of a frost.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>8:271</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> They have no thrift or foresight; and so, eating all they earn, have nothing to eat when they earn nothing. There are charity-subscriptions &#x26;c; the best charity one can pray for is the return of thaw, and the possibility of working.</p>
<p>It cannot be said that we have any news here, of much moment. We live quite quietly among a small circle of people, who see us from time to time, not so often as usual in the bitter weather; I do not go out <pb id="pg-10-28" n="10:28"/>much to dinner or <foreign><hi rend="italic">soirees</hi></foreign> (evening-parties); Jane does not go out at all, not even in the day-time, and accordingly has grown very impatient for mild weather again. However, she takes really handsomely to her in-doors life; and has not been better, I think, these good many winters: she (and you and all weakly people) must be especially careful about this spring season, the most insidious and injurious of all. We are generally alone in the evenings, tranquil over our books and papers; what visitors and visiting we have are in the middle of the day.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1838-02-16">16 Feb.</date> the Carlyles had several visitors. On returning from a walk TC found that Thomas Spedding had called and &#x201C;Cavaignac with two bottles of champagne&#x2014;was come to dine with us! Smiles; from the teeth outwards: but the purpose was kind, was welcome. Dinner not yet served, arrives Mrs John Sterling with the children in a Neat-fly. Talkee-talkee; which our maid benevolently stopt by entering with the soup,&#x2014;&#x2018;like a bolt out of the blue.&#x2019; Dinner done, <foreign><hi rend="italic">tant bien que mal</hi></foreign> [on balance, quite well], and C. and I smoking up stairs, arrives to tea good Thomas Erskine the Christian-Evidence; Cavaignac and he to feed together like the lion and the lamb! It passed pacifically; E. went away before ten, C. not till after el<supplied>[e]</supplied>ven&#x201D; (Journal, <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb.</date>).</note> With my will I would go out nowhere to visit in the evening; it never fails to do me more or less harm: but here there is no other way of carrying on intercourse with several sorts of people whom one likes otherwise to see. My most remarkable evening-party for a great while was one lately at no smaller a personage&#x2019;s than&#x2014;who think you?&#x2014;the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2019;s!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Spring Rice (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), Whig politician; M.P. for Limerick <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>, for Cambridge <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; chancellor of the exchequer under Melbourne, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>; comptroller of exchequer and 1st Baron Monteagle, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.

They invited me a second time; but I was absent and did not go. The invitation being now on my table, I think I will send it you, as a strange thing enough. I could not help thinking, Here is the man that disposes annually of the whole revenue of England; and here is another man who has hardly enough of cash to buy potatoes and onions for himself: Fortune has for the time made these two tenants of one drawing-room. The case, I believe, is this: Miss Spring Rice,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Alicia Pery Spring Rice (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>), maid of honor to Victoria, m., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, James Garth Marshall (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), third son of John Marshall.</note> the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2019;s eldest daughter, a very beautiful and rather intelligent young woman, was one of my German hearers last year, and took a fancy for my notability; so her mother the Lady Theodosia<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Theodosia, b.

The people were very kind; Spring Rice himself a substantial goodhumoured <foreign>shifty</foreign>-looking man of fifty: the rooms were genial with heat, and light as the sun at noon; <pb id="pg-10-29" n="10:29"/>there were high dames and &#x201C;distinguished males,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;distinguished females&#x201D;; coterie speech.</note> simmering about like people in the press of a June-Fair: the whole thing went off very well; and I returned about one in the morning with a headache that served me for more than a day after. &#x201C;It will help your Lectures,&#x201D; Jane said. May be so; but in the meantime it has quite <hi rend="italic">hindered</hi> my natural sleep and composure.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;My notablest social performance or endurance, this winter &#x2026; a <foreign>soiree</foreign> of Spring Rice Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2019;s. &#x2026; &#x2018;Most happy to make <hi rend="italic">your</hi> acquaintance,&#x2019; and you possessor in the Earth of some four score pounds sterling,&#x2014;the sum-total that of your properties, prospects, and pecuniary kingdom under the sun! &#x2026; It was a brilliant-looking thing; all very polite; marchioness &#x26;c, &#x2018;with feelings exactly like ours&#x2019; (as my dear Mother said of the Foreign persons in <hi rend="italic">W.

<p>I was out at Windsor, some five and twenty miles off, from saturday to monday last. A certain young Irishman &#x26; scholar named Edgeworth<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380205-TC-JWI-01">TC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JWI</corr>, [ca. <date when="1838-02-05">5 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> (come of very notable people, and himself a worthy man) had taken it into his head, and has been insisting occasionally these two years, that I, reason or none, must absolutely come out and pay him a visit. I went, to be done with it. This is the first time I have breathed country air since I left you. We did very well; tho&#x2019; I objected greatly to the cold, Edgeworth&#x2019;s house being full of slides, folding-doors, fine-views, and blowing in every corner like a pair of <foreign>fanners</foreign> [winnowing machine]. I saw Windsor Forest, a great parish of beautiful waste land, with <hi rend="italic">brackeny</hi> dry knolls, with cottages, and innumerable oaks single or in clumps, some of them the oldest and largest trees I ever saw. One huge old monster, quite empty in the heart, I <hi rend="italic">fathomed;</hi> six fathoms, about six and thirty feet round! Windsor town is a place midway in size between Dumfries and Annan; a red-brick, clean-swept elevated tidy kind of place: on the highest point of the ground there is Windsor Castle <pb id="pg-10-30" n="10:30"/>or Palace; which also we saw, outside and inside; very beautiful indeed, and sufficient to lodge a much larger figure than poor little Queen Victory. The Kings hang there, the pictures of them, all in rows with their gauderies about them, poor old King William the last: like so many shadows of a Dream;&#x2014;each hovers there for a year or two, and then Eternity swallows him, and he lies as strait as old Wull Moor the Galloway <foreign>Hushel</foreign> [useless worker].<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> Enough of Windsor. I am now to get forward with my Lectures; and do not mean to stir out of this, till I have put them into some kind of figure. What they are to be? That is the question. Nothing appears to be settled but that they <hi rend="italic">are to be</hi>. I suppose the people are willing to hear what I have got to say on any subject that interests me; I must get a name for my story; and then open my lips and proceed to tell it.</p>
<p>But here surely, my dear Mother, is a Letter long enough for any purpose whatsoever. It is a full sheet, and written in a hand of unusual smallness, tho&#x2019; I had literally nothing of the slightest moment to say. When Jack&#x2019;s letter comes I will endeavour to write another word. Jenny and you must buckle yourselves together, the sooner the better, and tell me a long story. Let me hear, what of your departure? I think you should be in no haste for Annandale in this bitter weather. Jenny too can stand no hardship. I am easier about her since I know you are there for nurse.&#x2014; Jane, who has just been down stairs to see me, and is writing to her Mother, charges me to send you her kind love; her prayers, she calls it, for all and sundry in this frosty time. She says she will take cold soon, unless the weather soften: she had better not, I answer. Along with Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s letter goes one for James Aitken about the letting of that Craigenputtoch House. I hope M&#x2019;Queen will get it and the farm; at all events, I hope I shall hear no more tell of it for a while.</p>

<ps><p>As there is a Note of Miss Martineau&#x2019;s lying here,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. TC could not escape Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s kindness, as shown by his Journal, <date when="1838-02-19">19 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;At night [<date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb.</date>] Miss Martineau and Darwin,&#x2014;with four bottles of brandy, the result of the sale of some American Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckhs. The visit, as most of those from that too happy and too noisy distinguished-female, did nothing but make me miserable. She is a formulist, limited in the extreme, and for the present altogether triumphant in her limits: the all-conquering <hi rend="italic">smallness</hi> of the phenomenon, victorious mainly by its smallness; and which not only waves banners in its own triumph, but insists on your waving banners too, is at times nearly insupportable to me. She said among other things that Jesus Christ had lived, she thought, one of the most &#x2018;joyous&#x2019; lives. That she had <hi rend="italic">once</hi> met a man who seemed not to believe fully in immortality;&#x2014;the trivial-impious sayings of this extraordinary man were retailed to us at boundless length.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I was very sorry that I chanced to be out yesterday when you did me the kindness to call. I go out generally about two o&#x2019;clock, and am not sure of being discoverable till towards five again.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb.</date>, TC noted that &#x201C;Spedding (the elder, from Cumberland, a man whom I like) had called,&#x201D; and, <date when="1838-02-19">19 Feb.</date>, that Thomas and James called &#x201C;while tea went on,&#x201D; on the <date when="1838-02-18">18th</date>: &#x201C;Staid tell eleven o&#x2019;clock; very pleasant men, especially the elder, a Cumberland scholar and squire whom I hope to see in the North Country. Told me of Hartley Coleridge, whom they esteemed a man of real genius; of his falling out of one high possibility down thro&#x2019; another lower and then again lower till he had now become a poor denizen of taprooms in the village of Ambleside.&#x201D; For James Spedding (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:196</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>. The family home was at Mirehouse, between Skiddaw (to the E) and the lake of Bassenthwaite (to the W), where Thomas lived with his parents, John (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>) and Sarah (d. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note></p>
<p>Tomorrow night and Monday night and probably other nights, and certainly all mornings, I am at home. If your Brother and you were to arrive here about six, you would find us in the act of making tea, and agreeably enlivened at sight of you. I hope you do not yet for some time tend northward. Skiddaw, I read in our paper, is grim as Spitzbergen, and the Solway all tumbling with ice. One is better in Babylon, till the Sun vindicate his existence a little. Let me hope still to see you here, if you have nerve for such an expedition. As for me, if I ever cross the Cumberland Fell country again, I surely will not miss Bassenthwaite.</p>

<p>Thanks, dear Sir, for your present of <hi rend="italic">Delora</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A poem which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> (ed. Horne, <date when="1836-07-00">July 1836</date> to <date when="1837-06-00">June 1837</date>) n.s. 10:717&#x2013;32. A separate publication has not been traced. TC apparently praised the poem to Hunt; see Blainey 85.</note> which I am glad to possess in a separate revised shape. I well remember reading it in the <pb id="pg-10-33" n="10:33"/><hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> with attention and glad surprise; and saying to myself, Here is a man with hot fierce matter in him; may the gods grant him strength and patience to work it into pure metal, and cast it into a shape that shall be perennial!</p>
<p>I believe, those bitter experiences you allude to are more or less, especially in these times, the lot of all men whatsoever that have any true talent to get unfolded. They are hard to bear; but useful, nay perhaps merciful and indispensable. The <hi rend="italic">infernal</hi> pride that is in all of us needs to be tamed into a <hi rend="italic">celestial</hi>, into a silent, patient, blessed one,&#x2014;like what Christian people call humility, the beginning of all good, as I take it, in Art and elsewhere for us Sons of Adam. Let us consider it as schooling; let us learn our lesson! For a true man, to whom his talent <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the great and sacred object, not the mere reputation of his talent, there can ultimately be no evil in these things. For such a man, considering what Criticism is in our time, Criticism can perhaps do nothing so kind as <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>construe him, abuse him, neglect him. Let her treat him, in short, according to her own sweet will. For one such man whom she has succeeded in finally <hi rend="italic">suppressing</hi>, or even putting down under his due place, she has blown up hundreds into a windy triviality, pretension, futility, which one supposes to be the completest wretchedness appointed for man. Forward, therefore, and fear nothing! The ways will be smooth or be rough; but the step being stout the progress is not doubtful. A German friend of mine, whom I like much, has written down the following motto in rugged hexameters:</p>
<p>As journeys this Earth, her eye on a Sun, thro&#x2019; the heavenly spaces; And radiant in azure, or sunless swallowed in tempests, Falters not, alters not; journeying equal, sunlit or stormgirt: So thou Man of Earth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Johann Heinrich Voss, &#x201C;Die Weihe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Homers Werke</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>) 1:9, ll. 70&#x2013;74.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I heartily bid you good-speed; and, were it after never such toiling, a happy issue.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also Blainey 84&#x2013;87.</note></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgwood</salute>
<p>My Husband is gone to dine with your Husband, and &#x2018;Erasmus,&#x2019; at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably at the Caledonian Hotel, where Erskine was staying.</note>. Thence they proceed together to a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">flare up</hi>&#x2019; at Miss Martineaus; (which I wish success to with all my heart&#x2014;at lowest, that it may consume its own smoke!)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s description of the dinner and <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign>, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380308-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-03-08">8</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> And now while these our so-called Lords and Masters are following their pleasing without us; a pretty idea is come to me, that I all alone <hi rend="italic">here</hi> will have a little quiet talk with you all alone <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. For I feel a sympathetic assurance that you are alone at this moment even as I am&#x2014;your feet on the fender as mine are&#x2014;looking into the fire as I was doing until I began to write. And if any one says you are idly employed or that I was idly employed I declare the faultfinder to be entirely ignorant of what <hi rend="italic">looking into the</hi> fire means. For my part I find it the very hardest work I ever apply myself to: my eyes are no sooner fairly rivetted on the red embers, than I seem to be changed into the Dove of the Ark sent forth &#x2018;ere yet the waters were abated,&#x2019; to fly and flutter in all directions, finding no rest for the sole of its foot.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 8:8&#x2013;9.</note> For you, indeed, with your better and happier nature, the world can never, I should think, become as a watery waste&#x2014;there must always be some dry land&#x2014;some green sunshiney spot where you see little children playing among the flowers! but even you I am sure often feel fatigued, as with a long journey, after a long look into the fire: and the Baby&#x2019;s-cap which you might have made in the interim, or the volume of <hi rend="italic">Western Travel</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Retrospect of Western Travel</hi>, 3 vols. (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>).</note> you might have read would not have proved such full occupation. Dear Mrs Wedgwood when shall I see you again? I hope and pray that for once the battle may be for the strong, and the Secretaryship for the man that deserves it! And that we shall know you again in the place whence you can be so ill spared.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref>, for the Wedgwoods&#x2019; reasons for leaving London. In <date when="1838-02-00">early Feb.</date> Hensleigh had been in London &#x201C;trying to get a law to exempt scrupulous persons from judicial oaths&#x201D; (Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 3:219). Perhaps he was on the same errand, as well as looking for another appointment. He became the registrar of metropolitan carriages in <date when="1839-00-00">early 1839</date>.</note> A woman who, as my Husband might say is no <hi rend="italic">Chimera</hi>, no <hi rend="italic">Incarnated formula</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">Reality</hi>&#x2014;a <pb id="pg-10-35" n="10:35"/><hi rend="italic">genuine woman</hi> is so great a rarity with us in this <hi rend="italic">dishumanizing</hi> City: that such a one, when known of, should be sought after, and brought back, in spite of all obstacles; like the <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Statue for the vacant pedestal</hi>, in the Arabian Tale.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> If you were to be recovered, as the Statue was by slaughter of giants and wildbeasts, I should entertain high hopes at present: for <hi rend="italic">Cavaignac</hi> were the very man for such an exploit! and Mr Wedgwood has engaged him to visit you. They met here one evening and liked each other. The only happy combination that took place! The rest of the people were the most incompatible that I even, who am remarkable for making the worst assorted parties in Nature, could have brought together. Mr Darwin has often helped me at such a Deadlift, but that evening he seemed to have privately made up his mind, that he would not speak a word or move a muscle, except according to his own sweet will, tho&#x2019; it were to save us all from perdition! Indeed, it strikes me that he and the whole of us are &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">demoralizing</hi>&#x2019; since you went&#x2014;there are wars and rumours of wars, tempests in teapots, <hi rend="italic">flare-ups</hi>, rather of the tar-barrel sort. &#x201C;The thing which is to day is (<hi rend="italic">not</hi>) the same that was yesterday, nor will be tomorrow.&#x201D; We want <hi rend="italic">reality</hi>, stability, composure of soul&#x2014;above all it seems to me, we all of us want a sound sleep!</p>
<p>My Husband is to give new Lectures in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>, on the subject of National Literature. This time he positively set his face against &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">fire-eating</hi>&#x2019; in Willis&#x2019;s Rooms, amidst Harp-players and Dancing Masters and such like; whereupon Mr Darwin after much rumaging has found him a less <hi rend="italic">fashionable</hi> quarter (near Portman Square) where he expects to feel less like a Mountebank. Meanwhile his frequent prayer is &#x201C;O for a little impudence and good health&#x201D;! but as for the first <foreign><hi rend="italic">non omnia possunt omnes</hi></foreign> [everyone cannot do everything]! He can do much, but he cannot be <hi rend="italic">impudent</hi> for the life of him: and a vehement longing for <hi rend="italic">good health</hi> is apt to defeat its object.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott lectures in Exeter Rooms and Darwin goes to hear him!!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> Such changes doth fleeting time procure! Time and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Rich.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Rich (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), Fanny&#x2019;s eldest half-sister, da. of Sir James Mackintosh and his first wife, Catherine Stuart (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>).

She had returned to live in London when widowed, and now lived nr. the Scotts at Woolwich. She was a devotee of Scott and Thomas Erskine. Fanny&#x2019;s husband Hensleigh and Erasmus Darwin were cousins.</note></p>
<p>I have been interrupted so often in writing this letter that I have lost all heart in making it longer. I am plainly writing with adverse Fates, and if I insist on going on shall probably spill <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the ink (as I <pb id="pg-10-36" n="10:36"/>have already done part) over my paper, or in some other way render it quite useless&#x2014; <closer><salute>So good night and God bless you!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> in answer to my last was as welcome as good news could be. I am much obliged to you for taking such pains; your stiff determined-looking lines have always a right honest meaning in them; they come from the heart, and go to the heart. You must thank Jenny too; if it were not that you are with her, she would deserve a Letter to herself in reply, and should have it.</p>
<p>Here is Spring come at last; something like ordinary March weather, which one is heartily thankful to see after the storming we have had. You will be thinking about Annandale now; but I advise you to be in no violent haste for a week or two: there are surly days yet before the fine days can be expected to come; and paved streets in the coal country are as good as Middlebie in the East winds. I suppose James Aitken has been with you, and is gone again? He would report progress out of the Scotch circle. I have heard no direct news since you wrote: I sent a Letter to Alick; he returned a Newspaper with strokes, from which I can infer that nothing is far amiss, and that is all.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s Roman Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-02-18">18 Feb.</date></note> which I was partly looking for that very morning, arrived on Monday last. I despatch it to you with a word or two of my own today; having just time enough for such a thing. I must postpone writing to Jack himself till tomorrow. The money he speaks of I think I will bid James Aitken take charge of:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;Lady Clare wrote to her Bankers (Stone &#x26; Martin) about ten days ago, directing them amongst other things to put &#xa3;150 at your disposal. If you have not enough of money in hand for the present, take any part of it that you may find necessary, and desire the Bankers to forward the rest to Dumfries Commercial Bank as before.&#x201D;</note> you are not on the spot, but James will act in your name. I have not yet been at the Banker&#x2019;s to get it; he holds out some five miles from this: but I mean to go today or tomorrow; and have no doubt I shall find it all right there.</p>
<p>You will see farther, with gladness, that Jack purposes being home <pb id="pg-10-37" n="10:37"/>soon; in the month of <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>, he says. That is the best news. The rest goes all as it used to do: his Lady&#x2019;s Lady-friend has got thro&#x2019; a <hi rend="italic">confinement</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Th&#xE9;r&#xE8;se von Spaur, b. Giraud (d. <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>), had been m. to Edward Dodwell (<date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), archaeologist. In <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> she m. Count Karl von Spaur (ca. <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), Bavarian minister at the Vatican. During the <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> revolution they helped Pius IX escape to Naples. They had two sons, one of whom had been b. on <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb.</date></note> it seems: all is still and dull at Rome, where there is nothing now to keep them, except fit weather for crossing of the Alps. We shall hope to see poor Jack again in not many weeks; and ascertain better then how it is with him.&#x2014; Great part of his Letter is occupied criticising our immortal <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written: &#x201C;The outward form of the work has gained very greatly by those subdivisions, omissions &#x26; corrections; and as for the spirit of it I think that must please every serious honest man. The book bears more reading than any I have seen for a long while. The first volume gives me a sense of obstruction; the fragments of the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> &#x26; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> look freer and more natural. The whole gains upon me the more I come to know of it; and I can appreciate it better now than last year having read a great deal more on the subject. That clashing, skirmishing and deadly battling of formulas and shams in high places with stern realities &#x26; chaos comes forth here and there most artistically; one does actually <hi rend="italic">see</hi> something of the Revolution, and can therefore turn back to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> again and again with considerable satisfaction increasing each time. The book is like good substantial, natural food, here and there a little tough and homely it is true, but thoroughly done and such as a healthy stomach is pleased with and can turn to nourishment&#x2014;no whipped painted froth that melts away to nothing in the mouth, and leaves you hungrier than before, if it does not give you a permanent indigestion. One would think the &#x2018;pudding stomach of Old England&#x2019; might make something of such a dish. She has been sadly reduced by spare diet of late, and a little training with such food <foreign><hi rend="italic">au naturel</hi></foreign> would do her more good than all the quack remedies in the world&#x2014;only the froth and spoon meat are so much more easily eaten.&#x201D;</note> and, alas, only the first volume of it, for the second Parcel containing the last two volumes is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> arrived yet, but must be hovering about, somewhere or other, as it has done near a twelvemonth now! Jack had read that first volume already in Manuscript, and with endless contradiction; he will have to execute an amazing deal of talk yet before he get himself reconciled to the thing. It is his way in these cases. I wish he were but <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, to begin it!</p>
<p>Jane continues very tolerably well; has had no cough; and begins to venture out a little now. My own health is not to complain of at all: I still study above everything to keep myself <hi rend="italic">quiet;</hi> not to get into a fret and a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fuff</hi></foreign>, and &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dad tysel&#x2019; a&#x2019; abreed</hi></foreign> [shake yourself to pieces]&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380330-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-03-30">30 March</date></ref>.</note> on any account whatsoever. There is no use in it, there is nothing in the wor<supplied>[l]</supplied>d worth it. I have made decided progress in that since last year. That perhaps is the chief of all the advantages I have got from that Book of mine. It is a great blessing.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Now, however, the Lecturing <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming on; I fancy it is as good as settled that I am to start <pb id="pg-10-38" n="10:38"/>and try myself again! We got a Room, or the offer of one which is like to be accepted, last night; and my first work today, on going out, is to see about. It is a far better room than last year&#x2019;s, an unexceptionable room, all seated for the purpose, quiet, and lighted from the roof: the only drawback is its distance, 3 miles from me, and rather out of the beat too of our <hi rend="italic">fashionable</hi> patrons; but on the whole there is no other at all suitable that can be got.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At 17 Edward St., Portman Sq.</note> I am to give 12 Lectures this year, and charge 2 guineas; if I have a good audience, it will mount up fast: one cannot say as to that; we must just try. The subject is to be &#x201C;On the History of Literature&#x201D;: I shall have to speak about Greeks and Romans first, then about other Nations; in short about the most remarkable Books and Persons and Opinions of all the Peoples that I know. There are to be three Lectures weekly (we think), the first on the <date when="1838-05-01">first day of May</date>.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, <date when="1838-04-30">Monday, 30 April</date>.</note> So you know <hi rend="italic">when</hi>. I am likely to be very busy getting all in readiness; Jane has gone down stairs (as I think I told you last time), and left me here with the Books and Library to myself.&#x2014; I have a notion, were the time come near, to get myself a horse, and ride about, tho&#x2019; it is a terrible dearth in this place; nothing can be more important for me than to be as <hi rend="italic">well</hi> as I can in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>. Wherefore again wish me good-speed, dear Mother; and do not fear but I shall, on the whole, get thro&#x2019; it not unhandsomely. I have many a good friend here, I do believe; the proportion of scoundrels in London is great; but likewise there is a proportion of better people here than you can easily find elsewhere in the whole world. Let us only keep our hearts <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, as I say; let us give no ear to vain-glory, to <hi rend="italic">self-conceit</hi>, the wretchedest of things; the Devil&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> work I think here below!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I yesterday dined with a Mr Erskine, a very notable man among the religious people of Scotland, who seems to have taken a considerable fancy for me.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> He is one of the best persons I have met with for many a long year. We were very cheerful; a small quiet party, and had blithe serious talk.

<p>I must now end, dear Mother. I am still forcing myself to think that you hold out tolerably well.

Robert must stand by the shop himself; which I hope is rewarding his care of it. A great blessing it is that you all keep your health. Jane sends her kindest wishes and regards.

We have again got frost; sharp biting northerly air; delicate people must keep within doors.</p>
<p>I have just finished a long Letter to Jack, which will set off tonight, as this will; his southward, yours northward: the next we get from him, I hope, will say that he is getting upon the road. I went to the Bank yesterday; and got the &#xa3;150 he speaks about; I sent it on to Dumfries, and bade James Aitken insert it in the Bank accounts there, in your name, as the other money was. I have to write to James about it this day still, before going out; in a frank for Mrs Welsh: the getting of the two franks at once, that was the reason why yours did not go yesterday by itself.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, [<date when="1838-03-08">8?

Darley told me, &#x2018;There was Colburn the Puff Publisher,&#x2019; but the creature was gone by before I saw him.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It was on Monday last that your Letter came;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-02-18">18 Feb.</date></note> they usually come on Mondays: it is now Friday morning when I sit in the Library up stairs, equipt for writing to you in answer; I could not get ready sooner. Your Letter, owing to the longer delay, was looked for with unusual appetite; we were not strictly speaking apprehensive of any thing, for the <hi rend="italic">Diarios</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Roman newspapers sent by John.</note> had given us repeated good indication: but I had made up my mind that there was a Letter to come that day; and accordingly it did come, and all was right once more in that quarter. I have written to our Mother (still at Manchester), and will despatch your Letter along with that to her today. I went yesterday to Stone and Martin&#x2019;s; found the &#xa3;150 ready; carried it over to Jones&#x2019;s in Threadneedle street,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wm. Jones, 36 Threadneedle St.</note> and had it there sent under way for Dumfries to the charge of James Aitken, to be placed by him as the former sums were; to whom I must this day also write a little Note of Instruction, to go along with a Letter to Mrs Welsh: this winds up the matter on my side too. You get the Newspaper simultaneously with this: may they find you still well, and give you a happy morning of it!</p>
<p>There has been a Letter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> from my Mother and Jenny since you last heard: they were well in spite of the bitter weather; close nestled by the fireside, and not thinking to stir for Annandale till the days softened a little. Jenny is to accompany our Mother over, and stay with her a short while. Our good Mother writes in the same simple intelligent affectionate style as ever: her rude-drawn lines and words are very affecting to me. There has been no direct word from Scotland since Jean&#x2019;s Letter which you have. I wrote to Alick twice at intervals, he sent me a Newspaper lately. I wrote also to Jean or her husband, about the letting of that house at Craigenputtoch, if there were any prospect of letting it along with the Farm which you may have seen <pb id="pg-10-41" n="10:41"/>advertised in the late <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi>. It is to be inferred that all continues on the old footing among our Kinsfolk. I have not been able to ascertain whether Mary and her James have any or what outlook of a Farm; not tho&#x2019; I have mentioned it in almost every Letter: Jenny indeed speaks of Stennybeck, and how the elder Hanning<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hanning; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370718-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>9:254</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1837-07-18">18 July 1837</date></corr></ref>. Alick finally replied on <date when="1838-04-15">15 April</date>: &#x201C;Hanning&#x2019;s talk about Stonybeck is in nowise worth heading [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. It is a tale of four or five years standing.&#x201D;</note> who had been at Manchester had said that there would likely soon be a vacancy there, and that Austin might then have a good chance. With the loan you offer,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said: &#x201C;If &#xa3;50 could help them you might lend them as much in my name.&#x201D;</note> and a similar sort of offer from myself (of money that Scotsbrig Jamie has of mine) they might manage to get into it, or into something, and do well in it: I should be heartily glad of it, and have good hopes of them, industrious frugal and cheerful as they are. No other news out of Annandale whatever: the winter there and everywhere has been inclement, stern and long-continued; but now we seem to be getting into Spring, tho&#x2019; indeed still not without returns of frost,&#x2014;e.g. today.</p>
<p>No Packet was ever unluckier than that of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>. So it seems you have only the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> volume yet, the other two lingering no man knows where! I wish you could have read and digested them before you got home; you will probably have some kicking against the pricks<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 9:5.</note> to go thro&#x2019; before you can reconcile yourself; yet reconcilement is probable at last. The third volume is generally the favourite: I clearly think either of the two much less unhappy than the first. They are past and gone; that is the beauty of them. No book or thing, I hope, shall ever more throw me into such a ferment;&#x2014;from the miseries of which I still, like one tempest-tossed and shipwrecked, am slowly recovering. Cavaignac sent off his <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> sheets, by a sure hand to Paris, who was to forward them free of expence to Rome, by &#x201C;a Merchant&#x201D; who sends a Package thither every week. Had we known of that Merchant sooner! The Article <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> seems to meet general approbration [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; I cannot say I ever felt more entirely indifferent as to the fate of any production whatsoever. I have got &#xa3;45 for it; no other real benefit or injury at all. It ought to be in your hands before this. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> what a despicability is Literature altogether! I confess, many times when I see &#x201C;distinguished females&#x201D; and such like, it appears to me deepest obscurity were better; breaking of whinstone roadstuff at 15 pence the cubic yard a more blessed trade! &#x201C;Be still therefore,&#x201D; I say to myself, &#x201C;close thy lips and wait and look.&#x201D;&#x2014; As to the Article-printing <pb id="pg-10-42" n="10:42"/>with Fraser, I imagine with you that I have probably done wrong:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not clear; John had said: &#x201C;I am not without hopes that you may still arrange with Fraser about reprinting the Articles.&#x201D;</note> I followed other judgement than my own; then Fraser fell sick; at any rate I am in such a weak mood that I abhor bargain-making, am fit for no transaction with a greedy mortal about money. It is very weak; but it is true, and cannot for the time be helped. As for Fraser he seems to be clearly getting better again; by and by we shall likely resume the subject; and either with him, or with some other, the Article Collection will be got out. I confess I want it done; I want to have the whole trash once fairly off my hand; that I might betake me to fresh fields;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Lycidas&#x201D; 193.</note> that I might consider then what quite new thing I would try writing, or whether anything more at all in the world. The edition of the F. R. as I conjecture must be nearly done, and there will probably be another; by [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] my soul (poor soul!) shrinks from speech of such a thing with Fraser. <hi rend="italic">Quiet disgust</hi>, that is the usual, least unsatisfactory mood I am in about such things. The heart of man that has not tried it cannot conceive what a business all that is. Yet, blessed be God, there is a kind of light-gleam in the innerman of one; which whoso will quietly, humbly, silently follow, it shall be well with him. &#x201C;Silently&#x201D; above all;&#x2014;why therefore do I now speak? In a word, O brother Jack, I do endeavour to thank Heaven for much mercy to me on this side also; yes, these long years of martyrdom, and misery which I would not suffer again to buy the world, were not utterly in vain; there is hope also, sure hope, that the worst of them are over. My mood of mind at present is not nearly so wretched: I am <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>, very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> and sad, but entirely peaceable, and such sadness seems almost as good as joy. My heart&#x2019;s prayer is, Deliver me, ye Supreme Powers, from Self-conceit, ah do,&#x2014;and then what else is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> will!</p>
<p>That is a beautiful project of meeting you at Paris; but alas, my dear Boy, it is impossible. Know in one word: I shall be lecturing, like a lion, at that very date of time! It is all settled now: there is to be a course of Lectures, 12 in number, to begin with the <date when="1838-05-01">first of May</date>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, <date when="1838-04-30">30 April</date>.</note> and go on three a week. Wilson and Darwin are busy: yesterday, no farther back, the room was secured; a regular Lecture-room this time; all seated, covered with faded red baize; a decent-enough place, in Edward street Portman Square, where some &#x201C;Mary-le-bonne Institution&#x201D; or other has its sessions: they have given it to us for the 12 times for 20 guineas. It will hold conveniently from 400 downwards; 150 <pb id="pg-10-43" n="10:43"/>will not look miserable in it, for it is of amphitheatral shape. Our hour as before is from 3 to 4. Pity me on the <date when="1838-05-01">first of May!</date> And the subject? Aye, the subject, for which we must contrive some <hi rend="italic">fit</hi> name (Henry Taylor giving counsel in that), is called as yet &#x201C;On the History of Literature&#x201D;; it means, The most remarkable Books, Persons, Opinions of our Western world, from the time of Homer downwards, so far as a poor ignorant man can endeavour to get up some sincere utterances about them in Twelve most limited Discourses. The Greeks, the Romans, the Crusades, Dante &#x26; Italians, the Spanish and Cervan<supplied>[tes,]</supplied> then Luther, Voltaire &#x26;c perhaps to Shakspear and Samuel Johnson. I tremble to think of it; yet endeavour not to tremble. I shall be in better plight this year; I think also of getting a Horse to ride about on from the middle of <date when="1838-04-00">April</date>; if I had my measure of health and pluck I could do very well. Happily we are out of Willis&#x2019;s Rooms<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370217-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:146</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-02-17">17 Feb. 1837</date></corr></ref>. For JWC&#x2019;s description of Willis&#x2019;s Rooms, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380307-JWC-FW-01">JWC to FW, [<date when="1838-03-07">7 March</date></ref>].</note> and his dancers and brass-bands, this year; they think some of the fashionables will be deterred by our ultra mundane position (in Portman Square district); but, in that case, we shall be as well without <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, I think. No fewer than four Principalities, last year, came and heard me, and did not to this hour pay the fee! We are to charge <hi rend="italic">two</hi> guineas this year; I cannot conjecture what audience there will be: we must try. Perhaps some &#xa3;200 may be made of it, or so; there is as to money no other resource very visible for me here. Try it therefore in Heaven&#x2019;s name!&#x2014; So you see, Doctor, you may probably get in before the death, if your Lady keeps her purpose, and hear a Lecture or two. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi>, O then, right merry shall we hope to be, with the brave Summer lying all manageable and free before us! I must work like a Turk however till the time come; I have nothing else to think of till then. Courage! <foreign>Esperance!</foreign> And now enough of this subject, which you will put together into &#x201C;harmonious composure&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> by your own quiet reflexion, more quiet than mine is at present. I wish I had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> sheets!</p>
<p>We are pretty well in health; Jane never coughing yet, beginning now to venture out when the day is favourable. She seems to me better than she has been for several winters. I go little out at night, when I can help it: all dinners, all <foreign>soirees</foreign> are a <foreign>malison</foreign> to me. I was at Spring Rice&#x2019;s once, Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2019;s!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380215-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-02-15">15 Feb.</date></ref></note> His sons and daughters were hearers of mine. They asked me a second time to their &#x201C;at Home&#x201D;; I was absent (out at Windsor for a day with poor <pb id="pg-10-44" n="10:44"/>Edgeworth who had still persisted in that strange pursuit of his that I should &#x201C;come and stay with him&#x201D;),<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380205-TC-JWI-01">TC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JWI</corr>, [ca. <date when="1838-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref>].</note> I did not go to the the second &#x201C;at Home&#x201D;; and now, as I learn, there is some <hi rend="italic">hitch</hi> in the business, owing to misconstruction of my absence, or I know not what: small matter; for my poor head and nerves did not recover the last entertertainment [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for eight-and-forty after. I dined very lately with one Erskine (of the &#x201C;Evidences of the Christian Religion&#x201D;), a mild benevolent man of fifty, one of the best of men. I seem to be getting among the Saints so-called; the better of them love me much. Woolwich Scott was of our party, a respectable character: he is delivering a <foreign>gratis</foreign> course of Lectures at Exeter Hall &#x201C;On God&#x2019;s methods of revealing himself,&#x201D; even now; very fluent, very honest-looking, to me not instructive.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Yet perhaps welcome to TC as arguing that the aim of the entire universe is to reveal God and that the Bible is but one form of revelation. Pbd. as an introductory essay to Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Epistle to the Romans</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>). Exeter Hall, 372, the Strand, founded in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>.</note> I went to the first, partly on compulsion; once or so I shall have to go again. Erskine is to be here, with Dunn<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev.

For the rest, what party is <hi rend="italic">so good</hi> as reading Thucydides, Dante or Johannes von M&#xfc;ller?<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380100-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [late <date when="1838-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2014;<date when="1838-03-00">early March</date>]</ref>.</note> A mixture of both is needful, but the solitary evenings are the best.

Of Mill I see almost nothing: he and his Review are taking a course apart from mine; not a prosperous one, as I predict: <hi rend="italic">they</hi> must forward, as I must. William Fraser has never played <hi rend="italic">pip</hi> since I saw him in Autumn, nor do I hear any whisper of him: I conclude with real pity that matters go crossly with him: his wife seemed entirely a fool, of good purpose; poor fellow! Allan Cunningham was here on Sunday last; large and bald. I have not a square-inch more, dear Jack but must say Farewell, all but the margins.</p>
<p>The sum of the matter therefore is, Come home safe, and with all the despatch possible. What is to be done then, we will decide, or speculate upon at boundless lengths. My Lectures will have proved themselves; I too shall then be clearer. I often think I could then wish much to get out of this Town, out of this country for a while; but I am rather driven to that than led to it: I submit to what the arrangement <pb id="pg-10-45" n="10:45"/>may most reasonably be. One does not know at all what will be best for him, except at most for the immediate future. Get ready therefore, O Jack; and come back with our blessing. How welcome will you be to our Mother, to us all! One has that possession on the Earth; and is that a small one?&#x2014; I had a letter the other day from Mrs E.

<p>Your Letter thro&#x2019; Sumner was sent by him from Paris about a month ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380215-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-02-15">15 Feb.</date></ref></note> the man himself has not yet made his appearance, or been heard of in these parts: he shall be very welcome to me, arrive when he will. The <date when="1838-02-00">February</date> Letter came yesterday, by direct conveyance from Dartmouth. I answer it today rather than tomorrow; I may not for long have a day freer than this. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fronte capillata, post est occasio calva</hi></foreign> [Although chance has hair at the front, she is bald behind]:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cato, <hi rend="italic">Disticha de Moribus</hi> 2:26.</note> True either in Latin or in English!</p>
<p>You send me good news, as usual. You have been very brisk and helpful in this business of the <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> Book, and I give you many thanks and commendations.

Blessings on you my brother: nay your work is always twice blessed.&#x2014; I believe after all, with the aid of my Scotch thrift, I shall not be absolutely thrown into the streets here; or reduced to borrow, and become the slave of somebody, for a morsel of bread. Thank God, no! Nay of late I begin entirely to despise that whole matter, so as I never hitherto despised it: &#x201C;Thou beggarliest Spectre of Beggary that hast chaced [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] me ever since I was man, come on then, in the Devil&#x2019;s name, let us see what is in thee! Will the Soul of a Man, with Eternity within a few years of it, quail before <hi rend="italic">thee?</hi>&#x201D; Better, however, is my good pious <pb id="pg-10-50" n="10:50"/>Mother&#x2019;s version of it, &#x201C;They cannot take God&#x2019;s Providence from thee; thou hast never wanted yet.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:79</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>But to go on with business; and the republication of books in that Transoceanic England, New and improved Edition of England. In <date when="1838-01-00">January</date> last, if I recollect right, Miss Martineau in the name of a certain Mr Loring<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> applied to me for a correct List of all my fugitive Papers; the said Mr Loring meaning to publish them for my behoof. This List she, not without solicitation, for I had small hope in it, did at last obtain, and send, coupled with a request from me that you should be consulted in the matter. Now it appears you had of yourself previously determined on something of the same sort, and probably are far on with the printing of your Two <hi rend="italic">Select</hi> Volumes. I confess myself greatly better pleased with it on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> footing than on another. Who Mr Loring may be I know not with any certainty at first hand; but who Waldo Emerson is I do know; and more than one god from the machine is not necessary. I pray you, thank Mr Loring for his goodness towards me (his intents are evidently charitable and not wicked); but consider yourself as in nowise bound at all by that blotted Paper he has; but do the best you can for me, consulting with him or not taking any counsel just as you see to be fittest on the spot. And so Heaven prosper you, both in your &#x201C;aroused Yankee&#x201D; state, and in all others;&#x2014;and let us for the present consider that we have enough about Books and Guineas. I must add however that Fraser and I have yet made no bargain. We found, on computing, that these would be five good Volumes, including <hi rend="italic">Teufelk</hi>; for an edition of 750 I demanded &#xa3;50 a volume, and Fraser refused: the poor man then fell dangerously ill, and there could not be a word farther said on the subject; till very lately, when it again became possible, but has not yet been put in practice. All the world cries out, why <hi rend="italic">do you</hi> publish with Fraser? &#x201C;Because my soul is sick of Booksellers, and of trade, and deception, and &#x2018;need and greed&#x2019; altogether; and this poor Fraser, not worse than the rest of them, has in some sort grown less hideous to me by custom.&#x201D; I fancy however, either Fraser will publish these things before long; or some Samaritan here will take me to some bolder brother of the trade that will.

The fire that is in one&#x2019;s own stomach is enough, without foreign bellows to blow it ever and anon. My whole heart shudders at the thrice-wretched self-combustion into which I see all manner of poor paper-lanterns go up, the wind of &#x201C;popularity&#x201D; puffing at them, and nothing left ere long but ashes and sooty wreck. It is sad, most sad. I shun all such persons and circles, as much as possible; and pray the gods to make me a bricklayer&#x2019;s hodbearer rather. O the &#x201C;cabriolets, neat-flies,&#x201D; and blue twaddlers of both sexes therein, that drive many a poor Mrs Rigmarole to the Devil!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the opening paragraph of &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:22.</note>&#x2014; As for me, I continue doing as nearly nothing as I can manage. I decline all invitations of society that are declinable: a London rout is one of the maddest things under the moon; a London dinner makes me sicker for a week, and I say often, It is better to be even dull than to be witty, better to be silent than to speak.</p>
<p>Curious: your Course of Lectures &#x201C;on Human Culture&#x201D; seems to <pb id="pg-10-52" n="10:52"/>be on the very subject I am to discourse upon here in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date> coming; but I am to call it &#x201C;On the History of Literature,&#x201D; and <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> it, not write it.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1838-02-09">9 Feb.</date> Emerson had written of having just finished a ten-week lecture-course &#x201C;which I ambitiously baptised &#x2018;Human Culture&#x2019; &#x26; read once a week to the curious in Boston.

Then again I think it is perhaps better so; who knows? At all events we will try what is in this Lecturing in London. If something, well; if nothing, why also well. But I do want to get out of these coils for a time. My Brother is to be home again in <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>; if he go back to Italy, if our Lecturing proved productive, why might we not all set off thitherward for the winter coming? There is a dream to that effect.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have next to nothing or altogether nothing to say this morning, yet I think I had better <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing on a sheet of paper and send it you: there is little doubt but it will be welcome. I am getting again into great darkness as to what is passing in Annandale; and fear nobody will write till I have written anew. Indeed I yet hardly understand, and that only by inference, whether you are in Annandale or Lancashire; an old newspaper from Hanning with three strokes on it made me judge that you had gone homewards, and I have sent two Newspapers directed thither; the Dumfries Courier of last week did not arrive moreover till Monday, but all well <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, and so I concluded farther that perhaps James and Jean had been over at Scotsbrig welcoming you,&#x2014;it was the best conclusion I could form about it! But I want of course to know accurately in distinct black-on-white. The weather all winter has been wild and bitter; I would fain know that you are safe thro&#x2019; it, and what you are all aiming at and occupied with.</p>
<p>As for me, I have but one interest in the wind at present; that of my Lectures<supplied>[.]</supplied> It is like the harvest of the whole year. I am not quite in such a dreadful fry about it as I was in, about this time twelvemonth; but it is again agitating enough; and I think often that if I had any money to live upon there is no power in the world that would tempt me to such circumstances. Perhaps it is so ordered that I have no money in order to <hi rend="italic">oblige</hi> me to open my jaw! I cannot say; I can say only that I had infinitely rather continue keeping it <hi rend="italic">shut</hi>. But, on the whole, they have got me a lecture-room, and I have drawn up the scheme of my twelve Lectures, which is to be printed next week; and from the <date when="1838-04-30">last day of April</date> (that is, monday come four weeks!) till near the middle of <date when="1838-06-00">June</date>, I shall be wriggling and struggling: ah me! There are to be but two Lectures a week; this will spread it over six weeks instead of four: it seems there would not be a fair chance of attendance otherwise. The subject is about all things in the world, the whole spiritual history of man from the earliest times till now; among my audience I am likely to have some of the cleverest people in this country; and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to speak to them! As I said, it were very greatly pleasanter for me to entirely hold my tongue. Nevertheless, we will fight thro&#x2019; it, one way or another, the very pain of it, and miserable trembling <pb id="pg-10-54" n="10:54"/>connected with it, is a kind of schooling for one. &#x201C;Thou must not <foreign>tine</foreign> [lose] heart,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:195</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> thou must gird thyself into forced composure; thou must strive to possess thy soul in patience, and await what will betide!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is the season, this and onwards till midsummer, when London is throngest with people; with meetings and speeches, with dinners, parties, balls and doings. I know not what I should do if I were to become an established <hi rend="italic">Popular;</hi> with the popularity I have, it is almost like to be too hard for me at times. Nothing <supplied>[in]</supplied> nature seems to me more entirely wretched and barren than the life of people, literary and other, that give themselves up to that sort of matter here. I firmly believe it to be the darkest curse God lays upon a man or woman. Carrying the beggar&#x2019;s wallet I take to be bad, but far from <hi rend="italic">so</hi> bad. The very look of the face of one of these people seems to say: Avoid me, if thou be wise!&#x2014; You judge from all this that I am resolutely anxious to keep myself quiet; that I go out oftener than I want, but as seldom as is possible for me; and on the whole am reading books and making notes for my Lectures, and holding on my way as composedly as may be. &#x201C;<foreign>Dinna gang to dad tysel&#x2019; a&#x2019; abreed</foreign>,&#x201D; said Lizzy Herd to Wull once; and I many a time remember the precept here.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. For Wull Brown, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340828-TC-AC-01"><sic>7:279</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1834-08-28">28 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> To be <foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded a&#x2019; abreed</hi></foreign> [shaken to pieces] is precisely the thing I want above all to avoid.&#x2014; As for the people I see, they are such as seem to have some likelihood of benefitting me; they would be long to mention. The best class of all whom I have seen this year are the class of religious people; certain of whom very strangely have taken a kind of affection for me, in spite of my contradictions towards them! It teaches me again that the best of this class is the best one will find in any class whatsoever. The radical members, and ambitious vain political people, and literary people, and fashionable people are to be avoided in comparison. One of the best men I have seen for many a year is one Thomas Erskine a Scotch Gentleman of great fortune and celebrated in the religious world; the title of his last book is &#x201C;on regeneration&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Erskine&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of Election, and its connection with the General Tenor of Christianity</hi> (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note> most strange it is how such a man has taken to me. Nay he has been heard to say that &#x201C;very few of them are at bottom so orthodox as Carlyle.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine had written to his sister, David Paterson (who had been given her father&#x2019;s Christian name), on <date when="1838-02-06">6 Feb.</date> about &#x201C;some of&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;deep elements of political science, which in his hands is one with religious obligation&#x201D; (Hanna 1:301).</note> What think you of that? Jane has a copy of Erskine&#x2019;s book; <pb id="pg-10-55" n="10:55"/>and will send it to you, I think. He is to come here this evening, and take leave of us, being bound for the Continent.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine left for Paris in <date when="1838-04-00">April</date>. In <date when="1838-09-00">Sept.</date> he went to Switzerland, made a tour of the Bernese Alps with Alexander Scott, and stayed in Geneva until summer <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.</note> He says he could not live in London, the sight of it would break his heart.&#x2014; I tell you nothing about the things they continue to tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about my Book:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The French Revolution.</hi></note> it is a deep question with me whether all such tellings and praisings are not rather a misfortune, calculated to drive one still farther from the one blessing of life, humble peace of mind. When grand people and beautiful people pay me grand beautiful compliments, and I grope in my pocket and find that I have so few pounds sterling there to meet my poor wants with, I cannot but say with Sandy Corry, <hi rend="italic">What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310500-TC-WG-01"><sic>5:268</sic>TC to WG, <date when="1831-05-01">1 May 1831</date></ref>.</note> Or with the Cow in the fable: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gie me a pickle pease strae!</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:269</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref></note>&#x2014; I send you the last American Letter, however, to shew you how they are going on there; and that I have even a prospect of getting money out of Yankee land. The reprint of the F. R. is to yield so many dollars (something beyond &#xa3;150), my friend Emerson says;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380410-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-04-10">10 April</date></ref>.</note> and then the reprinted Articles, &#x26;c &#x26;c. We shall see. And now enough of all that matter.</p>
<p>Jack, we hope, must be bestirring himself soon at Rome, in the way of getting homewards! I wish he were here again, poor Doil; I shall have much to tell him, and ask of him; many things to take counsel about. I had a Newspaper from him, since the Letter came; I think I sent it forward to some of you. It is almost certain, Jack will be for Scotland without much delay here; whether I can think of accompanying him is a thing all in the wind yet. In case he go back to Italy for next winter, we sometimes speak about going with him thither: but nothing can yet be settled; it depends on Lectures &#x26;c. One thing only is pretty clear to me, that I will get out of this London a while if I can. The stir of it frets me over much: I have the deepest appetite for repose; one all-surpassing wish, <hi rend="italic">to be well let alone</hi>. This should seem a thing not unattainable; and yet it is a thing difficult of attainment.&#x2014; Jeffrey is here from Edinburgh; fiddling about, as usual, and seems brisk enough: &#x201C;he can neither do thee ill na&#x2019;> good.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had some correspondence of Notes from Mrs Edward Irving, the other week: she wanted introductions to Germany for &#x201C;a dear friend of her late husband&#x2019;s&#x201D;; which I cheerfully gave. This dear friend, a very <pb id="pg-10-56" n="10:56"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [insipid]-looking man, meant, as I learned afterwards, to go and <hi rend="italic">convert</hi> the Germans to the gift of tongues, he himself in the meanwhile not knowing a syllable of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> tongue!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Woodhouse; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note> It seems a hopeful enterprise.

<p>But now I really must terminate. If Jenny is with you, let her sit down forthwith to a long blank sheet of paper, and consider what need I have of tidings! I know nothing, and want to know everything. The Newspaper from Dumfries instructed me by symbol that James had managed the Doctor&#x2019;s &#xa3;150, and got it put into the Bank safe on the same terms as the others, with the interest for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (if you would take it): this is all I have learned from that quarter. Alick for long has been entirely mute. I can only hope he is struggling on with some kind of tolerable outlook; if my wishes could avail anything, he were not struggling but triumphing; nevertheless it is perhaps better as we see it. Tell him to struggle on like a man, with courage, with patience; the proud temper that is in us needs to be tamed. It is verily so. Ah me, the Devil is too busy: he needs to <supplied>[be]</supplied> beaten out of every son of Adam with many stripes. As the good Erskine said the other night, &#x201C;A man that is unhappy is to be pitied; yet perhaps a man that is not unhappy is to be still more pitied!&#x201D; We all laughed, and admitted it to be just.&#x2014; I long to hear specially how Mary is, and whether they have yet any outlook of a farm. Anne Cook<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had been their servant from <date when="1835-11-00">Nov. 1835</date> to <date when="1837-06-00">June 1837</date>, when dismissed for stealing; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370611-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:231</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-06-11">11 June 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> wrote to Jane some time ago, about being reengaged here; Jane, I think, means to write to her; but you can say that our present servant answers extremely well at present, and there can be no thought of changing.

I but lately finished Alick&#x2019;s tobacco; I daily smoke on James Aitken&#x2019;s pipes, the best sort of pipes I was ever in my life master of.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the pipes, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371019-TC-JA-01"><sic>9:333&#x2013;34</sic><corr>TC to JA, <date when="1837-10-19">19 Oct. 1837</date></corr></ref>; for the tobacco, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371126-TC-AC-01"><sic>9:353</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1837-11-26">26 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-57" n="10:57"/>Jane for the last three weeks has not been so well. She at first had got a kind of cold, and even cough, which one liked extremely ill to witness; but that is gone now; and we look forward confidently to the good weather. She is now I think not worse again than before the cold, or generally thro&#x2019; the last three months: but it is a feeble state to front the world in, and her patience under the long confinement lessens as the year gets on. We have now sun, tho&#x2019; with east wind, and clouds of dust flying; she ventures out in fine days a little, and seems to enjoy London wonderfully, considering.</p>
<p>I end here my dear Mother; having written far more than I meant. Remember me to the good Grahame of Burnswark; assure him that, tho&#x2019; silent, I am not forgetful; far from that! Tell me how <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are, dear Mother. I will write again before these Lectures are done, nay probably before they begin.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>There never was any poor punctual man more unlucky in his calculations than I. Some fortnight ago, or more, on some Newspaper (I think) coming from Manchester with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes on it, I took it into my head that this was a sign you and Jenny were over into Annandale; that you had not time to write, and had meant me to understand the thing in that manner! The consequence was, I despatched my next Examiner <hi rend="italic">punctually</hi> addressed to you at Scotsbrig. Thither also I sent the next Examiner; nay I also wrote a good long Letter, and sent it thither!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-03-30">30 March.</date></note> There, it would seem, all these things, Newspapers and Letter, are yet lying. I cannot praise our Annandale friends for not taking some steps in consequence. They should have sent you notice, or sent me notice. They might have transmitted you the Examiners at any rate.&#x2014; I got the Second Newspaper from Manchester; but failed altogether to detect your handwriting or anything but Robert&#x2019;s; I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> the address indeed written on the Newspaper itself, but paid no heed to it: noticing the three strokes I fancied it was to be taken as a sign that perhaps Jenny (tho&#x2019; rather suddenly) had got safe back again. Not till yesterday afternoon when I got in from my walk, and found your Letter lying, did I see how it was.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-04-08">8 April</date> from Janet Hanning, with postscripts by Margaret A. Carlyle and Robert Hanning.</note> You may think what an astonishment it gave me. I instantly wrapt together an old Newspaper that chanced to be lying at hand and hastened out with it, to catch the Post still on the streets; a feat I happily accomplished: and now today, <pb id="pg-10-59" n="10:59"/>tho&#x2019; almost altogether <hi rend="italic">without</hi> time, I fling you together a word or two to explain how it was, and set your kind heart at rest. Nothing was wrong, all is right; only my skill in guessing was wrong and misled me.</p>
<p>The Annandale Letter will wait for you till you arrive there. It contained no news, except that we were holding on much as usual, only Jane&#x2019;s health a little threatening. The cold March> weather set her coughing again. But happily all that is past now, and she is as strong at least as before, and able to get out now when the day is favourable. I had enclosed you a Letter from my American friend Emerson; shewing how he had reprinted the F. Revolution in America, with skilful arrangements, and hoped to gain for me some &#xa3;150 by the job. A very kind man. Since that I have actually received a copy of the American Book (in two fine volumes), and a pretty book it is: if the &#x201C;700 dollars&#x201D; come too, it will be something! Emerson says they had already sold 500 copies; that the young people were in raptures, the old &#x201C;shaking their heads,&#x201D; in short that it was <hi rend="italic">all right</hi> there.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1838-02-09">9 Feb.</date>, Emerson had written: &#x201C;The book has the best success with the best. Young men say, it is the only history they have ever read. The middle aged &#x26; the old shake their heads &#x26; cannot make anything of it. In short it has the success of a book which as people have not fashioned has to fashion the people&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 177&#x2013;78).</note> They have the Review Articles printed too I suppose by this time; from which also I am to hope dollars. On this side of the water too, I must say, the Book business continues to prosper as well as I could hope: grand compliments &#x26;c from this one and that one;&#x2014;unfortunately no money yet visible. Patience, Patience; I believe it must turn to something at last. I gave Fraser a <foreign><hi rend="italic">tusseling</hi></foreign> [blowing up] the other day, who seemed greatly frightened; we will see farther into it soon.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-04-13">13 April</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;Nothing settled as to Fraser yet; tho&#x2019; he is now recovered and can be treated with. I went up about ten days ago, and gave him what is called a &#x2018;blowing up,&#x2019;&#x2014;poor creature, he had been cheating me a little as to <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. Very submissive, much frightened; but durst not yet produce any offer of cash for these Review volumes.&#x201D;</note> But indeed I believe poor Fraser will never do a<supplied>[ny]</supplied> good for me, and that I must try to make a bargain with some other as soon as possible. By the Note which I inclose you will see that a certain worthy Thomas Erskine proposes that a friend of his should help me in that business of bargain-making with Booksellers: I have several good friends here. This Erskine,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> I think I mentioned in the Scotsbrig Letter which you never saw, is a Scotch gentleman of fortune; famed in the religious world for Books he has written and things he has done; who says (consider <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>) &#x201C;he does not know but Carlyle is more orthodox than <pb id="pg-10-60" n="10:60"/>any of them!&#x201D; We like him very much, as every body does. He was here last night; but is going to the Continent soon, his home in the North having grown too sad for him, sisters and mother and so many dear friends having been called away by death within the last two years.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> his eldest niece, Ann Paterson, and in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> his mother, Ann Graham, and a second niece and nephew had died. He commented in <date when="1836-12-00">Dec. 1836</date>: &#x201C;Two persons taken from each of the three generations. &#x2026; My mother and uncle Tom, William Macdowal and Margaret Stirling, Georgie and Daidie Paterson&#x201D; (Hanna 1:246). Both his sisters&#x2014;Christian Stirling (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>) and David Paterson (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>)&#x2014;were still alive.</note>&#x2014; Enough now about Books. The Poet Southey, one of the chief men of England, was here last week; and left word among his friends that he meant to read the F. R<hi rend="italic">n six times</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-04-13">13 April</date>, TC noted: &#x201C;Saw Southey, once here, another time at Miss Fenwick&#x2019;s: very kind to me; and fond of talking, especially about the French Revolution, <hi rend="italic">book</hi> and thing. The excitablest man I ever saw. Very strange I should be <foreign><hi rend="italic">toleratus</hi></foreign> [tolerated] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">laudatus</hi></foreign> [praised] with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.&#x201D; Later he wrote: &#x201C;As Southey was the only man of eminence that had ever taken such a view of me, and especially of this my first considerable Book, it seems strange that I should have felt so little real triumph in it as I did. &#x2026; Truly I can say for myself, Southey&#x2019;s approbation, though very privately I doubtless had my pride in it, did not the least tend to swell me&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 352).</note> I said, there were compliments enough and to spare. <hi rend="italic">What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?</hi></p>
<p>We have also had Newspapers from Jack; three I think; all of which I duly forwarded into Scotland, so that you never saw them. One came yesterday no farther gone (it was off before your Letter came); it had a mark to indicate both that Jack was well, and that he had received the Article <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> which I sent him by some Frenchmen. I suppose we shall get a Letter before long to say that they are about leaving Rome. He was to be here before the end of <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>.&#x2014; Finally by the ticket you see how it is with the Lectures! Twelve of them, at due intervals; the price 2 guineas. I would give a <hi rend="italic">gill</hi> I were thro&#x2019; them. They throw me into a fever to think of them; but I must gird myself up, and go resolutely to work: it will not be so bad as last year. Some way or other we shall <foreign><hi rend="italic">warsle</hi></foreign> [struggle] thro&#x2019; it! There will be no peace for me till then. This, my dear Mother, must suffice you for news. I calculate on writing again before long; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will write before you go; or perhaps carry the Letter over to Annan and send it off, that will be best? As it is not to be till after the <date when="1838-05-01">1st of May</date>, I think I will try and send you a few Books about the beginning of the month. I have nothing but my blessing to send you at present; being all flurried to pieces, and not a moment to bethink myself. What an absurd mistake that was; what anxieties have I caused you by it! I will never do the like again,&#x2014;if I can help it.</p>
<p>Poor Mary! Poor wee Wull, whom I remember very well, whom I <pb id="pg-10-61" n="10:61"/>shall never see again!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet had said: &#x201C;we had a letter from Jean yesterday which brought us the painful inteligence that Marys little Child had died last thursday [<date when="1838-04-05">5 April</date>] at two oclock afternoon and was intered yesterd it is the little Boy William.&#x201D; In his Journal, <date when="1838-04-13">13 April</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;poor Mary of Annan has lost her little boy, of which and of whom I cannot give up thinking. Poor Mary! I meant to write to her today, tho&#x2019; I had nothing to say except of sorrow and sympathy; and know not whether it could do any good,&#x2014;in the mood I am in.&#x201D;</note> James Aitken had given us a hint that the poor child was dangerously ill; we did not learn till your Letter that all was over, and had ended in death. It will be a great sorrow to poor Mary and Jamie; I wish I had any means at all of alleviating it. But what can we do; what can we say? &#x201C;The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away&#x201D;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 1:21.</note> well if we could heartily add, &#x201C;Blessed be the name of the Lord!&#x201D; You should write to Mary, poor thing; assure her how truly we all sympathize with her, and entreat her to be comforted.</p>
<p>There is three o&#x2019;clock ringing! I am already too long here, and have written far more than I meant. Take care of yourself, dear Mother. Tell Jenny to accept my thanks for writing; it is very sad work writing (as I say to the Annandale people) when you can get no answer. Wish Robert all speed in his traffic; I not only wish it, but can hope it. Jane is gone out, or she would more expressly send her love. My blessing on you all! I hope to write soon again. <closer><salute>Ever (my dear Mother) Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>On second thoughts, I will not send you the Lecture-ticket this time lest it prove too weighty for the frank.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of these lecture tickets is preserved at Yale.</note> I send you an Irish Letter of compliments instead.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified, but possibly Father O&#x2019;Shea; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340812-TC-RWE-01"><sic>7:264&#x2013;65</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1834-08-12">12 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> You can read it and light your pipe with it.&#x2014; The Lectures begin on Monday fortnight (the last day of this month) and go on on Mondays and Fridays till the <date when="1838-06-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date>. You shall see the prospectus of them I hope by the next frank.</p>
<p>Buller is going to Canada with Durham; did you know that? with a salary of &#xa3;1500 a year. Arthur too goes; and they said, Mrs Buller herself was thinking of going! There is a heart for you.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-03-09">9 March</date></ref>. Harriet Martineau recorded that &#x201C;Charles and Arthur Buller obtained introductions and information from me; and Charles spent many hours by my fireside, diligently discussing business, and giving me the strongest impression of his heart being deep in his work. His poor mother, who worshipped him, came one day, just before they sailed, nervous and flushed, and half-laughing, telling me what a fright she had had:&#x2014;that she had been assured that the Hastings man-of-war, in which her sons were to attend Lord Durham, would certainly sink from the weight of the Governor-General&#x2019;s plate&#x201D; (Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 2:129&#x2013;30).</note></p></ps>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-03-27">27 March</date>.</note> came yesterday, not before I had begun to be looking for it; I answer without delay, as you announce the <date when="1838-04-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> for the last fit date. I will finish off all my correspondence today, and strike effectively, at least exclusively, into my Lectures then. It is but two days since I wrote to our Mother, whom for a fortnight prior I had mistakenly supposed to be in Annandale, and sent a Letter to, and Newspapers, directed <hi rend="italic">thither;</hi> all which, and all notice of them, they left quietly lying there; till she wrote herself in great alarm, otherwise quite well, and minded to continue in Manchester till &#x201C;the beginning of <date when="1838-05-00">May</date>.&#x201D; Your Letter which I had taught her to expect will be a new gratification. The Newspaper came from you that day I wrote to her; I took the three strokes to signify that <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> had arrived; in which it now seems I have been out. Never mind: it is not a thing to do much for you if you had it; and the getting of it by and by is sure. Cavaignac, I take it, is punctual; the delay must lie somewhere beyond his beat.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had said: &#x201C;Is Cavaignac in regard to Parcels the same as W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Fraser used to be? &#x2018;with best intentions always unfortunate.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> How happy that the Post is so punctual! If Letters <pb id="pg-10-63" n="10:63"/>lay, as Parcels do, above a year by the road, it would be a frightful thing to have friends in Italy. It will be all right by and by.</p>
<p>No news out of Annandale, except one little item of sorrowful aspect; the death of poor Mary&#x2019;s youngest child. It was a little Boy whom I think you never saw; an innocent-smiling &#x201C;<foreign>wee</foreign> Wull&#x201D; it was, last Autumn, as I well remember; and now I shall never see it again. In my present fragile state the thought produces more impression on me than it might. I am sorry for the sorrow of poor Mary: Poverty, Toil and Death, and the poor innocent <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [weak] smile of poor &#x201C;<foreign>wee</foreign> Wull&#x201D;;&#x2014;ah me, it is so the world is made! I mean to write to Mary also today. They have got no farm yet, at least none that I can hear of; but it seems or seemed there is still some not distant hope of Stenniebeck. I transmitted your message to them. Of Alick no tidings whatsoever; except once a Newspaper apparently in his hand. James Aitken had been at Manchester in the way of his traffic; and reported all to be moderately well. They have let Craigenputtoch again, to Macadam, his offer being higher than Macqueen&#x2019;s: the House is to stand vacant, I fancy, and rot slowly of its own accord.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01">TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date></ref></note> We offered it to the tenant whoever he might be for &#xa3;10; but lower, no, the word was &#x201C;rot and no <foreign>fash</foreign>.&#x201D; Macadam is to surrender the Park for &#xa3;10 when we like; I had to write, twice, about it: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Accidente al Papa</hi></foreign> [Curse the Pope]! Let it rot then. The rent he pays in all, I think, is some &#xa3;190. Mrs Welsh talks of perhaps going to Liverpool for a while.

<p>About the end of <date when="1838-03-00">March</date>, Jane threatened to begin coughing again; but happily that seems gone now; and as the weather does begin to grow vernal, and she gets out almost daily, I hope the brunt of the malady is over for one year. She keeps very quiet, and suffers what is inevitable as well as possible; I fancy Italy, as you say, might be of real service to her. To me also the one thing needful seems that of getting into any tranquil region under or above the sun. Positively at times the whirl of this dusty deafening chaos gets into the insupportable category. There is a shivering palpitancy in me, which makes <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> of any kind a thing to be shunned.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-04-13">13 April</date>, TC noted: &#x201C;My health is bad. A kind of flutter and palpitancy, increased by any kind of excitation; very disagreeable to me.&#x201D;</note> It is my nerves, my nerves: the poor chaos is bad enough; but with nerves one might stand it. We shall have a grand consultation when you come; all will be in some measure before us then. There are symptoms of capability to <pb id="pg-10-64" n="10:64"/>grow a lion<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref>.</note> by and by: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fluch</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Dem</hi></foreign> [Curse it]! Good never lay <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> lie where it might. Also I imagine it possible I might learn to subsist myself here; earning the small needful of money,&#x2014;literally with my heart&#x2019;s blood. You can fancy it; with such a nervous-system as I have: the beautiful and brave saying in their sumptuousity here and there, &#x201C;O Thomas what an illustrious character thou art!&#x201D;&#x2014;and Thomas feeling in his heart for comfort, and finding bilious fever; in his pocket, and finding emptiness; round him for fellowship, and finding solitude, ghastly amid grinning masks! But on the whole I do adhere to one thing, that of <hi rend="italic">holding my peace</hi>. I really am better too, in the inward heart of me; there is no danger of a man, I feel always, while his heart is not <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>. So let us hold on,&#x2014;thro&#x2019; these Lectures at any rate; for that is the nearest duty.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> 196.</note> I must tell you moreover that I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the American edition of the F. R<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> a most respectable gilt book, in two volumes, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they sell at 2 dollars,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >$2.50, according to Emerson; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> and were getting rapidly away with in Yankee land (1000 printed, 500 sold forthwith); nay, by Emerson&#x2019;s calculation whom I heard from since you heard, there was to be some &#xa3;150 of profit realized for the Author! The Review Articles are out, I suppose, and calculated for a similar result. We shall be very glad of it. Emerson says, the young men in America exclaimed &#x26;c &#x26;c; the old men shook their heads, and knew not what to exclaim. Southey the Poet, whom I saw here lately, proposes to read the Book over &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">six</hi> times,&#x201D; which I fancy you will think is enough.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380410-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-04-10">10 April</date></ref>.</note> To finish the business, I saw Fraser lately, and frightened him much; without result. He had been behaving in a knavish way about that <hi rend="italic">Teufelsk;</hi> clearly knavish. He thinks he has some 240 copies of the Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> still on hand:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-04-13">13 April</date>, TC commented: &#x201C;a small sale for so much noise.&#x201D;</note> it did not sell at all, he says, for two months, and then it began, and goes on; but the trade in the Row<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paternoster Row.</note> always think it may quite easily fall off again, and so never order above a copy or two at a time. I daresay poor James was speaking truth. For the rest I required his ultimate word about that Review Publication, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he would give. He promised to write it, but has not written it, tho&#x2019; the time is past and doubly-past. My interior conviction is that I shall never get any good of <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> that I must seek another Bookseller. Worthy Mr Erskine proposes that I should entrust the matter to a Brother-in-law of his here;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine&#x2019;s only surviving brother-in-law, James Paterson, lived in Scotland and was not a publisher. However in both his Journal, <date when="1838-04-13">13 April</date>, and in <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380410-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-04-10">10 April</date></ref>, TC refers to Erskine&#x2019;s &#x201C;friend&#x201D; who will &#x201C;bargain with some <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Bookseller.&#x201D; Erskine&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of Election</hi> was printed in Glasgow for James Duncan, Paternoster Row, London, in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>.</note> whom he is to bring to meet me on Monday next. By the time <pb id="pg-10-65" n="10:65"/>the Lectures are over, we must really have an arrangement, and <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be able to make one, I think. Enough of it now.&#x2014; The Lectures were first announced in the Newspapers yesterday:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> I have been among Tickets and Programs ever since; but have that over now. There are to be twelve lectures, two a-week; the first on Monday <date when="1838-04-30">April 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, the last somewhere about the <date when="1838-06-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date>. They make me shudder; but I will try not to shudder. I will do whatever I can by writing; but one cannot read part and speak part, it destroys the impetus for speech when you stop to read: speaking too is decidedly the favourite way with all. I have been very busy, especially with the first three lectures, on Greek and Roman things, where I had rusted greatly. I have read Thucydides, Herodotus; part of Niebuhr, Michelet &#x26;c,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Thucydides, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380100-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [late <date when="1838-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2013;early <date when="1838-03-00">March</date>]</ref>; Herodotus TC called &#x201C;a clear-headed, candid man&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> ed.

Indeed he seemed anxious to come to me rather; so I left him a card with invitation; he is not to leave London again he says, but to settle here: the &#xa3;6"10 shall be paid him therefore with no delay. He is a cleverish-looking man, the type of his face like that of Editor Lockhart&#x2019;s; with an <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> accent, I thought. Going thro&#x2019; the Green Park, I saw her little Majesty [Queen Victoria], taking her bit of departure for Windsor. I had seen her another day at Hyde Park Corner coming in from the daily ride. She is decidedly a pretty-looking little creature; health, clearness, graceful timidity looking out from her young face; &#x201C;frail cockle on the black bottomless deluges,&#x201D; one could not help some interest in her, as in a sister situated as mortal seldom was. The crowd yesterday, some two thousand strong, of loungers and children, <pb id="pg-10-66" n="10:66"/>uttered no sound whatever, except a kind of thin-spread interjection <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Aihh!&#x201D;</hi> from the infantile part of it; one old Flunkey in tarnished laced hat was the only creature I saw salute, he got a bow in return all to himself. Poor little victory!&#x2014; In the evening we had the Scotts, by volunteer engagement on their part; and then I had to go to a Bullerian rout, having refused a dinner there the day before: Mrs Martineau,<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mrs&#x201D; mistakenly written for &#x201C;Miss&#x201D;; see Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 3:220.</note> &#x201C;dear Mrs Rigmarole the distinguish female, great Mr Rigmarole the distinguished male&#x201D;!<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380316-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-03-16">16 March</date></ref>.</note> Radical Grote<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Grote (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>); see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330718-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:415</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-07-18">18 July 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> was the only novelty, for I had never noticed him before.

I will go out no more, I think, till the Lectures end.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Two days ago you had a Letter from me, explaining what a game of cross-purposes it had been between us: yesterday this Letter of Jack&#x2019;s came, and so now I am already writing to you again. As I shall get a frank tonight (for I am to dine with one Milnes a Yorkshire member),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Monckton Milnes, M.P. for Pontefract. For the dinner, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref></note> it is better to send off the message to you without delay.</p>
<p>All seems to be going well with Jack; he is still coming home, only not altogether so soon as he once talked of. I expect to be perhaps nearly done with my Lecturing before he come; an arrangement I shall not regret. About &#x201C;the longest day [<date when="1838-06-21">21 June</date>],&#x201D; one may hope, it will all be right&#x2014;so far!</p>
<p>This is the crowded season here; such dinnering and <hi rend="italic">partying,</hi> dancing and <foreign>deraying</foreign> [disorderly merriment] as it is weariness to think of! The kind of creature they call &#x201C;a lion&#x201D; goes about every day and night into such meetings to be stared at. I go out not once in the ten days; and I find it far too much. &#x201C;Never am better,&#x201D; as old Tom White<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> said, &#x201C;than when there&#x2019;s not a drop of it in me!&#x201D; I have refused this little member I am going to tonight, and again refused him; till at last I must go,&#x2014;and dine at seven o&#x2019;clock!</p>

<p>Yesterday, going thro&#x2019; one of the Parks, I saw the poor little Queen. She was in an open carriage, preceded by three or four swift red-coated troopers; all off for Windsor just as I happened to pass. Another carriage, or carriages, followed; with maids of honour &#x26;c: the whole drove very fast. It seemed to me the poor little Queen was a bit modest nice <foreign>sonsy</foreign> [cheerful] little <foreign>lassie</foreign>; blue eyes, light hair, fine white skin; of extremely small stature: she looked timid, anxious, almost frightened; for the people looked at her in perfect silence; one old liveryman alone touched his hat to her: I was heartily sorry for the poor <foreign>bairn</foreign>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps she might have said as Parson Swan<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> did, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Greet</hi></foreign> [weep] not for me brethren; for verily yea verily I <foreign>greet</foreign> not for myself.&#x201D; It is a strange thing to look at the fashion of this world!</p>
<p>I meant to write a word to poor Mary today; but these visiters coming in have belated me. I am sorry for it. And yet, at bottom, I had nothing to say to her, poor thing, except that I was very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> for her.</p>
<p>I insert here one of the Lecture Prospectuses: you will see what a thing it is! I must <foreign><hi rend="italic">warsle</hi></foreign> [struggle] thro&#x2019; it. Above all things, I must try to keep myself <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>. I should like well to be on Creca Moor<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Creca was four mi.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Will you accept a very small and hasty Note in return for the long, interesting and thoroughly instructive Letter you wrote me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I know with what difficulty you would write it, the little imp of a boy &#x201C;climbing up on the table&#x201D; beside you, excellent little imp that he is: but you contrive to draw me, in rude hard lines, a very significant and distinct image of what is going on: many, many thanks to you for it. I had another Letter from Alick not very long before:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-04-15">15 April</date>.</note> he too is still unanswered; perhaps I should have written to him rather; but you will convey my news to him, some way or other; and I think this is more certain of being delivered directly than a Letter to him would be. I know too you will all excuse me at present: my brevity, nay my silence altogether would not be inexcusable if you saw how I am situated.&#x2014; I sent off your Letter and Alick&#x2019;s to our Mother in a parcel of Magazines and old trash of books going to Manchester: I have just bought a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper to speed off to her today, and shall have to write thither also before long. You too I hope will see some glimpse of some Newspaper too; I will try to send you or get you something of the kind sent, at least once before this thing of Lecturing be over. But, indeed, as Corrie said &#x201C;What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201D;</p>
<p>First then let me tell you that a Newspaper came yesterday from Jack, with the mark of &#x201C;all well&#x201D; on it. It is from Rome; which City I suppose they must now be soon purposing to leave. Jack&#x2019;s last Letter, which came some three weeks ago and was sent off directly to our Mother, and which perhaps you have not heard of, reported that some delay was like to take place,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John in his letter of <date when="1838-03-27">27 March</date>, had thought that they would not leave till the end of <date when="1838-05-00">May</date> as the Spaurs were to travel with them to Milan and Como.</note> but that they still calculated on being here early in <date when="1838-06-00">June</date>. We shall hope to see the poor Doctor arrive safe to us once more.</p>
<p>And now for Chelsea and London. After much <hi rend="italic">trembling</hi> and preparation, yesterday our first Lecture was actually got delivered. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> I spoke of above contains a very kind notice of it (written I understand by the man that reviewed my Book there):<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Makepeace Thackeray; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370803-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:271</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-03">3 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>. In his notice of the first lecture in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1838-05-01">1 May</date>, he commented on the &#x201C;cultivated and intelligent aspect of the audience, of whom an unusually large proportion appeared to be of a high order, both as to station and education&#x201D;; he said of TC that his &#x201C;utterances half colloquial, half lyrical,&#x201D; were &#x201C;of a man who has evidently not inherited his views, or caught them by contagion, but has been urged by an insatiable thirst for truth, and has won it for himself, and his own inmost cravings, by hard contentions and the perilous labours of mental mining.&#x201D; See also Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CF</hi> 226&#x2013;32.</note> I fancy my <pb id="pg-10-71" n="10:71"/>Mother will send it forward to some of you and that you will all see it. I wish it could be kept for me; it and the rest that may follow; they will be worth looking at 10 years hence: but on the whole that is no matter.&#x2014; Our entrance into the enterprise was, as usual, performed under <hi rend="italic">mixed</hi> auspices. My health, or rather I should say my nerves and heart were not good: tremble, tremble, like an ague fever, now hot with hope, oftenest cold with fear, and on the whole extremely sour many times that I was bound to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> so shivered and quivered when all I prayed for was a life of quietness, of silence! To worsen the matter, poor Jane caught this Influenza that is going here, and after escaping all winter and spring much better than we could have hoped, fell ill and very ill just three days before the grand Business was to begin! Thank Heaven, she got as suddenly round again, and even got herself smuggled away yesterday, and in a private manner heard me preach. It was not so bad as last year; nor perhaps so good. I was very quiet; kept my tremblings down; and in the sick state I was in my mind felt half lame,&#x2014;like a spavined horse which I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> whip into heat. We shall be in many moods yet, before the &#x201C;six weeks&#x201D; end. But I suppose the thing <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be got over in some tolerable way; and that is all I request of Heaven about it.&#x2014;One thing is to be regretted in it, that the arrangements, and announcements and the rest of that, do not seem to be considered as what they ought to have been. I left it all to two idle friends of mine, a Mr Wilson and a Mr Darwin;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson and Erasmus Darwin.</note> and I believe they did what they could, but &#x201C;Easter-week&#x201D; and small circumstances which you would not understand were against them: whereby the thing is not fairly tried after all, and the money-produce of it may be somewhat less than it would otherwise have been. I expected vaguely perhaps &#xa3;300 for it, but shall now be well content with 2. These as you may guess are <hi rend="italic">family-secrets;</hi> no one else has any business to know about them. Perhaps the audience may <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> a little as the thing goes on; perhaps not: they seemed already (I am told) to be some 140; but the expenses of the business are huge in proportion. And now enough of all that. Nothing could be friendlier than my reception;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leigh Hunt described how TC was &#x201C;heartily greeted with applause at the close of his first week&#x2019;s eloquence,&#x201D; adding that he was sure that &#x201C;he has now found the secret (whatever it is) of speaking with like triumphant volubility&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1838-05-06">6 May</date>). Milnes said of him: &#x201C;there he stands, simple as a child, and his happy thought dances on his lips and in his eyes, and takes word and goes away, and he bids it God speed, whatever it be&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:220).</note> I have kind friends there, whom I ought never to <pb id="pg-10-72" n="10:72"/>forget. Hope with me that it will all end handsomely, and I be at liberty once more to &#x201C;get out of this.&#x201D; If I had health and impudence, great things lie before me here; but I have neither the one nor the other; and on the whole do not want great things&#x2014; O Heaven, peace, peace, that is all I want!</p>
<p>Thank James <hi rend="italic">for</hi> his care of Craigenputtoch; bid him do what farther with it <hi rend="italic">he</hi> judges fittest. Thank him too for his diligence with the Revolution; it gratifies me greatly. I send my brotherly love to one and all. Glad am I to learn that Alick is doing well; right glad. I will write to some of you again ere long. And now enough O Sister Jean! I have <hi rend="italic">physic</hi> in me, I am weary, and have much to do. <closer><salute>Your ever affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<ps><salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>When a man&#x2014;at least when this Man has &#x201C;physic in him,&#x201D; it appears to me that he should make a distinct announcement of the fact, in the very first sentence of his letter, instead of mentioning it by the by at the end. as the reader then takes in all he may say or sing <hi rend="italic">with allowance.</hi> Thus had he begun with &#x201C;My dear Jane I this morning swallowed <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;quite promiscuously&#x201D;</hi> a doze of castor-oil&#x2014;mixed up by my own hand too (my wife being in bed at the time) and sit down to write under its <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;dark brown shad&#x201D;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351012-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:226</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-12">12 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x201C;You would have formed to yourself, as you proceeded, a much cheerier as well as truer picture of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;the wark&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;I can assume his nerves were a vast deal stiffer than last year&#x2014; I took one glimpse at him (just one) when he came on the stage&#x2014;and to be sure he was as white as a pocket handkerchief&#x2014;but he made no gasping and spluttering as I found him doing last year at <hi rend="italic">the fourth</hi> lecture. By and by when the rate he was getting on at, told me I might look with safety he had recovered all that &#x201C;<foreign>bonny</foreign> red in his cheeks&#x201D; which Miss Corson of Craigenputtoch<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Eliza Corson; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320814-JWC-AC-01"><sic>6:203</sic><corr>JWC to AC, <date when="1832-08-14">14 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> so highly admired&#x2014;and having a very fine light from above shining down on him he really looked a surprisingly beautiful man&#x2014; His lecture was to my taste better than any he delivered last year in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hearing. tho&#x2019; he himself thinks foresooth there was not enough of <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> in it. and he delivered it very gracefully; that is to say, without any air of thinking about his delivery, which is the best grace of any. I in a manner, &#x2018;took <pb id="pg-10-73" n="10:73"/>up my bed and walked&#x2019; to hear him&#x2014;for I was hardly up after several days of tugging on with Influenza like a fly among treacle when the arrival of a Gentleman with a close carriage to take me,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Erasmus Darwin.</note> was a temptation not to be resisted&#x2014;and I just <hi rend="italic">waited</hi> to send off <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> with my blessing, and then flung on my cloak and drove after him. arriving at the door from opposite sides in the very same instant with himself&#x2014;but I turned away my face and passed on without taking any notice&#x2014;as the pheasants when they want to hide think it enough to stick their heads into a hole. Beware however dear Jane how you encourage that little morsel of yours to follow the trade of being a Genius&#x2014;it is a considerable risk&#x2014;one way and another&#x2014;and for my part if I had the power of administering it, I should advise it much as our good Doctor used to do with his senna&#x2014;&#x201C;you had better give it him or perhaps you had better <hi rend="italic">not.&#x201D;</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> My Mother complains that you take no notice of her and the only news she gets of any of you is by way of London&#x2014; For shame&#x2014;you who can write so well ought not to be so slack&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Sister</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you accept, at a late date, this short Note, which, should have been a long letter written many months ago. Better late than never, the Proverb says! I have been situated so, principally in regard to nerves and spirits too sorely acted on by the fret of this mad Babylon, that I am well sure, if you knew half of it, you would forgive me. Pray know always that I can never forget Burnswark and you; that if I do not write it is because silence seems better than any speech my humour would allow; that I am weary, sick; that I am anything but unregardful of you. Woe betide me if I were! Do not many images, of thick Tartan cloaks, cigar-boxes, coffee biggens and effects, with the image of a right friendly face turned towards me in honest helpfulness <pb id="pg-10-74" n="10:74"/>when there were but few turned that way,&#x2014;rise up in continual remembrance? Time robs us of many things; but these are of the things that I retain in perpetual fee-simple independent of time.</p>
<p>I have had a restless dreaming winter; mixture of dreaming, and starting up with loud knocks at &#x201C;the wooden guardian of one&#x2019;s privacy!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Pope, &#x201C;Lines from the Art of Sinking,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Minor Poems,</hi> ed. N. Ault and J. Butt (London, <date when="1954-00-00">1954</date>) 288.</note> The cry of my whole soul is, was, and will be, that I could be well let alone. But no, that is not so easy. I think it will be months and years yet, before I get back to the old level where peace and rest is. One comfort is that I am getting quieter by nature; namely <hi rend="italic">older.</hi> Allan Cunningham says, A man can have no right health in London till he once be five-and-forty.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> O for five-and-forty, Tam!</p>
<p>The good Yankee friends have reprinted the F. Revn in a very handsome manner; a copy of their edition is here. They are also printing Review things of mine.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> Nay they talk of sending me some scantling of dollars from both these sources; for it is friends not book-traders that have taken charge of it. Long life to Yankee-land! We shall see.&#x2014; Here at home, I have had a curious fortune too. As much applause, or rather considerably more, from the best kind of judges as was good for me; and from the Bookseller hitherto not a copper farthing. Nay the scamp has found out a set of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckhs</hi> (you know the pamphlet, worth about six-pence) which lay rotting in his cellar as &#x201C;d&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;d stuff&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:175</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and sells them currently for five shillings each!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fraser had bound fifty-eight copies of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> from page proofs for TC in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>. Perhaps he had some extra made at the same time. It is not known whether TC pursued the matter.</note> That trade seems altogether destined to revert very soon to the Devil, whose it is. I have checked the five-shillings &#x201C;Teufel&#x201D; however, and will do another thing or two in regard to that matter. Hang it! One right Annandale <foreign><hi rend="italic">Collie</hi></foreign> [scolding] is all the reply one can give to that kind of thing.</p>
<p>For the present I am again at my old trade of basket making, or lecturing. It goes along very tolerably; tho&#x2019; at a frightful expense to my nerves. By the blessing of Heaven, on this day month, I shall have done with it, and <hi rend="italic">then!</hi> I have always looked forward to the <hi rend="italic">then!</hi>; and yet I know not what I shall do then. John is coming, I hope; and then <hi rend="italic">we shall see.</hi> He was to quit Rome about this time or earlier, to be here in <date when="1838-06-00">June</date>. He has often sent remembrances to you, which I as <pb id="pg-10-75" n="10:75"/>regularly transmitted to Ecclefechan or Scotsbrig; but whether they always got round the Hill I know not so well.</p>
<p>My wife is not at all in strong health; nor am I, as you gather. I wish many a time I were in Creta or Langtether!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Creta is probably Creca; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref>. Langtether is untraced.</note> Let us hope that somehow or other I may see you this summer, were it on <hi rend="italic">greener</hi> ground. I will write no more in such haste. I will wish you a prosperous seedtime and all good; I will beg to be remembered kindly to the two ladies, good friends of mine.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham&#x2019;s sisters, Elizabeth Graham and Mrs. Howatson.</note> I will hope for your excuse of a scrawl like this; for your tolerance, your affection and good wishes; and subscribe myself (as I can truly)</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I must send you a short line rather than none at all. At present in the heat and press of Lecturing and tumult, I can afford no writing; it is not so much that I want time, as that I altogether want composure and spirits. You will take what I can send; if you saw completely how I am situated you would not think me stingy, I imagine, but wonderfully liberal &#x201C;considering.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Your Letter came,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-04-15">15 April</date>.</note> and one from Jean not very far off it, which last I have answered, with a request that the purport of news in said answer should be transmitted over to you. I was right glad to learn, both from yourself and still more pointedly from Jean, that all was going on quite handsomely at Ecclefechan; that you found your traffick answer the end, and stood faithfully to it; that there was every hope of its turning out as well as the hopefullest of us expected.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had opened a general store in Ecclefechan, <date when="1837-10-00">Oct. 1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371107-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:340</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-11-07">7 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> What a blessing it must be to an industrious man to see, not, as you have long been forced to do, his substance gradually wasting away from him, but an <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> were it even a slow one granted to his toil, and the certainty that at least day and way are <hi rend="italic">alike</hi> long! There is nothing that I know of more harrassing to a man than the kind of lot you have <pb id="pg-10-76" n="10:76"/>had to struggle with for long years past. With all the faults there were, I can assure you dear Alick, I have many times admired the constancy, the quietude you displayed, and on the whole how <hi rend="italic">well</hi> you behaved. Thank God, the worst seems now to be over, and better days are dawning for you. &#x201C;Better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than <foreign>nae bield</foreign>,&#x201D; they say. Be well content with poor Ecclefechan, in that it will do for you what prouder places have refused to do: yield you meat and clothes for your labour. A man can get no more that I know of in this world. And as for past toils and sufferings, we will say that surely we <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> them; that if we need more of them, we should hope to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> more of them. Folly is bound up in the heart of a man; pride, anger, intolerance,&#x2014;self-conceit, in a word, the root of all sin. One must be beaten with many stripes till <hi rend="italic">that</hi> be beaten out of him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Deut. 25:2&#x2013;3 and 2 Cor. 11:24.</note> Courage, my brave brother, I say; be steady and teachable, diligent and patient; live and learn!&#x2014; As for your success in your business I surely think the worst is past now, and that you have a free chance to hold on prospering still better henceforth. Be in no <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> to prosper, desire not much prosperity. A man saving five pounds in the year is, I believe, nearly <hi rend="italic">always</hi> a luckier man than one that is spending five hundred thousand. I do believe this, and know it more and more from what I see daily here under my eyes. O the tumult, the mad uproar as of a Bedlam; and all the cut-glass and upholstery of the world will not satiate <hi rend="italic">one</hi> soul of Adam&#x2019;s many sons; not the poorest cob<supplied>[b]</supplied>ler will be filled with it all, but desires something greater than it all.&#x2014; If I had any practical precept to enforce again upon you in regard to your shop, it would be this one, <hi rend="italic">To have faith in the honesty of human nature;</hi> I mean, to believe in spite of all appearances to the contrary that honesty will prevail against dishonesty, even in Ecclefechan, and anywhere under the Sun. It is a great truth. Have nothing to do therefore with bad articles at all at any price. All men do at heart desire to deal with a man of that sort; a man of that sort is sure to be acknowledged too, were it even slowly, and to draw round him all the worthy people in the district he lives in.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had written: &#x201C;how deftly I am able to whisk about in our little Shop, and with what serene composure I manage to execute the commands of my poor customers. &#x2026; Some few of them I helped in the long storm in winter and found &#x2018;ungrateful&#x2019; (as Dr. Thom said of the poor of Carlisle). I have not only refrained from <hi rend="italic">craving</hi> but even hinted to individuals among them that perhaps &#x2018;upon the whole&#x2019; it was better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to pay; well knowing that no further application could be made while the debt remained. I have moreover other and better customers. &#x2026; and continue to believe hope and trust that a liveliehood may be earned. <supplied>[My]</supplied> customers are gradually becoming more <hi rend="italic">respectable,</hi> ev<supplied>[en]</supplied> some few of them well-nigh entitled to &#x2018;Keep a Gig.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> I have no conviction clearer than this. Moderate <pb id="pg-10-77" n="10:77"/>profits, genuine goods, faithful punctuality; the conduct, in one word, of an <hi rend="italic">honest man:</hi> that is the rule. And so I leave you; adding only Jack&#x2019;s precept, To cultivate your hand writing. Write often, and choose your pen; by degrees you will find your writing improve into a swift free-flowing hand, and this will be a great convenience to you. God prosper you, my dear Brother! We shall all perhaps get better on, a little, than we have done for years past.</p>
<p>I sent your Letter forward to our Mother with some old books. There came a Newspaper from Rob<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning. Mrs. Carlyle had returned from Manchester with Janet on <date when="1838-05-08">8 May</date>.</note> the other day; indicating, as I suppose, that all was well. I must write again thither, tho&#x2019; I hardly know how to address; for I suppose now our Mother must be thinking of Annandale and green fields. My notion is that she has been pretty well in the Cotton Country, with company and plenty of coals; thro&#x2019; the wild winter; happier than she could have been at Scotsbrig in that dead season.&#x2014; I have seen nothing of any brother-in law of Jamie&#x2019;s yet;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Calvert. James had mentioned in his note of introduction, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date>, that he had been &#x201C;travelling for some years in South America.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date></ref>.</note> nor until he come can I know anything about his notions. He should be very welcome to me if he came. But probably he is in &#x201C;the City&#x201D; as they call it; that is, the Eastern trading part of London, and some four of [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> <supplied>or</supplied>] five miles off this region. London is like a whole set of towns; I might say, a set of Nations. The people even <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> differently rather, on different sides of it; I can know their dialects now, and say, &#x201C;You are a Chelsea man,&#x201D; &#x201C;You are of the Whitechapel region&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Jack has written to me, as you would probably learn thro&#x2019; Jean: all well; and ought to be setting off from Rome about this time. As to that indeed there is no precise light; but yesterday I had a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes: whether that indicates that he has received some parcel or other (of which he has <hi rend="italic">three</hi> or perhaps four wandering about this long while), or that he is about to set out from Rome homewards, I do not know. In any case we may infer that he was well; we are to hope that the broad face will become visible among us once more, and the poor Doctor get back to those he loves best after this other set of wanderings. &#x201C;Poor fellow, after all!&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Very often finish of my brother in summing up his censures of men&#x2014;so often that we had grown to expect it, and banter it&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:119).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Did my Mother send you a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper, as I hoped she would? In that case you would see I had got to sailing-depth once <pb id="pg-10-78" n="10:78"/>more, and was out on the ocean-waters; lecturing, lecturing! I believe there have been other Newspaper Critics,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> pbd. Thackeray&#x2019;s reviews, <date when="1838-05-01">1</date> and <date when="1838-05-22">22 May</date>, and a letter describing the first lecture, <date when="1838-05-02">2 May</date>; Hunt reviewed all the lectures, except the fourth, in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> <date when="1838-05-06">6</date>, <date when="1838-05-13">13</date>, <date when="1838-05-20">20</date>, <date when="1838-05-27">27 May</date>, and <date when="1838-06-03">3</date>, <date when="1838-06-10">10</date>, <date when="1838-06-17">17 June</date>; and the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> reviewed the lectures on <date when="1838-05-01">1</date>, <date when="1838-05-12">12</date>, and <date when="1838-05-26">26 May</date>.</note> and that they have all been laudatory; tho&#x2019; I have seen none more except the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (Hunt writes that in it), which also my Mother got from me. I think she said once they sent it on to you regularly.&#x2014; I was in a dreadful state of tremor and misery the first day; also a certain Doctor here had recommended a kind of <hi rend="italic">hartshorn</hi> preparation which I was to take for &#x201C;quieting my nerves,&#x201D;&#x2014;a cure far worse than the disease: however, I weltered thro&#x2019; that first time, and always since it has been simpler and simpler. I have three Lectures (fully the worst three) behind me now, a fourth tomorrow, and hope to go on in some reasonable way till I do once again get <hi rend="italic">done!</hi> My audience rather increases daily as yet, and is very kind and respectful to me; they seem quite a different set of people, three fourths of them, from what last year&#x2019;s were; more men, among them, and men with an air of <hi rend="italic">law</hi> and business. Our new Lecture room (the only tolerable place for speaking that one could get, last year&#x2019;s being a <hi rend="italic">dining</hi>-room and fiddling-room utterly detestable to me) lies quite out of the beat of my Fashionable friends, not a fourth part of whom seem to have followed me to the new shop. Nay I believe the whole arrangement was <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>managed, and that with good skill I might have pocketed very considerably more money than I shall get.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He netted about &#xa3;260; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380621-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-21">21 June</date></ref>.</note> But what then? One cannot learn except by experience <hi rend="italic">dear</hi>-bought. If I lecture again next year I will now manage it myself; I have learn<supplied>[ed]</supplied> it now. But on the whole, I am what they call &#x201C;successful,&#x201D; and may perhaps do myself good in the long run beyond what can be counted up in money at present. The people shall hear a little more of my mind this year, for I stand in less and less terror of them; and feel much &#x201C;more like a teacher and less like a showman&#x201D; than I did. And so, Boy, I must toil on for a calendar month yet; ah me!&#x2014;and if you hear nothing more of me, fancy that all goes smoothly, and <supplied>[that]</supplied> nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>Jane continues weakly, yet is always able to go out at Lecture time; she says &#x201C;any <foreign><hi rend="italic">harl</hi></foreign> of health she has is always there.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;And ony harl o&#x2019; health she has is aye aboot mealtime,&#x201D; as a country fellow, in Dr. Thom&#x2019;s surgery at Ecclefechan, said when enumerating his poor mother&#x2019;s ailments&#x201D; (A.

</bibl><sourceNote>TC-HC, [<date when="1838-05-11">11? May</date>]. MS: NLS Acc. 8064. Letter hitherto unpbd. Cole kept this letter and the petition (written on two foolscap pages with the watermark &#x201C;W. King / <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x201D;) with his collection of memorabilia relating to the establishment of penny postage, sold at Sotheby&#x2019;s, <date when="1981-12-17">17 Dec. 1981</date>, lots 103&#x2013;6. Cole (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350811-TC-HGR-01"><sic>8:191</sic><corr>TC to HGR, <date when="1835-08-11">11 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>) was sec. of the mercantile committee on postage, set up in <date when="1838-02-00">Feb. 1838</date> to promote Rowland Hill&#x2019;s plan for uniform penny postage (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370611-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:232</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-06-11">11 June 1837</date></corr></ref>). According to Cole, in the course of <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, five petitions were presented to parliament in favor of uniform penny postage payable in advance; under Cole and the mercantile committee&#x2019;s encouragement 320 were presented in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> and over 2,000 by <date when="1839-07-00">July 1839</date>, Cole having been particularly active &#x201C;before the opening of the Session in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> &#x2026; in preparing and provoking the adoption of petitions throughout the United Kingdom&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fifty Years of Public Work</hi> [London, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 1:48; samples of the petitions, 2:106&#x2013;8). On <date when="1839-05-02">2 May 1839</date> Melbourne and Spring Rice received a large deputation of M.P.s and the mercantile committee, urging adoption of uniform penny postage; on <date when="1838-05-31">31 May</date>, Russell announced to the House of Commons that the govt. would accept the plan. Since the battle was nearly won by early <date when="1839-05-00">May 1839</date> it seems less likely that TC wrote his letter to Cole and the petition during his <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> lectures, <date when="1839-05-01">1</date> to <date when="1839-05-18">18 May</date>. It is more likely that Cole, in the enthusiasm of his new role in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, had asked for TC&#x2019;s help (see n. 2) and that TC dashed off this petition after he had begun lecturing on <date when="1838-04-30">30 April 1838</date>. Since TC did not finish his lectures until <date when="1838-06-11">11 June</date> and he did not want to hear of the petition &#x201C;for a month to come&#x2014;being wholly in the agony of Lecturing at present,&#x201D; the letter can probably be dated Friday, <date when="1838-05-11">11 May</date>, when he gave his fourth lecture.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I will speak to Hunt about the Petition when I see him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No mention has been found of any involvement by Hunt in the campaign. TC was seeing him regularly at the lectures.</note> To shew my own goodwill, and satisfy my <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cole noted in his autobiography that, besides his institution on <date when="1838-03-14">14 March</date> of the <hi rend="italic">Post Circular or weekly advocate for a cheap, swift, and sure passage</hi>, as a way to circulate petitions and propaganda cheaply under the newspaper postage rules (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360824-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:41</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1836-08-24">24 Aug. 1836</date></corr></ref>), &#x201C;I proposed that Lectures on Postage Reform should be given, and an offer was made to Thomas Carlyle, who was a strong advocate of reform, which after some hesitation he declined&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fifty Years</hi> 1:44). Possibly TC offered this rough draft for a petition from &#x201C;Men of Letters&#x201D; instead of the lectures.</note> here is a rough scroll of <pb id="pg-10-80" n="10:80"/>some of my own ideas on the matter;&#x2014;rough and ready.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s petition is essentially a Carlylean presentation of common arguments in favor of reform.

<p><closer><salute>My dear Sir, / very truly yours, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>One of our Dumfries Papers, the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>, is a zealous advocate of Penny Postage, when the question turns up.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the editorial, <date when="1838-05-04">4 May</date>, about the strong feeling in the country that postage rates should be sharply reduced.</note> Do you see that?</p>
<p><title>To the &#x26;c The Petition of the undersigned Men of Letters</title></p>
<salute>Humbly sheweth,</salute>
<p>That your Petitioners, engaged in multifarious inquiries, connected in manifold relations, of friendship, kindred, business, community of study, and other calls for correspondence by letter, find the present rates of Postage a heavy burden and obstruction; and desire much that Mr R. Hill&#x2019;s Plan of Uniform Penny Postage were adopted in this Kingdom.</p>
<p>That meanwhile their personal interest in this Plan, however real and considerable, is yet small in comparison to the benefits they, as members of society, anticipate from it, in all points of view, moral, social, economical, to all classes; especially to the largest and poorest class, which counts not by units or by hundreds but by millions.</p>
<p>That man, as your Petitioners will crave leave to repeat, is distinguished from animals by the gift of Speech, and civilized man from savage by the art of Writing (which is but an infinite extension of Speech); to which miraculous art the Post-Office for daily individual <pb id="pg-10-81" n="10:81"/>purposes, as the Press for lasting universal ones, seems indispensably important, worthy of all furtherance and the utmost attainable freedom.</p>
<p>That alike by primary impulse of Nature and by continual necessities of Business, men are called to speak together; that men are rendered friendly and in all ways helpful to one another, chiefly by this same, by communicating their wants, attainments, sympathies, purposes,&#x2014;in a word, by speaking together when they wish to speak.</p>
<p>That Nations too exist united, and from heterogeneous Aggregates have grown into Nations and continue so, by no circumstance so much as by community of language, or the faculty of mutual speech and communication; that the more rapid, free, constant and universal such communication is in any Nation, the stronger, more coherent, vital, and victorious over difficulty, must that Nation every way become.</p>
<p>That there seems good reason to believe that Mr R. H.&#x2019;s Plan would ultimately, in this Kingdom, occasion no loss but rather a gain to the revenue; such an increase of letters, when all writers wrote freely, and the now unwriting millions began to write, might be anticipated from it.</p>
<p>That even in the contrary case, and supposing the Post-Office should become unproductive in finance, your Pet<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> will humbly urge that a tax on Letter-writing is a tax on deliberate Speaking,&#x2014;on the deepest want and most indefeasible right of man; a tax, as it were, on the act of living (for man&#x2019;s life is but an <hi rend="italic">utterance</hi> of himself); a tax fitter for Turkey and a Sultan&#x2019;s Divan, than for England and a legislature like your Hon. House</p>
<p>May it therefore please your Hon House to consider in your wisdom how the said Plan of Uniform Penny Postage may be put in action, and pass the same into a law.</p>
<p>And your Pet<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> will ever pray.</p></ps>

<p>Your and Jenny&#x2019;s Letter from Annan<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-05-09">9 May</date>.</note> arrived duly with its welcome news that you were safe on your own side of the Border again; where I hope you continue to find yourself well in spite of the North-winds. The greenness of the fields and the smokeless clean air would have a new relish after the long tack of <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign> [smoke] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">stour</hi></foreign> [dust] in Manchester. But I suppose you were as snug there too as you could have been anywhere else.</p>
<p>I have written several times to Annandale of late, once to Jean at Dumfries, once to Alick; and I calculated that you would be in no great anxiety about my news. I meant to write however, were it never so hurriedly; and here now is a Letter from Jack, which quickens my motion.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> I got a frank this morning at a &#x201C;breakfast&#x201D; where I was, among wits, poets and &#x201C;honourable members&#x201D; of various kinds:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1838-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;at Milnes&#x2019;s with Landor, Rogers, T.

Crabb Robinson, also present, recorded: &#x201C;Carlyle &#x2026; made himself very pleasant indeed. &#x2026; Talleyrand&#x2019;s recent death and the poet Blake were the subjects. Tom Moore had never heard of Blake&#x2014;at least not of his poems&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Henry Crabb Robinson on Books and their Writers</hi>, ed. E. J. Morley [London, <date when="1938-00-00">1938</date>] 2:550). Moore recorded in his Journal: &#x201C;rather a remarkable party, consisting of Savage Landor and Carlyle (neither of whom I had ever seen before), Robinson, Rogers, and Rice. A good deal of conversation between Robinson and Carlyle about German authors, of whom I knew nothing, nor (from what they paraded of them) felt that I had lost much by my ignorance&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore,</hi> ed. Lord John Russell [London, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>] 7:224).</note> so you must accept a few lines dashed off in the most untowardly circumstances (for my nerves are all <foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded abreed</hi></foreign> [shaken to pieces], <pb id="pg-10-83" n="10:83"/>and my time too is limited): you will hear at least, once more, that nothing has gone wrong with us here. Jack, I think, did not mean that I should send you his Letter; but it seems to me but that I should do so, as usual.</p>
<p>He is quite well, the Doctor, and in good heart and hope; but I grieve to say his fickle Dame has changed her plans again, and his coming home is delayed, nay becomes uncertain for this summer altogether! It is a provoking thing to depend on such people; but what can one do when one&#x2019;s bread lies among their feet? Jack, on the whole, I think has decided wisely; and I have no doubt you will think so too, and reconcile yourself to this disappointment, as you always meekly do. I had calculated on seeing the poor Doctor here before many days, and to me too it is a sad disappointment; but after all the chief thing we want is that our poor Doil should be <hi rend="italic">where it is good for him to be;</hi> so we must wait patiently. By Heaven&#x2019;s blessing he will one day be out of the hands of Dames of quality, and able to live independently of them, where he likes and as he likes. In the mean time, it would, I do believe, be highly unwise for him to think of <hi rend="italic">settling</hi> in London at present: Rome is evidently the place for him, where his work lies and his reward lies. Let us as you say always be thankful that it is no worse!&#x2014; If Jack should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get to us this summer, you will see he partly calculates on Jane and me going out to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for the winter. This is not so wild a project as perhaps it looks to you. A winter in Italy might be of real use in several important respects. For one thing the state of Jane&#x2019;s health in a climate like this is by no means comfortable to reflect on: she has no definite disease hitherto, but her weakness, aggravated always by cold weather, is great for these two years past: the Doctors all say that a winter in warm Italy might be of decided benefit. As for me too I have one thing that I long for, and that is <hi rend="italic">to be left resting</hi>. I could rest, I fancy, in any solitary place; I could have rested at Scotsbrig for that matter, but it would not do: Italy, besides being a beautiful resting-country, would offer me various things which I might learn, and be everyway benefitted by. In short, if it turn out that Jack actually do not get home, we are seriously thinking to turn over the project; to get our house &#x201C;let furnished,&#x201D; or in some way disposed of; and see whether we cannot manage it.&#x2014; Now, dear Mother, you have the whole business before you, down to the very foundation of it. Of course there is nothing decided yet, and you will hear of it all again and again, as it clears itself up; and we must all endeavour to do for the best. I will only add that if we determine to go, or indeed whether or not, it shall be stiff times with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> but I will get up to Scotsbrig for <pb id="pg-10-84" n="10:84"/>a week or two, and see what is to be seen! And so be of good cheer, my good kind Mother; and let us fear nothing. Ah me, if I were a little quieted in the nerves, and my bit partner were in better marching order, better times surely are come for us, and one might live more quietly than heretofore! Alick too is going to get lived, poor fellow; God be thanked for it. I say, better days are coming for us all; tho&#x2019; we must all get our <hi rend="italic">schooling</hi> out, and the due quantity of <hi rend="italic">stripes</hi> given, till our lesson be learned.&#x2014; But now to present business.</p>
<p>The Seventh Lecture<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Reformation, Luther, Ulrich von Hutten and Erasmus.</note> was got over, quite tolerably, yesterday. On the whole it goes on beyond expectation, and is what they call &#x201C;very successful.&#x201D; The audience has increased daily, and has I think nearly doubled itself since the first day; and they sit quiet and attentive as mortals could do. Very beautiful women I have, and honourable men. I believe, in spite of all mismanagements (which have been manifold, but shall be avoided on another occasion), the thing will turn out quite handsomely well.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1838-05-15">15 May</date>, TC had written in his Journal: &#x201C;A curious audience, a curious business. It has been all mismanaged; yet it prospers better than I expected once. The <hi rend="italic">conditions</hi> of the thing, ah, the conditions! It is like a man singing thro&#x2019; a fleece of wool. One must submit; one must struggle, and sing even <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, since not otherwise&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:136).</note> You see the criticisms in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, but need not heed <hi rend="italic">them</hi> much, except to consider that they are written by one evidently not friendly, and who therefore says not the best that might be said. It is Hunt that writes them; he, finding me this year a man whom he cannot pat on the back, and say &#x201C;Well done&#x201D; to, is grieved in mind to see it so, a little grieved; and then my Scotch Presbyterian <hi rend="italic">doctrine</hi> grieves him dreadfully, and so he <foreign><hi rend="italic">natters</hi></foreign> [grumbles] and chatters, poor man. His criticisms such as they are cannot but do and have done much good, by making the thing generally <hi rend="italic">known</hi> in an authentic manner (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> by a puffer); and that is always a principal difficulty here.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC commented, <date when="1838-05-15">15 May</date>, &#x201C;Hunt&#x2019;s criticism no longer <hi rend="italic">friendly</hi>, not so in spirit, tho&#x2019; still in letter; a shade of spleen in it. Very natural, flattering even; he finds me grown to be <hi rend="italic">something</hi> now. His whole way of life is at death-variance with mine. In this <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Examiner&#x2019;</hi> he expresses himself afflicted with my eulogy of <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi>, and two days ago he had, &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">multa gemens</hi></foreign> [groaning mightily],&#x2019; to borrow two sovereigns from me!&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:136). In his criticism, <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1838-05-13">13</date> and <date when="1838-05-20">20 May</date>, Hunt had said, &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle described the earliest character of Rome as consisting in a spirit of steady agricultural <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi>, a quality which he considered &#x2018;the germ of all other virtues,&#x2019;&#x201D; and &#x201C;If Mr. Carlyle did not interest us so much in what he does say, we should be inclined to quarrel with him for what he omits.&#x201D; Hunt&#x2019;s reviews of the lectures are repbd. in Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:176&#x2013;96.</note> I understand there are other things regularly in other Newspapers, but I see none of them; indeed, what is the use of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> seeing them? Somebody said the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> had something fresh, or was <pb id="pg-10-85" n="10:85"/>to have, yesterday on the subject; but I never learned whether or not.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray&#x2019;s second notice appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1838-05-22">22 May</date>.</note> If they bring a few more guineas into the coffer, it will be well; but as to their praise (or dispraise if they were so unkind), <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;what&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t&#x201D;?</hi>&#x2014; One thing our Managers<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson and Erasmus Darwin.</note> have determined upon, and acted on last day (yesterday), that of dividing the course into two, and letting people get into it, for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> guinea, at the middle point, namely the sixth lecture.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1838-05-22">22 May</date>, mentioned that the second half of the course was available for half cost, and the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1838-05-12">12 May</date>, had said, &#x201C;Some of our readers may have been frightened by the subjects of the first four discourses, to whom the modern course will present far greater attractions. We recommend them very cordially to attend this second part.&#x201D;</note> A considerable increase was accordingly visible yesterday. Daily, numbers of persons are applying to get in for a single lecture (many people of business cannot manage more); but this is a thing [letter breaks off here; other page or pages missing]</p>

<salute>O <hi rend="italic">Cousin</hi>, Gracious and benign!</salute>
<p>Beautiful is it to see thy tender years bearing such blossoms of tolerance! for tolerance is not in general the virtue of youth; but only of mature or even old age,&#x2014;experienced age, which after long and sore &#x2018;kicking against the pricks,&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 9:5, 26:14,</note> has learned for itself what it would not take on heresay, that the world we live in is, of necessity, and has been, and ever will be an erring and conditional world; that in short all men, women, and children, beginning with ourselves are shockingly imperfect, so that there is none justified in saying with self-complacency &#x2018;black is the eye&#x2019; of another. Indeed I should have felt it hard to have been reproached by <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for not writing&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">You</hi>, who have health, and no cares, cannot at all est<supplied>[i]</supplied>mate the effort <hi rend="italic">I</hi> make, in doing <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> that can be let alone without immediate detriment to the State or the Individual. I have had so much to bear for a long long time back from the derangement of my <hi rend="italic">Interior</hi>, that when a day of betterness does arrive, I am tempted instead of employing it in writing letters or in doing <hi rend="italic">duties</hi> of whatever sort, to make a sort of child&#x2019;s play day of it&#x2014;and then when my head is aching or my cough <pb id="pg-10-86" n="10:86"/>troublesome&#x2014;O Helen dear; may you never know by experience how difficult it is in such circumstances, to write a letter all about nothing, even to a sweet-faced well-beloved Cousin!</p>
<p>But it were a shame not to give you some news of me when you ask it so kindly&#x2014; By the way it is precisely a fortnight past on Friday since I received your letter, and it is good two fortnights since Mr Gibson mentioned Walter Macgregor;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cousin of the Welsh family in Liverpool.

I state this for my own justification in case of the letter having been detained; as you mentioned it was to go by Walter. <hi rend="italic">Of course</hi> it bore no date; so that I could not judge by simple arithmetical computation how long it had been in coming to hand. We were just then in the first ferment of our Lectures, which are still going on, and keeping up an extra degree of tumult within and without us.

<salute>Dear Mrs Child,</salute>
<p>You judged rightly that no man could be other than gratified with such a Letter and Gift as yours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With her letter of <date when="1838-04-07">7 April</date> Mrs. Child had sent her novel <hi rend="italic">Philothea</hi> (Boston, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>).</note> It is always uncertain with me whether praise, never so sincere, does one good, or does not do one great mischief; but the pleasure of it admits of no doubt. Nay after all one must take the <hi rend="italic">mixture</hi> of praise and dispraise such as this world confusedly offers, and make the best of it; and Nature herself gives us this rule: Love those that love thee, rejoice when any one loves thee, <pb id="pg-10-88" n="10:88"/>and count that sure gain, were there no other! That such&#x2014;brave <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fornarina</hi></foreign> [baker&#x2019;s wife]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Child had written: <hi rend="italic">Philothea&#x2019;s</hi> &#x201C;literary demerits I beg you to excuse, in consideration that I am an American baker&#x2019;s daughter (a sound less romantic than <foreign>Fornarina</foreign>, both to English and republican ears) and quite unskilled both in Greek and Latin.&#x201D; For Byron&#x2019;s description of his mistress Margarita Cogni, &#x201C;La Fornarina,&#x201D; see T. Moore, ed., <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</hi> (London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) 2:183&#x2013;89.</note> put my poor Book under her pillow, far off over the water;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had said of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>: &#x201C;Last summer, when I was alone in a remote country-town, struggling with worldly discouragements, craving sympathy and spiritual food, which none had to bestow&#x2014;a friend sent me your Sartor Resartus; which thenceforth was to my soul as sunshine, flowers, and the pure, strengthening breeze. I placed it nightly under my pillow, that with the morning light I might refresh myself from its pages. In my thoughts I often said, &#x201C;That Carlyle and I shall surely know each other in the spiritual world; for the hills and waters that separate us are merely material.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> this is a thing I will decidedly be proud of; a sweet thing, to temper other things with that are bitter,&#x2014;that are sent lest we get <hi rend="italic">too</hi> proud.</p>
<p>Of your three faults to the F. Revolution I find the two last abundantly true; as a hundred others are, which you do not name but might.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;If you are curious to know the most common objections to your French Revolution in this country, I will mention the two most prominent. First, that you do not speak with sufficient reverence for Lafayette;&#x2014;a criticism which will appear to you natural, knowing our national and individual friendship for that honest man. The <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> you record of him praise him far more than your <hi rend="italic">words</hi>. Secondly, it is said you do not tell us of anything performed by Mirabeau, which justifies your very high estimate of him; and this I felt to be true. The free outbreathings of the German soul seem artificial to those, who, trained in the midst of formulas, mistake them for nature; hence, many complain that your style is full of German <hi rend="italic">affectation</hi>&#x2014;that they cannot understand you, &#x26;c; but even these generally admit that your vivid, pictorial style will spoil all other history for us.&#x201D; Mrs. Child also expressed her admiration: &#x201C;I cannot express to you with what delight I have read that unrhymed, unmeasured <hi rend="italic">poem</hi>, called the French Revolution. &#x2026; Assuredly, that French Revolution is a glorious work of art, &#x2018;cast silently into everlasting time.&#x2019; Like those productions of genius, which are the property of universal man, it will be continually reproduced in after ages, weaving itself, like threads of gold into the fabric of other men&#x2019;s thoughts.&#x201D;</note> The one beauty of it to me is that I did with considerable honesty endeavour to make the best I could of it, and that now by God&#x2019;s great blessing I am rid of it, and never more in this world or the next shall it, like a Nessus&#x2019; Shirt, lie burning the life out of me, but go forth and take its own lot, and live or die as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> can. And so good speed to it <hi rend="italic">whithersoever</hi> bound!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Ah me, if I had wings or a wishing-carpet, I would go to many places, and surely to American England among the rest!

<salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
<p>I believe we reckon it a very questionable thing in this country to publish anything about our lives. But I cannot think <supplied>[of]</supplied> altogether refusing such a request as yours.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1838-06-11">11 June</date>, K&#xfc;nzel had asked TC for his help in composing &#x201C;a short but correct biographical sketch for a new German Cyclopaedia edited by F. A. Br&#xF6;ckhaus Esq. at Leipzig as a sequel to the renown<supplied>[e]</supplied>d &#x2018;Conversations-Lexicon&#x2019; which will contain the most striking features of our days in literature, sciences, arts, politics, history etc. from <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> till <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>.&#x201D; He was referring to Brockhaus&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Conversations Lexicon der Gegenwart</hi>, 5 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>), a supp. to the 8th edn. of <hi rend="italic">Conversations Lexicon</hi> (Leipzig, 1833&#x2013;37). K&#xfc;nzel contributed to the first three vols. He called <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> &#x201C;a comic novel&#x201D; that &#x201C;cannot quite be viewed as altogether successful&#x201D; (1:1191). In his article on TC, 1:723&#x2013;24, he said that &#x201C;Carlyle stands alone among living British critics&#x201D; (1:724).</note> The Notes of that piece of paper are correct, and if an article is to be written on the subject, it had better be correct than otherwise. I do not augur well of the new translation of Faust: indeed if I mistake not, the very first word is an error.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >K&#xfc;nzel had asked TC&#x2019;s opinion of a new trans., probably an anonymous trans., 2 vols., (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), which trans. pt. 2 for the first time, and of which fifty copies were printed for limited circulation.

<p>You would see by the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> how we were going on; struggling along, not without some success towards the conclusion of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Hunt&#x2019;s reviews in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380510-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-05-10">10 May</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380522-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-05-22">22 May</date></ref>.</note> The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> of this week ought to reach you too, almost without delay: I sent it forward to Jenny with your address &#x201C;Scotsbrig&#x201D; on it; meaning that she should see also how it went with me, and then send the thing on to you as usual: I have not learned for certain that she is returned home yet, but suppose it to be so, and that she is probably destitute of news about me. The Lectures, tho&#x2019; at first ill arranged, went on better and better, and grew at last, or threatened to grow, quite a flaming affair. I had people &#x201C;<foreign>greeting</foreign>&#x201D; [weeping] yesterday &#x26;c! I was quite as well pleased that we <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> there, and did not make <pb id="pg-10-94" n="10:94"/>any farther racket about it: I have too good evidence (in poor Edward Irving&#x2019;s case) what a <hi rend="italic">racket</hi> comes to at last; and want, for my share, to have nothing at all to do with such things. What the money amount will be I do not yet know for a day or two: but I ought to tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that the success of the thing, taking all sides of it together, seems to have been very considerable; far greater than I at all expected: and so are we not well thro&#x2019; it? My audience was supposed to be &#x201C;the best, for rank, beauty and intelligence, ever collected in London&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Thackeray&#x2019;s review, <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380501-TCJWC-JCA-01"><sic>TC and JWC</sic><corr>TCJWC</corr> to JCA, <date when="1838-05-01">1 May</date></ref>.</note> I had <foreign>bonny braw</foreign> [finely dressed] Dames, Ladies this and Ladies that,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I durst not look at them, lest they should put me out. I had old men of four score; men middle-aged with fine steel-grey heads; young men of the Universities, of the Law professions: all sitting quite mum there, and the Annandale voice <foreign><hi rend="italic">gollying</hi></foreign> [roaring] at them; very strange to consider.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the comments of George Ticknor on <date when="1838-06-01">1 June</date>: &#x201C;He is rather a small, spare, ugly Scotchman, with a strong accent which I should think he took no pains to mitigate. His manners are plain and simple, but not polished, and his conversation much of the same sort. &#x2026; Today he spoke&#x2014;as I think he commonly does&#x2014;without notes, and therefore as nearly <foreign>extempore</foreign> as a man can who prepares himself carefully, as it was plain he had done. &#x2026; He was impressive, I think, though such lecturing could not well be very popular; and in some parts, if he were not poetical, he was picturesque. He was nowhere obscure, nor were his sentences artificially constructed, though some of them, no doubt, savoured of his peculiar manner&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life &#x2026; of George Ticknor</hi> [Boston, <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>] 2:180&#x2013;81).</note> Again and again I say we should be thankful;&#x2014;and, above all things, shut our lips together again, and try to be quiet a little. They proposed giving me &#x201C;a dinner,&#x201D; some of them; but I declined it: &#x201C;Literary Institutions&#x201D; more than one express desire that I would lecture for <hi rend="italic">them</hi>; but this also (their wages being small and their Lecturers generally despicable) I decline. This morning I have written off a handsome refusal to the &#x201C;City of London Literary Institution,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the City of London Literary and Scientific Institution, 165 Aldersgate St., begun <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>.</note> leaving the door open however, should it at any time become <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> with me to enter. And so <hi rend="italic">this</hi> matter is over: good luck to it!</p>
<p>As to my health it did not suffer so much as I had reason to dread: I was awaking at 3 in the morning &#x26;c when the thing began; but afterwards I got to sleep till 7 and even 8, and did not suffer nearly so much. I am no doubt shaken and stirred up considerably into a kind of &#x201C;raised [inflamed]&#x201D; state, which I like very ill; but in few days I shall get still enough again, and probably even too still.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written in his Journal, <date when="1838-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;For me, the cry of my soul is, For the love of God, let me alone! Or rather, it has ceased to be a <hi rend="italic">cry</hi>, and sunk down into a voiceless prayer, which knows it will not be granted. Hardly a day has passed since I returned hither in Autumn last, in which I have not stormfully resolved to myself that I would go out of this dusty hubbub, should I even walk off with the staff in my hand, and no loadstar whatever. My wife herself seemingly sinking into weaker and weaker health, points out to me always that I cannot go; that I am tied here, seemingly as if to be tortured to death&#x2014;so in my wild mood I interpret it! <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> on such subjects; O how infinitely preferable is silence! Perhaps too my wife is right; indeed, I myself feel dimly that I have little to look for else than here. Be still, thou wild weak heart, convulsively bursting up against the bars. Silence alone can guide one. Suffer, suffer, if it be necessary <hi rend="italic">so</hi> to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi>.&#x2014; Last night, weary and worn out with dull blockheadism, chagrin (next to no sleep the night before), I sat down in St. James Park; and thought of these things, looking at the beautiful summer moon; and really quieted myself, became peacable and submissive, for the time. For the time:&#x2014;and afterwards, alas, I was provoked, and in my weak state said foolish words, and went sorrowful to bed! I am a feeble fool: fool, wilt thou never be wise?&#x2014;&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:137&#x2013;38).</note> One must <pb id="pg-10-95" n="10:95"/>work; either with long moderate pain, or else with short great pain: the short way is the best according to my notion.</p>
<p>Jane has been weakly all this while; yet has contrived to go every day to the Lecture, and get into almost as great a <foreign><hi rend="italic">tirryvee</hi></foreign> [nervous state] with it as myself. She is getting decidedly a little stronger now, I hope, as the weather grows warmer; she even proposed to go out to dinner along with me tomorrow night, but is not <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> yet. It is to these &#x2018;Marshalls,&#x2019; Yorkshire people, of enormous wealth, very good people, of whom I think I told you last time.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in the missing part of <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380522-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-05-22">22 May</date></ref>. TC had commented on a dinner then in his Journal, <date when="1838-05-31">31 May</date>: &#x201C;Dinner (that same day if I remember, <date when="1838-05-22">22</date><hi rend="italic">nd</hi> ult.) at Marshall&#x2019;s Grosvenor Street; the wealthiest of houses, the people hearers of mine. More sumptuous than I ever elsewhere saw; Empson, the Spring Rices there; Miss especially, very brilliant, exciting;&#x2014;such happiness is purchased too dear&#x2014;&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:138). John Marshall (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), of Headingley, near Leeds, and Hallsteads, Cumberland; M.P. for Yorkshire, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>; m. Jane Pollard (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) in <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>. His wealth came from improved mechanization of flax spinning in the Marshall factories at Leeds and Shrewsbury. Their large new Temple Mill, Leeds, was being planned <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>, and opened in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; it appeared as Mr. Trafford&#x2019;s Mill in Disraeli&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sybil</hi> (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>). TC presumably learned what a Captain of Industry or Millocrat was like from Marshall. TC describes him, in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 120&#x2013;22, 362, as the &#x201C;most or really almost only interesting&#x201D; member of the large family he founded, and mentions his London household where TC met Wordsworth &#x201C;oftenest&#x201D; in the early <date>1840</date>s, visits paid to it by himself and JWC, his own short visits to Hallsteads and Headingley, and Marshall&#x2019;s gift of the &#x201C;first <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> I had in London.&#x201D; The Marshalls had five sons and six surviving daughters, of whom Henry Cowper Marshall (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), the fourth son, m. Catherine Spring Rice (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>) in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. For further intermarrying with the Spring Rice family in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380215-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-02-15">15 Feb.</date></ref> TC was to become friendly with James Garth (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>) and William (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), the third and eldest sons. The father, though quiet in manner (as TC noted in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>), had shown extraordinary enterprise and entrepreneurial skill. His sons were brought up to be more gentlemen than factory-masters, and by <date when="1886-00-00">1886</date> the firm declined into bankruptcy. See also W. G. Rimmer, <hi rend="italic">Marshall of Leeds, Flax-Spinners, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date></hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1960-00-00">1960</date>). Though both Froude and Norton omit short passages in their edns. of the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, between them they give almost a complete text of TC&#x2019;s account of the Marshalls (MS: NLS 533).</note> Dinners do me always mischief, and I avoid them wherever possible. But this season of the year is all on a gallop here in London with dinners and meetings and <pb id="pg-10-96" n="10:96"/>business and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gilravish</hi></foreign> [commotion] of all kinds; and one cannot always refuse without suffering in another way. My last dinner (yesterday gone a week) was at the Spring-Rice&#x2019;s house, the Chancellor of the Exchequer no less, whose family, <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> [fine] daughters and sons, are great hearers of mine.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Tuesday, <date when="1838-06-04">4 June</date>. Spring Rice had three daughters and five sons. See also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380215-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-02-15">15 Feb.</date></ref></note> It was a splendid meeting; wherein I felt dull and sick: dinner-time 8 o&#x2019;clock, and I had been in the <hi rend="italic">medicinal</hi> way the day before! It is sad work.</p>
<p>What I am to do now? This is altogether uncertain yet. For one thing, I have made a kind of engagement here to <hi rend="italic">print</hi> my Articles &#x26;c, and that will detain me a few weeks at any rate. I could get no money for the Books; indeed I instantly tired of seeking; and Fraser, who I suspect had <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> of my being on the search, and of what ill speed I had, Fraser I say <hi rend="italic">drew up</hi> all of a sudden, and was quite determined that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would go either on the &#x201C;half-profits&#x201D; system or not at all. Whereupon I said to myself, &#x201C;Not thou, O Fraser, not thou but another; <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other is preferable to thee!&#x201D; So I walked over, and made a half-profits bargain with &#x201C;Saunders and Otley,&#x201D; a Bookselling house of far better character than Fraser&#x2019;s, and who at any rate are useful to me in the Lecturing business.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This arrangement was recent, as in his Journal, <date when="1838-05-31">31 May</date>, TC was still undecided: &#x201C;Speculation, fast coming towards act, of printing those &#x2018;Articles&#x2019; of mine <hi rend="italic">without</hi> money. Saunders and Otley or Fraser? that is the question; which will decide itself one of these days.&#x201D;</note> <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck</hi> accordingly is actually at press; and I can hope to give my Mother an English copy of him in regular shape before long. Poor fellow, he has had a sore struggle to get out here, some seven years or more; but having started up in Yankeeland, they were forced to let him out here; he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not keep down. Good luck to him we will say;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps he is no great shakes after all, poor fellow! How the Yankees are going on with printing &#x26;c &#x26;c you will see by these flaming epistles, which I send along with this.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the recent letters from Emerson, <date when="1838-05-10">10 May</date>, and Mrs. Child, <date when="1838-04-07">7 April</date>.</note> The printing of these books, I calculate, will be useful to me here as a Lecturer; that is my view in it, even should I get no money otherwise, and nothing but trouble, by them. Nay I have not yet bargained any farther than as to <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k with these Booksellers here; and perhaps shall <hi rend="italic">go</hi> no farther, but take some different scheme with it.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saunders &#x26; Otley, 50 Conduit St., pbd. 500 copies of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), for the first time with the &#x201C;Testimonies of Authors,&#x201D; They required a guaranteed subscription of 300, which Harriet Martineau helped to collect. Milnes was one of the subscribers; see Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:200. Saunders &#x26; Otley did not, however, publish the <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Essays;</hi> see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380615-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-97" n="10:97"/>I have had two Newspapers from Jack; the last of them only two days ago, and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was dated Florence; two strokes as usual.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x201C;all&#x2019;s well.&#x201D;</note> From which I can only gather that he is well, and is journeying northwards, having quitted Rome for the summer at any rate. One of the places he spoke of is the North of Italy, a beautiful Lake-country there;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Como, mentioned in John&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1838-03-27">27 March.</date></note> I fancy they are proceeding thitherward, or rather perhaps are there already after some smooth pleasant journey of a week or so. To England I fear there is small chance of their coming! No; they will not come the way one wants them; he that has his bread to win must wait on those that have it to give him. Poor Jack seemed very quiet; but no doubt he is <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> as we all are. It is to me a very great disappointment: I thought to have had the poor fellow here even now, and comforted myself with him in the time of rest.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1838-05-31">31 May</date>, TC had written: &#x201C;I had counted on the true Brother to commune with, a little; to break the utter solitude of heart in which I painfully live here. Lonelier probably is no man&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:137).</note> Let us not lament; let us be right thankful to know that he is well anywhere. By God&#x2019;s blessing the time for meeting will come; and we shall see the poor Doctor whole and well again, we will humbly hope, in due season.&#x2014; As for us, and our going to Italy to see <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, that is all as vague and uncertain as ever; hanging in the wind altogether till several things be settled; till, at any rate, we have heard from <hi rend="italic">him</hi> more specially. I do not know rightly <hi rend="italic">when</hi> a Letter may be expected; he will likely not write till my letter reach him, and it may require time, having to follow on journeys: whenever the Italian Letter does come, of course you will see it or hear of it forthwith.&#x2014; I will write no more today dear Mother; but leave this little scrap for tomorrow before sealing. All good be with you, and soft summer winds in quiet Scotsbrig yonder! Jane is gone out. Good day, dear Mother!&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi>.&#x2014; <salute>Dear Mother,</salute> I have scribbled a Note for Alick, and will add a word here before sealing up. Robert Calvert<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle&#x2019;s brother-in-law; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380510-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-05-10">10 May</date></ref>.</note> came, one day, about three weeks ago, just when I was going out to lecture; we could only appoint some other day, for he could not return that day to dinner: he came a day or two after, and spent the afternoon with us;&#x2014;a sensible well-bred, robust young man: we were glad to understand he had outlooks of employment here. He confessed that the Letter he brought in Jamie&#x2019;s name was at bottom written by Alick,&#x2014;ah thou, James of Scotsbrig! Tell Isabella<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Calvert Carlyle, James&#x2019;s wife.</note> that the Cheese lies, in its lead <pb id="pg-10-98" n="10:98"/>wrappages, waiting some great occasion: her health will require to be drunk then.&#x2014; Is it I that am to write to Jean at Dumfries; or is it not she to me? You may put that question to her, when you send our news. Poor Mary, I hope you go often down to see her: it would give me true satisfaction to know her honest James and her in some <foreign>canny</foreign> country place; but there is no hope of that just now, they must hold on steadfastly as they are doing, for a season yet. And you, dear Mother, when are you to write; about yourself and all your doings and concerns? I hope Alick has arranged these Houses for you on a better footing than they stood on, that you will be plagued no more about rents in that way.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s houses in Ecclefechan, where Alick now lived and worked.</note> Above all, how is your health, in these inclement months? It has been an unkindly spring again, and much sickness; very little summer weather even here as yet. With you I consider, it must be worse as to temperature. Yet surely summer <hi rend="italic">is</hi> coming. I have a good many Books and readable rubbish here for you; but do not yet see the best way of sending them. In due season they will come;&#x2014;perhaps I too, who knows! <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother. Jane joins me in affectionate wishes to you, and to all.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your card and Emerson&#x2019;s Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found; written in <date when="1838-03-00">March</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380615-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> lay waiting for me yesterday when I got back to my little room. I had not understood till then that it was New England friends, that it was other than &#x201C;two foreign gentlemen, <pb id="pg-10-99" n="10:99"/>Germans most probably&#x201D; who wanted to see me, and hear me. To hear me they were welcome; but I could see no one at that time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sumner had heard TC lecture, as he noted in a letter to George Hillard, <date when="1838-06-14">14 June</date>: &#x201C;I heard Carlyle lecture the other day; he seemed like an inspired boy; truth and thoughts that made one move on the benches came from his apparently unconscious mind, couched in the most grotesque style, and yet condensed to a degree to intensity. &#x2026; He is the Zerah Colburn of thought; childlike in manner and feeling, and yet reaching by intuition points and extremes of ratiocination which others would not so well accomplish after days of labor, if indeed they ever could&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memoir and Letters</hi> 1:318&#x2013;19). Zerah Colburn (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>), mathematical prodigy.</note> I hope you, as my friend&#x2019;s friend, understood it all, and excused it.</p>
<p>Perhaps now, as it has gone so, you will come down and see us here.

<p>Allow me to thank you in words, as in silence I very sincerely do, for the gift you have sent me, and the kind sentiments accompanying it. The Message, in all its items, Emerson&#x2019;s and yours, arrived safely <pb id="pg-10-100" n="10:100"/>here some three weeks ago.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bancroft, collector of customs in Boston, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>, had helped Emerson send twelve copies of his <hi rend="italic">Oration;</hi> see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 178. He had apparently enclosed vol. 2 of his <hi rend="italic">History of the United States</hi> and possibly also the 2d edn. of vol. 1, both pbd. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>.</note> I have read your Book with attention, I may say, with interest and profit, as an earnest faithful Book on a subject about which I had much curiosity and but little knowledge. You are bound to persist; and bring the business down, to the exit of Washington, at any rate.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bancroft ended vol. 10 at <date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>, not covering &#x201C;the exit of Washington.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>My praises of your Book might honestly be manifold. I do find several <hi rend="italic">things</hi> delineated and visibly set before me in form and colour: glimpses of the old primeval Forest, in its hot dark strength and tangled savagery and putrescence; Virginia Planters with their tobacco-pouches, galloping amid the &#x2018;buckskin <foreign>kye</foreign>&#x2019; (as our Burns has it)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Epistle to J. R.&#x201D; 65.</note> in the glades of the wild wood; Puritans, stern of visage, warm and sound of heart,&#x2014;all this and much of the like is ocularly there. I reckon it a high praise to say that you have more than once, in such passages, reminded me of M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft</hi>, one of our bravest Books, which at the same time you probably never read.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since Bancroft had studied in Germany and France, <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821-00-00">21</date>, he might well have read Johannes von M&#xfc;ller, <hi rend="italic">Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft</hi>, 5 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>).</note></p>
<p>And then as to my censures, for there are censures everywhere, and all things have light <hi rend="italic">and</hi> shadow,&#x2014;I should say that your didactic theoretic matter gratified me generally much less; that, in a word, you were too didactic, went too much into the origins of things generally known, into the praise of things only partially praisable, only slightly important: on the whole, that here is a man who <hi rend="italic">has an eye</hi>, and that he ought to fling down his <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi> and look with that!&#x2014; Forgive my plainness of speech; did I think less of you than I do, I had omitted this <hi rend="italic">shady</hi> side of the business, and left only light.</p>
<p>But in any case, many thanks, my dear Sir; and right good speed in your work, and in all works you so faithfully lay your strength to. <closer><salute>I beg a continuance of your good-will; and am always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>There is a bundle of Letters going off to my Mother; in which, tho&#x2019; doubtless you will all share in them, I may as well insert specially a single line for you. Our Lectures are over, as you will learn abundantly from our Mother; over, and well over: I suppose they will yield us some scrap of &#x201C;private capital,&#x201D; on which we may be able by dint of thrift to struggle on again till the season come round, next year, if we live to see it. A very great blessing to one who like me has not for many years, you may say never at all, seen any fixed prospect of livelihood before him, but been at all times baited and haunted by the haggard fear of actual destitution! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than <foreign>nae bield</foreign></hi> [shelter],&#x201D; the Proverb says: we will be thankful for these Lectures, for these changes of luck, that have yielded us even this little deliverance: &#x201C;these little things are great to little man.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goldsmith, <hi rend="italic">The Traveller</hi> 42; see also <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210716-TC-JBW-01"><sic>1:368</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1821-07-16">16 July 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> Our Lecture-room this year was in a baddish part of the town; but it was a real Lecture-room adapted for a man speaking in, not a rascally fashionble shew-room (like last year&#x2019;s) adapted for fiddlers fire eaters and playactors: I got my &#x201C;tinkler jaw [loud, scolding tongue]&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200419-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:240</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-04-19">19 April 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">loosed</hi> considerably better in it, and told the people much more of my mind. They welcomed it too, as handsomely as people could: there is fair play for a man here, if he can get <hi rend="italic">play</hi> at all; people ask not, who or what he is, so much as simply, whether he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> say or do anything that has any substance in it for them.&#x2014; Since I wrote my Mother&#x2019;s sheet, the first Proof of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> has actually come to hand and been corrected: it will make a nice enough Book, which I hope to shew you soon. &#x201C;I am glad he is going to get published, poor beast,&#x201D; said Jane. And so am I too, &#x201C;poor beast&#x201D;: he has had a sore fight for it, these seven years and more, since you and I drove down to Glencaple that <date when="1831-08-00">August</date> morning<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, in an attempt to get <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> pbd. in London; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310806-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:312</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 63.</note> (and lost the beer-barrel from behind us); so many years struggling to get his head above ground, up out of the mire;&#x2014;almost like the Author of him, we may say! And now he is actually getting up; and will breathe, and live as long as is appointed him; a day, or a year and day, that is of no moment; simply <hi rend="italic">as long as it is given him</hi>, which is just the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> longness.</p>
<p>I cannot tell you yet what I am going to do, or when or how I <pb id="pg-10-102" n="10:102"/>shall get to Annandale (if possible); but it will clear itself up before long, and then you shall soon hear. I am and shall be in a <hi rend="italic">heated</hi> sort of state, for some while; a state I do nowise like; but it will not last: I shall get <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> again with the smallest possible delay. I hear still that there are people meaning to &#x201C;give me a dinner,&#x201D; I heard so again yesterday: but I will not have it, unless the contrary be impossible; a &#x201C;dinner&#x201D; will do little for me, except fret my poor nerves: but really the friends here that I have are worthy of all gratitude from me. My health is not bad, were I rested again; indeed I think I am considerably better in body and mind than I was this time last year; but I am still far from rested, and want quiet! quiet!&#x2014; Jane seems to grow distinctly a little better as the summer gets in, thro&#x2019; all these fierce east-winds: she is a little <hi rend="italic">under</hi> par today, and cannot go out with me to the place we were to dine at. Had Jack got home about this time, and carried us off with him &#x201C;O&#x2019;er the Border and away,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;O Saw ye Bonie Leslie&#x201D; 2.</note> how blithe had it been for us all! But that was not the way of it, I fear; we must be content with another way of it.</p>
<p>I supped on one of the Ecclefechan eggs last night; fresh as wine; the greater part of them are now gone for breakfast: a large indentation too has been made in the bacon-ham, which is one of the best of its kind. The beef we durst not cut upon so freely; finding it <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, savoury to the taste and fierce on the weak stomach, Jane gave it away to Mrs Sterling to whom it was jolly acknowledgement of many many favours we have had from that house. They boil it, rasp it down into powder, eat it with joviality to breakfast,&#x2014;happy are <hi rend="italic">they</hi> in their stomachic department. Many thanks to poor <hi rend="italic">Dillick;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s nickname.</note> God be thanked that he too is to be able to live; that after a ten-years battle, and work without wages, is now to work <hi rend="italic">with</hi> wages of some sort, and have a little composure in his lot!&#x2014; Remember us both, in all affection, to Jenny and the <foreign>Bairns</foreign>. <closer><salute>Good be with you, dear Brother, and with yours!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Our correspondence has fallen into a ravelled state; which would doubtless clear itself could I afford to wait for your next Letter, probably <pb id="pg-10-103" n="10:103"/>tumbling over the Atlantic brine about this very moment: but I cannot afford to wait; I must write straightway. Your answer to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> will bring matters round again. I have had two irregular Notes of your writing, or perhaps three; two dated <hi rend="italic"><date when="1838-03-00">March</date></hi>, one by Mr Bancroft&#x2019;s Parcel, bringing Twelve <hi rend="italic">Orations</hi> withal;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380613-TC-GBA-01">TC to <sic>GB</sic><corr>GBA</corr>, <date when="1838-06-13">13 June</date></ref>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371208-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:361</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1838-06-13">13 June 1838</date></corr></ref> for the <hi rend="italic">Oration</hi>.</note> then some ten days later, just in this very time, another Note by Mr Sumner, whom I have not yet succeeded in seeing, tho&#x2019; I have attempted it, and hope soon to do it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-CSU-01">TC to <sic>CS</sic><corr>CSU</corr>, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date></ref>.</note> The Letter he forwarded me from Paris was acknowledged already, I think.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1837-11-02">2 Nov. 1837</date>, acknowledged in <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380316-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-03-16">16 March</date></ref>.</note> And now if the Atlantic will but float me in safe that other promised Letter!</p>
<p>I got your American <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> a good while ago. It seems to me a very pretty Book indeed, wonderfully so for the money; neither does it seem what we can call <hi rend="italic">incorrectly</hi> printed so far as I have seen; compared with the last <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> it is correctness itself. Many thanks to you, my Friend, and much good may it do us all! Should there be any more reprinting, I will request you to rectify at least the three following errors, copied out of the English text indeed; nay mark them in your own New English Copy, whether there be reprinting or not: Vol. I. p. 81 last paragraph, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> September <hi rend="italic">read</hi> August; Vol. II. p. 344, first line, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> book of prayer <hi rend="italic">read</hi> look of prayer; p. 357, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> blank <hi rend="italic">read</hi> black (2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> paragraph, &#x201C;all black&#x201D;).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 2:84; 4:193; and 4:206.</note> And so <foreign><hi rend="italic">basta</hi></foreign>. And let us be well content about this F.R. on both sides of the water, yours as well as mine.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Too many cooks!&#x201D; the Proverb says: it is pity if this new apparition of a Mr Loring should spoil the broth.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Loring, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref></note> But I calculate you will adjust it well and smoothly between you, some way or other. How you shall adjust it, or have adjusted it, is what I am practically anxious to learn. For you are to understand that our English Edition has come to depend partly on yours. After long higgling with the foolish Fraser, I have quitted him, quite quietly, and given &#x201C;Saunders and Otley, Conduit Street,&#x201D; the privilege of printing a small edition of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> (500 copies), with a prospect of the &#x201C;Miscellaneous writings&#x201D; soon following.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saunders &#x26; Otley advertised &#x201C;T. Carlyle&#x2019;s Miscellaneous Works in Four Volumes&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>. But in fact Fraser did publish the 1st English edn. of <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381115-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-11-15">15 Nov.</date></ref></note> Saunders and Otley are at least more reputable persons, they are useful to me also in the business of Lecturing. <hi rend="italic">Teufels</hi>k is at Press, to be out very soon; I will send you a correct copy, the <pb id="pg-10-104" n="10:104"/>only one in America I fancy. The enterprise here too is on the &#x201C;half-profits&#x201D; plan, which I compute generally to mean equal partition of the oyster-<hi rend="italic">shells</hi>, and a net result of <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the division of profits, &#xa3;500, on <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Essays</hi>, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>: &#xa3;261 to Fraser, &#xa3;239 to TC.</note> But the thing will be economically useful to me otherwise; as a publication of the &#x201C;Miscellaneous&#x201D; also would be; which latter however I confess myself extremely unwilling to undertake the trouble of for <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. To me they are grown or fast growing <hi rend="italic">obsolete</hi>, these Miscellanies, for most part; if money lie not in them, what does lie for me? Now it strikes me you will infallibly edit these things at least as well as I, and are doing it at any rate;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had told TC in his letter of <date when="1838-05-10">10 May</date> that Henry Swasey McKean (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380925-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref>) had volunteered to correct the proofs and that he had &#x201C;your <foreign>Errata</foreign>,&#x201D; presumably the &#x201C;correct List of all my fugitive Papers&#x201D; that TC had sent to Loring; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380316-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-03-16">16 March</date></ref>. The <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Essays</hi> were also ed. by Charles Stearns Wheeler, after McKean had left Cambridge; see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 191. For TC&#x2019;s response to this edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, vols. 1 and 2, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381202-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-12-02">2 Dec.</date></ref></note> your printing too would, seem to be cheaper than ours: I said to Saunders and Otley, Why not have 200 or 300 of this American Edition struck off with &#x201C;London: Saunders &#x26; Otley Conduit Street&#x201D; on the title-page,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This is what Fraser did for his <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> edn.</note> and sent over hither in sheets at what price they have cost my friends yonder? Saunders of course threw cold water on this project, but was obliged to admit that there would be some profit in it, and that for me it would be far easier. The grand profit for me is that people would understand better what I mean, and come better about me if I lectured again, which seems the only way of getting any wages at all for me here at present. Pray meditate my project if it be not already too late, hear what your Booksellers say about it; and understand that I will not in any case set to printing till I hear from you in answer to this.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson replied, <date when="1838-08-06">6 Aug.</date>, that &#x201C;our two first volumes of the Miscellanies are published. &#x2026; The edition consists of 1000 copies. Of these 500 are bound, 500 remain in sheets. The title pages, of course, are all printed alike; but the publishers assure me, that new title pages can be struck off at a trifling expense, with the imprint of Saunders &#x26; Otley. &#x2026; The retail price is $2.50 a copy; &#x26; the author&#x2019;s profit $1.00; &#x26; the bookseller&#x2019;s, 35 cents, per copy, according to my understanding of the written contract&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 190). In his letter of <date when="1838-07-30">30 July</date>, Emerson reported that James Munroe, publisher of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Essays</hi>, had sold 250 copies.</note></p>
<p>How my sheet is filling, with dull talk about mere economics! I must still add that the <hi rend="italic">Lecturing</hi> I talked of, last time, is verily over now; and well over. The superfine people listened to the rough utterance with patience, with favour, increasing to the last. I sent you a Newspaper once, to indicate that it was in progress. I know not yet <pb id="pg-10-105" n="10:105"/>what the money result is; but I suppose it will enable us to exist here thriftily another year; not without hope of at worst doing the like again when the time comes. It is a great novelty in my lot; felt as a very considerable blessing; and really it has arrived, if it have arrived, in <hi rend="italic">due</hi> time, for I had begun to get quite impatient of the other method. Poverty and youth may do; Poverty and Age go badly together.&#x2014; For the rest, I feel fretted to fiddlestrings; my head and heart all heated, sick,&#x2014;ah me! The question as ever is: Rest. But then where? My Brother invites us to come to Rome for the winter; my poor sick Wife might perhaps profit by it; as for me, Natty Leatherstocking&#x2019;s Lodge in the Western Wood,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Fenimore Cooper&#x2019;s hero, Natty Bumppo, of the &#x201C;Leatherstocking&#x201D; novels, <hi rend="italic">The Pioneers</hi> (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>), <hi rend="italic">Last of the Mohicans</hi> (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), and <hi rend="italic">The Prairie</hi> (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>). Emerson had described his own home in great detail in his letter of <date when="1838-05-10">10 May</date>, in pressing TC to visit (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 184&#x2013;85).</note> I think, were welcomer still. I have a great mind too to run off and see my Mother, by the new railways&#x2014; What we shall do, whether not stay quietly here, must remain uncertain for a week or two. Write you always hither, till you hear otherwise.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Orations</hi> were right welcome; my <hi rend="italic">Madeira</hi> one, returned thence with Sterling, was circulating over the West of England. Sterling and Harriet stretched out the right hand with wreathed smiles.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;L&#x2019;Allegro&#x201D; 28. Harriet is Harriet Martineau.</note> I have read, a second or third time. Robert Southey has got a copy, for his own behoof and that of <hi rend="italic">Lake</hi>land: if he keep his word as to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, he may do as much for you or more. Copies are at Cambridge, among the Oxonians too; I have with stingy discretion distributed all my Copies but two. Old Rogers, a grim old Dilettante, full of sardonic sense, was heard saying, &#x201C;It is German Poetry given out in American Prose.&#x201D; Friend Emerson ought to be content;&#x2014;and has now above all things, as I said, to <hi rend="italic">be in no haste</hi>. Slow fire does make sweet malt:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial, echoed in Butler&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> 3:52.</note> how true, how true!

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>Very unluckily I yesterday, making more haste than speed to get on board a Steamboat, had an ugly full-length fall; which has lamed me a little, and indeed might have been far worse. The accident is not dangerous as it now proves, nor likely to trouble me long at all: but I doubly grieve for it as my promise and purpose for Wednesday <pb id="pg-10-108" n="10:108"/>is thereby rendered impossible, and your kindness to me of none effect for this once. <closer><salute>I pray you accept my regrets; and believe me always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is only a day or two since I wrote to you; but here is a Letter from Jack, which I must send to you, and a line or half a line along with it. Yesterday it arrived; today, being in the Letter-writing way, I will send it off.</p>
<p>Jack has got up to the North of Italy, to a beautiful Country of lakes and hills at the foot of the Alps; a bit nearer us; but whether any likelier to get actually to us this year, we cannot yet say. He still speaks of its being probable he may come home in <date when="1838-09-00">September</date>; but it were not wise in us to count on that: we must just leave it all to the Upper Power; and in the meanwhile be thankful that our good Doctor is well where he stays, and tho&#x2019; far from us can pass his summer in tolerable comfort.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John in his letter from Milan of <date when="1838-06-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date> had said that Lady Clare would spend the summer at Como. He described his journey from Rome and mentioned that at Bologna he &#x201C;saw Pepoli&#x2019;s cousin (<hi rend="italic">Maddalena</hi>) at his mother&#x2019;s house, and his sister Mad<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Zampieri at her own house. I do not know whether Pepoli has told that his poor mother has been quite mad for something more than a year, and keeps continually raving in a most painful way about him.&#x201D; He wrote of &#x201C;a considerable possibility of my being home again in <date when="1838-09-00">September</date>.&#x201D;</note> He had not got my Letter when he wrote; but must before now, if no mischance befel; for I wrote it without any delay. This is enough for Italy.</p>
<p>And now, dear Mother, what of Scotsbrig and Annandale? I begin to be very desirous of some precise information as to matters there. How has your health stood it; how do you find yourself in the old upstairs rooms, so quiet after all the noise and reek you had? I fancy <pb id="pg-10-110" n="10:110"/>Alick&#x2019;s being at Ecclefechan will be a resource for you; in the good weather it will be easy and pleasant to take a walk over thither. Your weather, I doubt, has been blustery, wet and inclement hitherto; as indeed it has till within these two weeks been here: nay still it is very rainy, but that in our dry dusty world of London is a quality rather than otherwise. It washes our atmosphere, our tree leaves and streets: summer green is beautiful everywhere. Oh, I wish many times I were mounted on that <hi rend="italic">saddle</hi> there (close by you) and a good <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> under it,&#x2014;to fly thro&#x2019; the wind in still Annandale again! Patience; we must have patience, and see what can be done.</p>
<p>The printing of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh proceeds apace; and cannot last beyond three weeks, I should say. It will be a pretty enough Book. I do not mean to go on with the others at present: I hear for certain that they are done or nearly done in America: by way of saving myself trouble for which there is no sure or evident money-return, I will wait till I hear from America before printing farther. I wrote to Emerson, the other day, about it; about sending me some of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> copies over to sell them here for my own behoof. We will hear first, and then determine.</p>
<p>My Lectures, now that the whole matter is summed up have realised in gross about &#xa3;300; from which about &#xa3;40 of expences (higher a little than they should be) were to be deducted; so that our net product is just about &#xa3;260: better than I expected; better very decidedly than I expected once. All the rest of it is satisfactory as anything could be: on the whole one ought to be quietly thankful for it. I clap in here a &#xa3;5 note, of which you are to distribute the individual sovereigns among my sisters and yourself: Mary, Jean, Sandy&#x2019;s Jenny, Jamie&#x2019;s Isabella, Mother&#x2019;s self,&#x2014;a sovereign each to all the woman-kind, which they may buy bonnets with or <foreign>brats</foreign> [clothes] and <foreign>pattens</foreign>, and call &#x201C;the Lecture.&#x201D; Add</p>

<p>I have often had occasion to remark that it is always the <hi rend="italic">good</hi> people one misses. One great bore after another <hi rend="italic">knabs</hi> one at home, but when at last by heaven&#x2019;s mercy there comes a reasonable man or woman or both together (as happened the other evening) then twenty to one we have just gone out to recruit exhausted nature.</p>
<p>Truly, you as well as myself are become a sight for sore eyes! the more the pity that we did not see each other&#x2014;</p>
<p>The kind invitation you left was accepted on the instant and the <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> of acceptance has been delayed thus long only because, like much else in this world, it fell between two stones.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Your long close-written and very punctual and desirable Letter came the day before yesterday. I am unable to answer it as it should be answered: my right-hand is lame or lamish, and I write at all only with difficulty and doing myself hurt. You must be content with this scrap, which I stuff into a frank of Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s, till I get means of writing more fully. It is all, at any rate, that the frank will carry with safety. But indeed I have written often and fully of late weeks, and sent nearly all my news: there was another Letter, to our Mother, <hi rend="italic">subsequent</hi> to the one you mention; of which last you say nothing tho&#x2019; there was time enough for you to have heard of it: however I will hope and believe that it too has got safe to hand; there was a trifle of cash in it, and a Letter from Jack at Como, of about the same date &#x26; the same tenor as the one you yourself had. Owing to the state of my right-hand, I have never got it answered yet; but indeed having written, before that, to Rome, I fancy that it would very soon be answered otherwise, and so endeavour to sit waiting patiently for more.</p>
<p>The reason of lameness of hand is a very insignificant one. A certain Gover<supplied>[n]</supplied>ment Official of my friends here, one Mr Elliot, &#x201C;Agent General for Emigration,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Elliot; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380618-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1838-06-18">18 June</date></ref>].</note> persuaded me about ten days ago<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1838-06-17">17 June</date>.</note> to jaunt with him as far as Gravesend, down the River some twenty miles, to see a Ship of Kentish Emigrants he was just sending off to New South Wales. Being in great haste to get on board our Steamboat at London <pb id="pg-10-113" n="10:113"/>Bridge, I missed my footing at the corner of a Street, stumbled ever worse till I reached the curb-stone, and there (the ground being steep and I in a running condition)&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">fell</hi> flat into the pavement, one of the heaviest falls; laming my wrists, which indeed saved my head and face from breakage. The left wrist which was the worst is now well; the right, having had all the work to do, now demands holiday, and with that will be well soon too. I write none that I can avoid. Could not James send me a <hi rend="italic">tin</hi> wrist in case of extremity? That tin thumb of his has filled me with laughter and admiration again and again.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note></p>
<p>I am much obliged to him and you for your care of that accursed Craigenputtoch.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean wrote to John, <date when="1838-07-15">15</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-07-16">16 July</date>, that she and James had visited Craigenputtoch to see &#x201C;how things were going there it was so long since any body had seen it.&#x201D; But details are not clear as her letter to TC has not been found. Apparently Joseph McAdam had damaged the woods, something he had also done on his earlier let in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330521-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:391</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-05-21">21 May 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> The thing to be done is to secure the house and the woods at least from other injury than those of weather and nature. Adamson can and must keep M&#x2019;Adam from meddling with them.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Robert Adamson and Joseph McAdam, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01">TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date></ref></note> It is, I have no doubt whatever, entirely a falsehood that Mrs Welsh gave any such permission as Joseph talks of: I wrote to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">hash</hi></foreign> that very day your Letter came, a letter of brimstone and cayenne, requiring him to keep out of my premises and within the limits of his own, under penalty of law-beagles and Botany Bay; his cattle were to go out instantly and to stay out, another tree felled was <hi rend="italic">felony</hi> by law: I imagine he will hold his hand for a while. If the Speddoch man<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. Speddoch was five mi. E of Craigenputtoch.</note> will regulate the woods, and rain is kept out of the house, we must be content. I again request James to take charge of it. And for the rest the less I <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> about that detestable place, the thankfuller I shall be. It never turns up here with any other result than with vexation to us. I could get into right rage at it; but study not to do that. You were right not to mind M&#x2019;Queen; to let Peter Austin talk.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John McQueen, who had failed in his application to rent (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01">TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref>), and Peter Austin of Carstammon.</note> Enough of it.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> will be printed out I expect in about a week; copies of it may be in Dumfries about the beginning of next month: I have other Books to send by some early opportunity. That printing once done, I am free to run whither I will; and a few right July days might soon drive me out of this. But whitherward? All our plans are driven aback by the planlessness of Lady Clare. We need not think about Italy for winter if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is uncertain about returning thither. But then if there is no Italy there <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be a Scotland? Jane is altogether discouraged <pb id="pg-10-114" n="10:114"/>as to Templand by the hint of &#x201C;Liverpool children&#x201D; being there. She speculates sometimes about Annandale, Kirkcaldy &#x26;c. Next time I write, I hope to say something more definite. Meanwhile the poor Dame is clearly a very great deal better since the summer weather came; indeed she has not been so well that I have seen these three years. All is well enough with us here: the great secret now as formerly to keep in the utmost quietude we can. I feel as if growing fast <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, especially in mind and heart. It often seems to me strange that I have but been 4 years here; I feel as if I had lived at least 20 since we left Scotland. True enough, I have had a bit of fighting, seen and unseen; but I have tript up the enemy a little, and ought to be content for the present. <hi rend="italic">Content</hi> is not the word, <hi rend="italic">indifferent</hi> is nearer it; I never more authentically considered the whole world as smoke and triviality than I do even now. But I am resting, I am resting; let us lie and <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>, and say nothing!</p>
<p>A Miss Fergus from Kirkcaldy was here staying. I had to accompany her to see the Coronation Procession;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1838-06-29">29 June</date>, for details of the procession and coronation.</note> we had been invited to the Montagues&#x2019; window,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Basil and Anna Dorothea Montagu; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231014-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:451</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-10-14">14 Oct. 1823</date></corr></ref>. Anna Brownell Jameson was also there: &#x201C;As to the Queen, poor child, she went through her part beautifully; &#x2026; even Carlyle, who was standing near me, uttered with emotion a blessing on her head, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi>, you know, thinks kings and queens rather superfluous&#x201D; (Gerardine Macpherson, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life of Anna Jameson</hi> [London, <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>] 143&#x2013;44).</note> but sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not otherwise have gone. I had even a &#x201C;ticket to the Abbey&#x201D; (a thing infinitely precious), but gave that decidedly away. Crowds and mummery are not agreeable to me. The Procession was all gilding, velvet and grandeur; the poor little Queen seemed to have been <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping] <supplied>[;]</supplied> one could not but wish the poor little <foreign>lassie</foreign> well: she is small, <foreign>sonsy</foreign> and modest,&#x2014;and has the ugliest task, I should say, of all girls in these Isles. Our Hyde Park Fair was literally about <hi rend="italic">a hundred</hi> Lamb-fairs all in one;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was a fair in Hyde Park, begun after the procession had passed, with &#x201C;nearly 1,000 booths, marquees, tents, stalls. &#x2026; Not fewer than several thousand persons of all classes paid it a visit&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1838-06-29">29 June</date>). The Lockerbie Lamb Fair held in <date when="1838-08-00">early Aug.</date>, to which TC compares it, was the largest in Scotland.</note> perfectly goodnatured, but such a gathering as eye never saw. I have heard of nothing that pleases me like the dining of Ecclefechan on the top of Burnswark that day!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean also refers to this in her letter to John, <date when="1838-07-15">15</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-07-16">16 July</date>: &#x201C;Mr Grahame was in his Majesty on the <date when="1838-06-28">28</date><hi rend="italic">th</hi> Dining Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on the Hilltop.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1838-07-04">4 July</date>, had reported that about 500 people from Ecclefechan spent the afternoon on Burnswark Hill, 100 dining on the grass; Graham of Burnswark presided over toasts and speeches, and schoolchildren marched and played music.</note> Well done!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-115" n="10:115"/>I have exhausted the utmost scrap of paper I dare venture on; also my hand is quite worn out. If that Letter to my Mother have come (as I doubt not) let James signify it by <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke on the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>. Jack requires an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> now, and I send that to him. You will send my Mother word of us; her and all the rest.

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>I answer you as one in doleful dumps; having had a fit of sleeplessness these three nights, owing mainly I suppose to the hot weather.

To me, had I not often witnessed the like already, it were next to unaccountable.</p>
<p>Alas, my friend, I do not think I can come on Monday. I am to dine on that day, if at all able, with Allan Cunningham and a frightful Scotch <foreign><hi rend="italic">etcetera</hi></foreign> of Coronation-Editors;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In town to report Victoria&#x2019;s coronation on Thurs., <date when="1838-06-28">28 June</date>.</note> preparatory to which a breakfast with wits, four miles off?&#x2014; Ah, me!</p>
<p>You are very good to think me useful or ornamental in such a union; and surely if there is anything worth wishing for in this world, it is the meeting with friends, kind, honest-hearted and wise, who will let one live in friendliness among them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding and Sterling were discussing monthly meetings of a small dining club: &#x201C;a small select company definable as persons to whom it was pleasant to talk together&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:158).

Its first meeting was on <date when="1838-08-07">7 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;at first called the <hi rend="italic">Anonymous Club</hi>; then, after some months of success, in compliment to the founder who had now left us again, the <hi rend="italic">Sterling Club</hi>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:159).

Literally every dinner, as they order these things here, is martyrdom to me; which I never submit to except under the impossibility of seeing see-worthy people otherwise. Could you indeed arrange a meeting without that brutal appendage! But I suppose no man can in England. With it, you may safely calculate on me as a guest, so often as my nerves will in any sort permit; but as a regular dining member, the rigorous gods have said, NO!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC did become a member.</note> The last Tavern-dinner I saw still lives in my remembrance, a &#x201C;Golgotha without the sacredness.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I hope to see you here however on Monday. The Printer lingers sadly with the last leaves of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>. In the course of next week I shall be ready to fly, if need continue.</p>
<p>My wife grows better, not worse; and salutes you well.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>There seems a kind of destiny to have hung over this sheet, which has lain waiting these three weeks to be written on, and seemed sometimes to my imagination as if it would never get the length of being written. If you have not got the Letter I sent to Rome, your poor imagination will be in a pretty state! And as for me, I may say a kind of paltry remorse has persecuted me daily and nightly by reason of it. The story, you observe, is this. In due course of answer to your last <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> letter but one, I wrote to Rome; and sat expecting an answer to that. No Gloag<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gloag was a colleague of John&#x2019;s in Rome who had left for London with a patient of theirs &#x201C;suffering from mental derangement&#x201D; and with a letter of <date when="1838-05-19">19 May</date> for TC which he apparently never delivered (John&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1838-06-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date>).</note> nor no letter by Gloag up to this date has been heard of here. But about three weeks ago there came a Letter from Como explaining how the Newspapers had duly followed you northwards, how you pretty confidently expected a Letter to follow you too; but requiring withal that I should write to Como, just &#x201C;as if I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written to Rome.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In John&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1838-06-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date>.</note> With this demand, tho&#x2019; it introduced an <hi rend="italic">overlapment</hi> not so pleasant in our correspondence, I proposed, the next morning or nearly so, to comply. Would I had done it on any terms. Behold, however, on entering my Library here after breakfast I found a Glazier, with cloths, screw-planks, chalk-bags and dusting-brushes, already in possession of the place; with intent to clean the windows. No help therefore for that day. On the morrow, entering in like manner I found Ellen the maid there enveloped in dust and overturned furniture, engaged in cleaning the room. Next day was Sunday: instead of writing, that day, I let myself be persuaded to go jaunting down the River with one Frederick Elliot &#x201C;Agent General for Emigration&#x201D; to see a ship of Kentish Emigrants before sailing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1838-06-17">17 June</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380618-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1838-06-18">18 June</date>]</ref>.</note> Wo worth the day! For turning suddenly at full speed at the corner of Fish-Street Hill (being rather late for the Steamboat) I struck my foot on a post, staggered rapidly to the curbstone, and then <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> flat forward, laming my chin slightly, and both wrists severely, so that I have not been able to manage a pen at all without pain ever since! A hope carried me on for some time that you would write in answer to the Rome letter (which surely you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> get): but this fades into dubiousness; <pb id="pg-10-120" n="10:120"/>and the fault <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have committed in not writing grows clearer and clearer, however that may be. So that my hand being now stronger for writing, indeed all but well for all <hi rend="italic">other</hi> purposes, I will write this day; of my numerous despicable perplexities and irresolutions there shall one this day be put an end to. Observe farther, for avoiding of farther overlapment, That if you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written already when this comes, then write without loss of a moment; but if you have written, then consider this as nothing, as not sent and non-extant; whereupon I, answering instantly, will bring matters round again. Jean at Dumfries has had a Como Letter from you, it seems; of what date she does not mention;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1838-06-17">17 June</date>.</note> but probably about the same as mine: her Letter is filled mainly with Craigenputtoch devastations and Macadam&#x2019;s havoc in the woods; and gives little news except that our Mother was &#x201C;staying with Alick&#x201D; for a day or two, that Alick had dined in Burnswark on Coronation-day (see <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> sent you), and that all was going on as usual thereabouts.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380706-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1838-07-06">6 July</date></ref>.</note> Gloag, as I said, has given no sign of himself or of his message. Thomson<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref>.</note> received and acknowledged his &#xa3;6"10 a day or two after we first heard of it: this should have been stated long ago, but was forgotten in perhaps two Letters, or more. And now, with at least a statement of these sorry burbles, let me take the poor half sheet that remains, and proceed to write in it.</p>
<p>The Lectures, as you might guess from the Roman Letter, ended with great <foreign>eclat</foreign>; people &#x201C;weeping&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date></ref>.</note> I was right glad to see myself thro&#x2019; it. Three or four applications, one from Edinburgh,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Nichol, lithographic draftsman and printer, 27 Hanover St., younger brother of John Pringle Nichol, had invited TC to lecture in Edinburgh. TC had apparently sent a prospectus and a letter specifying the kind of audience he would want; Nichol replied on <date when="1838-06-25">25 June</date> regretting that Edinburgh could not provide it.</note> were made me to &#x201C;repeat&#x201D; my lectures; all these I gracefully declined for the time being, on the terms likely to be offered. The net outcome in money (deducting <hi rend="italic">great</hi> expenses) was some &#xa3;264: we have in all, or had at that date, about &#xa3;300 to front the coming year with: a great blessing for a man that has been hunted by the squalid spectre of Beggary these long periods of time, and seldom for many months could see how by uttermost exertion and uttermost thrift, bread and water were to be made sure to him! Ah me, I had got nearly sick of that sort of thing; if a little money to live upon have come now, it has really come in season; the latter half of life suits far worse with want than the first. As for the &#x201C;applauses&#x201D; &#x26;c, they go by me like the voice of the <pb id="pg-10-121" n="10:121"/>wind: there is no glory I know of that is worth the agitation occasioned by it.&#x2014; Out of America too Emerson talks really of &#x201C;remittances&#x201D; as probable; and all manner of psalmodying goes on there to the due extent;&#x2014;the net result of all which, as I say, is at least that we shall be able to live for a while without anxiety as to money. One of my hearers, a youth from van Diemen&#x2019;s Land, came here yesterday with a manuscript volume, containing his Reports of those Lectures of mine.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Chisholm Anstey was the son of one of the earliest settlers in Tasmania. His small quarto notebook of 214 pages came into the possession of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society on his death in Bombay, <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>; see also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380110-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-01-10">10 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> It is one of the strangest things: not a <hi rend="italic">miniature</hi>, but an entire <hi rend="italic">large-as-life</hi> only half eaten away as with moths! We think of having it copied; so that you may one day see what sort of thing that was.&#x2014; Since the Lectures ended, on the <date when="1838-06-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date>, I have been the idlest man or nearly so in London. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ignavia, inertia</hi></foreign> [shameful indolence]!

I corrected the proofsheets of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>, that, and the wretchedest trash of Books (not in sufficient quantity either), is all that I have done. <hi rend="italic">Teufk</hi> is to be published <hi rend="italic">today</hi> (I suppose); Saunders &#x26; Otley are my men; Fraser cut a little too close, last time we talked, so I am off with him. If I can get no money, I will at least have no Irish Blackguardism either.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:245</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July 1834</date></corr></ref> for Fraser&#x2019;s Irish connections.</note> The edition is but of 500 (<hi rend="italic">said</hi> to be); the &#x201C;Miscellaneous Writings,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">out</hi> in America probably before this, are to follow &#x201C;if there be encouragement.&#x201D; Since money seems not to lie in them, I see not with certainty what does lie for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. They are obsolete to me, they give me <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [vexation]. I proposed having 200 American copies so arranged as to be sold here for my behoof; there is a correspondence as to that on the Atlantic at present; we shall see: my American friends have arranged that I am to have a dollar for every copy sold <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> it will be the far easiest way of editing to take their already edited copies here too, if it can be arranged. <hi rend="italic">Teufelk</hi> was little other than a weariness to me; how much more would these <foreign><hi rend="italic">blethers</hi></foreign> [prattlings] be,&#x2014;unless one saw <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> like to spring of them. There is no change in <hi rend="italic">Teuf</hi>k from the genuine Fraser Copy; a few pages called &#x201C;Testimonies of Authors&#x201D; stand by way of Preface, beginning with John Murray and his <hi rend="italic">Taster</hi> (which stage of it you remember well, seven <pb id="pg-10-122" n="10:122"/>years back), and ending with Emerson&#x2019;s Preface to the Yankee edition; it gives covertly a history of the poor Manuscript &#x26; publication, and embraces the wisest and stupidest, the worst and best, that can be said of it. In next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, I suppose, you will see it announced:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found in <date when="1838-07-00">July</date> or <date when="1838-08-00">Aug.</date> issues of <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>.</note> if there appear any review worth notice for good or evil I will try to send it. And so Speed to Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh! Jane said &#x201C;I am glad he&#x2019;s to be printed at last, poor beast!&#x201D; So am I; after, a seven years fight for it.</p>
<p>And now, dear Brother, the question continually rises on me, What is to be done next? Something must be done; for I am going half-mad here in the horror of dusty heat and disturbed sleep for no end. Thank God, Jane is a great deal better since the weather grew fairly warm: she could be almost well, she says, if I were well. She is averse to travel in this posture of affairs; indeed we have no place to travel to, for Templand is full of Liverpool children, and at Scotsbrig you know what accommodation there is. The new possibility of your still coming home in <date when="1838-09-00">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> seems to knock Italy on the head; for what should we do the<supplied>[re]</supplied> without you, and what would you do there without your salary and Countess? We can decide on nothing.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380621-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-21">21 June</date></ref>. John had also said in his letter, <date when="1838-06-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x201C;Had we been on the other side of the Alps I should have advised you without hesitation to come to me; but I do not know how Como and its Italian heat might suit you.&#x201D;</note> Meanwhile for me the time rather presses. All <date when="1838-06-00">June</date> we had rains, and I did well enough; but within the last ten days, ah me, there is heat, that accursed heat of London pavements, likest Tartarus of all earthly things; and <supplied>[do]</supplied>gs bark thro&#x2019; the night; and in a word I for one <hi rend="italic">must begone out of this</hi>. Last night neither of us slept (Jane on account of me) till five in the morning: the Devil is too good for torture of that kind,&#x2014;unknown to me now these many years. And yet whither to go? Annandale is the refuge not of my courageous conviction but of my pusillanimity: I feel as if I should sink into deeper brutification there, and something of it cleaves to me long after I have left it: with you or with Jane beside me it were different; but neither of you can go. I often think of Switzerland and Como; would to Heaven I were there. But the getting thither! Then again I think of at least running over to Paris, where Thomas Erskine now is: &#x2014;out of the frying pan into the fire? Another plan, perhaps the reasonablest of all, is that of going out into the country a little and taking lodgings; for it is not the heat, it <supplied>[is]</supplied> only the London heat that destroys me. In short, my dear Brother, you see I am at my old work, and know not what to resolve on. Count only that I will soon resolve on something; and do you write always hither for Jane will <pb id="pg-10-123" n="10:123"/>continue here, or some one for her. The Kirkcaldy Miss Fergus was here some two weeks we are strongly invited to Kirkcaldy: Emerson invites us both, with great specialty, to come and live with him at Concord for a year. Plenty of invitations; some four or five to the North of England too! Out upon it that one cannot sleep! After all, however, it is mainly bile that keeps me from sleeping here in spite of the heat; bile that I can deliver myself from by medical craft: also I have had too many <hi rend="italic">dinners</hi>, with all I have refused! It is a scandalous business dining.&#x2014; God keep us, dear Brother! I tell thee all my sorrows as if thou couldst help me there. I am tempted to burn this letter; but my thumb (root of the thumb, there it alone lies now) is too tired to write another. Courage, the heat will pass; nay there are symptoms of rain this very day.&#x2014; <closer><salute>God ever b<supplied>[less you,]</supplied> dear brother of a dyspeptic&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>As this Letter is to go for nothing I make no apology for the entire egoism of it. I know too, my dear Jack has <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sorrows, perhaps sleepless ones too, in the Inn of Como! Be of courage, my boy: things are far better with us after all than they once were. Cheer up; let us hope to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> too, before long, and to arrange it so that we <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> met. Without thee, I were very lonely, and poor enough in this world. Yet you must not grow impatient&#x2014;with Spaurism, and this perpetual fluctuation. Be patient with it; you will be out of it by and by, and that with profit to us all.&#x2014; Last night I sat down to smoke in my nightshirt in the backyard: it was one of the beautifullest nights; the half moon clear as silver, looked out as from Eternity, and the great Dawn was streaming up: I felt a remorse, a kind of shudder, at the fuss I was making about a sleepless night, about my sorrow at all of a Life so soon to be absolved into that great Mystery above and around us. O let us be patient, let us call to God with our silent heart, if we cannot with our tongue!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jean was to write to you soon from Dumf<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, and talked of sending the Letter thro&#x2019; me.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380718-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-07-18">18 July</date></ref>.</note> I must send my Mother word, so soon as I have resolved on anything. Jane speaks now of our all moving over to Boulogne-sur-mer! Perhaps it might do: seabathing is always excellent for me. Understand this only: if I do quit London I will send a Newspaper Examiner with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke; then shortly after the County Newspaper of the place I am gone to will indicate whitherward; till in a day or two following that, there will come a Letter, articulately speaking. If Examiners come with their usual strokes, consider me still here. The Rain has actually come! There will be sleep tonight.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-10-124" n="10:124"/>I send you the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> as you ordered; perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> would be a nuisance in addition; perhaps you still want it too?

<p>Here comes hearty rain just while I am sealing up; Heaven be thanked for it! The grass everywhere was almost entirely burnt brown.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The distress of the country at present seems beyond expression. There will almost infallibly be riots and bloodshed before long. I am thankful <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be Prime Minister in such a distracted, delirious, and everyway miserable and despicable time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was happy to hear of James&#x2019;s success in the asylum business: it may turn out for his good in various ways. People will see better what manner of stuff he is made of. He does well not to be a <hi rend="italic">sollicitor</hi> beyond measure. It is better when a man&#x2019;s work and conduct speaks for him.</p>

<p>They report very unfavourably of Isabella from Scotsbrig: but without any intelligible particulars; always merely that she is &#x201C;no better.&#x201D; I suppose it to be <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi> (stomach-disease), and consequent universal dispiritment.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute> This sheet has just arrived, just been read; and now I will fill up the vacancies of it, before going <pb id="pg-10-126" n="10:126"/>out and consigning it to the Post office again. A Letter from me (after too long delay!) is on the road since about a week; may it find you well; may it <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> some Como message on the way for me! The sleepless humour I was in at my last writing has gone again; the weather has been moist and cool ever since; my hand also, I feel, is considerably mended: on the whole, I feel very decidedly better. We went out on Monday to Woolwich, looked at a vacant cottage there, which the Rev<hi rend="italic">d Scotts</hi> can let us have free of rent if we like to carry out furniture to it. Scott, by the bye, seems to me a rather good fellow; decidedly possessed of talent, of force; a rough Scotch <hi rend="italic">mirth</hi> lurks in him, which I like much. His cottage we shall hardly take, I think. My <foreign><hi rend="italic">outrake</hi></foreign> [journey] from this Babylon remains therefore dubious as ever. I was seriously thinking of Newcastle Steamers, and Scotsbrig; but this of the Manchester journey on our Mother&#x2019;s (to page 4) Mother&#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] part, which I learn first in this letter, throws a new shade over that.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had copied a note from Alick, who reported: &#x201C;Cannot tell whether she will get to Manch<hi rend="italic">t</hi> or not.&#x201D;</note> Then Scott and others<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine, who was already in Paris.</note> want me to go to Paris and Switzerland! I remain like the ass amid bundles of hay. Besides the weather will soon be permanently cooler; then I can do where I am. I have engaged myself with <hi rend="italic">mercury and castor</hi> today; my poor liver once helped, my poor soul will be better off, freer to choose, abler to perform. For the present, it is all idleness with me; reading of bad books and trash: but really having now rested almost a year, I feel as if I should think of recommencing.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Teufels</hi>k is not out yet to my knowledge; I leave it freely to take its own way in that and all respects. I am sitting for my picture again,&#x2014;instigated by my Wife or &#x201C;some demon more wicked.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;It seems probable, my friends, that Ananias was tempted unto this by some demon <hi rend="italic">more wicked than his wife</hi>.&#x2019; Rev. Dr. Nimmo in a sermon heard by Carlyle when a student in Edinburgh&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). Cf. Acts 5:1&#x2013;3.</note> The Artist, one Lawrence, has greatly the air of a first-rate young man; he was extremely anxious to volunteer on this occasion, and has had it in the wind for above six months; he confidently expects to succeed; but I must say that, tho&#x2019; we are half way now, there does not appear to me any considerable hope of him and it. I sit daily; 3 sittings more and I have done with it: all other work, entertainment, excitation I sit withdrawn from for the present. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ein Faullenzer</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> an idler]? Wait a while!&#x2014; Jane continues much better during the warm weather: she failed to send any express remembrance to you last time; but charges me now to send the kind love of one in a press of affairs, &#x201C;just this moment going out to the Butcher&#x2019;s&#x201D;! She seems to agree with London in summer as much as I disagree with it. Her welfare then depends <pb id="pg-10-127" n="10:127"/>mainly on mine.&#x2014; I will still write instantly when a Letter arrives from you. No whisper yet from Gloag. By the way, what of that Parcel of sheets of the last 2 volumes of F. Revolution?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had sent the last two vols. of page proofs of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> to John via Paris in late <date when="1837-04-00">April 1837</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370423-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:188</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-04-23">23 April 1837</date></corr></ref>). John seemed to be reading them by <date when="1837-05-00">mid-May</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370530-TC-JAC-01">9:213</ref>).

In <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380129-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1838-01-29">29 Jan.</date></ref>, TC implies that it was John&#x2019;s copy of the book that was lost, not the parcel of sheets mentioned here.</note> Can nothing be done for it? One might easily make inquiries about it in Paris (T. Holcroft, or plenty of others). Also could I not send you a copy now direct to Milan; with Teufel<hi rend="italic">k</hi> for company? Say how, or whether. The Scott people (Scott and Erskine are to go on their travels soon) <hi rend="italic">cd</hi> even carry it as far as Geneva.&#x2014; John Sterling was here yesterday; he has a little Article in Mill&#x2019;s Review on <hi rend="italic">Montaigne</hi>, which is to be out on Monday next.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Montaigne and his Writings,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 29 (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>): 321&#x2013;52, signed &#x201C;&#xa3;.&#x201D;</note> He scribbles or writes at a great rate for Blackwood &#x26;c; and is on the whole one of the most restless men now extant.

Mill I saw last night; borrowing some Books from him. Friendly as ever when we meet; but that is now rarely: our paths diverge more and more; to me he is nearly altogether barren; to him I am perhaps <hi rend="italic">oppressive</hi> in the self-subsistence which he (tho&#x2019; only in Benthamic speculation of Radicalism) very properly aims at. He is one of the barrenest clever men I ever saw. Darley comes here, stutter-stuttering, sometimes; very unhappy, yet perhaps approaching nearer the root and cure of his unhappiness,&#x2014;&#x201C;m-m-my own heart!&#x201D; namely.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have been thinking earnestly these three days about writing to you; and here now, by way of good luck, is a Letter from the Doctor, which as it were commands me to make no more delay. It is long, I think, since you have heard so little of me in such a space of time; nothing direct, except one little Note to Jean, since the <date when="1838-06-00">middle of June</date> when the Lectures ended. I have been rather lame for writing (as Jean would tell you; but that is about over now); besides being very languid and indisposed; neither indeed have I ever rightly ascertained where you were, or what you were specially about, since your return from Manchester. I will set all on some clearer footing today. The only particular notice I had was in Jean&#x2019;s Letter to Italy, and this not an agreeable notice, that you had caught cold, scouring blankets with Isabella, and were out of order on that account.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had written in his note to Jean: &#x201C;Our Mother has not been so very well for some days. &#x2026; Isabella &#x26; she had been scouring blankets, and both overworked themselves I fancy&#x201D; (JCA to JAC, <date when="1838-07-15">15</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-07-16">16 July</date>).</note> Surely, my dear Mother, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> might cease now to expose yourself in that manner; you have had enough of it, one would think, some years ago! Let me hope that it was nothing very serious this attack, but that you are already out of it, and <hi rend="italic">that it may serve as a warning to you</hi>. Hire somebody for such work; if I should pay it, three times over! I will still hope there is little mischief done this time.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s best news is that in all probability he is coming home after all. I for one am right glad to hear it. In <date when="1838-09-00">September</date>, he says, or almost in the <date when="1838-08-00">end of August</date>, one may hope to see him here. He is in good <pb id="pg-10-130" n="10:130"/>health, and well off for all things except one: news from home. Three letters of mine have been sent; but none at that time had reached him. My last to Rome must be <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, I imagine; detained by that beggarly Austrian Post-office of theirs;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Austrian-controlled govt. of Lombardy, fearful of political conspiracy, opened mails extensively.</note> but the next I hope has reached Milan before this, and set the good Doctor&#x2019;s heart at rest. Jean&#x2019;s Dumfries letter was also forwarded with a Postscript from me without loss of time; we will suppose that this also may arrive, and set all to rights. Not one of my Newspapers durst they forward; not even M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier:</hi> surely that Constitution must be in a staggering state which M&#x2019;Diarmid can put in jeopardy!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All Lady Clare&#x2019;s party&#x2019;s newspapers had been detained or lost since their arrival in Lombardy.</note> But at all events now I will write again forthwith to Berne in Switzerland: there among the honest Swiss, with the wretched Jesuitry and imbecile stagnation of Italy all behind the Alps, our poor Jack will learn that his friends are still well, and eager to see him among them again. You will get the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> of next week, instead of the Austrian Postmaster, whom we will not trouble farther at present in that way. Jack, I suppose, had <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> him to open that last letter, and get himself scolded a little; which, judging by the strange gum seal, I think the wretched scamp has actually done.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter, <date when="1838-07-16">16</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-07-17">17 July</date>, John had written: &#x201C;I would considerably prefer having my pocket picked to having my letters taken away. &#x2026; No Government under heaven has a right to seize or detain them. Englishmen are trained from their very infancy to regard every letter as the most sacred of private property. &#x2026; With newspapers it is different. &#x2026; Every government is justly entitled to make what regulations it chooses in regard to them.&#x201D;</note> Byron, writing out of that country, says in one of his letters, &#x201C;If anybody open this, pray let him understand that I for one consider him as a mean scoundrel, and those that employ him, be they Emperors or what not, as worthy of being spit upon by all honest men&#x201D;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a reference to Byron&#x2019;s letter to Murray from Ravenna, <date when="1821-02-16">16 Feb. 1821</date>: &#x201C;&#x2018;Letters opened?&#x2019;&#x2014;to be sure they are, and that&#x2019;s the reason why I always put in my opinion of the German Austrian scoundrels&#x201D; (Thomas Moore, ed., <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</hi> [London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>] 2:447).</note> let them take <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. &#x201C;A poo<hi rend="italic">a a</hi>venge!&#x201D; as old Pa<supplied>[r]</supplied>liament<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Dr. George Little or his father, of Ecclefechan; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:305</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> once said; but the best one can get, in such circumstances.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I sent away a large Packet of Books, to go by steam to Edinburgh; and thereafter to be forwarded by Coach to James Aitken at Dumfries. They will probably arrive early in the next month (<date when="1838-08-00">August</date>), and serve you all reading for a while. The address was ordered to be &#x201C;James Aitken, English Street, Dumfries&#x201D;; and one or two of the Books are marked specially for him, one or two also for <pb id="pg-10-131" n="10:131"/>Alick; the rest are for your care, as usual, to be lent out and read as you direct. <hi rend="italic">Scott&#x2019;s Life</hi> by Lockhart is among them, with some unimportant <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>. But the finest item of the collection, you will say I hope, is <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>, fairly at last in the shape of a Book! They have got it out finally, after long delays; and it will take its lot like other things. It is not a pretty volume, not at all finely done off: but on the whole I care next to nothing at all about it, or about what comes of it,&#x2014;&#x201C;a <foreign>kirk</foreign> and a mill&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial: expressing indifference about the result.</note> if the world like: <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had fairly done with it almost seven years ago. The present edition is small; the sale will not be great.</p>
<p>Jane is very decidedly better ever since the summer began: she is now about as well as I have seen her since we came to Chelsea; goes out to dinner &#x26;c occasionally, like other people: if she can but stand the winter as well, it will be a great improvement. As for me, I have not been decidedly ailing at all; but yet kept in a weakly languid state, in consequence of my lecturing operations, and all the bustle there was about that. The heat also was against me; but there is no heat now: indeed I fear there is far too much cold for the country; Jane has a fire down stairs this very day! We had it extremely hot for about a week, however; that cost me two almost sleepless nights, and had the business continued, I should most probably have run off&#x2014;to Annandale or somewhither. Jane and I at one time were seriously meditating an expedition of that kind; but she, having heard of &#x201C;Liverpool children&#x201D; at Templand, thought it would not do at all, and gave it up, being &#x201C;well where she was.&#x201D; For my share, I did not give it up, but in the cool weather, I had no such cause for haste; besides I wanted to see what Jack would do. There seems now little doubt but I should be better for a short absence somewhere out of this Babylon: but I must be regulated a good deal by Jack&#x2019;s motions. If he do come in <date when="1838-09-00">September</date>, it seems most likely he will be for Annandale almost directly; in which case there is little or nothing to hinder my going with him; accordingly I will hope that such may be the way of it, and continue to hope till I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the direct contrary. For the present, London is got very quiet, some hundred thousand, or so perhaps, having quitted it in the last three weeks; so I manage very tolerably even here, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">dawner</hi></foreign> [stroll] about, doing little but read; and rest myself as I best can. We will wait patiently till we see what Jack makes out.&#x2014; A certain Mr Scott (a very good man, once Edward Irving&#x2019;s Assistant) offered us an empty house rent-free out at Woolwich, which is some dozen miles off this, if we liked to go out and hire furniture and live there for a month or so; but <pb id="pg-10-132" n="10:132"/>we, having recovered our <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> here at home, did not hesitate to &#x201C;decline from it.&#x201D; There are indeed plenty of invitations to the North and to the South; but one has no talent for &#x201C;visiting,&#x201D; in such circumstances as mine. We let them all hang there in the distance.&#x2014; The Painter Jane spoke of, taking my picture, has wearied me a good deal, and made out as good as nothing; a likeness as of one in doleful dumps, with its mouth all <foreign><hi rend="italic">sheyled</hi></foreign> [distorted] and its eyes looking fiercely out: meant to be very tragical. Jane is off to see it even now; and will decide: Finish or burn. My vote is distinctly the <hi rend="italic">latter;</hi> at all events <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am free of it now, let them do as they like.</p>
<p>Jean says, poor Mary is still very much distressed.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had said, in her letter to John, <date when="1838-06-15">15</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-06-16">16 June</date>, that she had not seen Mary &#x201C;since the little boy died in spring,&#x201D; and that she had been &#x201C;in very bad spirits ever since then.&#x201D;</note> Poor Mary, I wish one could do anything for her. You do well to go about her, and cheer her up as you can. She has a kind heart, poor thing; and this is one of the hardest trials, this of a mother bereaved. But I hope she considers <hi rend="italic">whose</hi> doing it was, and strives to acquiesce in the Higher Will, sore as it is for flesh and blood. We are taught that all there, even bereavement itself, is for the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. Give her my hearty sympathy.&#x2014; I did not understand till Jean&#x2019;s letter that Jenny had such a task before her. Jean seemed to say you or she had some thoughts of going. I think one or both of you, at all events somebody, ought to go. The poor creature is far from right help there and managed very badly once before.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny had asked Jean to Manchester for her confinement &#x201C;next month&#x201D; though &#x201C;it seems doubtful whether I shall get.&#x201D; Jenny had had one miscarriage (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370119-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>9:120</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1837-01-19">19 Jan. 1837</date></corr></ref>) and &#x201C;had been in bad health ever since last time till very lately&#x201D; (Jean&#x2019;s letter to John, <date when="1838-07-15">15</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-07-16">16 July</date>),</note> I should like well to hear that somebody was with her; better still that she had got well thro and was herself again. I have not written thither since you left; but I will send them some token soon. Alick has not written, tho&#x2019; he ought if I calculate aright: I hope still to hear goodish news of his shop speculation; perseverance <hi rend="italic">will</hi> triumph there as in other things. The dinner on Burnswark, when I contrasted it with what went on here around me in the same hours, looked very interesting.&#x2014; We have seen no more of Isabella&#x2019;s Brother:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Calvert; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June</date></ref>.</note> indeed, I think he spoke about going northward for some time. His place, at any rate, even here, is long miles from us;&#x2014;like a man living about Dalton,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Five mi. W of Ecclefechan.</note> with uproar all the way between!</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I have been interrupted; and indeed at all events ought to think of finishing. You yourself are surely bound to write to <pb id="pg-10-133" n="10:133"/>me; I will anticipate something of the kind before long. Send me <hi rend="italic">back</hi> the next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> with &#x201C;two strokes&#x201D; if you can; with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke if you are still ailing a little: if you were seriously out of order, I should calculate on a <supplied>[letter?]</supplied> without delay. I will take the Newspaper addressed in Alick&#x2019;s hand. On the whole take care of yourself, dear Mother; and scour no more blankets!</p>
<p>Jane, as I said, is out, and cannot join me in love to you all; which I expressly send, praying good to be with you one and all. I ought to be in the air before this time, for it is now towards three o&#x2019;clock, so long winded was my visitor below stairs: and no Wife to take him off my hands.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good be with you, dear Mother; blessings for this day and always.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1838-07-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July</date> from Como reached us the day before yesterday. I am much grieved at the harrassing scarcity of news you suffer under; owing in good part, as you conjecture, to the villany of the Lombard Post-system.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380726-TC-MAC-01">previous letter</ref>.</note> All <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Letters to us have arrived duly, except Gloag&#x2019;s, who neither by message nor note of any kind has ever shown any symptom of his existence here. The Newspapers have come more rarely than you seem to say; one, and one only, from Florence was the last we got. But on your side henceward, what a vacuum! Several <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi> and four or five <hi rend="italic">Examiners</hi> must be lying in the Lombard Archives, dangerous to the state. A Letter, of the usual length and minuteness, written about the <date when="1838-05-00">middle of May</date> to Rome, never reached you, but must be lost now: this is the beginning of the whole complexity. For the next that arrived here was not an answer to that, but an announcement of your advent to Milan, requesting withal that I should write immediately &#x201C;as if I had not before written.&#x201D; This, owing to an accident in my right hand rendering writing painful, I was unable to do without unusual effort, and put off till some fortnight ago; I rashly imagined that a Newspaper to your address would do the essential as well. About a fortnight ago however I did write, tho&#x2019; with a hand still lame, and in the worst mood, after a sleepless night; that precious <pb id="pg-10-134" n="10:134"/>sheet, for want of a better, I will hope you may have got shortly before this time; I will avoid <hi rend="italic">all</hi> unpunctuality in future; and pray withal that it may be long before we have to correspond under Austrian sway again! Nay another subsequent Letter, from Jean in Dumfries namely, which she sent to me that I might add a postscript and forward it, was instantly sent along, and ought also to be at Milan about now: this, if you can get it, will give you all manner of details both about Annandale and us, and satisfy you that <hi rend="italic">all is well</hi> there and here. So you see there are three letters from our side also; and counting one of these as actually lost (the Roman one), there are still two which I think may reach you. At worst I lose not a moment in scribbling a fourth, and sending it off to Berne; there at last in the honest Swiss land, where pettifogging Knavery one may hope does not <hi rend="italic">sit</hi> aloft as in <foreign><hi rend="italic">W&#xE4;lschland</hi></foreign> [Italy], but <hi rend="italic">hangs</hi> aloft with hemp round its windpipe,&#x2014;I will calculate for certain that your intolerable suspense is put an end to. I will stop my Newspapers; I will write no more to that despicable country. Rejoice that the Alps are between you and it! But on the whole, all is well, dear Jack; Jean&#x2019;s Dumfries business seemed done according to your wish;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had asked Jean, <date when="1838-06-17">17 June</date>, to find out how much he had in the Commercial Bank, Dumfries, and how much interest had accrued. Jean replied, <date when="1838-07-15">15 July</date>, that he had &#xa3;1,301, but that interest could not be added till &#x201C;our Mother come with the receipts.&#x201D; He also wanted to know how to transfer his funds to London if he did not return to Scotland that summer.</note> your Dr Thomson here was settled with as you bade;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref>.</note> our Mother had got home to Annandale safely; we were well here: in short all was as you wished it, in the &#x201C;old&#x201D; wholesome &#x201C;way.&#x201D; What a beggarly employment of one&#x2019;s sheet: one half of it spent not in writing anything, but in writing <hi rend="italic">about</hi> writing something! Nay I must still tell you several old things over again, uncertain whether you may have yet heard them.</p>
<p>The Lectures terminated quite triumphantly, at the due day, early in <date when="1838-06-00">June</date>. Our audience grew better and better to the very last; there was applauding, complimenteering &#x26;c &#x26;c, and a money result of near &#xa3;300 left in the hands of a man heartily glad to shrink back into his hole again. Thank Heaven! It seems pretty generally expected that I am to lecture next year again and subsequent years, having, as they say, &#x201C;made a new profession for myself.&#x201D; If dire famine drive me, I must even lecture; but not otherwise Whoever he may be that wants to get into the centre of a fuss, it is not I. Freedom under the blue sky; ah me, with a bit of brown bread, and peace and pepticity to eat it with: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> for my money before all the &#x201C;glory&#x201D; of Portman Square<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lecture hall, 17 Edward St.</note> or <pb id="pg-10-135" n="10:135"/>the Solar System itself! But we must take what we can get, and be thankful. After the lecturing, came a series of dinner-work and racketting, came hot weather, Coronation uproars,&#x2014;and at length sleeplessness, <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi>, inertia, and at times almost the feeling of Nonentity! I like that existence very ill; my nerves are not made for it. I corrected a few Proofsheets, I read a few Books dull as Lethe; I have done nothing else whatever that I could help, except <hi rend="italic">live</hi>. Frequently a little desire for some travel, a notion that change of scene and objects would be wholesome has come upon me; but in my condition of irresolute imbecillity, especially in the uncertainty we stood in as to your movements, nothing could be done. The weather has now grown cool, even cold; I find it tolerable enough to lounge at Chelsea for the time. My digestion is very bad; I should say however that my heart and life is on the whole sounder than it was last year. Now too all is getting very quiet, streets quite vacant within these two weeks; I am not like to stir from this, unless driven. As for Jane she is much improved, indeed almost well, since Summer came; she does not wish to stir from her quarters at all; there are &#x201C;Liverpool children&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Mary Welsh&#x2019;s children of Maryland St., Liverpool.</note> at Templand, this cuts out Templand at any rate, which we once thought of. But if thou, O Jack, get home in <date when="1838-09-00">September</date>, why might we not run northward together still? There is or was a project of travel to France and Paris where the good Thomas Erskine now is, whither Scott of Woolwich is going soon. In a word, my dear Brother, I will now count on meeting you if it do not go altogether badly, somewhere or other: this is the best news I have had for a good while.</p>

From talk with Robertson and Harriet Martineau he &#x201C;gathered a strange, almost romantic, picture of the Radical chiefs&#x2014;of the great struggle between the old Unitarian section of them against Mr. R., as imaginative and conservative of many things; Mill, the greatest of all, deeply imbued with old Benthamite connections, and gradually beginning to understand the strong personal devotion and friendship of Mr. R.&#x201D; Robertson himself, Stanley felt, was &#x201C;holding one of the most important positions in the journalism of England.

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>Accept my best thanks for your gift of Em Swedenborg&#x2019;s work,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An edn. of <hi rend="italic">A Treatise Concerning the Last Judgment;</hi> the most recently pbd. edn. being London, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>. Wilkinson was to publish a new trans. (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>); see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390916-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-09-16">16 Sept. 1839</date></ref>. Later he explained his approach to TC: &#x201C;When I read <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> as they appeared, I was so much incited by them that I wrote a long letter to him &#x2026; with a copy of Swedenborg&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Last Judgment</hi>, begging him to read that work. The result was a beautiful letter to me&#x201D; (Frederick H. Evans, <hi rend="italic">James John Garth Wilkinson</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1936-00-00">1936</date>] 92).</note> and for the kind sentiments you entertain towards me. That an earnest <pb id="pg-10-142" n="10:142"/>fellow man recognizes an earnest meaning in us, and with brotherly heart wishes us success in our special course of endeavour: this is a true benefit, one of the truest and purest we can receive in this world. Alas, each man, enveloped in his own peculiarities and confused tortuosities, is in great part hidden from all men; seen only of the maker of men! It is much if we can discern here and there darkly as thro tumults and vapour, that here also is a brother struggling whither we struggle; and call to him from the distance, &#x201C;Good speed to thee also!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Hitherto I have known nearly nothing of Swedenborg; or indeed I might say less than nothing, having been wont to picture him as an amiable but inane visionary with affections quite out of proportion to his insights; from whom nothing was to be learned. It is so we judge of extraordinary men. But I have been rebuked already: a little Book by one Sampson Reed of Boston in New England which some friend sent hither,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had sent TC Reed&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Growth of the Mind</hi> (Boston, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>) in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340805-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:259</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-08-05">5 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340812-TC-RWE-01"><sic>7:263</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1834-08-12">12 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>. According to Wilkinson this reference by TC &#x201C;caused the reprint of the Growth of the Mind&#x201D; of London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, and a considerable sale (<hi rend="italic">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi> 12:576).</note> taught me that a Swedenborgian might have thoughts of the calmest sort on the deepest things; that in short I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know Swedenborg, and ought to be ready to know him.</p>
<p>I hope to find due leisure for studying this Book of yours before many days. I engage to read it with my best attention. Meanwhile, soliciting a continuance of your goodwill</p>

On Saturday I bundled them both up with a long scrawl of my own, and set off to get a frank for them. But, behold! <pb id="pg-10-143" n="10:143"/>my &#x201C;honourable members&#x201D; had all gone out of Town; there was no frank readily to be had. I therefore write you a single word here, and will seal the thing and send it off without more waiting. We are well here, Jane in general much better than formerly. We are glad to think you are there at hand to help poor Jenny; we earnestly hope she will get thro&#x2019; her task, poor little body, handsomely and soon.

I am quite idle and languid: I do not sleep well in the hot nights: very little would have made me fly off, and deliver this Letter to you with my own hand in passing!

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>As a frank is going off in some fifteen minutes, I may as well write you a word instead of sending a Newspaper; tho&#x2019; the latter would have told you nearly all I can yet have to tell or at present get you told.&#x2014; We did not get away from the Dock that night till half past one or later; we in consequence arrived at Leith some five hours <hi rend="italic">after</hi> John Fergus had returned home again; namely, about midnight. The consequences were confusion on the back of confusion. Omitting all which for the present let me say only that I did arrive here yesterday about noon; in a deluge of rain, wearied and unbreakfasted, yet otherwise improved rather than injured in health; that I was welcomed &#x201C;in choicest mood&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281200-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:424</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-12-01">1 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> that I have bathed, ridden on horseback, and slept, all comfortably, and am here scribbling to my Goody, in a dry bedroom with rain all battering round me and it,&#x2014;unable as yet to give almost any account of myself. The ground still rocks, as if I were at sea. With my mind too it is the same. And thou, poor Goody? Many a time I thought of that sad dreary hour, many a time asked myself, what is my poor <foreign>lassie</foreign> doing?</p>
<p>The character of matters here is not such that I can predict at all how long I shall continue. Good Humour and Health are incarnated in our landlord; the two dames (Elizabeth &#x26; Jessie) are known to you:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They had lived with their brother John in London while he was an M.P., <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:246&#x2013;48</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> my only fault is like to be that I cannot get my <hi rend="italic">peace held</hi>. I will struggle however to say not a word that I can help. A man with a <hi rend="italic">talent for visiting</hi> might do wonders in that way here; but I have no talent.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Three</hi> dips in the sea are the smallest possible number. But how many more; or what I am to do next? I can think of no place for a Letter of yours, except this that you write forthwith to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x201C;to lie till called for.&#x201D; And yet that, except there be something momentous, is not worth while.

O dear, dear, what a life is this of ours! But no more of it today. I do expect to grow a great deal better by this expedition; <pb id="pg-10-145" n="10:145"/>then we shall all be better.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>It will be a most hasty Note you get from me today; but I will rather write you such than none at all, or wait another day to do it, having already waited too long. Your Letter to Chelsea came duly; and just about along with it, one from the Doctor still in Italy: no doubt you are greatly surprised that I should answer you from Kirkcaldy of all places; but be of good heart, my brave boy; nothing wrong has happened, it is all right and in the course of Nature that I date to you here and not elsewhere, nay I have the hope of seeing you face to face before many days. The way of it I will now explain.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-08-02">2 Aug.</date> Alick&#x2019;s was dated <date when="1838-08-08">8 Aug.</date></note> which came along with yours indicated that in all likelihood he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> get home to London, tho&#x2019; not till &#x201C;the first week in <date when="1838-09-00">September</date>&#x201D; or later: it appeared farther that he was as good as done with Italy, Lady Clare hardly meaning to go back again. I sent his Letter off to Manchester to our Mother; and before they could well have received it, there came a Letter from <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, indicating the same expectation as you had announced, namely, of Jack and me going in by Manchester and bringing our Mother home. A part of the Letter was written by Jenny,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. Margaret A. Carlyle&#x2019;s was postmarked <date when="1838-08-13">13 Aug.</date></note> the rest by my Mother: so far all was well. But now I, for my own part, had become altogether bilious, sleepless &#x26;c owing to the London dust; and after long scheming and grumbling had made up my mind <hi rend="italic">to get out of London</hi>, at all rates and risks, so long as any good weather remained. To go by Manchester, it struck me, would only confuse matters there, and Scotsbrig itself would be quite solitary <pb id="pg-10-146" n="10:146"/>without my Mother. On the other hand I had an invitation of long standing to the Ferguses of Kirkcaldy, one of whom Miss Fergus a very good and kind person staid some two weeks with us in coronation time this summer.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John, Elizabeth, and Jessie Fergus. Elizabeth had stayed with the Carlyles in <date when="1838-06-00">June</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-07-00">July</date>.</note> They are all good kind people: You remember Provost Fergus, the Father of them, now deceased?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Fergus of Strathore, provost of Kirkcaldy, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">26</date>. His father, James Fergus, founded their wealth by introducing ticking as a staple article of manufacture in Kirkcaldy.</note> I had other pressing invitations here in the North. So after abundance of hesitation (for really I was in a poor feckless way, bodily and spiritually) I did last saturday night fairly stow myself into a Leith Steamer below London Bridge; arrived at Leith on Monday at midnight, and on Tuesday morning landed here, in a pour of &#x201C;even-down rain,&#x201D; and was welcomed by the people with all imaginable cordiality. Our party is but one man (John Fergus, late Member for these Burghs, a most jovial social good-natured man), one man besides myself, and two dames his Sisters, one of whom is our old guest. We are very quiet. They let me alone; they have got me a bold swift horse to canter about upon, which I do daily for two hours; I also bathe daily in the blue sea-water which you know of old, in short I do already feel very considerably amended, and could not for the time be better off. I expect Jack in the meantime will be home at his day; will rest himself a little beside Jane at Chelsea; then off for Manchester, and home to Scotsbrig with my Mother, where perhaps the whole of us almost may meet ere long. As for me, my plan is to stay here a day or two yet; indeed so long as I find it not uncomfortable to stay, where could I be better? I will then go across to Edinburgh, stay there for perhaps a day, with John Gordon most probably; then forward to <supplied>[a]</supplied> place called Minto near Hawick, where a certain &#x201C;Reverend Mr Aitken&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Aitken; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270217-TC-DA-01"><sic>4:192</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1827-02-17">17 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> (who was in London lately) will earnestly welcome me; with whom and his Gi<supplied>[g]</supplied> and Scenery and Books I can surely put off a day or two without wear<supplied>[y]</supplied>ing: he finally will set me on my way to Langholm, and then I have but some twelve miles, <hi rend="italic">which</hi> will not beat me we may suppose! I think I have heard there is a coach from Langholm past Scotsbrig on certain days. I will write either to you or Jemmy again, if I want to be <hi rend="italic">met</hi> at Langholm, and name the day. Or if I do not want to be met, I will send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke, the sense of which is to be for you that I am coming <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. Probably the Coach will be the easiest way for us. If there had been an attainable Gig indeed&#x2014;but I believe there is none.&#x2014; In short, my dear Brother, you are to learn from this scrawl that all the strangers <pb id="pg-10-147" n="10:147"/>are on their way homewards; that I for one am here, and likely to be with you in few days hence. How many days I cannot yet say; it may be in a week, it may not be for ten days; we will wait for the Newspaper with one stroke. This for the present is all the news: our Post is setting off in very few minutes; I have had to write at the top of my speed. The rest we will reserve for <hi rend="italic">speech</hi>. Jack had kind messages to you all; he was well, and ought to be over the Alps ten days ago, and perhaps about Paris by this time. Jane was in her usual state of health, certainly not worse, when I left home: a lady<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Elliot, b.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>No doubt you are much surprised to see me date in answer to you from Kirkcaldy, the &#x201C;Long Toun.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210219-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:328</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-02-19">19 Feb. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> I had done with long ago; but I will explain how it is. For several weeks, indeed all summer I had been suffering as I usually do from London dust and London tumult; and regretting considerably that I had not fled to the country directly on the ending of my Lectures. But Jack&#x2019;s Ladies with their constant change of schemes had prevented that, and now only the present and <pb id="pg-10-149" n="10:149"/>the future belonged to me. Jack too, as you would see by his Letter, was indeed absolutely coming, but not for some weeks yet, not till the good weather would be mostly gone. Now as my sleeplessness and restless <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi>ness still continued, as various persons, the Ferguses of Kirkcaldy among others, had invited me pressingly to pay them visits, I did at last (Jane encouraging me) get under way and on board of an Edinburgh steamer, last Saturday; and so, winds and waves proving moderately favourable, here I am since Tuesday last,&#x2014;very greatly bettered already by the shaking up I have had. I thought long whether I should not take Manchester by the road; but it struck me I might readily enough arrive at the wrong time there, and at any rate that you would grudge to see me go to Scotsbrig by myself: so I came this way, and calculate now that I shall meet you at Scotsbrig. Thus it stands. Jack&#x2019;s Letter, which I forwarded to you exactly about the day you and Jenny were writing off to me; this Letter (which I hope you got, tho&#x2019; it was addressed to Jarman Street) would instruct you what we had to look for from the Doctor. I calculate that he will stay only a day or two in London; that he will then come to Manchester (if all be ready) by himself, and so bring you home that we may all meet on the Annan shore. If I were to be in Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">long</hi> before you, and you <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi> to get home, I would run over myself by the Steamer and fetch you: but I think we shall perhaps all arrive moderately near one another by mere course of things, and all prove right without effort of mine. For besides this Kirkcaldy visit, I have to give a glance at Edinburgh as I pass, and then to spend some days with Aitken the Minister of Minto near Hawick, who was with us in London lately; so that we may hope Jack will have arrived, and you be about ready to start with him by the time I get sight of the Solway again. This then is the figure of the thing, dear Mother; you are to fancy me waiting here, and slowly wending southward, in hope of a glad meeting for all of us in Scotsbrig soon. I add only that Jane was moderately stout when I came away, and anxious mainly that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would get a little better. A Lady of her acquaintance, now travelling for six weeks in Germany, had lent her a nice little carriage of the <hi rend="italic">clatch</hi> sort, with horse and man, in which she could go driving about, and there were two or three friends of hers at hand; so that she was likely to do very well till my return. All are very kind to me and her.</p>
<p>As for myself no man is better off since I got hither. The people are proud to have me, and are in themselves good people, amply provided for both with kindliness of spirit, and with worldly goods. They are two elderly unmarried sisters, and one unmarried brother, John Fergus, lately Member of Parliament, but who has now given it up, and lives <pb id="pg-10-150" n="10:150"/>here minding his own farming and flax-manufacturing, one of the jolliest, healthiest best-conditioned of men. They have set me on a fine horse, swift strong and quiet, on which I scour about for some two hours daily. D<supplied>[aily]</supplied> too I bathe in the beautiful blue sea-water, at what hour I li<supplied>[ke.]</supplied> For the rest they <hi rend="italic">let me alone:</hi> all is rightly arranged about their house<supplied>[.]</supplied> I sleep sound, eat moderately, bathe and ride, and go along as well as anybody could wish. It is quite wonderful to myself what an improvement is made in my health since I got here. Let me be thankful for it. So long as I can stay here without wearying, it will be good for me to stay I think.</p>
<p>I wrote yesterday to Alick, explaining as I have now done to you. I despatched you a Newspaper that day I arrived. I will study to send you at least one weekly till I get to Scotsbrig. I have written to Jane; but she cannot write to me till I write again, my motions are so uncertain. My chief anxiety at present is about poor Jenny: you must send a note to Jane at Chelsea instantly when there is any news of her; Jane will then know how to write to me. In the meanwhile all I can appoint you to do is to send a Newspaper to me within three or four days of your getting this; addressed &#x201C;care of the Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> David Aitken, Minto, Hawick&#x201D;: two strokes will indicate that nothing is wrong; if all were <hi rend="italic">over</hi> and had gone well, I would take <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke as a symptom of that, and be right glad to see it. If anything of the smallest moment occur with me, I will write to you again wherever I be.</p>
<p>And so dear Mother accept this hastiest dud of a Letter, as better than none, and indeed the best I can give at present. Our Post prevents deliberate writing; unless you do it the day before!&#x2014; Thank good little Jenny for her help in writing me that letter; thank <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> too, for I am much obliged to you both. Let me hope, you continue well, in spite of the <hi rend="italic">clashy</hi> weather, and have had no return of illness.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had reported her &#x201C;compleet recovery&#x201D; from a &#x201C;not very serious&#x201D; ailment before she left for Manchester (<date when="1838-08-08">8 Aug.</date>).</note> Take care of yourself, and of the poor little <foreign>lassie</foreign>, till I see you&#x2014; Tell Robert that the Book Parcel did indubitably (Fraser says) leave London; but there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Agents of his in Manchester; it is probably lying with the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> one of these. I got their names: Sowles is the name of one; but I have forgot the other;&#x2014;&#x201C;Bankes&#x201D; or some such thing. If you know one, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can probably tell you of the other. The Books were I dare say of little value; but one would rather get them than not. I must end here, dear Mother; my pen is a most thriftless one; my letter is a perfect <hi rend="italic">splash</hi>; but what then?&#x2014; Mrs Welsh, I suppose I told you, is in Liverpool; attending to her sister-in-law,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Welsh.</note> who is not at all in good <pb id="pg-10-151" n="10:151"/>health. The weather is often rainy here; the crops all the way up from London looked extremely backward.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself my dear Mother, and let us hope to meet again soon once more under this sun.</p>

<salute>My own Jeannie,</salute>
<p>Elizabeth has got me a frank for tomorrow; and as our post sets off early in the day, I must write you a word this afternoon; another word can, if need is, be added in the morning. I have indeed nothing at all to say; but you will thank me for saying even nothing in black on white. So here goes.</p>
<p>From the mere date you will infer that things go moderately right with me, since I still continue here. In fact my day of departure and all future movements are as unfixed as ever. I have written to John Gordon requesting to be apprised by return of post whether he could lodge me for a night in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: but now as after <hi rend="italic">two</hi> posts there comes no answer from John, I infer that he is out of Town, and all is still at sea with me there. As the shortest method of arrangement, I determine to go across the water (the day after tomorrow with John Fergus), and see with my own eyes who is there, who not: we shall return again that same day, but shall have decided most probably what day I am to leave this for good and all; at lowest I calculate on seeing Sam Aitken<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200000-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:219</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1820-01-01">1 Jan. 1820</date></corr></ref>) lived at 106 Lauriston Place; his bookshop, still known as Bell &#x26; Bradfute&#x2019;s as well as Aitken&#x2019;s, was at 12 Bank St.</note> or at the <hi rend="italic">very</hi> lowest Sam Aitken&#x2019;s shop. My chief message to you therefore is an announcement now how you may write to me; by directing namely to the care of Sam. Take a sheet, my good Duckie, the instant you get this read, and send me your news, with or without frank; directed &#x201C;Care of &#x26;c Bank Street Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D;; I will tell Sam or Sam&#x2019;s people to keep it for me or what to do with it; I shall then know something definite, of Chelsea at least, a thing I am growing anxious to do. <pb id="pg-10-152" n="10:152"/>From no other quarter is it so much as possible that I should get news. I have written to Alick, written to my Mother at Manchester; but neither of them have a fixed mark of my whereabouts; my Mother is directed to write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that I may hear. You will get this on Wednesday; suppose you do not write till Thursday I shall still get it on Saturday,&#x2014;ah me! almost a week yet; but it is the soonest possible. I got your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, about an hour after my Note went off; I got also your <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, and noticed the extract from the Article <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi> in it: perhaps Editor Wilson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Wilson; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:242</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, <date when="1838-08-21">21 Aug.</date>, ended &#x201C;Wilberforce and Sir Walter Scott&#x2014;their Biographers criticised,&#x201D; with a quotation from TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; described as &#x201C;the best review article which has yet appeared on his life and writings.&#x201D;</note> sent it you on that ground? My Goody&#x2019;s two strokes were better than any conceivable extract. I have also sent you a Newspaper once, and intend that in defect of letters you shall not want for that sort of service.&#x2014; How rapidly my &#x201C;nothing in black on white&#x201D; is going on! Let me try at least to give you some glimpse of our manner of existence here.</p>
<p>Our party you already know; Elizabeth you know, and probably Miss Jessie, a most jocose, blithe-smiling, good-doing blonde-insipid young lady of a certain age, wearisome a little, yet easy to live with, and whom it is a shame to speak otherwise than admiringly of. John Fergus, our landlord, is a man-mountain for size, &#x201C;most athletic and best-natured of men&#x201D;; very conversible, rational, and well-conditioned every way; an active extensive farmer and manufacturer, who does much business daily, and daily takes a fair swill of the good things of life along with him; a man whom I like rather better, as I know him rather better. Healthy limitation, that is the rule of things here; dashed pretty considerably with the virtuous-insipid: all right and well. My bedroom is the back bedroom; I should have had the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> had you been with me, and a bell in it! None of the rest seem to have bells; a grave defect, which I have learned to get over now. I awake generally above an hour too early, but put off the time in some tolerable way; this morning, for example, at half past seven, I sallied out in blustering wind, and plunged myself into the sea, an adventurous but rather successful step, which perhaps when there is not rain I shall repeat. Shaving and deliberate dressing carries one on to nine o&#x2019;clock, when some kind of thing (a gong I think) gives a huge low growl somewhere in the lower premises and indicates that breakfast is on the table. A most plenteous breakfast, in the many good things of which, except tea and coffee (with some eminent ham, overdone in frying), I must hesitate to partake. Slowly with some loose conversation we breakfast, a certain <pb id="pg-10-153" n="10:153"/>old Surgeon one Johnston<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Brown Johnston (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), FRCS, <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>; burgess of Edinburgh, <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>. His surgery was at 243, his house at 245, High St., Kirkcaldy.</note> (the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bailie&#x2019;s brother)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Johnston had held various posts in Edinburgh town council, including bailie and lord dean of guild, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">17</date>.</note> stalks in daily, with hardly any speech at all, to look at the newspaper, and stalks out again: they say he has done it daily these fifteen years! Our breakfast done, the ladies leave us for the drawing room: and after a due space; we remaining two do also withdraw, John to his counting house or to his farms till five in the afternoon, I to my own premises or to the drawing room, or whither I list. Hitherto almost every morning there has been a hurried letter to write, for the South Post leaves at twelve; London letters not <hi rend="italic">arriving</hi> (which is unlucky) till after one. After one, however, the post has arrived too, and the Newspaper; after which there is clearly nothing to be looked for from the world; you are then clearly &#x201C;left to your own intrepidity and force of purpose.&#x201D; Our dames, I suppose, go out charity-ing,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were presumably the founders of The Misses Fergus&#x2019; Initiatory Charity School.</note> fowl-feeding, marketing; as for me I smoke, I have books, I have the sea and the highways. These two last especially: I have bathed hitherto every day (except yesterday when John had me out riding far and wide among his farms); I have also ridden two hours or more every day,&#x2014;putting on bad clothes if it rain; in bright days, with the fresh woods, clear hilltops, with the blue everlasting deep and the Bass<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bass Rock, 350 ft. high, off the coast of East Lothian.</note> and Lothian ever and anon in sight, and a swift beast to carry you, it is as pleasant riding as could be contrived. The people here are nearly all grown utter strangers to me; but yonder is the old Bass Rock, yonder is my poor Jeannie&#x2019;s birthland, and twenty years of fateful time are written on them for me. O my dear <foreign>bairn</foreign>, if I had thee here, I feel as if I should be quite happy for a while. We are to come next year when the <hi rend="italic">great</hi> house is done building:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ferguses lived at 252 High St., Kirkcaldy. By TC&#x2019;s next visit in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> the Ferguses had moved into the &#x201C;great house.&#x201D;</note> we actually will, I think; shall we not? It is a tolerably good sign of me, when I long to have loved ones near me, especially sharptempered wives; accordingly I do incline to say that I have made considerable improvement this week, tho&#x2019; the hours do not suit me altogether. But to proceed: the gong growls again at half past five, and luncheoned, or unluncheoned as I, but all in full dress of solemn black with what of silk is fit, we solemnly descend to dinner. There is free allowance of good things amany; of good wines among others, in which latter I think I shall cease or nearly so to partake: two glasses, one glass, four glasses, <pb id="pg-10-154" n="10:154"/>a glass of whisky punch, all seem to do me mischief alike. A walk ensues, executed by John and me about the doors, I smoking as I walk; then, near eight I suppose, is found limited supply of excellent tea, and talk in which I have to do more than I want, till on the stroke of ten enter <foreign><hi rend="italic">gar&#x26;ccedil;on</hi></foreign> again with a tray of bottles, with two biscuits, and the promise (now fulfilled) to me of a plate of tolerable porridge. Ill-arranged, you see! Two hours or three farther from dinner, it were all right. At half-past ten, &#x201C;candles&#x201D; are ordered, but not brought to us; they are stuck in our rooms, fine wax lights, and we are all sent marching thither at that very early hour. Indeed a certain solemnity is throughout visible here; a great dressing and washing; manifold creatures carrying off your clothes to ever new brushings, &#x26;c, &#x26;c: but all is right at bottom, and you do find yourself served, and that a hospitable spirit, better every way than common, encircles you. We seem to have in the regular way no visitors. There is a Miss Drysdale, a queer broad ancient maid, farmeress who &#x201C;makes draining-tiles&#x201D;; she runs out and in at present; but she is an old friend, on visit in the neighbourhood.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably either a sister of the Misses Drysdale, 246 High St., or John Drysdale, Town Clerk, 85 High St.</note> We had Ferguson of Raith<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Ferguson (ca. <date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), advocate, <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>; M.P. for Fife, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">7</date>, for Kirkcaldy Burghs, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date> (before and after John Fergus), for Haddington, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>.

<p>Eleven o&#x2019;clock is surely just at hand; here too is Elizabeth with a Note in her hand, which she has left. My end is come for the present. Write dear Goody, as I bid thee.

<salute>Dear Goody,</salute>
<p>Your two Newspapers were handed in to me this morning while shaving; they had been forwarded from Bank Street, where your dear little Letter (nay it was a long full Letter) lay waiting for me duly on Saturday.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1838-09-01">1 Sept.</date></note> That is a good <foreign>lassie</foreign>! There is nothing like punctuality. I should have been disappointed beyond expression had you failed on that occasion; but you did not fail.&#x2014; Today there is nothing but rain past, present and future: wherefore I have fled from a dull company, while it is not yet noon, into the Minister&#x2019;s study; and will here with all copiousness splash down what is needful to bring forward the record, and answer as I have been answered. The invaluable Mintos moreover, it would seem, have the will and power to frank: the only thing against me is the damp <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, which makes my hand and my very jaws go shivering as in ague (for we have no fires anywhere); this and a bad unmendable pen&#x2014;must even be put up with.</p>
<p>I have been here since Tuesday evening (it is now Thursday); I left Kirkcaldy that morning between seven and eight, in dim rainy weather, and did not arrive here till about the same hour in the evening; rain, dull company, fatigue and want of dinner being the main features of the day. The Kirkcaldy visit may be said to have gone off with complete effect. Nothing could be kinder, politer, more attentive than the good Ferguses were, one and all of them. They seemed to like me, and I really felt grateful for what they did and forebore to do. Not even Miss Jane<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A third Fergus sister. See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370717-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:248</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-07-17">17 July 1837</date></corr></ref> for an earlier reference where she was not identified.</note> &#x201C;with the eyes all about&#x201D; but made herself agreeable at last: she had joined us, some three days before it ended, returning from Aberdeen with an inane-pacific Mr Royd<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the Royd whom Jane Fergus was to marry.</note> (brother of the one we saw); tho&#x2019; full of mincings and affected ways, and even of coquetries, and very questionable in my eyes at first, she too recommended herself, and the inane Mr Royd her squire <foreign><hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi></foreign> recommended himself, and all was well. John Fergus is really a good fellow, tho&#x2019; with a dash of the Kirkcaldy gigman in him; a right healthy hearty merry fellow; &#x201C;Miss Jessie&#x201D; too has <hi rend="italic">real</hi> jocosity, nay she rose that <pb id="pg-10-163" n="10:163"/>morning I came off, and sque<supplied>[e]</supplied>zed my hand with a real air of friendliness and regret that touched me with the like sentiment. In short it is all settled, Goodykin, that we are <hi rend="italic">both</hi> to go back next year if we prosper, and make a right thing of it. To me it has been truly beneficial I think, and I am certain it was often truly pleasant; I rode every day but two, some times a matter of twenty miles; I bathed every day but two: the very sight of the green hilly country, of the everlasting rocks and divine sea-water, with Scotch faces ancient and new (for the very infants had a broad miniature Scotchhood interesting to me): all this, as one galloped about in it in the bright autumn, made up a kind of inarticulate Poem, most sad, most beautiful: &#x201C;a good joy.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> You must thank Elizabeth yourself by a speedy threepenny; you are she that beats us all for a deep threepenny. Besides Elizabeth herself was about writing to you when I came off; <foreign>mal</foreign> arrangements not my own prevented me from leaving a line to go with it: there was a Letter from Ellen&#x2019;s sister, whom also I called and saw as I passed on to the Harbour: the whole package I fancy must be already in your hands before this can arrive. But let us quit the lyrical; let us take the historical.</p>
<p>On the day my Letter specified, John Fergus and I went over to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: the bright day saddened down very soon into gloom and rain; my history there that day was absurd enough: all mortals out of town! I called first at your Uncle Robert&#x2019;s:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Welsh, S.S.C., 60 Northumberland St. In a letter to TC, <date when="1839-05-14">14 May 1839</date>, he said: &#x201C;I saw the card which you had left at my house in Autumn when I came home; but, not having heard anything of you,&#x2014;and the servant not being able to tell me anything about it, I thought that it had been an old card of yours which had been turned up by the annual cleaning of the house at that season.&#x201D;</note> gone to the West Country for a month.

In one word, I went splashing about till all my Cards were exhausted, and not a soul was to be found at home. Not even Miss Ferrier<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Ferrier (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), novelist: <hi rend="italic">Marriage</hi> (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Inheritance</hi> (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), and <hi rend="italic">Destiny</hi> (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>). She lived at 10 Nelson St.</note> could I see; tho&#x2019; Elizabeth had straitly charged me to call, Miss F. being an ardent admirer of the &#x26;c: but she too was from home at the moment, she wrote over next day a melancholy Note to say that she could not even see me as I returned being herself called out of town in the interim. Sam Aitken alone of men did I speak to, brisk, rapid as ever, tho&#x2019; a little wrinkly about the eyes, and with head grown very decidedly grey. In a kind of despair I went into Ambrose&#x2019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Noted tavern; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260620-TC-TM-01"><sic>4:107</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1826-06-20">20 June 1826</date></corr></ref>. Robert Welsh commented: &#x201C;I am not surprized that you got a very uncomfortable meal at Ambrose&#x2019;s. It never was a good house,&#x2014;even in Ambrose&#x2019;s time. It was the very reverse of what the Professor pictured it in his Noctes. Had he exerted his imagination in the opposite way he could scarcely have exceeded the truth&#x201D; (<date when="1839-05-14">14 May 1839</date>).</note> for a pipe and spoonful of grog: but, <pb id="pg-10-164" n="10:164"/>alas, Ambrose himself is dead, and all has gone among them too. At half past four o&#x2019;clock John Fergus came with his <foreign>shandrydan</foreign> [old-fashioned chaise], and carried me back to Newhaven and Fife again. On the Saturday appointed for your Letter, I was luckier: your Letter would have come to me (by arrangement with Sam) next day; but I could not wait; besides the little Duke had written to me in the interim, a card of mine with my address having been left for him at Moray Place;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >24, Jeffrey&#x2019;s town house in the New Town.</note> I also wanted to see the Lecture man,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Nichol; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380714-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-07-14">14 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; as it proved, I failed in that, he too was &#x201C;in the country, Sir.&#x201D;&#x2014; Well, but at two o&#x2019;clock I was hastening towards Sam&#x2019;s along Princes Street, when what female figure should start towards me but Mrs Hickson! &#x201C;Mr&#x201D; &#x2019;Ickson on a commission of inquiry about handloom weavers; <hi rend="italic">so</hi> glad to see you; beautifullest town in the world; lovely town; could live here forever&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Hickson, b.

But at Sam&#x2019;s&#x2014;there lay the Letter! It is all right my Goody, all very right. I read it there, and again on the Calton Hill, whither I had retired with it and a cigar, and all Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and the Firth in clear sunshine at my feet: to spend some twenty minutes I had in the perfectest felicity attainable at the time. Thanks for that letter!</p>
<p>Jeffrey to whom I had written in answer to his Note, sat by appointment at half past two waiting for me at Moray Place. We talked long, in the style of literary and philosophic clitter-clatter; finally it was settled that I should go out with him to dinner at Craigcrook, and not return to Fife till the morrow; for which accident too the Ferguses were prepared. Sam Aitken and I had previously settled that I was to go with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> on Tuesday to Minto. At the due hour I joined the Duke at his Town house, and we walked out together as in old times. The Empsons were still there, tho&#x2019; about to move southward in some ten days; Mrs Jeffrey and they welcomed me, all alone. The evening was not on the whole equal to a good solitary one. The Duke talked immensely and made me talk; but it struck me he was grown weaker; or is it I that have been used to better talk? Empson was prosy as ever, somnolence itself; nay more than once before bedtime he actually did sleep and even snore. Charlotte looks well contented, mysterious, silent and <hi rend="italic">spoony</hi> as ever; Empson altogether <foreign>kedge</foreign> [eager] on the <pb id="pg-10-165" n="10:165"/>subject, at times next to absurd. Their Life seemed to me to hold out an unbounded prospect of sleepy prose; <foreign>ennui</foreign> without limit, endured without reluctance. To crown the whole, Mrs Jeffrey&#x2019;s tea was too good; I made a most imperfect sleep with immense effort, and was glad to be set down at my steamboat again on the morrow morning. My bed was in <hi rend="italic">our</hi> old room: ah me! The poor Duke and I seemed to have made up our minds <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to contradict each other; but it was at the expence of saying nothing intimate: on the whole we managed it; and my esteem for Jeffrey could not hide from me that at bottom our speech was, as I said, <hi rend="italic">clatter</hi>. In fact he is becoming an amicable old fribble; very cheerful, very heartless, very forgettable and tolerable! Compliments to you were many. I like the Lady best there.</p>
<p>But now, not to tire you with more of this, fancy me set down at Minto from the Minister&#x2019;s vehicle, which waited for us at &#x201C;Ancrum Bridge&#x201D;;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ancrum was five mi. NE of Minto and ca. forty-eight mi. SE of Edinburgh.</note> fancy me be-rained ever since; and for the present not happy here! It is a strange plump I have made from the solemn iron-spring gigmanity of Fergusdom into the vapid element of notability, sumptuosity with wooden-spring gigmanity, that environs me here. Minto Manse is a Dilettantism, the whole existence of man and thing is that here. Poor Bess is not well. Sam Aitken with his rude fun and voracity of nature, to which I am getting used, is the main thing we have to depend on. There came with us a certain Mr Lindsay (I think) Wine Merchant Leith;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Lindsay, 25 Quality St., Leith.</note> the inanity of whom transcends all I have met for several years; he goes tomorrow: poor fellow, he is very goodnatured too; why do I complain of him? Nay, am not I a traitor to speak otherwise than handsomely and praisingly of persons so kind to me? They are all goodnatured and very good: But&#x2014;but&#x2014;these three mornings I have wakened hours too early; that is it! Today I had settled that I was to quit on Saturday morning, for Hawick, then to Langholm by Coach, and Jamie to meet me there from Scotsbrig; I had the pen up to write to that effect before writing to you. But David pleaded, and then modestly gave in; after which poor Bess herself came in to plead, &#x201C;till next week at any rate&#x201D;: so that I could not resist, but said we would &#x201C;put it off then&#x201D; till monday or so. My only guidance to you is, that you may address now, as soon as you like, <hi rend="italic">to Scotsbrig</hi>; I shall in all likelihood be there before it. I learn moreover by a Letter which Sam shewed me that your Mother is probably still at Templand; I wrote to her from Kirkcaldy to have a letter for me at Scotsbrig, and <pb id="pg-10-166" n="10:166"/>I would if she were still at Templand make my way to her speedily.&#x2014; O Goody, enough of this confused Narrative style! Thou seest how it is: &#x201C;to Scotsbrig,&#x201D; it all lies in that.</p>
<p>What a touching thing is that fifty pounds from America! One prays that the blessing of him that was <hi rend="italic">rather ill off</hi> may be with them, these good friends of mine. Courage, my Goody! I begin to feel as if one might grow to be moderately content with a lot like mine. All <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be well yet. What did you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> with the bill? Laid it by?&#x2014; The only deficiency on your despatch is the want of news from Jack, who I thought would have sent some token of himself before now. Of course you will now forward such welcome tidings without delay. From Manchester too there comes nothing? I had a Newspaper this day with Rob&#x2019;s hand on it and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke: does that indicate that the business is well over there? They were to write to you; I shall hear in two days after you hear, whenever that may be. Poor John Sterling! It is really &#x201C;very absurd.&#x201D; The &#x201C;old ass&#x201D; is as well away I think. Ramsgate is as good a plan as can be; go by all means if you can: nay if Jack have not come, I hope you are there even now. The very sound of the sea has health in it for me. By the bye Eliz. Fergus and her Sister<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jessie. Jane Fergus seems to have lived with them only occasionally.</note> are to live at Hastings this winter; they calculate on your coming down to see them there; it is but some sixty miles.</p>
<p>O Goody of me was there ever such a blockhead of a Letter! And now it is getting towards 3 o&#x2019;clock, and the rain has become Scotch mist; and I must walk or do worse. Accept the will for the deed, poor little <foreign>Bairn!</foreign> Ah me, I wish I were&#x2014;but no matter. I kiss thee a hundred times. Be well and cheerful. Send Jack hither to me; I think I will not stay <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest</salute></closer></p>

We have printed half the matter. I should presently begin to print the remainder inclusive of the Article on Scott in two more volumes. but now I think I shall wait until I hear from you. Of those books we will print a larger edition say 1250 or 1500 if you want a part of it in London for I feel confident now that our public is a thousand strong.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having arrived within sight of my old friend Skiddaw again, I naturally bethink me of the new far kinder friend who lives sheltered about the roots of Skiddaw. I have been in Fife, in Edinburgh, in Roxburghshire; I got hither on Saturday night last. My appetite for locomotion, at no time vehement, is altogether satisfied now, and more, but I should heartily grudge to leave the North Country without at least an effort towards seeing one I like so well. Pray instruct me therefore what your capabilities are; that I may compare them with mine, that we may calculate, and see what will come of it. This place, my Mother&#x2019;s dwelling place, is not above twenty miles from Carlisle City, the Cathedral of which in good weather is visible from any of our knolls. Carlisle is attainable any day along the Glasgow Highway without difficulty; one might be there about noon or one o&#x2019;clock; nay in the afternoon (arriving, I should fancy, between three and four) there is a Coach that passes within some two miles of me. Beyond Carlisle, all is Chaos, Nox and&#x2014;Elysium!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:543.</note> Finally, till about this day week I could not well get away; if indeed then, or at all; for all is out of square here: <pb id="pg-10-173" n="10:173"/>my Brother belated in his return from Italy, my Mother still but <hi rend="italic">expected</hi> out of Lancashire, &#x26;c. &#x26;c. Not to mention again that I myself am sated with locomotion, and sinking daily deeper into unutterable brown-study, Werterean reminiscences, torpor and <foreign><hi rend="italic">far-niente</hi></foreign> [do-nothing]. This is the posture of things on my side of the Water; now what of yours? I will answer you in words; in deeds I will perform for the common cause what I can.</p>
<p>The Colonial secretary<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of TC&#x2019;s names for James Spedding.</note> must be with you; enjoying the blessed Scotch mists. Pray remember me affectionately to him,&#x2014;you may also, before my advent, inquire privily of him Whether he is provided with a tobacco-pipe. He will be, or has been, astonished to learn that John Sterling is not within the Four Seas<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Britain; cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320629-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:180&#x2013;81</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-06-29">29 June 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> now, but suddenly off to Italy for the winter.</p>
<p>I write no more, with this bad pen, with this pale ink, but subscribe myself, with much hearty regard, and high hopes of meeting now or afterwards,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding replied, <date when="1838-09-16">16 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;We are three generations under one roof, with no great store of Philosophy among us, but a fair modicum of sincerity and tobacco.&#x201D; He and James tried to visit TC at Ecclefechan on Mon., <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, but &#x201C;made a failure in our attempt to run you to earth&#x201D; (A.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here I am again, at my old table, with my old apparatus, writing to you, to see if I can forward a meeting betwixt us soon.</p>
<p>I left Kirkcaldy on Tuesday morning gone a week; went on that day to Minto by a very tedious route, and arrived very cold, with dull companions (two Edinburgh friends of the Minister&#x2019;s),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sam Aitken and James Lindsay.</note> about seven in the evening. Robert&#x2019;s Newspaper, which had wandered about for some time, being addressed &#x201C;H<hi rend="italic">i</hi>wick,&#x201D; did nevertheless arrive at &#x201C;Minto, Hawick, N.B.&#x201D; the next morning after myself; and was right gladly welcomed by me, the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke indicating as I thought that all had <pb id="pg-10-174" n="10:174"/>turned out well with you;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander had written to TC, <date when="1838-08-08">8 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I may mention here, in case I should forget that my mother on arriving at Manchester will immediately forward a newspaper to you with only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke in the cover.&#x201D;</note> as I have since, with great satisfaction, specifically ascertained that it did. Minto, in rainy weather, with dull people, was no sojourn for me after Kirkcaldy; so, in the gracefullest manner possible for me, I made myself loose of it on Saturday morning; was whirled along in the Minister&#x2019;s vehicle to Hawick; and then found an Edinburgh and Carlisle Coach with a seat on it, which swiftly brought me on to Langholm.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The coach took about two and a half hours.</note> I remembered Tibbie and Hugh at Hawick, but had no time at all to make any inquiry about them.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s maternal aunt Isabella (&#x201C;Tibbie&#x201D;) Aitken McKinnon (d. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:319</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb. 1828</date></corr></ref>) and her husband Hugh McKinnon, a tailor or stocking-maker at Hawick (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280911-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:403</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-09-11">11 Sept. 1828</date></corr></ref>). In later letters the name is also spelled McKinnow.</note> From Langholm I got a Gig with a squinting talkative driver to forward me; and arrived here safe about five in the afternoon. Poor Isabella<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s wife, who was expecting a child in <date when="1838-11-00">Nov.</date></note> was, as she now constantly is, in bed; I was very sorry to find her ill and helpless. I had not calculated on that. However, I got into your premises here; Jamie soon came home from the hill; a daughter of Ben Rae&#x2019;s,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Local schoolmaster who taught Jean (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:305</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-03-21">21 March 1825</date></corr></ref>). His da. may have been Barbara Rae, dressmaker, of Ecclefechan.</note> a smart young woman happened to be here: they were all as kind as possible; Jamie is most assiduous; and so ever since we have lived along here wonderfully well. I am greatly bettered by my Kirkcaldy expedition; for I bathed daily, and rode daily: if I had you safe here, we should be all very right as things go.</p>
<p>Sandy would have it that yesternight you would come. I accordingly went down to Annan, and waited anxiously enough till the Steamer got to shore: Passengers many, but no Mother there for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> I had to return to Mary&#x2019;s; calculating that you would not come now, till you heard from me; that perhaps you were waiting for Jack (of whom I had then heard no word at all), or perhaps for me, to escort you over. I determined to write to-day; and went jogging home on my work-horse again. But now this morning there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a Letter from Jack: he has been detained by various <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but does calculate now on being home either on Saturday or Monday first.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1838-09-15">15</date> or <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept.</date> (John&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1838-09-04">4 Sept.</date> from Berne).</note> Jane I suppose has already told you this; for she said to me she had written to you by the same post as the frank came by. If we now knew that Jack <hi rend="italic">were</hi> arrived, and what his motions were in London, we should have it all before us. My notion is, he will not stay long in London, perhaps only a day or two; but one cannot say for certain; nor do I know rightly how <pb id="pg-10-175" n="10:175"/>you are situated at Manchester as to that yourself; so that there is something still of vague left about <hi rend="italic">your</hi> journey as well as his. Jamie and Isabella have much need of you here; we are all eager enough to see you back again. On the other hand, I do not think it is right or safe for you to travel in railways &#x26;c by yourself; I decidedly say you must be escorted at least into the Steamer and out of it. My notion was, and in good part still i<supplied>[s]</supplied> that, without counting on Jack&#x2019;s motions, Robert should accompany you to Liverpool on Monday evening next, and see you safe put into the Royal Victoria which sails that night: on no account are you to go by yourself, on no account to take other than a Cabin place (a sofa there is far preferable to nothing): about eleven o&#x2019;clock some of us will be on the Annan shore to receive you next morning; and in this way it will be all right. Nay Robert might send word before to Liverpool, and <hi rend="italic">secure</hi> you a berth. Take a thimbleful of brandy with you too, and on the whole <hi rend="italic">lie still;</hi> most of the sailing will be in the night. But on the other hand, dear Mother, if you would rather wait for John; pray do it without any scruple on my account: I am going up to Templand for a day (where Mrs Welsh I find still is); I have a visit to pay in Cumberland, if I like:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Thomas Spedding at Mirehouse.</note> in short can shift about here very well till you do come.&#x2014; So it remains uncertain. All we can fix is that some of us will be at Annan-foot on Tuesday to try for you: if you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come, we will of course look for a Letter either then, or sooner which will be better. Sandy got me an old gig from Dumfries yesterday; I will drive you up in that if you come.</p>
<p>They are all well at Dumfries and hereabouts, all except poor Isabella, whose ailment too is not reckoned dangerous. Jane sends nothing but good news from London. We are all heartily glad that poor Jenny has got thro&#x2019;: give my affectionate regards to her, and to the poor little new Margaret[<supplied>. May she get good</supplied><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >] Bracketed words faded: reading conjectural.</note> and ill of Life then. May she grow to be a big Margaret and a good and happy one!&#x2014; There is not a moment of time remaining; I have been writing other Letters: Jamie waits impatient. On Tuesday then? <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever affectionately yours</salute></closer>

<ps><p>If you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> come on Tuesday, pray send a Newspaper to Jane in London with <hi rend="italic">one stroke</hi> on it; I will appoint that to be a sign that you are off. Send it off on Sabbath, Saturday if you can. If Jack be there, he will then know about you.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Goody,</salute>
<p>Many thanks are due for that punctuality of despatch, for those bright little Letters you send me. They are the liveliest of Letters, which gives me pleasure because it shews a lively Goody, cheerful and well. They send good news otherwise too; and seem to have the faculty of finding good news to send. Jamie brought me in the last, on the due morning, before breakfast; and a right seasoning it was to one&#x2019;s morning meal; a thing to set one up for days to come! The frank also has arrived, and all goes well. I must now scribble you a word in continuation: on Monday morning you will look for a word, and ought not to be altogether disappointed.</p>
<p>Our Minto visit could not be called a successful one, but we made it <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, we got thro&#x2019; it as gracefully as was feasible. The rain continued on us there, and the rather boisterous dulness, and the dilettantism and discontent. Bess was not in very good health at all, nor could I ever get into anything like free communication with her. The Minister himself in fine got dyspeptical, nervous, &#x201C;a Procter without the genius&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Bryan Waller Procter (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>), see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231014-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:451</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-10-14">14 Oct. 1823</date></corr></ref>. Ironic, as most of TC&#x2019;s references to Procter were derogatory (cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:50</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:219</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>), though John Carlyle once said of him: &#x201C;He <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a spark of the Divine within him&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18310226-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:234</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-02-26">26 Feb. 1831</date></corr></ref>).</note> he had a frightful gathering of voracious, bibacious dullards, one day, to see Sam, and never did more good after. We talked together considerably, he and I; but it was too clear there was no conversation so pleasant to David as the sound of his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> wish-wash, which on the other hand was to me infinitely insipid. I tried again to like the really harmless and hospitably minded man; but did not succeed a whit better than of old; so gave it up as a thing I could not do. He is of a fatal species; a Half-and-half to the backbone of him, without earnestness, truth of soul, or sincerity of any kind that I could see, except sincere admiration for himself. Old Bradfute&#x2019;s money has made a Manse nicknackety beyond all others, but it has not made any man or woman comfortable. Peace be with them, the good people! I got off on Saturday morning after all, in a smooth way; and do not mean to return soon. Let poor David be as well as he can without me; with me he can only be worse! I suppose he will quit his Parsonage before long, and come perhaps to&#x2014;London for a time!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Aitken (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270217-TC-DA-01"><sic>4:192</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1827-02-17">17 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>) remained at Minto until he retired in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deus avertat</hi></foreign> [God prevent].

<p>For you are to understand that poor Isabella is entirely laid up with sickliness, or rather with pure debility and little pain attending it; lies constantly in bed; and has no hope, the Doctor says, of rising from it, till&#x2014;a certain event happen, not near at hand yet! Poor Jamie has rather a heavy handful, the farm-season so bad too; but he gets on wonderfully nevertheless: it would have done you good to see him bring in the tea-tray sometimes himself, and become valet of all work on my behalf! I kept out of all people&#x2019;s way; not even Grahame<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham of Burnswark.</note> (till this morning) could get hold of me; I did well enough, found it even interesting, so strange and solitary was I here, present in my birthland, and yet not present. To aggravate the matter there was no horse that one could ride on, no means of transport any whither. Alick went into Dumfries on Wednesday, and hired me the worst of gigs for three weeks at a shilling a day. Your Mother had no Letter waiting for me here, but one came on Monday; most brief; she had been in bed with headache, and could not write sooner, hardly even then. Having got my gig, I was about setting off for her yesterday; I had also written to Spedding, meaning to have Cumberland in reserve: but just at the nick of time we got some enigmatic notice from Manchester about a Steamer arriving; so we turned, Jamie and I, our vehicle towards Annan rather; and did then some half mile out of the burgh actually descry our Mother, mounted in Austin&#x2019;s cart faring safe homewards. She was overjoyed to see us; turned back with us &#x26;c; and is now here, busy as a bee: so that all is straight on that side now. She charges me to thank you most emphatically for your Letter to Manchester, which had made her &#x201C;as light as a feather all day&#x201D;; she says, &#x201C;whatever sort of Mother-in-law she be, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are the best of daughters-in-law,&#x201D;&#x2014;such a swift despatching little Goody; supreme in threepennies. I now think <pb id="pg-10-178" n="10:178"/>of Templand for Monday, back probably on Wednesday; then we shall wait for our Doctor from Italy; the Speddingian Answer will be here too: this is all the Past and all the Future I need speak about here. Jack ought to be with you today or Monday; we will look of course for an announcement as soon as may be: the late silence had become alarming almost, as well as tantalizing. If Jack (which I dare hardly expect) sit by you while you read this, bid him welcome once more to his own land; say I will not advise him or sway him by any influence, but should like extremely well to see him here without loss of an instant. Ben Nelson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:304</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> was searching for him in the Steamer last but one: so Ben said, whom I met while searching for my Mother by the same vessel. I had gone down, on some notion of Alick&#x2019;s, but of course was unsuccessful. I noticed Oliver Richardson<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370722-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:261</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-22">22 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> and Henry Duncan,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200126-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:223</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-01-26">26 Jan. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> very red and blousy both; but escaped them, being <hi rend="italic">thirsty</hi> &#x26;c and indisposed for salutations; I escaped Ben too <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, but he found me before tea was well done.&#x2014; In short, dear Goody, thou must say to Jack that I prognosticate he will spend very little time in London; that we shall have a letter appointing his day at Waterfoot of Annan, when I will, if Heaven please, attend with horse and <hi rend="italic">clatch</hi>, and take him hither once again. Finally, if Hanning send a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke, heed it not, for it <hi rend="italic">now</hi> means nothing. And so let me end this, before my paper altogether end.</p>
<p>You will still get to Ramsgate, will you not? It were a great pity <supplied>[to]</supplied> miss it, if it seem pleasant and still possible. Meanwhile drive about what you can, keep your heart light, and be well when I come. I do not think it will be long this time. The Spedding answer will hardly tempt me, unless Jack linger too long. I think it will be better to leave these grand North-of-England things all in a lump till we <hi rend="italic">both</hi> go, in a kind of state, next year? If the Fates will so turn it. We shall see.&#x2014; Emerson&#x2019;s Letter is very kind; I will write him some kind of answer, but cannot respond as to his printing scheme yet, till the actual Book have arrived, as specimen, and one can shew it to a Bookseller, and ask what terms he will give for it. Fraser or Saunders it is all one, I think: money is not procurable in this Island by that method, it would seem. At Edinburgh I wanted a copy of Sartor, poor beast, to send over to Elizabeth: Sam had got no copy, had never heard of it, and only then wrote off for some,&#x2014;such is the Saunderean energy! Depend on it, therefore, my bonny little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, all these vague things they tell thee about Sartor, are mere vague <foreign>blarney</foreign>;&#x2014; and think farther that <pb id="pg-10-179" n="10:179"/>we will not care a strand whether they are or not. No; a certain fair Critic long ago among the peatbogs<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC at Craigenputtoch.</note> declared Sartor to be a &#x201C;work of genius&#x201D;; and such it is and shall continue tho&#x2019; no copy of it should sell these hundred years. I agree with you farther that unless some Bookseller will make a specific offer of cash, we ought to leave these beneficent Americans to manage their own affair themselves.&#x2014; No word of Alzdorf or his Letter; indeed I rather doubt if Sam now knows my address properly: very well; but say so if you see the man.&#x2014; I have told you nothing about anybody here: it will all be better by word of mouth. Poor Mary is still depressed and <foreign><hi rend="italic">doure</hi></foreign> [gloomy] about the loss of her child; otherwise shifty, kind and helpful as ever. Ann Cook has &#x201C;a good place&#x201D;; attending upon some old dame somewhere in Lancashire. Alick is not altogether right yet, but much better than formerly: his traffic prospers beyond what could be looked for, and he seems more quieted, reconciling himself to his allotment: he is far greyer in the temples than I. It gives me the strangest feeling to plump suddenly into view of these conditions of existence: hearts so kind, a lot so sequestered; the sweep of Time passing on in these little creeks too as on the wide sea where I have to navigate. One can say nothing; one&#x2019;s heart is full of unutterabilities. But on the whole, Life is all great and unutterable; the little Ecclefechan shop, as the grand Napoleon empire, is embosomed in Eternity; a little Dream and yet a great Reality one even as the other.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Life-partner, dear little Goody of me.

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>There cannot any right answer be written you here and now; yet I must write, such answer as I can. You said, &#x201C;by steam-ship&#x201D;; and it strikes me with a kind of remorse, on this my first day of leisure and composure, that I have delayed so long. For you must know, this is my Mother&#x2019;s house,&#x2014;a place to me unutterable as Hades and the Land of Spectres were; likewise that my Brother is just home from Italy, and on the wing thitherward or somewhither swiftly again; in a word, that all is confusion and flutter with me here,&#x2014;fit only for <hi rend="italic">silence!</hi> My Wife sent me off hitherward, very sickly and unhappy, out of the London dust, several weeks ago; I lingered in Fifeshire, I was in Edinburgh, in Roxburghshire; have some calls to Cumberland, which I believe I must refuse; and prepare to creep homeward again, refreshed in health, but with a head and heart all seething and tumbling (as the wont is, in such cases), and averse to <hi rend="italic">pens</hi> beyond all earthly implements. But my Brother is off for Dumfries this morning; you before all others deserve an hour of my solitude. I will abide by business; one <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write about that.</p>
<p>Your Bill and duplicate of a Bill for &#xa3;50, with the two Letters that accompanied them, you are to know then, did duly arrive at Chelsea; and the larger Letter (of the <date when="1838-08-06">6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August</date>) was forwarded to me hither some two weeks ago. I had also, long before that, one of the friendliest of Letters from you with a clear and most inviting description of the Concord Household, its inmates and appurtenances; and the announcement, evidently authentic, that an apartment and heart&#x2019;s welcome was ready there for my Wife and me; that we were to come quickly, and stay for a twelvemonth. Surely no man has such friends as I. We ought to say, May the Heavens give us thankful hearts! For in truth there are blessings which do, like sun-gleams in wild weather, make this rough life beautiful with rainbows here and there. Indicating, I suppose, that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a Sun, and general Heart of Goodness, behind all that;&#x2014;for which, as I say again, let us be thankful evermore.</p>
<p>My Wife says she received your American Bill of so many pounds <pb id="pg-10-186" n="10:186"/>sterling for the Revolution Book, with a &#x201C;pathetic feeling,&#x201D; which brought &#x201C;tears&#x201D; to her eyes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> From beyond the waters there is a hand held out; beyond the waters too live brothers. I would only the Book were an Epic, a <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> or undying thing, that New England might boast in aftertimes of this feat of hers, and put stupid poundless and penniless Old England to the blush about it! But after all, that is no matter; the feebler the well-meant Book is, the more &#x201C;pathetic&#x201D; is the whole transaction: and so we will go on, fuller than ever of &#x201C;desperate hope&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18340320-TC-SA-01"><sic>9:399</sic><corr>TC to SA, <date when="1834-03-20">20 March 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> (if you know what that is), with a feeling one would not give and could not get for several money-bags; and say or think, Long live true friends and Emerson,&#x2014;and (in Scotch phrase) &#x201C;may ne&#x2019;er <foreign>waur</foreign> [worse] be amang us&#x201D;!&#x2014; I will buy something permanent, I think, out of this &#xa3;50, and call it either <hi rend="italic">Ebenezer</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in the stone Ebenezer that Samuel raised in commemoration of divine assistance (1 Sam. 7:12).</note> or <hi rend="italic">Yankee-doodle-doo</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;something&#x201D; became a horse, to be called &#x201C;Yankee,&#x201D; which was never bought because John Marshall gave him one on <date when="1839-06-21">21 June 1839</date> which he called &#x201C;Citoyenne&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390619-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1839-06-19">19</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390626-TC-MAC-01"><date when="1839-06-26">26 June 1839</date></ref>).</note> May good be repaid you manifold, my Kind Brother; may good be ever with you, my Kind Friends all!</p>

<salute>Dear Goody,</salute>
<p>This is probably the last Letter you will get from me dated here at this time; I begin to make serious arrangements for departure: some time next week, as I compute it, I shall be with you at Chelsea, and then the rest can be learned by <hi rend="italic">word of mouth</hi>,&#x2014;which will be a far better way; will it not? Meanwhile, Jack has arrived duly; and all goes whirling with doubled confusion. I seize an hour of the morning, snatched from a Day as to which no Plan, after various attempts, could be formed; I will send you forth a word or two of Autobiography, and make that certain at least.</p>
<p>Our journey, my Mother&#x2019;s and mine, to Nithsdale took effect; but <pb id="pg-10-189" n="10:189"/>not very prosperously. Our Gig-horse, a huge nag of Jamie&#x2019;s not used to such work, became unwilling to perform before we reached Dumfries; you can figure it, with my Mother in all her tremulous apprehensiveness, sitting by me! We got to Dumfries, however; procured a better gig for the morrow, and yoked the ugly quadruped again: this time before ever leaving the pavement, he flatly refused to act at all; he would not even take us back to Annandale: we had to unyoke him, and send him home, giving up Templand for that day. I had already seen M&#x2019;Diarmid and Aird; had nothing more to do in Dumfries, but wander up and down with such entertainment as my own sour thoughts, full of pity rage and sorrow would afford me. One good thing was, M&#x2019;Diarmid had faithfully paid me, nine sovereigns for you for Puttoch; which coins I have or will account for.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid, ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, had acted as agent for letting the shooting at Craigenputtoch since they left in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370818-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:291&#x2013;92</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1837-08-18">18 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> He would take no <hi rend="italic">percentage</hi> this time; we shall have to make him some acknowledgement by and by. His wife<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne, b. M&#x2019;Knight (d. <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) of Dumfries, m. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>.</note> was fat-sentimental, as on former occasions; little Mac himself as kind as could be,&#x2014;wretched only that I could not eat and drink with him. He has not succeeded well for this year with the letting of Puttoch; but has better outlooks for a near future. A certain Colonel Somebody of Mabie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps a relative of Robert Kirkpatrick Howat, who owned Mabie, an estate in Troqueer parish, four and a half mi. SSW of Dumfries. There is no record of a Howat in the Army.</note> has the House and Game this season at the easy rate of &#xa3;4, there <hi rend="italic">being</hi> no Game; but he will <hi rend="italic">preserve</hi> the Game this year, and in future years give &#xa3;10 for his accommodation, and perhaps plague us less about it. As for Goody she with Macqueen&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> and Macdiarmid&#x2019;s instalments in her pocket will really be in funds for the present; able to bind Revolution Books<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> and what not (considering the Savings Bank too), according to her own sweet will. Nay there are other funds too, I guess! A Letter from your Mother, <hi rend="italic">un</hi>refusable, but which seemed to me to hold cash: a truly monied Goody! Poor Aird<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), journalist; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:361</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351019-TC-JWC-01"><sic>8:230</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1835-10-19">19 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> is the same interesting rustic he always was; vegetating, like willow in flowerpot, regretting the free watercourses, where his right place were. We walked to Lincluden Abbey,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruins of a <date>twelfth-cent.</date> religious house of Benedictine nuns which became a collegiate church, <date>fourteenth-cent.</date>; one and a half mi. NW of Dumfries in Terregles parish, a favorite walk of the townspeople and of Burns.</note> in the soft evening; talking <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [insipid] philosophy about the &#x201C;glorious spirit of the Past,&#x201D; and such like, not a word of which would I dissent from, <pb id="pg-10-190" n="10:190"/>but let it all pass in peace. I also saw Burns&#x2019;s House,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Mill Vennel, renamed Burns Street. Robert Chambers described it as &#x201C;a detached house &#x2026; a neat one of two storeys, containing kitchen, parlour, one or two good bedrooms, and several smaller rooms&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">The Life and Works of Robert Burns</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1896-00-00">1896</date>) 3:425.</note> the little oblique angled hut where the great soul had to adjust itself, and be a King without Kingdom: it seems vacant since the Widow&#x2019;s death;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Armour (<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>).</note> some dirty children sat on the doorsill, and the knocker seemed torn half off;&#x2014;the soul of the man is now happily far away from all that.&#x2014; Jean and Jamie were both as kind as could be; but you know what their house is! We huggermuggered as we could. They are prosperous both, I think; have a noisy <foreign>gleg</foreign> [lively] little child,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Aitken, now two years old.</note> and near prospect of another I should fancy. Jean received your Parcel with great expressions of thankfulness; she made your last gown, I think I heard, into quite an eminent one. Mary too at Annan was emphatic in her gratitude, in her affectionate remembrance of you. All which was pleasant to hear.</p>
<p>But to get along. On the wednesday morning (morrow of that nag-business, second morning of mine in Dumfries), I got upon the Edinburgh Coach, leaving my Mother whose health did not promise well; and got safely to Templand before breakfast was begun there. A certain fat good-natured &#x201C;Mr Boswell&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> with a Greenock dialect garnished by Lancashire &#x201C;dock English,&#x201D; otherwise a very excellent young man, sat there; &#x201C;waiting for Mr Alick Welsh<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of JWC&#x2019;s Liverpool cousins staying at Templand.</note> down from Crawford.&#x201D; Your Mothered [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] entered soon, right blithe to see me; then Alick as expected; then breakfast, and a pleasant tho&#x2019; too talking day. Templand and Nithsdale, all moist and green but sunny (for the time) and yellow with harvest, looked as beautiful as ever; your Mother looks no older, not altered in any way: the chief danger now as ever that you be overloaded with good victual, or otherwise killed with Kindness. I spent the whole time talking to her, the youths having soon gone out to fish or see the Grey Mare&#x2019;s Tail;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >100 ft.-high waterfall on Crichope Burn, N Nithsdale parish.</note> I flatter myself I was very agreeable. She was kissing kind; made me promise, if it were in any manner possible, that I would bring up John and my Mother still, and stay there for a series of days. She packed up apples for Sister Jean; a small pot of marmalade for my use at Scotsbrig; two larger ones of &#x201C;rasp jam&#x201D; for your use at Chelsea:&#x2014;sinner that I am, they took to leaking on the way to Dumfries, stained as with blood in many places a clean shirt for me, and I left them there. One of them now has got <pb id="pg-10-191" n="10:191"/>hither; I will still try to fetch it on, bad company tho&#x2019; it be. There is also the Letter I spoke of,&#x2014;evidently not full of writing. On the Thursday afternoon I came off again by the Glasgow coach. Little Whigham of Allanton<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Whigham of Allanton, Dunscore.</note> sat on the top beside me; very cheerful, speechful: Poor Mrs Brydone [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of Dunscore<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly Matilda, b. Mackenzie (d. <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), m., <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, to Robert Bryden (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280226-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:331</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1828-02-26">26 Feb. 1828</date></corr></ref>), minister at Dunscore.</note> had just been sent off to Glasgow Madhouse; so he told me. A new horse was waiting at Dumfries, but the night wet and too late for travelling</p>
<p>On the morrow afternoon arriving at Ecclefechan we found Letters at Alick&#x2019;s; one from the Speddings, announcing first their joy at the certainty they seemed to have of seeing me; then, of later date, a Postscript signifying that they had <hi rend="italic">been at Scotsbrig</hi> seeking me, and that I was now bound to come!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380913-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1838-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref> Spedding had said in his postscript, <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I trust you will now feel yourself bound to come to us, be it through fire or through water&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">CS</hi> 517).</note> The other Letter was from Jack; it indicated that in all likelihood he had been at Annan some hours, waiting the sight of me. After refreshment, and new misventures with horses, I set off to Annan with our old horse; and then at Mary&#x2019;s in the cool of the evening did actually find Jack, found Goody&#x2019;s Letter, Review of Sartor, gift to my Mother, and all as right as it could be! Thanks to thee, my good Wife, tho&#x2019; my hot-tempered one! O my dear Jeannie I have more regard for thee than perhaps thou wilt ever rightly know of. But let that pass.&#x2014; Jack, as you say, is the very <supplied>[De]</supplied>mon of the Uncertain, <foreign><hi rend="italic">D&#xE9;mon de la chose incertaine</hi></foreign>.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;<foreign>Rien ne m&#x2019;est s&#xFB;r que la chose incertaine</foreign>,&#x201D; Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Villon, &#x201C;Ballade du concours de Blois.&#x201D;</note> I have even less tolerance of that than <supplied>[form]</supplied>erly; yet the man&#x2019;s good-nature at bottom is inexhaustible; one cannot long be angry at him, the best way is to go your own road, and laugh. No peace has been here since he came, except two days that he spent at Dumfries (having <hi rend="italic">failed</hi> of Templand, and only <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> off a letter of mine, inclosed in excuses, by Andrew Watson);<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carrier; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> last night (it was Rood Fair)<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dumfries cattle market held last week in <date when="1838-09-00">Sept.</date>; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251009-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>3:386</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1825-10-09">9 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> he returned again with Jamie. Rome is evidently the place he will go to: indeed at Dumfries yesterday he found a Letter from Lady Clare, offering him the old terms if he will wait till February and then go back with her! I incline to think it will perhaps really be the best way; no man in that humour need try London, need try anything resembling London. But for the present his haste to be back thither, &#x201C;by the <date when="1838-10-03">3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of October</date>,&#x201D; is like that of a lover on assignation; the rather as he finds I have not completed <pb id="pg-10-192" n="10:192"/>my arrangements, and cannot well go till the <date when="1838-10-05">5<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> or <date when="1838-10-06">6<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>. It is clear he comes back with me; but nothing farther is clear.</p>
<p>I have bought Lawrence a cap, one of the best ever seen: I cannot conceive all this you tell me about his sketch, and imagine it must be a foolish fondness that blinds the black eyes of the woman.

Poor Goody I wrote to Alzdorf a hurried Letter from Dumfries; I could testify little of him; I said what I knew. <foreign>Bravo</foreign>, Goodykin! it was well done to demolish that Southwood Smith; were it only that he was the stuffer of old Bentham he is avoidable to me forevermore.<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320616-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:175</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-06-16">16 June 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> I am sorry for Hunt; but man cannot help him.

<p>And so in fine my Dearest I am coming back to thee, like the ill sixpence; whither else can I go? It is very right as thou sayest that I am chained: London is the place I do at bottom believe; Rome surely we will not at all think of since (God be thanked!) there is now no cough in the business. In about a week from this date then, a Steamer may be setting out; and in eight-and-forty hours after that! But I will write, or otherwise indicate the day. Do not you write after Tuesday at latest.&#x2014; For us here two things present themselves as possible in the interim; both of which <hi rend="italic">may</hi> very readily fail: To run over to the Speddings, whose brief call here, and no one to receive them, presses on me; or else to run up to Templand, according to promise exacted and given. I had brought myself to the point of Speddingdom this morning, <pb id="pg-10-193" n="10:193"/>and proferred it to Jack; but he will <hi rend="italic">and</hi> will not. It hangs uncertain till the hour. We have a gig and carthorse till Wednesday next, and weather seeming to mend. But on the whole, I am perhaps as well entirely dormant here. My last travel gave me a dirty little cold, a continual small headache which sticks by me still. Consider it all as <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>chose incertaine</foreign>&#x201D;</hi> except that I shall be with thee, and&#x2014;! O my dear Good Wife.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Things go not well with me here. My unlucky absence when you and the Secretary did these rough districts the honour of a visit,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380913-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1838-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref></note> was but the first of a considerable series of mischances; the general sum of which, alas, is <hi rend="italic">No Cumberland for me this year!</hi> It is not without far <pb id="pg-10-194" n="10:194"/>more regret than is commonly implied in the word &#x201C;regret&#x201D; so used, and not till the last vestige of rational feasibility has disappeared, that I make this decision. Nay now when it is made, I feel as if I had done wrong; as if, especially after such kindness shewn me, I had been fated and bound to come.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380927-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-27">27 Sept.</date></ref></note> But my Brother arrived only a week ago, and insists on being back to Town on Wednesday first, with the possibility of Italy again close behind that; so that I cannot leave him. I tried to persuade him with me; but neither, in his great haste, would that answer. The Coaches do not answer; your Wigton Coach leaves Carlisle an hour before our Glasgow one arrives; and then as for my own means of transport they are of the most elegiac description: an antique vehicle of the Gig species, very rheumatic on its springs, and drawn by a young plough-horse&#x2014;entirely inadequate for long journeys!

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We are unfortunately not to see you again on this occasion: it seems to be settled that we are to go southward again either on Friday <pb id="pg-10-195" n="10:195"/>or Saturday.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1838-10-05">5</date> or <date when="1838-10-06">6 Oct.</date></note> I fully purposed otherwise; nor is it altogether my blame that it is not otherwise: but there is no help now; we must hope for better things<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390505-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, [<date when="1839-05-05">5 May 1839</date>]</ref>.</note> next time. Nay who knows but I may be at Edinburgh lecturing some time or other, and to see you all sooner than we expect!</p>
<p>I want you at present to send me out a Pound and a Half of Mundell&#x2019;s best tobacco<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Mundell, 19 High St., who had taken over after the death of his father, Robert, <date when="1837-09-00">Sept. 1837</date>.</note> by the Carrier tomorrow. Alick has sent for my large quantity, both to Hawick and to Glasgow; but it is not come yet, nor is there any hope of it till after I depart. It will have to be sent after me by some Meal and <foreign>etceteras</foreign> that are coming. Mundell&#x2019;s six <hi rend="italic">quarters</hi> (make him do it up in quarters) will serve in the interim. You will need six shillings to buy it with; likewise, I remember well <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, you already stand my creditor for some three shillings laid out in that way before my arrival: I will leave cash to liquidate the whole claim with my Mother. Do not neglect therefore, my <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; but let me have the needful article by the Carrier tomorrow night, and thanks shall be thine.</p>
<p>Alick, in whose upper room, beside Jack and a good fire, I now write, is well; and it seems to me, doing well; much cheerfuller than in late years. Our Mother and we too (Jack and I) were down at Annan yesterday: all well there. Jack did not come up with us; I have met him here few minutes ago; Jamie and I having brought over the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi> [gig], after tea, by moonlight. My Mother has been busy as a bee all day; washing &#x26;c: she is tolerably well in general; but, I think, exposes herself too much. Jamie has a Rick in; a good quantity reaped, and the rest getting fast ready, and fast cut. Newspapers with strokes have come from Manchester, but no Letter as yet.</p>
<p>This is all the news. James will receive the Gig probably on Saturday, and assist the messenger to get rid of it. Thank him again for all the trouble he takes with me. As for the young James, I move that warm winter clothing, of flannel or plaiding be provided for him with all convenient despatch; also that he be forbidden positively to mount on <hi rend="italic">dressers</hi>. And so my dear Jean I must bid you good-b&#x2019;ye for this time. I am gratified to find you all fighting along in an honourable way, with more success not with less than formerly. Continue in that way. It is the right way; and God does speed one in it sooner or later. I will write to you before long from London. Some Letter to my Mother will <pb id="pg-10-196" n="10:196"/>be sent so soon as I arrive; to you I will send a Newspaper if I can. The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> of tomorrow you can send out hither, if it be not gone elsewhither.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good be with you and yours, dear Jean.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I remain ever / Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>James can keep an account of the Puttoch wood (if it be cut), and of his own expenses about it in the first place.</p>
<p>[John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s postscript]</p>
<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>It seems as good as fixed that we are to go on saturday from Annan with the Victoria steamer,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Royal Victoria</hi>, the Carlisle and Annan Steam Navigation Company&#x2019;s &#x201C;splendid and powerful new Steam-ship,&#x201D; sailed from Annan Waterfoot to Port Carlisle and Liverpool.</note> to remain at Manchester over Sunday and go on to London on Monday. It grieves me to think that I saw so little of you and in such confusion. If I find that Jamie&#x2019;s poney can carry me up to Dumfries and back again in a day I may still see you either tomorrow afternoon or on thursday. My plans in regard to Italy will not be fixed till I get to London. But I think it very unlikely in any case that I shall make any arrangement that can keep me so long from returning to Dumfriesshire as last time. I am most heartily weary of wandering and shall be glad when I get some place of rest. However I will do the best I can with patience in the meantime. Give my kindest respects to James the larger. If the thing is to be done conveniently, I shall see you again. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Jameson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter lay long at Edinburgh; and reached me in Dumfriesshire only a few days ago, when I was about returning hither. Baron <pb id="pg-10-197" n="10:197"/>Alzdorf got a Testimonial from me, as he, so backed, was doubly and trebly entitled to do: but whether it and all the rest did him any service I have not yet learned. I saw him in Regent Street the day before yesterday; but he would not see me or my signals, and the vehicle had to drive on.</p>
<p>You do me so much honour that I can only cover my face, and sit speechless for a time. The hearts of women, dear little creatures, are by nature exaggerative; many is the Bristol Diamond, or poor Scotch Pebble,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Transparent rock crystal, resembling diamonds, found in the Clifton limestone near Bristol, and agate or other gems found as pebbles in streams.</note> that has been taken for a true stone of price!

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I write to you rather than to Jack, not knowing whether Jack may not have already left you, as things have turned out. Nay, I am not without expectation of seeing Jack today yet before the Post go off. And this is one of the reasons why I did not write sooner. At any rate I send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> my history; understanding that with you it will be most convenient for inspection by all parties, by Jack if he is still with you, among others. You will without delay convey it to my Mother too; and so all will be put on a clear footing, and settled for the next chapter in continuation.</p>
<p>Your gig remained in my sight, that day, till it got to the white house again, or nearly so: I saw Ben Nelson take leave of you from the rearward, and the Doctor and Alick roll off, till they died away into a point for me, and all was over on that side for one other time. It is a great mercy that we were privileged to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi>; one should think of that, and not of the pain of parting. I had been gratified as of old with the true brotherly love of one and all; gratified to see you struggling along under better auspices than of late; I had much to gratify me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC described his visit in his Journal, <date when="1838-10-16">16 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Have been in Scotland some eight weeks; returned eight days ago, considerably improved in health. Was three weeks in Fife; saw Jeffrey in Edinburgh; then Minto Manse for 3 days (not <hi rend="italic">thither</hi> again, I think, without cause!); the rest at Scotsbrig, in the peacablest, not otherwise in the best style. Jamie and his sick wife the first week; then <hi rend="italic">met</hi> my dear Mother at the Gallowbank at Annan, who turned with me, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> might bring her up: next week came Jack after long uncertainties, who still lingers in Annandale, tho&#x2019; expected soon now. Kindness of simple hearts: a rude phasis of humble necessitous but not ungenerous Life, contrasting very abruptly with the life I lead here. My beloved Mother, ye true Brother-hearts, Good be always with you! We met again, and had to part again.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> Struggle <pb id="pg-10-199" n="10:199"/>on, my brave ones! All good be with you till we meet again!&#x2014; Our voyage to Liverpool was prosperous enough; a clam chill evening; the sheep sore afflicted, the men all tolerably off: I myself spoke no word, or hardly any; looked at the broad Millpath face of Porteous,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly William Porteous, carpenter and millwright, High St., Lockerbie.</note> saw once or twice half-roasted half-distracted visage of Butcher Douglas<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either John Douglas, Bridge St., Dumfries, or Robert Douglas, North St., Annan.</note> from the deck side-hutches (where he seemed to be drinking, smoking, and not well to live); your brandy was of excellent service, my pipe went well; and so about midnight we discerned the Rock of Liverpool, and all its multifarious lights rising round us,&#x2014;one great blaze among the rest which, we ascertained afterwards to be a huge Fire, still going on tho&#x2019; in a subdued state;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fire &#x201C;burst forth&#x201D; on Fri. evening, <date when="1838-10-05">5 Oct.</date>, in a warehouse containing cotton on Robert St. North leading to Princes Dock. It was contained by Sat. evening, though clearly still burning when TC saw it on Sun. morning. There had been three explosions, at least two large warehouses destroyed, surrounding buildings badly damaged, one man killed; the insurance costs came to &#xa3;119,500. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1838-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, described &#x201C;the vivid frightfulness of the fire ascending &#x2026; and the reflection therefrom upon the river.&#x201D;</note> and finally, amid immense yoho-ing, bullyragging and other tumult, we saw ourselves, about one in the morning, all run safely into moorings in the Dock, and at liberty to land if we liked. To the last moment it was uncertain with me what I would do: however, a porter offering himself &#x201C;for eighteen pence, Sir,&#x201D; to the Angel H&#xF4;tel, I set off with him, several others following on the same quest of a bed to sleep in. The Angel, or Wellington, or whatever it was, would not take us in; but some Royal H&#xF4;tel, close by, did: there, after kicking our heels for a good while, in the empty lobby, in the dead of night, and relying mainly on Patience and the goodwill of &#x201C;Boots&#x201D; (for <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had our fate in his hands), the wearied individuals did, I suppose, get into some kind of sleeping-cribs; I at least did, and could bolt the door upon myself about two in the morning, and say: Here I will be private till the morrow if it please Heaven. I supped on your brandy and one of Mary&#x2019;s crackers; indeed, you may tell her and yourself that nothing of the sort could have been usefuller than your kind gifts proved: thanks to your kind hearts for them! Your pocket-comb was right serviceable too; I found I had <hi rend="italic">forgot</hi> the other. Tell my Mother not to fret herself in the smallest about it, as I know she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been doing; I got an excellent one since I came hither. In fine all <pb id="pg-10-200" n="10:200"/>was right enough. The sooty smell of Liverpool awoke me in the morning about eight; I dressed and walked off to Maryland Street<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To John Welsh&#x2019;s house.</note> for breakfast: too early still by an hour.</p>
<p>There was no train for Manchester till five in the evening, so have they arranged it on Sundays. I sat with George Johnston, sat with poor Mrs Welsh, or with the others when they returned from church. Poor Mrs Welsh seemed to me to be evidently in the worst state: I think she feels herself to be departing fast, and has very nobly taken up her attitude as to that. She used to be a restless noisy bustling house-mother; she is now a courageous devout woman, silently gathered together to die.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She d. sometime before <date when="1838-11-27">27 Nov.</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381127-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-11-27">28 [27] Nov.</date></ref></note> Ah me! I have seen nothing that affected me more, for years.&#x2014; But at length, five came, and half-past six; and I saw Hanning waiting on the outlook for me, and was soon settled in a coach by him, and on the way to Jersey street,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> across dark streets, with here and there the flare of a Methodist Chapel starting out on them. In one dark street, a drunken Coachman drove against us; fairly drove our hind wheels and axle out from beneath us! Our coach jolted amazingly, as if crossing a ditch of a yard deep, and then hung wrecked; but to us there was no damage done at all, not even to my trunk, tho&#x2019; it had jumped down to the pavement, and was lying there. In two minutes the drunken coachman had been seized, his number taken, and witnesses bespoken; and we were mounted in a new coach which took us home without accident. Jenny was well, and the little child; they have a decent <foreign>shifty</foreign> [resourceful]-looking little maid-servant, and all seemed to be going well with them. A bed had been provided for the Doctor, not in the inn, but in the house itself; I slept in my Mother&#x2019;s bed, which I remembered in the old house:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >7 Bank St., Salford, where he had stayed <date when="1837-07-00">July 1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370702-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:236</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1837-07-02">2 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> I was just closing my senses in sweet oblivion when the Watchman, with a voice like the deepest bass of the Highland bagpipe, or what an <hi rend="italic">Ostrich-Corncraik</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The corncrake has a particularly harsh call, here imagined as even worse drawn out through the ostrich&#x2019;s long neck.</note> might utter, groaned out, &#x201C;groo-o-oo,&#x201D; close under me, and set all a-gallop again. &#x201C;Groo-o-oo!&#x201D; for there was no articulate announcement at all in it that I could gather, &#x201C;Groo-o-oo,&#x201D; repeated again and again, at various distances, dying out and then growing loud again; for an hour or more: this seemed to be the employment the worthy functionary had chalked out for himself to pass the night in: I grew impatient; bolted out of bed, flung up the window: &#x201C;Groo-o-oo&#x201D; there he was, advancing, lantern in hand, a few yards off me! &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t you give up that noise?&#x201D; I hastily addressed <pb id="pg-10-201" n="10:201"/>him: &#x201C;You are keeping a person awake. What good is it to go howling and groaning there all night, and deprive people of their sleep!&#x201D; He ceased from that time; at least I heard no more of him. No watchman, I think, has been more astonished for some time back. At five in the morning, all was still as sleep and darkness; at half-past five, all went off like an enormous mill-race, or ocean-tide, &#x201C;Boom-m-m!&#x201D; far and wide: it was the mills that were all starting then, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">creeshy</hi></foreign> [greasy] drudges by the million taking post there; I have heard few sounds more impressive to me,&#x2014;in the mood I was in.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Hast thou heard &#x2026; the awakening of a Manchester &#x2026; at half-past five by the clock; the rushing-off of its thousand mills, like the boom of an Atlantic tide&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Chartism, Works</hi> 29:181).</note> Jenny and Rob were as kind to me as kind could be. They seemed to be doing well; plenty of rough business, and st<supplied>[ou]</supplied>t hearts for it: I was glad I had not grieved them by passing by without a visit, tho&#x2019; my visit was <supplied>[too]</supplied> hurried for being satisfactory. Newspapers both from Liverpool and Manchester were duly despatched to my Mother; you ought to have got the first of them on Monday morning. I went off by the Railway at a quarter past nine that morning.</p>
<p>I will not detain you with my Railway journey: it was one of the strangest in character that I ever made; so lonely, for our road has no houses near it yet; so new, so enchanted-looking! We went at all rates, from thirty miles an hour, to a mile and half,&#x2014;the rate at which, according to Jamie, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddies</hi></foreign> [donkeys] can long hold out after they are <hi rend="italic">done</hi>.&#x201D; One whole hour, shortly after sunset, we remained stagnant, perhaps some 200 of us, in the belly of a chalk-hill, the bottom of a ditch sixty or seventy feet deep, with two men and candles waiting by us, and a little stripe of sky overhead,&#x2014;till they ran off with our steam-horse, and brought back another stronger, able to draw us out. Much of the road is unfinished yet, nothing but the mere iron laid down, and the arrangements of all kinds incomplete. I had little or no dinner but Mary&#x2019;s two remaining crackers: however, I felt no hunger; there was no danger, there was room enough, warmth enough, no discomfort to complain of, tho&#x2019; we were some three hours beyond our time. Near midnight I got safe and comfortably home; Jane, with tea <hi rend="italic">and</hi> eggs, sitting <foreign><hi rend="italic">gleg</hi></foreign> [eager] in expectation of me. She is better than I have seen her for a long time; I myself too am quite rested now, and decidedly in better case than I have too often been in of late years.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1838-10-16">16 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I saw several things in my journey; I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> nothing.

When? When? For her Ladyship had fallen ill, and none but her Doctor could give help. She seems to me to be rather well served; she should have <hi rend="italic">kept</hi> him in her pay I think, not turned him out to grass, in the hope of getting him when she pleased to whistle! However, I went up to her <foreign>H&#xF4;tel</foreign> directly on the morrow morning; sent in my card with a corteous [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] message; her Courier came down: How could one <hi rend="italic">get</hi> to Scotsbrig, and in how long? I said, <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>by railway, in about four-and-twenty hours; but they had better <hi rend="italic">write</hi>.&#x201D; My calculation accordingly is that a Letter would arrive with &#x201C;speed&#x201D; on it, probably on Thursday morning. Now I discern from Newspapers that the Doctor was up at Templand then, that he came thro&#x2019; Dumfries on Friday, that Saturday was the soonest he could <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of starting. So perhaps he will be here today? Or perhaps he still will not think of setting off till his own time come? I have heard nothing of her since Tuesday morning. The Doctor will have decided for himself. People here seem to think that Rome, this winter, might be a better place than we thought it, so many English are gone thitherward. They also seem to say he ought to demand <hi rend="italic">four</hi> hundred pounds from her Ladyship if he wait for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. I cannot advise in it. His room is ready here, and his welcome; let him write to me instantly if he be not already on the road. There is even a room for him down stairs all winter if he will have it, and cover enough,&#x2014;poor Tongleg, truest-hearted, <foreign>fashourest</foreign> [most troublesome] of men! We shall do very well, once all settled together.&#x2014; Or perhaps Lady Clare has not written at all? The [Turn back to the beginning; then margin after margin; what a scrawl!]<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s brackets.</note> thrifty <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> woman, she calculated that I would write, that he would come of his own accord, and cost her no money? In that case, I would have him reckon that I had not written at all, and take his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> time in coming. Thrift <pb id="pg-10-203" n="10:203"/>of that sort seems to me despicable beyond most thrifts; I thank Heaven, I have no poor brother, poor sister, so poor as that. Alick&#x2019;s honey-jar is on the table every morning, right good; the currents put into a chrystal [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] case. You are to thank Mary also for her gifts; Heaven has given her too a generous heart. Good brothers, good sisters, best of Mothers, you were <hi rend="italic">all</hi> kind to me, each of you kinder than the other: my heart&#x2019;s thanks are with you all! And so good b&#x2019;ye, dear Alick; I will write again soon, to my Mother I think. I must terminate <hi rend="italic">this</hi> scrawl with a P.S. on the other page. <closer><salute>Your ever affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Jamie&#x2019;s harvest, I hope, is prospering still. His kindness, in the trouble he was in, is deeply present with me. Tell him, <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> stone of meal, I think will do; Jane seems to have given up porridge: that will serve me for a long time. As for butter, we are eating the Scotsbrig butter daily: it seems the price here is 13<hi rend="italic">d</hi> per pound, and the stuff pretty fair: Jane thinks, as poor Isabella is not there herself to manage it, we will <foreign>fash</foreign> [bother] none&#x2014;this year. Neither is there any violent <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> about the meal, only moderate speed.

God bless you all always!<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1838-10-11">11 Oct.</date> the Carlyles had dined with Edward Strachey, who recorded his impressions of JWC: &#x201C;She is a very pleasing woman. She appears to have a good deal of humor; and though she seems very gentle, I hear that she has a sharp wit. &#x2026; Aunt Buller told me that Sterling wrote Mrs. Carlyle a severe lecture on her proceedings in this line. They were at a party, when Sterling, in a very solemn manner, pronounced the world to be a mere sepulchre, adding &#x2018;But there are martyrs&#x2019; crowns for some of us.&#x2019; To this Mrs. Carlyle rejoined, &#x2018;Yes; but I don&#x2019;t think any of us seem much inclined to try for them.&#x2019;&#x201D; TC had talked at length of the political and social unrest he had felt in the north: &#x201C;In one place &#x2026; he used to hear a loom at work till twelve o&#x2019;clock at night, and &#x2026; before seven in the morning &#x2026; he was told there was a weaver next door,&#x2014;a man with a wife and six children,&#x2014;earning six shillings a week by his seventeen hours of daily work. &#x2026; Whether we pay them ill or well, we treat them equally as mere machines. &#x2026; In many places they are forming societies for purchasing rifles by a subscription of a penny a week. They are desperate men, who say it is better to shoot or be shot than to endure this any longer; and, says Carlyle, &#x2018;we shall soon have insurrections, and these poor creatures must be put down by the sabre and the gallows, and then perhaps thinking men will be roused to seek for a remedy.&#x2019; He observed that the Duke of Buccleuch has about fifty thousand men working for him, and giving up to him two thirds of the fruit of their labors; and yet it never occurs to him (though he is by no means a bad man) that he has any duties to perform to any one of this multitude. They may live on their six shillings a week, while he imports his cartloads of foxes from Ireland as the best mode of employing his great wealth&#x201D; (E. Strachey, <hi rend="italic">LC</hi> 825&#x2013;26).</note>&#x2014;</p></ps>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Wedgewood</salute>
<p>I was walking pensive &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">sul margine del rio</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [on the riverbank] when the Postman poked his head under my bonnet, and with a self-complacent smile handed me your letter. An observant Twopenny! he knows that nobody receives the favours made to pass thro&#x2019; his hands, in so thankful a spirit as I do; and would run a dozen or even two dozen yards out of his beat at any time for the purpose of hastening my satisfaction, and witnessing the sensation which he a humble terrestrial Twopenny is thus enabled to produce on an interesting female of the higer [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] orders! I seized the God-send with a passion for letters in the abstract, not to be found surpassed, I am sure, even in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miss Wisby&#x2019;s Establishment for Young Ladies</hi>&#x201D; hard by;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Harriet Wisbey had a boarding school at 15 Cheyne Walk.</note> but when I perceived it was from you,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> who could only have been incited to so strong a measure, by a strong impulse of kind remembrance&#x2014;my feelings rose to a pitch of enthusiasm, and I should have answered it in the <hi rend="italic">ebullition</hi> of the moment, had not the Husband of me been coming home that very night, and certain tag-rags of preparative arrangement demand my wifely superintendence and cooperation.</p>
<p>And he did actually come&#x2014;not however till after I had counted every instant from four o&#x2019;clock till midnight&#x2014;all the wheeled things which passed thro&#x2019; the street during these many hours, having been successively mistaken for the happy cab which had the honour of bearing a Man of Genius. Think of that! in a street thro&#x2019; which all Chancellor&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">omnibii</hi> pass not to mention washerwomens-carts world without end!&#x2014; Nay the very tea kettle, which I dare not let <hi rend="italic">go off the boil</hi> began at last to make a sound like the rumbling of wheels in the distance as if on purpose to increase my distraction! He came at last however, and it was all right. I find him somewhat cheerfuler for having had his humour out, and brown as a nut by exposure to air&#x2014;further than this I see no difference. To the eyes of true Philosophy, indeed, which would take in the <hi rend="italic">Clothes</hi> as an inseparable part of the whole man, he must exhibit a touching spectacle of demoralization&#x2014;not a shirt left that would look &#x2018;respectable&#x2019; on a <foreign><hi rend="italic">crow-boggle</hi></foreign> (as we call it in Scotland) Anglice scarecrow! precious result of travelling about the world without one&#x2019;s wife and needles and thread! Striking <pb id="pg-10-205" n="10:205"/>illustration of the truth of the maxim &#x201C;a stitch in time, saves nine&#x201D;! And it is I, <foreign><hi rend="italic">poverina</hi></foreign> [poor little one], who must now put in these nine stitches multiplied by nine&#x2014;I who &#x201C;being an only Child&#x201D; like Charlotte Jeffrey&#x2014;&#x201C;never <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to sew.&#x201D; But there is a long winter before us&#x2014; For his locomotive tendencies have quite worked themselves out for the present and there is no talk of Italy any longer to bother the peace and quiet of 5 Cheyne Row&#x2014; My Brother in law, indeed &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">did design</hi>&#x201D; to go back to Rome for the winter and to practice there on his own footing, but such design I believe will prove to have been nothing more than a devout imagination, he is a highly imaginative man!&#x2014; Moreover Lady Clare now wishes him to wait for her till <date when="1839-02-00">February</date>.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your very courteous Letter has just been handed in to me. I answer without delay, what you have reason to expect, that I am flattered and honoured by your proposal; that if such a dedication can seem in any way desirable to you, it cannot be other than gratifying to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dwight wanted to dedicate to TC his <hi rend="italic">Select Minor Poems, Translated from the German of Goethe and Schiller, with Notes</hi> (Boston, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>). In his letter he described himself as &#x201C;a young student of German letters, following out gratefully, but unworthily, the impulse which he owes in great part to your writings. &#x2026; Most pleasant of all will it be, when it is all done, to inscribe one page to the most successful interpreter of the beauties and deep wealth and wisdom of German mind to the English people, with whom, in spirit at least, we younger and ruder Americans, New Englanders, claim to be numbered&#x201D; (<date when="1973-00-00">1973</date> edn., 11).</note></p>
<p>My best wishes go with you in your Enterprise. Among the Germans are to be found true Singers; the only true ones we have had for a great while, with any such compass of melody; the last we are like to have, I think, for a great while. You do well to unseal their voices for them in that great Western Land. They are countrymen, kinsmen of ours, these <foreign><hi rend="italic">Teutschen</hi></foreign>; and truly, in the speaking or singing department, the chief of the Family at present. In the doing and devising department again, we <hi rend="italic">Saxons</hi>, Englanders New and Old, may set up for the first. Honour to each after his kind!</p>
<p>Your mood of mind is the right one for a Translator. The <hi rend="italic">tune</hi> of a Poem, especially if it be a Goethe&#x2019;s Poem, is the soul of the whole; round which all, the very thoughts no less than the words, shapes and <pb id="pg-10-207" n="10:207"/>modulates itself: the tune is to be got hold of before anything else can be got.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dwight had said: &#x201C;I have adopted &#x2026; the principle &#x2026; of preserving the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> always with the spirit, as being, in fact, inseparable from it in a lyric. Generally, I have caught the music of the piece, and walked about with it ringing through me, while I pondered and digested the substance, and in this way has the literal imitation become natural and free&#x201D; (<date when="1973-00-00">1973</date> edn., p. 11).</note> And <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> each language has its genius, its capabilities;&#x2014;your task is a difficult one. For the rest, there is no alchemy like true goodwill.</p>
<p>It is several years now since I quitted that province of things: but I feel still, and shall ever feel, its great importance to the whole modern world: and it is a real pleasure to me, on looking round, to observe so many generous fellow-labourers, on this side the Ocean and on that,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dwight trans. most of the Goethe poems, some of the Schiller, and contributed all the notes; the other trans. were by Frothingham, Margaret Fuller, George Bancroft, Channing, F. H. Hedge, et al.</note> who have taken up the cause in such a fashion as to ensure fair play to it in the long run. Go on and prosper.</p>
<p>May I ask you to present my kind remembrances to Mr Ripley.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dwight&#x2019;s book was one of the series ed. by George Ripley, <hi rend="italic">Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature</hi>. For Ripley&#x2019;s earlier correspondence with Carlyle, see vols. 8 and 9. A transcendentalist, Ripley and his wife, Sophia Willard Dana (d. <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), were prime movers in the Brook Farm Colony, nine mi. from Boston. They lived there throughout the experiment, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>, and Ripley was pres. of the &#x201C;Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education.&#x201D; Later he wrote for the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harper&#x2019;s New Monthly Magazine</hi> and ed. the <hi rend="italic">New American Cyclopaedia</hi>, 16 vols. (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>).</note> I have many friends in your country, whom I know not how to thank. If you see Emerson, say I wrote to him lately out of Scotland, and mean to write again in some two weeks by a speedier conveyance.</p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>It is all right; all your Letters with their inclosures have arrived in due succession: the last, inquiring after the fate of the others, came this morning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, <date when="1838-10-17">17 Oct.</date>, worried that TC had not received his letters (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 195&#x2013;96).</note> I was in Scotland, as you partly conjecture; I wrote to <pb id="pg-10-210" n="10:210"/>you already (tho&#x2019; not without blameable delay), from my Mother&#x2019;s house in Annandale, a confused scrawl, which I hope has already got to hand, and quieted your kind anxieties: I am as well as usual in health, my Wife better than usual; nothing is amiss, except my negligence and indolence, which has put you to this superfluous solicitude on my account. However, I have an additional Letter by it; you must pardon me, you must not grudge me that undeserved pleasure, the reward of <hi rend="italic">evil</hi>-doing. I may well <hi rend="italic">say</hi>, you are a blessing to me on this Earth; no Letter comes from you with other than good tidings,&#x2014;or can come while you live there to love me.</p>
<p>The Bill was thrust duly into Baring&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baring Brothers &#x26; Co., merchants, 8 Bishopsgate, est. <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>.

In brief, I am about half resolved to buy myself a sharp little nag with twenty of these Transatlantic Pounds, and ride him till the other thirty be eaten: I will call the creature &#x201C;Yankee,&#x201D; and kind thoughts of those far away shall be with me every time I mount him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380925-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <sic><date when="1838-09-23">23 Sept.</date></sic><corr><date when="1838-09-25">25 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note> Will not that do? My Wife says, it is the best plan I have had for years, and strongly urges it on. My kind friends!</p>
<p>As to those copies of the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Miscellanies</hi>, I unfortunately still can say nothing, except what was said in the former (Scotch) letter, that you must proceed in the business with an eye to America and not to us. My Booksellers Saunders and Ottley [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] have no money for me, no definite offer in money to make for those 200 copies, of which you seem likely to make money if we simply leave them alone. I have asked these Booksellers, I have asked Fraser too: What will you <hi rend="italic">give me in ready money</hi> for 250 copies of that book, sell it afterwards as you can?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380615-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> They answer always, We must see it first. Now the copy long ago sent me has never come to hand; I have asked for it of <pb id="pg-10-211" n="10:211"/>Kennet,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard James Kennett, bookseller; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370601-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:218</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-06-01">1 June 1837</date></corr></ref>.

Meanwhile S. and Otley want forsooth a &#x201C;Sketches of German Literature&#x201D; in three volumes; then a &#x201C;Miscellanies in three volumes&#x201D;: that is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> plan of publishing an English edition; and the outlook they hold out for me is certain trouble in this matter, and recompense entirely uncertain. I think on the whole it is extremely likely I shall apply to you for 250 copies (that is their favourite number) of these 4 volumes (nay if it be of any moment, you can bind me down to it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, and take it for sure): but I cannot yet send you the titlepage; no bookseller purchasing till &#x201C;we see it first.&#x201D; But after all, will it suit America to print an <hi rend="italic">unequal</hi> number of your two pairs of volumes?. Do not the two together make one work? On the whole, consider that I shall in all likelihood want 250 copies, and consider it certain if that will serve the enterprise: we must leave it here today. I will stir in it now however, and take no rest till in one way or other you do get a titlepage from me, or some definite deliverance on the matter.

<p>Kennet the Bookseller gave me yesterday (on my way to &#x201C;the City&#x201D; with that Brother of mine the Italian Doctor who is here at present and a great lover of yours) ten Copies of your Dartmouth Oration:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Dartmouth College Oration</hi>, delivered <date when="1838-07-24">24 July</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380925-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref> Emerson asked that his $10.00 fee be used for books for the college library; among those bought were TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> and Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>.</note> we read it over dinner in a chophouse in Bucklersbury, amid the clatter of some fifty stand of knives and forks; and a second time more leisurely at Chelsea here.

As to my share in it, grieve not for half an instant. Pantheism, Pottheism, Mydoxy, Thydoxy are nothing at all to me; a weariness the whole jargon, which I avoid speaking of, decline listening to: <hi rend="italic">Live</hi>, for God&#x2019;s sake, with what Faith thou couldst get; leave off <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> about Faith!

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Hardly above a week ago, I wrote to you in immediate answer to some friendly inquiries produced by negligence of mine: the Letter is probably tumbling on the salt waves at this hour, in the belly of the Great Western;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Launched by the Great Western Steamship Co., Bristol, <date when="1837-07-19">19 July 1837</date>; first Atlantic crossing, <date when="1838-04-08">8 April.</date></note> or perhaps it may be still on firm land waiting, in which case this will go along with it. I had written before out of Scotland, a Letter of mere acknowledgement and postponement; you must have received that before now, I imagine. Our small piece of business is now become articulate, and I will despatch it in a paragraph. Pity my stupidity that I did not put the thing on this footing long ago! It never struck me till the other day that tho&#x2019; no copy of our &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; would turn up for inspection here, and no Bookseller would bargain for a thing unseen, I myself might bargain, and leave <hi rend="italic">their</hi> hesitations resting on their own basis. In fine I have rejected all their schemes of printing &#x201C;Miscellaneous Works&#x201D; here, printing &#x201C;Sketches of German Literature,&#x201D; or printing anything whatever on the &#x201C;half-profits system,&#x201D; which is like toilsomely scattering seed into the sea; and I settled yesterday with Fraser to give him the American sheets, and let them sell <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>, on clear principles, or remain unsold if they like. I find it infinitely the best plan, and to all appearance the profitablest as to money that could have been devised for me.</p>
<p>What you have to do therefore is to get 250 copies (<hi rend="italic">in sheets</hi>) of the whole Four Volumes, so soon as the second two are printed, and <pb id="pg-10-215" n="10:215"/>have them with the proper titlepage sent off hither to Fraser&#x2019;s address; the sooner the better. The American titlepage, instead of &#x201C;Boston&#x201D;: &#x26;c at the bottom, will require to bear, in three lines: &#x201C;London: / James Fraser, 215. Regent Street / <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> /.&#x201D; Fraser is anxious that you should not spell him with a <hi rend="italic">z;</hi> your man can look on the Magazine, and beware. I suppose also you should print <hi rend="italic">labels</hi> for the backs of the four volumes, to be used by the <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-binder; they do the books in that way here now: but if it occasion any difficulty, never mind this; it was not spoken of to Fraser, and is my own conjecture merely; the thing can be managed in various other ways. Two hundred and fifty copies, then, of the entire book: there is nothing else to be attended to that you do not understand as well as I. Fraser will announce it in his Magazine; the eager select public will wait.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Until summer, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390624-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1839-06-24">24 June 1839</date></ref>.

Do not hurry yourselves, or at all change your rate for <hi rend="italic">us:</hi> but so soon as the work is ready in the course of nature, the earliest conveyance to the Port of London will bring a little cargo, which one will welcome with a strange feeling! I declare myself delighted with the plan; an altogether romantic kind of plan, of romance and reality: fancy me riding on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Yankee</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380925-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref></note> withal, at the time, and considering what a curious world this is, that bakes bread for one beyond the great ocean-stream, and how a poor man is not left after all to be trodden into the gutters, tho&#x2019; the fight went sore against him, and he saw no backing anywhere. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah akbar</hi></foreign>, God is great;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301023-TC-G-01"><sic>5:177</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1830-10-23">23 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> no saying truer than that.&#x2014; And so now, by the blessing of Heaven, we will talk no more of business this day.</p>
<p>My employments, my outlooks, condition and history here, were a long chapter; on which I could like so well to talk with you face to face; but as for writing of them, it is a mere mockery. In these four years, so full of pain and toil, I seem to have lived four decades. By degrees, the creature gets accustomed to its element; the salamander learns to live in fire, and be of the same temperature with it. Ah me! I feel as if grown old; innumerable things are become weary, flat, stale and unprofitable.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.2.</note> And yet perhaps I am not old, only wearied, and there is a stroke or two of work in me yet. For the rest, the fret and agitation of this Babylon wears me down: it is the most unspeakable life; of sunbeams and miry clay;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 40:2.</note> a contradiction which no head can reconcile. Pain and poverty are not wholesome; but praise and flattery <pb id="pg-10-216" n="10:216"/>along with them are poison: God deliver us from that; it carries madness in the very breath of it! On the whole, I say to myself, What thing is there so good as <hi rend="italic">rest?</hi> A sad case it is, and a frequent one in my circle, to be entirely cherubic, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> face and wings. &#x201C;<foreign>Mes enfans</foreign>,&#x201D; said a French gentleman to the cherubs in the Picture, &#x201C;<foreign>Mes enfans, asseyezvous</foreign> [My children, sit down]&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;<foreign>Monseigneur</foreign> [Sir],&#x201D; answer they, &#x201C;<foreign>il n&#x2019;y a pas de quoi</foreign>! [there&#x2019;s nothing to do it with!]&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Origin not traced.</note> I rejoice rather in my laziness; proving that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> sit&#x2014; But, after all, ought I not to be thankful? I positively can in some sort exist here for a while; a thing I had been for many years ambitious of to no purpose. I shall have to lecture again in spring, Heaven knows on what; it will be a wretched fever for me; but once thro&#x2019; it, there will be board wages for another year.

I say, I will be thankful; and wait quietly what farther is to come, or whether anything farther.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jack has left us this morning; all very <foreign><hi rend="italic">dowie</hi></foreign> [sad], as you may suppose: but I undertook to write; and indeed may as well be doing that as not, to keep thoughts out of my head. He went away well in health, and under the best auspices every way; we have the hope too of seeing him back before <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long: so that no parting could well be less painful: but there is pain in them all. I will now give you a narration how the place came into his hand, what kind of place it seems likely to be, and in short &#x201C;all about it,&#x201D; as accurately as I can. He was to have got a frank from the Duke yesterday, and have written himself; but there was such a bustle no frank could be spoken of; and so now, with or without frank, it falls to my share.</p>
<p>Nothing that ever befel any of us had such a look of providential guidance, I think, as this post now entered upon. Had Jack gone off with me from Scotsbrig that Saturday morning, he had found Lady Clare very unwell and altogether eager to engage with him again. It depended on some perfect trifle whether she had not sent her Courier up to Scotsbrig to fetch him to her direct. But at the time her Courier was for setting out, the poor lady had fallen so ill that she could give no orders at all; and still more, at the time Jack actually arrived, she was literally in a state of mental incapacity, and would not so much as see him! There is little doubt but had he been with her from the first she would have escaped this sickness; her poor thrift seems to me to have been sharply but not altogether undeservedly punished in that way. On the second or third day after his arrival, Jack, heartily sorry for the poor lady and still unable to see her, had made up his mind to propose, to the Miss Elliott who was watching over her or to any friend she might have in a disposition and condition to act for her, that he and Miss Elliott and Lady Clare should directly quit London and its fogs and excitations, and retire to the Isle of Wight for the Winter: he went away from this house with the purpose of making that proposal. The look of things on the spot induced him to think that it would be unseemly on his part to start such a matter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written to his mother, <date when="1838-11-02">2 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;My first care on the tuesday [<date when="1838-10-23">23 Oct.</date>] was to enquire for Lady Clare. It would be too long to tell you all the circumstances of her case. She had got worse after my brother called [see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381015-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref>], and been constrained to send for other physicians, who had been in attendance almost a fortnight when I arrived. They named her disease Nervous Fever with delirium; but from all that I have been able to hear of it, it looks more like threatening of mental derangement. When Miss Elliot announced to her that I was come, she said she had not strength to see me. &#x2026; I called several times in succession &#x2026; and at last, when I found that she persisted in not seeing me, I met her physicians in consultation, and ascertained from themselves that it was impossible to predict when her disease would terminate, so that I could not even hope to help her by waiting. &#x2026; I am not without hopes that she may yet recover; but the case is certainly doubtful.&#x201D;</note> There remained <pb id="pg-10-220" n="10:220"/>for him now therefore nothing but to let <hi rend="italic">Clare</hi>dom take its course; and for his part either to make off for Rome on his own footing, or take up his quarters in this back-room here till he saw what London would yield him. But now in that posture of affairs before coming down here, he saw at a large public Hospital where the Doctors are in the habit of assembling, and where he among others used to call, a certain Dr Thomson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380412-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-04-12">12 April</date></ref>.</note> now settled here whom he had known at Rome; this Dr Thomson told him that yesterday he had been applied to with the offer of going with the Duke of Buccleuch<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381115-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-11-15">15 Nov.</date></ref></note> to Italy, but had declined; and had named some other as likely, or some two others, one or both of whom were now actually in treaty about it: <hi rend="italic">him</hi> he had considered to be fixed, or he would have named him first of all. Jack returned to us to dinner very sorry; thinking he had just been a post <hi rend="italic">too late</hi>. We declared that it must not be so taken up; that he must instantly stir his fires, and try still. A letter to the Duke was accordingly penned there and then, offering his services to the Duke; referring withal to his seven years&#x2019; experience in Italy, to various physicians of eminence here and elsewhere, especially to a Sir James Clarke, Physician to the Queen, whom I had seen last winter, and he had seen lately in consultation (I think) about a sick friend of ours.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling.</note> This letter was despatched by an old Chelsea pensioner,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:215</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> glad to run for a shilling; and not long after tea, word was brought back that the Duke was not in town, but that the letter would be forwarded by the next post. Well, next morning Jack was off to inquire, to exert himself in every way: he soon learned that the man whom the Duke trusted to in the business was a Dr Hume, an old sagacious Scotchman the Duke of Wellington&#x2019;s physician,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Robert Hume (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), b. Renfrewshire; studied medicine Glasgow and Edinburgh, <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>; entered army medical service, where he served with distinction in the Peninsula and won the Waterloo Medal; M.D., St. Andrews, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>; Licentiate, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>, F.R.C.P. <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>. Settled in London, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>, he was Wellington&#x2019;s private physician; metropolitan commissioner in lunacy since <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>; and an inspector gen. of hospitals.</note> well known and esteemed here. To this Dr Hume Sir James <pb id="pg-10-221" n="10:221"/>Clarke (another Scotchman he,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clark had been born in Banffshire, and educated at Aberdeen and Edinburgh univs.</note> and a very good man) gave him a letter of introduction: Jack went off instantly, found Hume, and shewed face, and told his story: this, I believe, was the decisive thing; for Hume liked the look and way of him (it was an immense fact too that he had been in Italy so long before), and gave him the preference to all the rest. He got good accounts of him too, on asking around; other Doctors spoke, old Sterling spoke; in short it was a decided thing. The only one that did not behave with zealous kindness was one Dr Peebles, a Roman acquaintance of his now in Edinburgh; he, canny man, &#x201C;did not know enough about Dr Carlyle to recommend him,&#x201D;&#x2014;they had met some three times; but I told Jack, before that, on reading a work of this Dr Peebles&#x2019;s, that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was a <foreign>shable</foreign> [nonentity]:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Home Peebles; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360912-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:62</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-09-12">12 Sept. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> let him rest there, and fight his own battle as cannily as he can.&#x2014; Enough of people &#x201C;did know Dr Carlyle&#x201D;; and so the thing was all fixed and settled, except the details of it, the day before we wrote to you last. The salary is &#xa3;500 a year, with accommodation &#x26;c; sure for one year, and all as one would have it: if, as is possible, they come home in summer again, the engagement and salary will still hold till this time twelvemonth, not a shorter time, however much longer. Lady Clare, who did at length &#x201C;open her letters,&#x201D; open Jack&#x2019;s letter, and about a week ago consent to see him,&#x2014;shed many tears at their meeting, and seemed still very unwell and unhappy; heartily glad of his good fortune, yet at bottom very sorry for herself: she was to go off this very morning with Miss Elliott for the Isle of Wight where Miss E. has a house; the London Doctor wanted her to stay all winter <hi rend="italic">here</hi> and be doctored; but Jack zealously advised her to quit doctoring altogether, and get into the country to quiet. He parted from her with great sympathy, and even with esteem, as her ways are better known to him than to us; but I cannot help feeling that it is much better he has done with that concern, and has now got into another much more promising one. The poor lady is much to be pitied too: fancy her lying here in a <foreign>H&#xF4;tel</foreign>, out of her senses, and not one of her three or four brothers, or her kindred at all, taking any charge of her; nobody but servants and an accidental friend! What is the use of wealth, if in sickness and despair you must lie like an outcast in a hospital? Not one of us, as Jane says, but would have had kind hands to minister to us had we been lying so. The poor lady has a most barren life, and some secret sorrow that blights all <pb id="pg-10-222" n="10:222"/>things for her: we will pity her respectfully, and wish her well elsewhere. Jack is to write to her from Italy; they parted in kindness and sadness.</p>
<p>It is hardly a week yet since the Duke&#x2019;s family came: Jack has seen them repeatedly, dined with them &#x26;c. The very first note the Duchess<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Charlotte Anne Thynne (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), da. of 2d Marquess of Bath m. <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>; mistress of the robes to Queen Victoria, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>.</note> sent was altogether unlike the <hi rend="italic">icy</hi> epistles of that kind we used to read: it gave us good augury, which everything since then has tended to confirm. She is a right natural, hearty, cheerful and honest-minded lady, from all I can learn, or Jack could observe; the Duke too he seemed to consider a very affable rational quietly sensible man;&#x2014;we thought it very kind last night, the Duke followed poor Jack out into the lobby, and asked him (Jack thought, with a blush) &#x201C;Whether he was in need of any money before setting off?&#x201D; They have three, or perhaps four very nice children; for whose health it is chiefly that they go abroad:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Walter (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>), 6th Duke of Buccleuch; Henry John Montagu Douglas Scott (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>), 1st Baron Montagu; Walter Charles Scott (<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>); and Francis Robert Montagu Douglas Scott (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>), who d. in Naples the next <date when="1839-05-00">May</date>.

But the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1838-10-20">20 Oct.</date> had reported: &#x201C;It is not disguised that his object is to repair the inroads which he has made on his splendid patrimony by recent great outlays of various kinds. Many of these have been on improvements which are creditable to him, and will ultimately repay him; but there are others as to which opinion will be more divided. Report states that he contributed ten thousand pounds to the funds of the Carlton Club, and expended besides, thirty thousand in the last election. &#x2026; His absurd violence as a politician is much redeemed by his personal qualities, his courtesy, good faith, and gentlemanly bearing.&#x201D;</note> there is a certain queer old Earl of Hume<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), 10th Earl of Home; lord lt. of Berwickshire; m. <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>, Lady Elizabeth Montagu (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), who, as second da. of Henry, 3d Duke of Buccleuch, had been the present Duke of Buccleuch&#x2019;s aunt.</note> (Jack describes him as near four-score, speaking broad Scotch, and telling hunting-stories, a respectable old blade); he, with the heads of the house, with the children and their tutor and governess, and Heaven only knows how many courier flunkies and other ministering servants,&#x2014;were to constitute the party. It was apprehended few inns would be able to take them all in: wherefore it is settled now that they are to go in two parties; Jack (and perhaps the old Earl and perhaps not) with the children and their tutors and attendants, occupying two carriages and preceded by a baggage-cart (with a fine French name, <foreign><hi rend="italic">fourgon</hi></foreign>) carrying all the baggage, nay carrying a kitchen apparatus and a Cook,&#x2014;this is to be the first party. The Cook will always drive ahead far enough to be at the inn and have all things ready for them; most comfortable sure enough! Then at the distance of a day or half a day <pb id="pg-10-223" n="10:223"/>the Duke and Duchess with their retinue will come following behind; and at any town, or inn that promises to be large enough they are to stop and pass the night altogether: it is on this principle that Jack was to go off this morning; the Duke not till tomorrow. They are to be at Paris on saturday by easy Journies: they go down thro&#x2019; France to Marseilles at the very end of it: they do not <hi rend="italic">cross</hi> the Alps, but go round by the end of them, go by steam from that Marseilles (or perhaps in the Duke&#x2019;s own ship); in some ten days they will be out of the winter, and into bright weather again: there seems to be every prospect of their journey being easy and prosperous, late as the season is; and, I do think, of their doing very well together when arrived, which is more important. No medical situation could have been schemed out for our poor Doil that would have been preferable; I sincerely think, as every one does, that it is very good, and may be very useful to him. He is to write to you from Paris; you will get the letter probably in some eight days after this. He volunteered to write tonight from Dover to Jenny at Manchester; I was going to have done it, otherwise.</p>
<p>And so you see, dear Mother, all is settled; and our poor Doil<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of John&#x2019;s nicknames; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:172</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note> off again: it is not his lot to be at rest. For the last two weeks there has been the most amazing concourse of tailors, shoemakers and other furnishers here; he himself whirling about from place to place, dining out, dining in the city, seldom dining here; but all is over now, and things were pretty well adjusted at last. We have had a very pleasant month of it, he and I; we had long walks together several times, went to see people, &#x26;c; and often gave ourselves rendezvous to meet somewhere in town, and probably dine at a chophouse in an independent way. We had talkings and arguings; a more restless or a kinder hearted mortal never lived than this Brother of mine. He is gone now, poor fellow; his room lies vacant with some little broken paper and fragments; and no Jack any longer there. We must be content; there is time to meet, and again a time to part; such is our lot here on Earth. May the All Good grant us all a reunion Yonder where there is to be no parting more! Amen.</p>
<p>Jack has left his Bank-receipt with me; what money he had here to spare (&#xa3;100 of his with some of mine) I am putting into the American funds, where one has 5&#xBD; per cent for it, and perfect safety as I believe: Jack was not entirely sure about putting the whole amount he has into that investment, tho&#x2019; I rather counselled it: but if he do so determine, it can be done at any time. One of the last things he did was to force a sovereign on me &#x201C;to buy <hi rend="italic">Examiners</hi> for my Mother&#x201D;: it will serve forty <pb id="pg-10-224" n="10:224"/>weeks: I could not refuse it utterly without vexing the poor Doil; who indeed had no more need of English money. We went up in a cabriolet (small coach) this morning together, having breakfasted hastily about 8 in the clear <foreign><hi rend="italic">snell</hi></foreign> [biting] morning; we arrived duly at the door of Montague House (Buccleuch&#x2019;s residence here, a fine large house in the midst of a garden);<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Montagu House, Whitehall, built for Ralph (<date when="1638-00-00">1638</date>&#x2013;<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>), 3d Lord Montagu, had come into the Buccleuch family through the marriage of Elizabeth Montagu (<date when="1743-00-00">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>) to Henry, 3d Duke of Buccleuch. It was &#x201C;screened from the street by trees and a garden; and between it and the Thames was a terraced garden with venerable trees, fountains, and statues, and an open pavilion commanding a fine view of the river&#x201D; (John Timbs, <hi rend="italic">Curiosities of London</hi> [London, <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>] 553). Buccleuch pulled down this Montagu House and built a new one, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>.</note> coaches were drawn up at the door, Jack&#x2019;s luggage was hauled in by servants, and there we shook hands, and said farewell. I wrapt myself in my cloak, and strode away home again thro&#x2019; the bitter wind in a mood of strange sadness and resignedness which I shall not soon forget. Poor Jack was very <foreign>wae</foreign> [sad] too, but did not <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [weep] or otherwise misbehave. Good go with him so will we all pray.</p>
<p>Since coming home, I have pasted up our middle folding-doors, for the winter and frost are actually come; and then all this being sorted, I have sat and wrote till now the shadows of night are falling again. I hope I have given you a full narration, and that you all feel about the business as I do, thankful tho&#x2019; <foreign>wae</foreign>. I sent a Newspaper to James Aitken yesterday in my own hand, which would be a kind of token to them; you can let them know more specially by sending this or otherwise so soon as there is opportunity. Mary should be written to, or apprised; Alick can do it.</p>
<p>The rest of my story, what relates to Chelsea alone, can soon be told. I am well enough; meaning soon to be busy, tho&#x2019; it is not yet perfectly clear at what. Some &#x201C;article,&#x201D; I suppose; but it must be one of some significance. The little one already written comes out tomorrow: it is entitled &#x201C;Varnhagen von Ense&#x2019;s Memoirs&#x201D;; I will send the Review by and by (about New Year&#x2019;s time), and you will read it pleasantly enough; but it is on the whole worth nothing at all except the cash I get for it. They are out of measure anxious to have more writing from me; indeed almost troublesome about it, for it seems to be doubtful whether that is my best course now or not.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1838-12-03">3 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The Article <hi rend="italic">Varnhagen</hi>, signed S.<hi rend="italic">P</hi>., came out last week, with the others in that N<hi rend="italic">o:</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [worth nothing]. The question is now: shall I write another larger; and if so, on what? All literature speculation and theory is grown flat and stale to me. I had a notion, and have, of writing some sort of address to English fellow-men on the condition of men in England. My heart has for twenty years had feelings of its own on that subject; a faint monition born of conscience urges me on. But it is difficult to articulate such a thing; but I am rude, inexpert:&#x2014;alas, but I am lazy and foredone in heart: that is the great <hi rend="italic">but!</hi> We shall see.&#x201D; This became <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, pbd. late <date when="1839-12-00">Dec. 1839</date>.

The F. Revolution too it seems is near done; I will combine America with this country, and have another edition of that too, with clear prospect of profits, before long. It will be <date when="1839-03-00">March</date> probably before the &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; arrive from America; this, had I seen into the thing sooner as I now see it, might have been avoided, for the thing would sell now were it here. My dear Mother shall have a copy, go without one who will. Let us be thankful therefore that all is so tolerable; that we are well in health, and no longer so terribly poor as we used to be of late years. Jane stands the winter as yet quite handsomely; she is evidently much stouter than she was this time twelvemonth. We partly expect Mrs Welsh here by and by: but doubtless all is very unsettled about Liverpool; the poor Mother of the house having been so lately called away.</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Almost the very day after my last Letter went off, the long-expected two volumes of &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; arrived. The heterodox pamphlet has never yet come to hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Divinity School Address</hi>, <date when="1838-07-15">15 July</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381107-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-11-07">7 Nov.</date></ref></note> I am now to write to you again about that &#x201C;Miscellany&#x201D; concern: the fourth letter, I do believe; but it is confirmatory of the foregoing three, and will be the last, we may hope.</p>
<p>Fraser is charmed with the look of your two volumes; declares them unsurpassable by art of his; and wishes (what is the main part of this message) that you would send his cargo in the <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> state, bound and lettered as these are, with the sole difference that the leaves be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> cut, or shaved on the sides, our English fashion being to have them <hi rend="italic">rough</hi>. He is impatient that the Book were here; desires farther that it be sent to the Port of London rather than another Port, and that it be packed in <hi rend="italic">boxes</hi> &#x201C;to keep the corners of the volumes safe,&#x201D;&#x2014;all which I doubt not the Packers and Shippers of New England have dexterity enough to manage for the best, without desire of his. If you have printed off nothing yet, I will desire for my own behoof that Two hundred and <hi rend="italic">sixty</hi> be the number sent; I find I shall need some ten to give away: if your first sheet is printed off, let the number stand as it was. It would be an improvement if you could print our titlepages on paper a little stronger, that would stand <hi rend="italic">ink</hi>, I mean: the fly-leaves in the same,&#x2014;if you have such paper convenient; if not, not. Farther as to the matter of the titlepage, it seems to me your Printer might give a bolder and broader type to the words &#x201C;Critical and Miscellaneous,&#x201D; and add after &#x201C;Essays&#x201D; with a <hi rend="italic">colon</hi>, (:) the line &#x201C;Collected and Republished,&#x201D; with a colon also; then the &#x201C;By&#x201D; &#x26;c. &#x201C;In Four Volumes./ Vol I&#x201D; &#x26;c I mean that we want in general a little more ink and decisiveness: shew your man the titlepage of the English &#x201C;F. Revolution,&#x201D; or look at it yourself, and you will know. R W. E&#x2019;s &#x201C;Advertisement,&#x201D; friendly and good, as all his dealings are to me ward, will of course be suppressed <pb id="pg-10-229" n="10:229"/>in the English copies.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written a brief intro. to vols. 1 and 2, called &#x201C;Advertisement&#x201D; and signed &#x201C;R.W.E. Concord, <date when="1838-06-24">June 24, 1838</date>.&#x201D;</note> I see not that with propriety I can say anything by way of substitute: silence and the New England <hi rend="italic">imprint</hi> will tell the story as eloquently as there is need.</p>
<p>For the rest you must tell Mr Loring,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellis Gray Loring.</note> and all men who had a hand in it along with you, that I am altogether right well pleased with this edition, and find it far beyond my expectation. To my two young Friends Henry S. M<hi rend="italic">c</hi>Kean (be so good as write these names more indisputably for me) and Charles Stearns Wheeler,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380925-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref></note> in particular, I will beg you to express emphatically my gratitude; they have stood by me with right faithfulness, and made the correctest printing; a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> service: had I known that there were such eyes and heads acting in behalf of me there, I would have scraped out the Editorial blotches too (notes of admiration, dashes, &#x201C;we thinks&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c, common in Jeffrey&#x2019;s time in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review) and London misprints; which are almost the only deformities that remain now. It is <hi rend="italic">extremely</hi> correct printing wherever I have looked, and many things are silently amended; it is the most fundamental service of all. I have not the other <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> by me at present; I think they are of themselves a little more correct; at all events there are nothing but <hi rend="italic">misprints</hi> to deal with;&#x2014;the Editors, by this time, had got bound up to let me alone. In the &#x201C;Life of Scott&#x201D; fourth page of it (p.296 of our edition), there is a sentence to be deleted. &#x201C;It will tell us, say they, little new and nothing pleasing to know&#x201D;: out with this, for it is nonsense, and was marked for erasure in the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. I daresay. I know with certainty no more at present.</p>
<p>Fraser is to sell the 4 volumes at 2 guineas here. On studying accurately your program of the American mercantile method, I stood amazed to contrast it with our English one. The Bookseller here admits that he could by diligent bargaining get up such a book for something like the same cost or a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> more; but the &#x201C;laws of the trade&#x201D; deduct from the very front of the selling-price&#x2014;how much think you?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">forty per cent</hi> and odd, where your man has only <hi rend="italic">fifteen</hi>, for the mere act of vending! To cover all, they charge that enormous price. (A man, while I stood consulting with Fraser, came in, and asked for &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Revolution&#x201D;; they shewed it him, he asked the price; and exclaimed, &#x201C;Guinea and a half! I can get it from Am<supplied>[er]</supplied>ica for nine shillings!&#x201D; and indignantly went his way;&#x2014;not without reason<supplied>[.) There]</supplied> are &#x201C;laws of the trade,&#x201D; which ought to be <hi rend="italic">repealed;</hi> which I will take the li<supplied>[berty]</supplied> of contravening to all lengths by all opportunities&#x2014;if I had but <pb id="pg-10-230" n="10:230"/>the power! But if this joint-stock American plan prosper, it will answer rarely. Fraser&#x2019;s first &#x201C;French Revolution&#x201D; for instance will be done, he calculates, about New Years day; and a second edition wanted; mine to do with what I like. If you in America wanted more also&#x2014;? I leave you to think of this.&#x2014; And now enough, enough!</p>
<p>My Brother went from us last tuesday; ought to be in Paris yesterday.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1838-12-03">3 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;My good brother Jack went away, as Physician to the Duke of Buccleuch, for Italy and Naples, this day week. The drive with him to Montague House that morning; his <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> at me as I sat smoking by the fire the night before; our bustlings and our journeyings, all our meetings and our partings here below: O Heaven!&#x2014; He writes to me yesterday that they had been detained all the week at Dover by the weather, which indeed has surpassed all measure for wildness: they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> to get across on Saturday: this day probably they are somewhere about Beauvais, or in that region. Good go with them! We rejoiced in Jack&#x2019;s good fortune; yet it is a wandering fortune, and at bottom perhaps no good one. The poor Doil has his own sufferings;&#x2014;one of the kindest-hearted, lovablest and most provoking of the Sons of Adam. To me the best of brothers. I doubt I did wrong in so peremptorily refusing all money from him, even tho&#x2019; I did not need it. When I did look to need it, and to be beaten and reduced to a morsel of bread, it was he alone of men alone that always to my imagination stood between me and such issue. Is not such a brother a possession of one&#x2019;s own?&#x201D;</note> I am yet writing nothing; feel forsaken, sad, sick,&#x2014;not unhappy. In general Death seems beautiful to me; sweet and great.

A new epoch (for good or for great evil!) is evolving itself in me: be it in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>.

I seem to myself more a monster than a man. O the detestable irrepressible beastly ideas I have of myself and of man and men! How could Swift laugh at such things and write them down in words. They are things to be shuddered over, and kept in profoundest concealment.&#x2014; For one thing, I am always in the despicablest state of health: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the main source of them I believe. <foreign>Basta</foreign> [enough], for this day.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>You ran off from me in Autumn altogether on the sudden; instead of finding you at Hastings on my return from Scotland, I learned while sojourning there that you were over the seas again for a winter in Italy. That midnight interview in the box-cab, on the pavement of London streets,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:160.</note> was the the last I was to get of you for some time! We hear duly of your progress; across the Alps, thro&#x2019; Picture-galleries, Lombard or Tuscan cities, beautiful Italian Nature and Art; an articulate <hi rend="italic">Good-speed</hi> goes now and then from us, and many an unarticulated one: what more could a Letter do? However I will this morning write you a Letter too, that you may have it in both ways.</p>
<p>I remained in all some eight weeks in Scotland; three in Fife, diligently riding over green paths there, or walking silent by the shore of the many-sounding sea, with a due proportion of <hi rend="italic">bathings,</hi>&#x2014;with many unutterable meditations. Then I saw Scotch Parsons<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On his visit to the Aitkens at Minto Manse; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380906-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1838-09-06">6 Sept.</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380915-TC-JWC-01"><date when="1838-09-15">15 Sept.</date></ref></note> at dinner, in &#x201C;Yarrow visited&#x201D; or therabouts [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>];<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Wordsworth, &#x201C;Yarrow Visited&#x201D; (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>). Yarrow Water, Selkirkshire, joins Ettrick Water ca. ten mi. from Minto, Roxburghshire.</note> but hastily quitted these. I spent a night with Jeffrey;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380906-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1838-09-06">6 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> looked on the stones of Edinburgh City; wondered whether it was solid or a dream. Then I saw my good Mother and Kinsfolk, my native soil of Annandale. Finally I came drifting back hither, foolish &#x201C;drift-log on the sea of accident&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> where I ever since lie high and dry, not a whit wiser. Ah my friend, you know little about <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>, much as you argue with me about it! How many tragedies, epics, Haynes-Baily ballads,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Haynes Bayley (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), prolific writer of songs, ballads, and dramatic pieces.</note> and bursts of parliamentary eloquence<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18330321-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>9:393</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> would it take to utter this one tour into the South of Scotland by an atrabiliar lecturer on things in general?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311021-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:28</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-10-21">21 Oct. 1831</date></corr></ref> and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 18.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pauca verba</hi></foreign> [few words]:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> 1.1.</note> that is the only utterance for it.</p>
<p>On one subject however I must speak a word: the subject of wine. Standing duly ranged for my return there waited me here two dozen <pb id="pg-10-233" n="10:233"/>elegant-looking pint bottles; which, on being proved by the cork-screw, gave evidence of containing Port, of as excellent a quality as I ever tasted in my time. By a hint dropt from you before, and only by that, I recognised the beneficent hand of your fellow-traveller Dr Calvert,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. John Calvert.</note> a gentleman whom I have only seen once for a moment, but whom I ought not for a long course of years to cease remembering. How have I deserved this at his hands? Greater faith I have not found in Israel.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 7:9, Matt. 8:10.</note> Better wine I do believe was not drunk in this century. Pray say all that is handsome to him on my part, and in the dialect grave or sportful that you know will suit him best: I am much flattered and obliged; and know not what to say, or do, except blush almost as red as the liquor.&#x2014; Another individual too, I find, has sent Malmsey Madeira hither; addressed to my wife!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Calvert&#x2019;s and Sterling&#x2019;s gifts, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug.</date></ref>].</note> No end of strong drink? Always new mystery in the doings of men? If you fall in with this mysterious individual, at any quiet time, pray give him a hint of what I think, for you know it well enough. He is a very strange fellow, I suspect; and you have the way of him better than I.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since my return I have been as idle as man could well be. A Book I suppose will grow in me if I live some years. But as yet it lies swimming over Infinitude; sunk beyond sounding in Chaos and Night.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:543.</note> Really I find it a dreadful piece of work to write anything that is worth writing. One is <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> too; every man is alone in that matter, more or less. The difference with me of this year from last is that I feel afar off as if the desire and necessity of writing <hi rend="italic">might</hi> again declare itself in me; last year it seemed impossible forevermore. You are to consider more over that I am sick, continually dyspeptic, sleepless weak and sickly while I live in this London. If the gods would grant me bread and water anywhere with a kind of approximate health&#x2014;? The gods know better what they are about, and will do no such thing. However, here is one fact: my American friends have sent me &#xa3;50 <hi rend="italic">gained</hi> by the Revolution book in Transatlantic land; is not that worth noting? England has not yielded any coin of money, tho&#x2019; the &#x201C;first edition,&#x201D; says Fraser, is near done. We shall learn cunning by degrees. But now, with this American fifty pounds, partly for the humour of the thing, I have a real thought of purchasing a horse (my <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> medicine, with which I am approximately well always), and riding the same, in the name of Heaven. You remember our gallop on the heights of Hampstead? But in truth I think if I were rightly healthy, rightly as in old young days, <pb id="pg-10-234" n="10:234"/>I should fly out of the world; nothing under the Zodiac would contain me.</p>
<p>My brother, who joined me in Annandale, who followed me hither, and has had much fluctuation in his outlooks since then, is gone for Italy eight days ago; I expect a Paris Letter from him one of those mornings. He goes to Naples, Physician to his Grace of Buccleuch; carries messages for you, whom he eagerly counts on meeting somewhere. The good Jack! He has left me very lonely here for the time being; but his work, it appea<supplied>[rs,]</supplied> did not lie here, one has to follow his work. John Mill also talks of going abroad <supplied>[one]</supplied> of these days; to Malta, Mrs Buller told me.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Buller had probably been told this by Molesworth or Edward Wakefield, who had written to Molesworth, <date when="1838-11-28">28 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Our noble friend Mill is ordered to Malta&#x201D; (A. J. Harrop, <hi rend="italic">The Amazing Career of Edward Gibbon Wakefield</hi> [London, <date when="1928-00-00">1928</date>] 109).</note> He has got a dyspepsia; for which his Doctors imagine a winter in some better climate might be effectual at once in this early stage of it.

<salute>Dear Mrs Rich,</salute>
<p>Here is your brave Admiral&#x2019;s letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anselm John Griffiths (d. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), entered navy, <date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>; retired active service, <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>; rear adm., <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. Griffiths, a lt. on the <hi rend="italic">Culloden</hi>, which picked up 147 survivors, including Capt. Renaudin, from the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>, had been irritated by TC&#x2019;s repetition &#x201C;in his own peculiar style&#x201D; of the French version. He had written to a friend (see n. 8) on <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept.</date> detailing, &#x201C;since you request it &#x2026; the state of the actual fact as respects the sinking of the Vengeur.&#x201D; In <date when="1838-11-00">Nov.</date> several newspapers (including the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1838-11-18">18 Nov.</date>) pbd. a short letter from Griffiths with a summary of these facts. For the admiral&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 20 (<date when="1839-07-00">July, 1839</date>): 78&#x2013;79. See also <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:212&#x2013;15.</note> and many thanks for the sight of it. The Admiral&#x2019;s story hangs well together; his style, apart from all other considerations, is that of blunt sailor-like sincerity and perfect veracity. I have a decided persuasion that here is the true narration after all; that the Vengeur sank in this and no other manner, and that the French account of her sinking is no other, in all probability, than a cunningly devised fable of Barr&#xE8;re&#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bertrand Bar&#xE8;re de Vieuzac (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), member of the French National Convention, and the Committee of Public Safety. Minister of culture and propaganda when the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi> was sunk, he used the story to encourage the ill-equipped republican forces.</note> whom Mercier characterises as &#x201C;the greatest liar in France.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Sebastien Mercier (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340818-TC-JSM-01"><sic>7:276</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1834-08-18">18 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>) in <hi rend="italic">Le Nouveau Paris</hi> (Brunswick, <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>) consistently denigrates Bar&#xE8;re: &#x201C;<foreign>de ses vils mensonges</foreign>&#x201D; (1:130), &#x201C;<foreign>le menteur le plus intr&#xE9;pide</foreign>&#x201D; (2:86). TC follows Mercier&#x2019;s incorrect spelling &#x201C;Barr&#xE8;re.&#x201D;</note> Unless other evidence be adduced, I shall feel obliged to cancel the business in a new Edition,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his 2d edn. (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), TC added the passage beginning &#x201C;So has History written &#x2026;&#x201D; with a note &#x201C;Rear-Admiral Griffiths: Letter in the Newspapers (Examiner Newspaper, <date when="1838-11-18">18th November, 1838</date>), and Letters growing out of that. <hi rend="italic">See</hi> Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine, no. for <date when="1839-07-00">July 1839</date>&#x201D; (3:300&#x2013;301). In later edns. this note was altered to &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, Sinking of the Vengeur&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 4:242).</note> and hold it up to the world as a magnificent Fiction,&#x2014;worthy of the <hi rend="italic">Opera Tragique</hi>, but unfit for use elsewhere.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Barr&#xE8;re&#x2019;s masterpiece; the largest, most inspiring piece of <foreign><hi rend="italic">blague</hi></foreign> manufactured, for some centuries, by any man or nation&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 4:242). In his article, No. 11 of &#x201C;Epistles to the Literati,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 20 (<date when="1839-07-00">July 1839</date>): 76&#x2013;84, TC surveyed the whole episode, pbd. all the available correspondence, and expressed his conclusions in much the same way (p. 82; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:208&#x2013;25).</note></p>
<p>It is always good to destroy a Falsehood whenever one finds it. <pb id="pg-10-237" n="10:237"/>Admiral Griffiths bids fair to have the happiness of putting a final extinguisher on this. Whether the French will take down their <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mod&#xE8;le du Vengeur</hi></foreign> from its peg in the Pantheon, and own that it was all wind, we do not know:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Larousse du XXe Si&#xE8;cle</hi> (Paris, <date when="1933-00-00">1933</date>) in the entry &#x201C;Vengeur&#x201D; writes of heroism which prefers death to captivity in England, and while mentioning that the capt. and &#x201C;some&#x201D; sailors (267 in all, according to Griffiths) escaped in boats provided by the English, still concludes that about 250 men sank, to the cry of &#x201C;<foreign>Vive la R&#xE9;publique</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> but as for me my belief is all shaken, and without new evidence I will have no farther hand in it.</p>
<p>I have spoken of the business to Cavaignac and an Editor of the <hi rend="italic">National</hi> Newspaper:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Armand Marrast, contributor to <hi rend="italic">Le National</hi> during his exile, and ed. after <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360502-TC-JSM-01"><sic>8:339</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1836-05-02">2 May 1836</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370803-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:272</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-03">3 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>).</note> I wish them to submit the matter openly to France, and ask: &#x201C;Have you any counter-evidence then, or have you none?&#x201D; a thing which they, as truth-lovers, have expressed willingness to do. The former Letter in the Sun Newspaper does not seem to have come into view in France, the <hi rend="italic">National</hi> Editor heard of it from me for the first time. I will get it copied for him; I have already copied this second Letter (tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">without</hi> &#x201C;My Aunt&#x2019;s&#x201D; name,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. A copy of this letter of TC&#x2019;s and the admiral&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept.</date> in the same handwriting (MS: NLS 8955.49) is headed by the copier: &#x201C;To my Aunt, Miss Jane Stirling, Clippens.&#x201D;</note> of course) and will let him have study of it. On Thursday night I am to see him and Cavaignac again.</p>
<p>And now what I wish you to ascertain for me is whether Admiral Griffiths would have any objection to have this second letter faithfully translated, and published too (in my name, as a thing I have been allowed to see), entire or what part of it is thought needful, in the French Newspapers? I can see no objection; but nothing shall be done in that way, till we have express leave. Nay I believe the already published Letter will suffice; tho&#x2019; this second one confirms and elucidates it. They would of course treat <hi rend="italic">this</hi> as a private letter; and probably give only passages of it by way of comment to the other.&#x2014; &#x2014; Having given new currency to the Fiction (which I read in boyhood in an English Book, and have since read in all places, and never till now saw authentically contradicted),<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >But see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381210-TC-AMA-01">TC to <sic>[AM?]</sic><corr>[AMA]</corr>, [ca. <date when="1838-12-10">10 Dec.</date>]</ref> for the contradiction pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>, <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>, which TC had read.</note> I am anxious to see it extirpated, and even to be <hi rend="italic">in at the death</hi>. Let me know therefore as soon as you can ascertain, whether there is leave or not.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adm. Griffiths gave TC permission to use his letters in Britain, but not &#x201C;in any other language or Papers, as <hi rend="italic">so</hi> put forth <hi rend="italic">by me</hi>. I never deemed it worth one thought to awaken the French from their dream of glory in this case; and should have still preserved silence, had not Mr. Alison and yourself given it the weight of an English authority. &#x2026; So far as I am an <hi rend="italic">active</hi> party, I confine my interference to our side of the water; leaving you to do as you see fit on the other&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:217).</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; If you have any opportunity <pb id="pg-10-238" n="10:238"/>I will beg you to thank Admiral Griffiths in my name, and offer him my best respects.</p>
<p>I did not find you at Clifton Terrace; but I will try again. I saw &#x201C;Snow&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Julia Wedgwood (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>), Fanny&#x2019;s eldest child.</note> at the upper window, and have discovered your topography.

See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:212&#x2013;15, for Griffiths&#x2019;s two letters.</note> on which we communicated lately. You undertook the French side of the business; you are become, so to speak, advocate of France in this matter; as I for my share am put into the post of advocate for England. In the interest of all men, so far as that can be concerned here, the truth ought to be known, and recognised by all.</p>
<p>Having read the story in some English book in boyhood, naturally with indelible impression of it; reading the same afterwards with all <pb id="pg-10-239" n="10:239"/>detail in the <hi rend="italic">Choix des Rapports</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced, but clearly a collection in several vols. of the many reports made to the National Convention, <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">95</date>.</note> and elsewhere; and finding it everywhere acted upon as authentic, and nowhere called in question,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Despite this disclaimer TC had read the report of Lord Howe&#x2019;s battle against the French in the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>, <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>, with this footnote: &#x201C;In a bombastic report which was made to the convention by Barr&#xE8;re, it was asserted that the sailors of Le Vengeur disdained to surrender to the English, and that as the vessel went down they uttered the shouts of <foreign>Vive la R&#xE9;publique, Vive la Libert&#xE9;</foreign> and <foreign>la France</foreign>. The one of these assertions is as false as the other. The vessel did surrender, and when she sunk nothing was heard from her crew but cries for succour&#x201D; (379); and even in his 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> TC had drawn attention to the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>.</note> I wrote down in my Book with due energy and sympathy, as a fact for ever memorable. But now, I am bound to say, the Rear-Admiral has altogether altered the footing it stands on; and except other evidence than I yet have, or know where to procure, be adduced, I must give up the business as a cunningly devised fable, and in my next edition contradict it with as much energy as I asserted it. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know with how much reluctance that will be; for what man, indeed, would not wish to believe it?</p>
<p>But what can I do? Barr&#xE8;re&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Rapport</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Report made to the National Convention, <date when="1794-07-09">9 July 1794</date>.</note> does not even profess to be grounded on any evidence except what &#x2018;the English Newspapers&#x2019; afforded him. I have looked into various &#x2018;English newspapers&#x2019;; the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, the Opposition or &#x2018;Jacobin&#x2019; journal of that period, I have examined minutely, from the beginning of <date when="1794-06-00">June</date> to the end of <date when="1794-07-00">July 1794</date>, through all the stages of the business; and found there no trace or hint of what Barr&#xE8;re asserts: I do not think there is any hint of it discoverable in any English newspaper of those weeks.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >However Thackeray in his &#x201C;French Criticism of the English&#x2014;the Vengeur,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 21 (<date when="1840-03-00">March 1840</date>): 332&#x2013;45, quoting a report in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> that Bar&#xE8;re might have misinterpreted, concludes: &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle &#x2026; must be taken to task for calumniating honest Barr&#xE8;re. He had <hi rend="italic">some</hi> little peg to suspend his lie upon&#x201D; (340-41). &#x201C;On the Sinking of the Vengeur&#x201D; was repbd. in the 2d edn. of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), and TC added a final postscript: &#x201C;additional microscopic researches &#x2026; disclose to me what seemed the probable genesis and origin of Barr&#xE8;re&#x2019;s Fable; &#x2026; the discovery, &#x2026; not of much importance even to our criticism of Barr&#xE8;re&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:225).</note> What Barr&#xE8;re&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">own</hi> authority was worth in such cases, we all know. On the other hand, here is an eyewitness, a man of grave years, of dignified rank, a man of perfect respectability, who in the very style of these letters of his has an air of artlessness, of blunt sincerity and veracity, the characteristic of a sailor. There is no motive that could induce him to deny such a fact; on the contrary, the more heroic one&#x2019;s enemy, the greater one&#x2019;s own heroism. Indeed, I may say generally of England, at this day, that there could not be any where a wish to disbelieve such a <pb id="pg-10-240" n="10:240"/>thing of an enemy recognised as brave among the bravest, but rather a wish, for manhood&#x2019;s sake, to believe it, if possible.</p>
<p>What I should like, therefore is, that these circumstances were, with the widest publicity of Journals or otherwise, to be set openly before the French Nation, and the question thereupon put: Have you any counter-evidence? If you have any, produce it; let us weigh it. If you have none, then let us cease to believe this too widely credited narration; let us consider it henceforth as a clever fable got up for a great occasion; and that the real <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi> simply fought well, and sank precisely as another ship would have done. The French, I should hope, have accomplished too many true marvels in the way of war, to have need of false marvels. At any rate, error, untruth, as to what matter soever, never profited any nation, man, or thing.</p>
<p>If any of your reputable Journalists, if any honest man, will publish, in your Newspapers or otherwise, an Article on these <hi rend="italic">data</hi>, and get us either evidence or no evidence, it will throw light on the matter.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marrast received only one reply, dated <date when="1838-12-24">24 Dec.</date>, to enquiries in French official quarters which TC pbd. in his article (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:219&#x2013;20). But after the article appeared, <date when="1839-07-00">July 1839</date>, it was replied to in several French journals (see Thackeray, <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 21 [<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>]: 335&#x2013;45, and TC&#x2019;s final comments, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:224&#x2013;25).</note> I have not yet Admiral Griffiths&#x2019;s permission to print this second letter (though I have little doubt to get it very soon); but the first is already published, and contains all the main facts. My commentary on them, and position towards them, is substantially given above.</p>
<p>Do what is fit; and let the truth be known.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your letter with its welcome batch of news came last week; for which many thanks. We had heard from Alick some time before, but were otherwise without tidings from the home-land. It is you always that send a clear detail of all things more surely than another; and truly when I think <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you have <supplied>[to]</supplied> write, with &#x201C;the imp&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Aitken.</note> dipping continually in your ink, and then by way of finish spilling the bottle over your writing, I ought to be doubly thankful. I was not aware that I had been silent to you so long; I fancied at least that you had duly seen our other Annandale epistles: fasten you upon the &#x201C;faithless Dillick&#x201D; <pb id="pg-10-241" n="10:241"/>for that oversight, and scold him sharply into order<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick in his letter of <date when="1838-12-24">24 Dec.</date> felt &#x201C;somewhat <hi rend="italic">nettled</hi> &#x2026; a sort of <hi rend="italic">slur</hi> has attempted to be cast on my character.&#x2014; The reverse is the fact. The letter in question arrived here on tuesday&#x2014;was perused at Scotsbrig the same day&#x2014;brought over again &#x26; sent to Jean next morning&#x2014;received again at night and sent to Mary on the following morning.&#x201D;</note> Or perhaps it was only John Jardine;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ecclefechan carrier to Dumfries every Wed., to Annan every Thurs.</note> and poor Alick did as well as he could, but was unlucky?&#x2014; I had written at great length to our Mother just before your Letter came; I learned too by a short note from Jack that he had written to you all from Dover where he lay storm-staid: I waited therefore till word came from Paris; a happy event which took place last night; and now I write without delay. The letter is sent round by you according to your request, tho&#x2019; I have my doubts about the safety of it. Pray make strict inquiry, and if there be any hesitation, send on my Mother&#x2019;s Letter by itself,&#x2014;for I have no doubt she is in great anxiety to see it before now. We had a Newspaper from Boulogne, charged some 14 pence; which we refused; having learned from it all we cared <hi rend="italic">one</hi> penny for, that Jack was safe across: this until yesternight was the only intelligence we got. All goes well, it would seem, in that quarter; and our good Doctor is like to get on altogether handsomely. His Duke and Duchess appear to be very good people; the situation is every way a far more promising one than that Clare concern could ever have become. My Mother ought to understand that the weather will soon grow warmer upon them after quitting Paris. If I get Newspapers, I will try to send them; but there seems to be some new crotchet in the Post Office so that money is charged for them: in that case, I will refuse, and <hi rend="italic">have</hi> none to send, at which she must not get uneasy.</p>
<p>Poor Wull Brown!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their cousin of East Linbrigford. Alick had told TC in his letter of <date when="1838-08-08">8 Aug.</date> that Will had had rheumatic fever and was at Annan: &#x201C;The fever is now left him but he is weak and heartless and professes to think he will not recover again &#x2026; His own heartlessness <supplied>[is]</supplied> looked upon as the worst symptom.&#x201D;</note> I hardly expected to see him again, yet his departure proved swifter than I had looked for. A toilsome, stinted, slavish life his was; and the fruit of it is all gone to the wind, will do good to no one, probably will do mischief. The &#x201C;chinchilla tippet&#x201D; is verily of evil omen; in strange contrast with the famishing dog stealing a raw potatoe; and almost as mad in its own way as that was. Many a time has some little legacy of money been the wreck of a human life in this world of work and effort. We will <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> the poor legatee alone, we will leave the whole business alone,&#x2014;with better wishes for it than hopes.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For information about Will&#x2019;s death from Jean&#x2019;s letter, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>The cheerfullest tidings you sent was that from Scotsbrig and Ecclefechan<supplied>[.]</supplied> <pb id="pg-10-242" n="10:242"/>I hope poor Isabella will get fast stronger now, and soon be able to follow her affairs again. My new Namesake is welcome to this world.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella and James&#x2019;s second son, b. <date when="1838-11-00">Nov.</date></note> He has got a tough job of it, I can tell him, he is bound for the credit of the house to grow a stout fellow, and clear things to the right and left of him by and by.&#x2014; Alick&#x2019;s continued welfare is very gratifying. He is very patient and diligent in his calling; there seems to be a fair outlook of his prospering very fairly in it. I have not for many years seen him in so wholesome a way as he looked to be in then. Tell him he has always my love and best wishes I can form; and that I mean to write him soon:&#x2014;if it is not he that ought to write hither? What becomes of Linbrigford Farm?

See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec.</date></ref>, for further details.</note> no chance there now? They must be patient; some suitable place will turn up by and by.&#x2014; Our Scotsbrig meal barrel will be altogether welcome arrive when it may. The oatmeal is done; I am reduced to a thin supper of hot milk, with or without a bit of toast. The tobacco is done; I have been obliged to send to my wholesale merchant for 3 pounds more of his coarse stuff,&#x2014;the retail price in these shops is 5/4! By the bye I believe now that the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kimmiter</hi></foreign> [Weasel] Mundell told me false about this London Tobacconist, and that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> tobacco is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> manufactured here, but at Glasgow. Putting faith in the human word, I have been kept continually in a puzzle about my tobacco these four years, and I begin to see it now! Many thanks to Peter<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mundell&#x2019;s was now run by Peter Mundell (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381002-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1838-10-02">2 Oct.</date></ref>); perhaps his father Robert was the &#x201C;<foreign>Kimmiter</foreign>&#x201D; with the false information. However Alick in his letter of <date when="1838-12-23">23 Dec.</date> said that &#x201C;the exciseman tells me, there is not any tobacco cut in Britain except in London.&#x201D;</note> for his guidance. But it is pity when the Speech of Man becomes like the Chattering of Sparrows,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> and worse; a man ought to be ashamed of wearing a tongue in these circumstances.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I sent off a considerable bundle of books, thro&#x2019; Edinburgh for James. You probably have them before now. One was for Glencorse the Annan Weaver that saved me (before you were born) from drowning:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381127-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-11-28">28 Nov.</date></ref></note> pray do not fail to wrap it up, and send it safe and soon. If James have received the Parcel, let him put <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke on the next <hi rend="italic">Courier;</hi> that will be sign both for them and this.&#x2014; William Corson<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310824-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:360&#x2013;61</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> wrote to me about six weeks ago: he wanted to take Craigenputtoch House. I referred him to James and M&#x2019;Diarmid; said that he <pb id="pg-10-243" n="10:243"/>should have it, the game, and all &#x26;c&#x2019;s for &#xa3;10, the sum M&#x2019;Diarmid hoped to get from some Sportsman about Mabie. As you say nothing of Corson, I infer he has not shewn himself. Probably he expected to get the house for <hi rend="italic">nothing;</hi> that is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a rent that will pay one. Let him stand there, <hi rend="italic">un</hi>housed for me, if not on those terms.&#x2014; Mrs Welsh still continues at Liverpool, and probably will till the season improve. We expect to see her here before she return northward.</p>
<p>With regard to Chelsea, all goes on moderately well. Jane, in spite of the inclement tempestuous weather, and worse than all, the detestable frost-fogs, is still on her feet, making no complaint, and goes out whenever there is a glimpse of sun. I am in my old bilious way, now better, now not so well; I carry on as I best can. Sometimes I have serious thoughts of buying myself a horse with my American money, and riding for health&#x2019;s sake. A horse is so dreadfully ill to keep here. But then health, even as a commercial commodity, is also so valuable. We shall see when the Spring weather comes: I really have a thought of trying it, the only medicine ever yet discovered for me. In regard to all outward things, I get on what ought to be called &#x201C;very well indeed.&#x201D; The best is, I mind little how that go; my chief joy and desire of my heart being still to <hi rend="italic">keep myself quiet</hi>. Take what you will from me, good people, but leave me my natural rest! The F. Revolution will require a new edition before long; I shall take better care of that, and go more cunningly to work with it. The poor book has fought its way very handsomely hitherto; with England and America together. I do think I shall even make some money of it yet. There is a dud of an Article by me in the last London &#x26; Westminster Review; signed &#x201C;S.P.&#x201D; as one I did not care to own: it is a quite innocent thing too;&#x2014;and the Editor gentleman ought to pay me my cash for it soon! They have offered me, these Editor people of that same Review, the amplest scope and room to write whatsoever I will for them: the fools, they should have closed with me this time twelvemonth, when I was anxious for, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> declined the very terms they are <hi rend="italic">treating</hi> upon me now!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371030-TC-JSM-01"><sic>9:337&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-10-30">30 Oct. 1837</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371107-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:343</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-11-07">7 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371212-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:364</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-12-12">12 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> The tables do turn in that way sometimes. I cannot bring myself to any decision about this offer of theirs; indeed I am altogether indisposed for writing (and yet at bottom desirous of it too); I must conclude about it one of these days, and set to work in some more decisive sort of industry than that of mere reading, and scribbling for my own behoof merely. But one sits (or rather <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sit) so quiet in the evenings, with a book, lamp and clear-going fire: just about enough of worthy friendly people come to interrupt us; and for invitations out <pb id="pg-10-244" n="10:244"/>there are two to be refused for one to be accepted: the weary soul says to itself, Why should I work or struggle? Behold, is there not a book, is there not tobacco and quiet?&#x2014; However, that will not do long; I believe I must alter my figure one of these days.</p>
<p>Dear Jean, I have had such a pen as no Christian could rejoice in (&#x201C;Wha could spell wi&#x2019; sic a pen?&#x201D;),<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:363</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> and now my sheet is entirely done, and I must out to look for a frank. Innumerable things were to be added: indeed what end were there, did not time and paper end? Give our love from this Chelsea fireside to all the loved hearths; clear be they all, and cheerful and peaceable. Good be with you always.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A Frenchman of my acquaintance has requested me to take some charge of the inclosed Paper of Questions, proceeding from a Paris Erudite, who seems to sign himself &#x201C;Aim&#xE9; Guillon de Montl&#xE9;on.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aim&#xE9; Guillon de Montl&#xE9;on (<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), controversial writer, theologian, historian.</note> I apply to you as the fittest friend I have in this case.</p>
<p>M. Cousin, it appears, in publishing an Edition of Abelard&#x2019;s works,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Victor Cousin (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271119-TC-JJ-01"><sic>4:278</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1827-11-19">19 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>), in <hi rend="italic">Collection de documents in&#xE9;dits sur l&#x2019;histoire de France, Ouvrage in&#xE9;dits d&#x2019;Ab&#xE9;lard, pour servir &#xE0; l&#x2019;histoire de la philosophie scholastique de France</hi> (Paris, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>).</note> has omitted these 89 sections of the celebrated Eunuch&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Ab&#xE9;lard (<date when="1079-00-00">1079</date>&#x2013;<date when="1142-00-00">1142</date>), a Breton, one of the founders of scholastic theology; castrated by order of Fulbert, canon of Notre Dame, whose niece, H&#xE9;loise (<date when="1101-00-00">1101</date>&#x2013;<date when="1164-00-00">64</date>), he had seduced.</note> <hi rend="italic">Sic et Non;</hi> and is even thought to have destroyed the Manuscript:&#x2014;for what reason <pb id="pg-10-245" n="10:245"/>Heaven alone knows; neither man nor beast, one would think, could fear injury or hope for profit from the amplest discussion, and decision either <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sic</hi></foreign> or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Non</hi></foreign>, of these 89 things.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sic et Non</hi> was apparently Ab&#xE9;lard&#x2019;s earliest theological work but never previously pbd. Cousin had collated two thirteenth-cent. manuscripts from the monasteries of Saint-Michel and Marmoutiers. He included Ab&#xE9;lard&#x2019;s prologue, sixty-eight complete questions and answers that he thought would have contemporary interest, and a list of all 157 questions to give a fairly exact idea of the work. Presumably Guillon was correct and Cousin had not destroyed the manuscripts as the work was pbd. later (with 158 questions and answers) by E. L. T. Henke and H. S. Linderkohl, eds., <hi rend="italic">Petri Abaelardi Sic et Non</hi> (Marburg, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>).</note> Aim&#xE9; Guillon, however, is not of that opinion; but requests you, thro&#x2019; me, to stir a little in the matter,&#x2014;to prevent <hi rend="italic">manuscripticide</hi> at least.</p>
<p>Would you therefore be so good as ascertain first whether both or either of these <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. he indicates, with the 89 <foreign><hi rend="italic">suppressa</hi></foreign>, exist in your Libraries; and then secondly at what cost a copy of the 89 could be got out of them and sent to him? I have promised that he shall have some kind of answer before long.</p>
<p>I write today, but shall perhaps not get a frank today. When you come to Babylon again, pray let me see you.</p>

<salute>My dear Maurice,</salute>
<p>You spoke one day about the possibility of getting me a permission to read in a private room of the British Museum.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s view of working in the British Museum, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400626-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1840-06-25">25 June 1840</date></ref> n. 1., and later vols.</note> Might I now ask you to be so kind as investigate that matter a little more closely for me. I could like to know first what such a permission means, whether one has actually some kind of inhabitable closet to oneself (inhabitable <pb id="pg-10-246" n="10:246"/>at this season of the year) with liberty to order books as in the public room; and then secondly by what methods such a permission is to be obtained or solicited.</p>
<p>I am also speculating about another suggestion of yours: that of getting some Books from Cambridge.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Douglas Heath (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), barrister; fellow of the Trinity College, Cambridge, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>; judge of court of requests, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>, county courts, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; he ed. the legal remains of Francis Bacon for vol. 7 of Spedding and Ellis&#x2019;s edn., <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>.</note> Neither is the scheme of the &#x201C;London Library&#x201D; dead; nay it seems rather to be in a lively way, and will perhaps come to something before long.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The campaign for the subscription library culminated in a public meeting, <date when="1840-06-24">24 June 1840</date>, at which TC spoke.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday in enumerating the &#x201C;happy arrivals&#x201D; that gave good augury for this Christmas, we had to mention among the first of them that of your Letter from Marseilles.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> Your Letters from Dover had got to their destinations; your Letter from Paris, and before that, a Boulogne Journal (which I refused, as the charge was 15 pence and I had got what I wanted of it) had reached us in due season; but no other hint or tidings whatsoever; a thing I had more than once been audibly <pb id="pg-10-247" n="10:247"/>lamenting. With the noon of Christmas, however, came a new figure of affairs; the invaluable Threepenny, with his double knock, set all to rights. I instantly despatched news of the occurrence to Alick, not waiting for a frank; I am to send your Letter itself on Saturday next; the summary will gratify them all tomorrow. We hope you are at Civitavecchia<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fortified town and seaport, thirty-seven mi. WNW of Rome.</note> by this time; that favourable weather and fortune has attended and will attend you. Let us be as thankful as the contrary would have filled us with affliction. Many are the journeys thou hast had, poor Jack: come safe back to us before long, and set thy staff up somewhere.</p>
<p>I was extremely melancholy for a day or two after that Tuesday morning. It was altogether mournful to go up stairs, and see the trunks, the fragments of paper and other residue, and to hear only the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> proclaiming, &#x201C;Jack is not here now.&#x201D; One has to consider that too as inevitable, to endure that too. Your image of your progress and position hitherto is such as ought to gratify us. I like the Duke and Duchess for your behoof, and calculate that you will get into a very tolerable relation towards them. Intimacy is perhaps not to be expected, perhaps not to be desired; but they have young human hearts, and you have intimate services to do them. The more I think of it the more I like that little trait of the Duke asking you about money the night before you went. Stand by your work <foreign><hi rend="italic">fortiter</hi></foreign> [bravely] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">suaviter</hi></foreign> [pleasantly]; that is the rule; and let anything that will follow from it follow. Old Home<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a note from Dover, <date when="1838-12-01">1 Dec.</date>, John had written: &#x201C;For the last two days I have dined with Duke and Duchess and Lord Home. &#x2026; I think him a good-natured curious specimen of Scotch nobility.&#x201D;</note> also will do: as for the Tutor,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note>&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ay de mi!</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:241</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> I know that kind of &#x201C;indolent&#x201D; callow individuals; one is right lonely and <foreign>wae</foreign> for oneself when thrown into society with such: fifteen years fewer on thy dull head; poor boy, thou knowest little how it stands with an ancient like me in all this, for God&#x2019;s sake shut thy yellow-bill (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Gelbschnabel</hi></foreign>),<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally yellow bill, the mountain linnet; figuratively <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gelbschnabel</hi></foreign> means whippersnapper or callow youth.</note> and let me at least have silence! On the whole, you will probably find the young man courteous in manner; and for the rest be able very much to leave him standing on his own basis. May wisdom guide you dear Brother in all that, and prosperity attend you. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> prayer is above all important.</p>
<p>Soon after your departure there came a Letter from Jean: it was to her accordingly that I forwarded your Paris Letters; by a contrivance <pb id="pg-10-248" n="10:248"/>of franks which was to carry them forward to Scotsbrig the same day. Further, the night before last (this was another &#x201C;Christmas luck,&#x201D; enumerated by our Dame) the Scotsbrig Barrel of Meal came to hand, and in it two short Letters, from our Mother and Jamie. They are about ten days back in date; a while subsequent to Jean&#x2019;s. Jean had been at Scotsbrig just before writing. I must now tell you the news. Poor Wull Brown is dead: he seems to have departed on the Tuesday before that on which your journey began;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tues., <date when="1838-11-27">27 Nov.</date></note> they give no particulars: he never grew better, I conjecture, sank pretty rapidly, and passed away in the mood we saw him in.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381211-TC-JCA-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-11">11 Dec.</date></ref></note> Jamie appears to have seen him once again at least; he was altering his will, and needed Jamie&#x2019;s help: Robert<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Will&#x2019;s brother, a mason; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220429-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:100</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1822-04-29">29 April 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> has got <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, or as good as that; when Jamie objected, Wull gave a snore thro&#x2019; his nostrils and made no other answer: Nell<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably his sister; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340327-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:120</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-03-27">27 March 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> has an annuity of &#xa3;20; the rest is all gone to the foolish Daughter,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary, who had had an illegitimate da. in <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date> (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:171</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March 1819</date></corr></ref>). She was apparently very like him (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351024-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:240</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-10-24">24 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>).</note>&#x2014;whose first free act, Jean says, was to commission thro&#x2019; her a &#x201C;chinchilla tippet of the shawl shape,&#x201D; the lowest cost of which would be &#xa3;7 or &#xa3;8: a great contrast, Jean remarks, to the phenomenon you once noticed in that house, of a famishing dog in rapid flight with a raw potatoe it had stolen! The <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of all things is solemn and tragical; our poor Wull, such as he was, has passed on also, and will never thro&#x2019; all centuries return any more.&#x2014; Isabella has got a new son; whom they are to call Tom, in honour of me. She recovers her strength, yet slowly, they say. Our Mother is much down stairs assisting; the sister Martha Calvert<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Isabella and Martha&#x2019;s mother was Martha Calvert (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240210-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:30</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-02-10">10 Feb. 1824</date></corr></ref>). Martha was presumably employed as a nurse by Mrs. Park.</note> being strictly engaged at Ecclefechan with Mrs Park,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of James Park; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360223-TCJWC-JAC-01"><sic>8:306</sic><corr>TCJWC to JAC, <date when="1836-02-23">23 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> who is very ill of rheumatic disorders. Alick is considered to be doing well. Jamie got &#x201C;nearly the half&#x201D; of his crop more or less damaged by rains, reckons that it will be a bad year for wet-land farmers, but withal that he &#x201C;will be able to go on as usual.<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> What the Austins are doing I did not hear; except that our Mother was to go down thither about the new-year &#x201C;to assist Mary,&#x201D; in an inevitable business she has. It is a miserable year for the poor, there and here: provisions rapidly rising, trade like to be unsettled, great discontents like to take <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> among the Lancashire people: I pity them from my soul. Jean mentions one other anecdote: Sandy Corrie<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311124-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:55</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-11-24">24 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> called one day, and celebrated <pb id="pg-10-249" n="10:249"/>your good fortune, your bread now was baked and water made sure, nay you might have it in your power to do any one of them an effectual service: all which, Jean says, they took as <hi rend="italic">Foll-loll de riddel loll</hi>.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A meaningless refrain.</note> I was to send you our Mother&#x2019;s blessing, and request to have a letter at due intervals, the first soon. She seemed to be in her usual state of health; she had put in <hi rend="italic">a mutton ham</hi> (in her old way) beside the tobacco, and written nearly two pages. I recollect nothing else that needs mention. They were all gratified with their Dover letters.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1838-12-01">1 Dec.</date></note> It is at this moment about noon: the invaluable Threepenny has again arrived, bringing a Letter from Alick! All is still well there; Grahame and your other friends clamorous with &#x201C;congratulations,&#x201D; and good wishes. Rob Brown engaged to try and get Linbrigford farm for Austin, did quite the reverse: there is now little hope of it, Alick thinks, and little use in it if there were.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter, <date when="1838-12-23">23 Dec.</date>, Alick wrote: &#x201C;After poor <hi rend="italic">Wol&#x2019;s</hi> miserable exit, Rob of Annan engaged to Jamie of Scotsbrig to claim the farm. &#x2026; instead of which he wrote to Thos. Carlyle of Waterbeck very soon after giving up all claim to the farm whatever. This was exactly what might have been expected from the poor professing <hi rend="italic">white liver</hi>. Miss Brown who is now gone to Carlisle again, has also engaged to apply about it. &#x2026; I am far from being convinced that it is worth applying for at all. A more heartless looking spot I never set my eyes on.&#x201D;</note> Ben Nelson has got an appointment, chief manager of a branch of the Southern Bank<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Southern Bank of Scotland, founded <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, was based at Dumfries. By the time of its takeover by Edinburgh-Leith Bank, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, it had seven branches.</note> at Annan, salary &#xa3;100 or so, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> furnishing a clerk; his business is to advise: you are to write to him? Hunger rules at Ecclefechan, not without riot. Paterson of Townfoot was said to have offered the poor people turnips at 10/a-cart-load, potatoes at &#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi> apiece, they burnt him in effigy, a turnip hanging round his neck; whereupon Sharpe &#x26;c have been &#x201C;swearing in special constables in great numbers.&#x201D;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was burned in effigy &#x201C;on the wooden-bridge before his own front door. The authorities were here assembled to investigate the case on saturday [<date when="1838-12-22">22 Dec.</date>]. &#x2026; His honour of Hoddam [General Sharpe] and Sir Patrick [Maxwell] of Springkell were on the bench, backed by Alic Young. &#x2026; Anything however like a &#x2018;rising&#x2019; appears to me out of the question in the mean time. A vast quantity of blacker misery must first be endured. My own motto, in the present posture of affairs continues.&#x2014; Economy Moderation and sobriety, at least as near as possible.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>, <date when="1838-12-21">21 Dec.</date>, reported a radical meeting in Ecclefechan on <date when="1838-12-14">14 Dec.</date>, and &#x201C;a little effigy-burning&#x201D; on <date when="1838-12-15">15 Dec.</date>, but did not report the trial.</note> Mother is to go to Annan this week. Miss Brown is gone back to Carlisle. Scotsbrig and the rest of them well. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> cease now, or change.</p>
<p>Robertson paid me &#xa3;18 for the Varnhagen Article; by a draft on the Westminster Bank in Waterloo Place: entering to get it cashed, I discern sitting as main clerk, considerable greyheaded and worn, but <pb id="pg-10-250" n="10:250"/>with the old air of knavery and ledger politeness,&#x2014;Tom of the Bank!<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Irving of Supplebank, one of three brothers; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220427-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:95</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1822-04-27">27 April 1822</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-JCE-01"><sic>3:97</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> Palpably he; and in an inner room, munching at the moment a tough crust, sat the bald head of an old clerk of Oliver and Boyds.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edinburgh publishers who had pbd.

One cannot say what is <hi rend="italic">safe;</hi> this Illinois concern is universally said to be &#x201C;safe <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>,&#x201D; and how safe that is you cannot for your life learn farther. Hamilton himself would not advise, but seemed to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it advisable for you.&#x2014; Apart from settling of the money that day, it is difficult to say what I have been performing since you went. Idle and miserable, too often! And yet one is not always idlest when suffering much and seeming to do nothing. I awake these two last weeks regularly too soon; but in the long dark hours have felt that my pain of mind was literally an indispensable thing, a clearing of the decks for action. There is some writing <hi rend="italic">in</hi> me this year; very different from last: that is a great comfort. What the writing is we shall see by and by. For one thing, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review stuff; I have done altogether with Robertson for one while; the decision whether I should not even write a great quantity for him <pb id="pg-10-251" n="10:251"/>hung upon a hair at last, but the hair turned it, and it was final. Mill is off for Paris, thence for Italy, where he had some hope of seeing you.<note n="27" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They saw each other in Naples, <date when="1839-02-00">Feb. 1839</date>.</note> Before going he was here once, and spoke of his readiness <hi rend="italic">now</hi> and wish to have any quantity of reviewing I could do for him. The confused welter shaped itself in some days more into a kind of reluctant purpose to do an essay on Oliver Cromwell; and I went to the Museum with that view one day, Robertson and I having agreed about it two nights before;&#x2014;he had come with Pepoli&#x2019;s things<note n="28" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were no articles by Pepoli or on Italy in current numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>.

TC apparently wished to write a longer work, but (as his practice elsewhere shows) such a review essay would not have precluded this. Forster, Vaughan and Robertson all wrote in vindication of Cromwell, so that if TC were to write on Cromwell, he then needed to make his work more thorough rather than different in interpretation if he were to surpass them. David Masson explains that &#x201C;Robertson had been trained among the Independents or Congregationalists, the only portion of British Society that had preserved a tradition of Cromwell more affectionate and respectful than that which prevailed generally&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties</hi> [Edinburgh and London, <date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>] 10&#x2013;11, where he has much else to say about Robertson).</note>&#x2014; But you shall hear better next time.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>On thursday I hope Alick would receive the Letter I hastily despatched for him with tidings that there was news of Jack&#x2019;s welfare and good progress. I now according to engagement send you off Jack&#x2019;s Letter itself; which tho&#x2019; it contain little not known now will not fail to be interesting to you. I fancied your fears and anxieties in this dreary winter season would be so great that it was worth while to despatch the good news express and as it were by way of telegraph. I <pb id="pg-10-256" n="10:256"/>wrote to Jack, a long letter, the next day; addressed to Naples. He wishes Alick to write; which he ought to do by and by. You might add a line yourself. The address is &#x201C;Dr Carlyle/Duke of Buccleuch&#x2019;s/Naples&#x201D;; it must be written large and plain; you have to pay some 2/ to Postie, or it will not go off. We may consider Jack as doing very well at present; far better than we could expect in Autumn last. You must not be impatient for his next letter; who knows how long they may loiter about, at one place and another, before they get the length of Naples? Whenever it comes to hand (if he send it this way) I will despatch it.</p>
<p>The next morning after I had written to Alick there arrived a Letter from him; assuring me, among other good things, that you stood this winter pretty well. You are probably at Annan today; but they will send you this without loss of time. We send our affectionate regards to Mary and James; our best wishes that she were well thro&#x2019; her task, poor thing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her pregnancy.</note> They are not likely to get Linbrigford, Sandy says;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec.</date></ref></note> which perhaps is a pity, and perhaps may be no pity; one does not know. This must be a sore year for working men, with all kinds of provision so high: but it will not last always; there are better things possible yet.</p>
<p>I have realised my American Draft of dollars into Pounds Sterling; I send my dear Mother five off the fore-end of it: the &#x201C;<foreign>kitlin</foreign> ought to bring the <foreign>auld</foreign> cat a mouse&#x201D; in such a case as that,&#x2014;an American mouse! It is very curious that cash should come in that way to good Annandale industry from across three thousand miles of salt water, from kind hands that we never saw. I mentioned probably in the former letter that I have arranged with these same American people for 250 copies of my &#x201C;Miscellanies,&#x201D; as they call them, which are to be sold here. Fraser is extremely impatient for them; but will have to wait three months, I fancy. He tells me the F. Revolution is going off briskly, will very soon be done, and a new edition required. Both from the Miscellanies and it I hope to make a little cash; I understand the method of bargaining better now, and the books do sell, no thanks to booksellers, or even in spite of them, the blockheads! It does not seem at all likely that I shall ever have much money in this world; but I am not now so terribly hard held as I used to be, such bitter thrift may perhaps be less imperative by and by.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s health is again somewhat stronger; she still goes out in fine days a little, and does not cough. We hope she will be able to hold up <pb id="pg-10-257" n="10:257"/>till the year turn; she is evidently better than she has been of late winters. This day (which is wet) she sits by me &#x201C;covering a chair,&#x201D; a new stuffed very pretty chair, which a certain Mr Darwin (one of my Lecture friends) brought in yesterday, by way of Newyear&#x2019;s gift: very handsome indeed! She herself some time before that had bought for me with her own cash a huge article of the kind they call Tub-chair; it is really like a <hi rend="italic">tub</hi>, or hogshead, all stuffed round; screens you from every draft, and the only fault is that one cannot sit in it without <hi rend="italic">falling asleep</hi>. I wish many times you had it, up in your room yonder; with a good clear fire in front, and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> all round (for it would rise a foot over your head) you might let the winds rave as they liked,&#x2014;provided always no cattle or other outlers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Animals left unhoused.</note> were exposed to them!</p>
<p>I have for the present given up with the Review people; chiefly on this fundamental ground, that the Editor is very much of a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi>, a class of persons whom I find it utterly disagreeable to act with; the fatallest class of all! Mill is gone to Italy for health, and this man of his (one Robertson, a blustering, good-natured, ignorant, illbred Scotchman), tho&#x2019; a great admirer of mine, does not suit me at all.&#x2014; I am beginning to read books with a kind of view towards writing somewhat;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably on Cromwell.</note> but that writing lies a good way off yet I think. The best is, that I am not so dreadfu<supplied>[lly]</supplied> pushed now, and can wait a while till the spirit move me.</p>
<p>Last night I was dining at the Bullers&#x2019; to meet Charles who is just returned from Canada. There was another man called Gibbon Wakefield, who seemed to me clever and coarse; he too is one of Durham&#x2019;s people. I think they will have a warm winter of it among them; the thickest skin hold<supplied>[s]</supplied> longest out, say I: it is for their own cause they are struggling; very slightly if at all for mine or the world&#x2019;s. Charles gave me a frank, you see; and that was good so far.</p>
<p>Your Letter, your mutton-ham (tho&#x2019; you said nothing of that) were lying safe in the Barrel. Many, many thanks. It is all right; right as could be.&#x2014; Jane says &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t ye say every thing that&#x2019;s kind for me, to Mary and her?&#x201D; I am to mention farther that it was your own former praise of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> hand (as compared with mine) that made her write so carelessly, so illegibly. You see what <hi rend="italic">partiality</hi> comes to at last!&#x2014; Good be ever with you dear Mother. Send a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke when Mary is better if you have not time to write at the instant.&#x2014; I sent the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> round by Jenny last week; I know not whether she understood to forward it. Send her my love; I will write by and by. <pb id="pg-10-258" n="10:258"/>Your letter, round by Dumfries, came right? I infer so from Alick. I have to write a word for Jamie still.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever &#x26; ever,&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
