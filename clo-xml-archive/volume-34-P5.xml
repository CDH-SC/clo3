<p>This volume includes letters from July to the end of <date when="1858-12-00">December 1858</date>. Of the letters, 69 are from JWC and 121 from TC.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the 190 letters in this volume, 121 are from TC and 69 are from JWC. Twenty-five (36 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s letters and 89 (74 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are previously unpbd. Eleven (16 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s letters and 11 (9 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are pbd. in part. Twenty-eight (41 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s are pbd., many either in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM,</hi> or A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM.</hi> Three (2 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are pbd. in full. Five (7 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s and 18 (15 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are quoted.</note> It is a period of significant accomplishment undermined to some extent by familiar demons. Frequent bouts of ill health, TC&#x2019;s preoccupation with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, and memories of her idyllic Haddington youth continue to torment JWC. In moments of despair, she finds no outlet for her feelings, even in the act of writing, which becomes a burden that sharpens her sense of estrangement from the world. For both TC and JWC, the written word has been the rock on which their &#x201C;sore life pilgrimage&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580708-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July</date></ref>) has been founded. When letters fail to appear regularly, the result is invariably panic and desperation on the part of the anxious recipient. From Annandale, where by the end of June he is seeking solitary relief from the frenetic but successful push to complete the first two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, TC pleads with JWC to write: &#x201C;What can I infer, in my gloomy thought, but that you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> better, more likely worse, and so in spite of my express request have kept <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> lest the real news might drive me crazy altogether!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Her withering reply confirms his fears. She rejects his suggestion that the air of Scotland and the presence of her beloved Dr. Russell might strengthen her condition: &#x201C;My constitution is completely worn out&#x2014;my nerves, my spirits worn out! Can all the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> on earth renew nerves and spirits?&#x2014;You are indeed sanguine if you imagine any &#x2018;air&#x2019; any D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; any anything can ever make <hi rend="italic">me</hi> into a healthy or even approximately healthy woman again&#x2014;You will have to just put up with me, as I am; even as I put up with myself as I am&#x2014;for the rest of my appointed time&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date></ref>). She is equally dismissive of his pitiful exhortations&#x2014;&#x201C;hold up thy little heart &#x2026; there are yet good years ahead of us. &#x2026; Courage, courage&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580708-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July</date></ref>)&#x2014;which only serve to reinforce her conviction that he is incapable of fathoming her despair. With bitter irony she reminds him of his favorite doctrine, which suits her present mood in ways that he does not appreciate: &#x201C;[D]on&#x2019;t you, &#x2018;the Apostle of Silence&#x2019; find fault with me for putting your doctrine in practice&#x2014;There are <pb id="pg-34-xiv" n="34:xiv"/>days when I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> hold my peace, or&#x2014;speak things all from the lips outwards&#x2014;or things, that being of the nature of self lamentation had better never be spoken&#x2014;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580716-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-16">16 July</date>]</ref>). TC is frightened and perplexed by her &#x201C;Silence.&#x201C; He takes the unusual step of writing in confidence to Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sister Louisa Baring with the delicately phrased suggestion that she invite JWC to visit the family house at Alverstoke, opposite the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>Fearful of being accused of meddling, he immediately makes a &#x201C;clean breast&#x201C; of the matter to JWC, and begs her to &#x201C;judge the situation fairly.&#x201C; He admits that his plan &#x201C;may be a hindrance not a help,&#x201C; though he hopes &#x201C;it will in fact be neither&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580714-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-14">14 July</date></ref>). She is quietly touched by his consideration, but when recurring tensions surface in late <date when="1858-10-00">October</date>, JWC quickly forgets the part he has played in her temporary recovery. In a letter to Lady Stanley, she recalls: &#x201C;I continued in a horrid way, till Miss Baring persuaded me away to Bay House &#x2026; where in twenty four hours I became all healed&#x2014;like a cracked china basin boiled in sweet milk!!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581023-JWC-LST-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, [<date when="1858-10-00">late Oct.</date>]</ref>). If the written word can exacerbate JWC&#x2019;s feelings of paralysis and &#x201C;self lamentation,&#x201C; it can also free her from the snares of her emotional claustrophobia. When she redirects her formidable powers of observation to the world around her, she achieves a perspective that conveys an exhilarating sense of release, both social and linguistic. Teeming with humor and drama, her two Chelsea set pieces, &#x201C;Notes of a Sitter-still&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580711-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-11">11 July</date>]</ref>) and &#x201C;Notes of a Still-sitter&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-JWC-TC-02">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date>]</ref>) are the very opposite of &#x201C;still.&#x201C; Like TC, she unconsciously lives through the people and places that she describes, and invests them with individuality and distinctness.</p>
<p>In her description of Turgenev&#x2019;s friend Vassily Botkin, she establishes a clear contrast between her practical Scottish nature and his &#x201C;Cossack&#x201C; character, &#x201C;not that [she] ever saw a Cossack or heard one described.&#x201C; He possesses &#x201C;thin semi-circular eye brows&#x2014;a wide thin mouth&#x2014;complexion whity-grey, and the skin of his face looked thick enough to make a saddle of!&#x201C; His entrance into the house is as boisterous as his enthusiasm for TC&#x2019;s writings, which he translates into Russian: &#x201C;I begged him to be seated and he declared &#x2018;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was the man for Russia&#x2019; I tried again and again to &#x2018;enchain&#x2019; a rational conversation but nothing could I get out of him but rhapsodies about <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in the frightfulest <hi rend="italic">English</hi> that I ever heard out of a human head!&#x201C; She adds laconically, &#x201C;It is to be hoped that &#x2026; he <hi rend="italic">reads</hi> English much better than he <hi rend="italic">speaks</hi> it&#x2014;else he must have produced an inconceivable Translation of <hi rend="italic">Hero Worship</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580711-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-11">11 July</date>]</ref>). A somewhat relieved TC rightly remarks in his reply, &#x201C;[T]he Picture of Botkin &#x2026; seemed unsurpassable for fun &#x26; truth recogniseable thro&#x2019; it&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580713-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-13">13 July</date></ref>).</p>
<p>In her second &#x201C;Note,&#x201C; JWC sends a highly charged report of Lady Bulwer Lytton&#x2019;s extraordinary appearance at her husband&#x2019;s election rally in Taunton, <pb id="pg-34-xv" n="34:xv"/>where she publicly challenged him. Wholly identifying with Lady Bulwer Lytton as an abused spouse, JWC weaves newspaper quotations with her own descriptions to heighten the drama of Edward Bulwer Lytton&#x2019;s humiliation: &#x201C; &#x2018;Your <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi> is here&#x2019;&#x2014;Sir Liar staggered, turned as white as a sheet&#x2014;cast one wild look at his wife&#x2014;and&#x2014;&#x2018;rushed down the companion ladder&#x2019;! &#x2026; near the bottom of which, by the kind foresight of somebody, his carriage and servants stood ready! He &#x2018;jumped in&#x2014;fell back almost fainting&#x2019;&#x2014;and was galloped back to Knebworth&#x2014;leaving his friends to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> for him!&#x2014; Dont you think The Lady had the best of the day here?&#x2014;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-JWC-TC-02">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date>]</ref>). JWC&#x2019;s anger and ardor are intensified by the subsequent details of Bulwer Lytton&#x2019;s successful scheme to inveigle Lady Bulwer Lytton to London in order to have her committed to a lunatic asylum.</p>
<p>TC responds awkwardly to her championing of Lady Bulwer Lytton, whom both he and JWC had helped with publishers in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510107-JWC-JWE-01 lt-18510107-TC-LBL-01">26:9&#x2013;12</ref>). Undoubtedly aware of the rumors about their own marriage that had been circulating following the death of Lady Ashburton, TC advises JWC to temper her enthusiasm with caution. He agrees that Lady Bulwer Lytton is &#x201C;no more <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> than I am,&#x201C; but in a clumsily worded elaboration, he distinguishes &#x201C;scientifically&#x201C; between madness, which is beyond cure, and &#x201C;folly,&#x201C; with its &#x201C;wild ragings and jealousies and diabolic <hi rend="italic">passions</hi>,&#x201C; which can be &#x201C;stilled&#x201C; by reason and a &#x201C;change of heart.&#x201C; Hopeful that his &#x201C;Goody&#x201C; will accept this distinction, TC then echoes her condemnation of Edward Bulwer Lytton, &#x201C;the so-called &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> vessel&#x2019;&#x201C; who is a &#x201C;wretched profligate Quack&#x201C; and the &#x201C;ugliest of existing human creatures.&#x201C; But there are limits to TC&#x2019;s indignation. Fearful that JWC may want to initiate a campaign of support for Lady Bulwer Lytton&#x2014;a campaign that might throw unwelcome attention on life at Cheyne Row&#x2014;he advises her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not to speak of it;</hi> for we can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing in it,&#x2014;except easily enough <hi rend="italic">mischief</hi> to ourselves and others. &#x2026; Therefore, silence, silence!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580714-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-14">14 July</date></ref>).</p>
<p>A brief interval of relative peace follows, with both JWC and TC experiencing improved health. She tenderly admits to him, &#x201C;My greatest comfort all this time has been just knowing <hi rend="italic">you</hi> situated according to your needs&#x2014;in full enjoyment of air, milk, and quiet&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-19">19 July</date></ref>). Preparing for her visit to Alverstoke, she startles him by praising her new servant Charlotte Southam, who is &#x201C;[a]bove all &#x2026; my <hi rend="italic">servant</hi>&#x2014;does what I order at the first word&#x2014;and not my <hi rend="italic">mistress</hi>!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580730-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-30">30 July</date>]</ref>). JWC arrives at Bay House, proudly and comically conscious of her class and her appearance: &#x201C;How differently one&#x2019;s looks impress different people! The man who drove me from the station &#x2026; evidently took me for <hi rend="italic">well enough</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">going to service</hi> at Bay House; for he turned round so soon as we passed thro the gate, to ask &#x2018;Was he to drive round to the back door?&#x2019; and then the footman who received me took me for <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>!! coming close up to me, when he had any thing <pb id="pg-34-xvi" n="34:xvi"/>to say, and <hi rend="italic">shouting</hi> it&#x2014;into my ear!!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580802-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref>). Nonetheless, she is relieved by the warm welcome that Louisa Baring and her sister Emily extend to her.</p>
<p>The effect of the new surroundings is immediate. She informs TC two days later, &#x201C;I have not a single thing to complain of; and I agree with the place famously. I get a fair amount of sleep, am much less sensitive about the throat and breast, much less <hi rend="italic">shivery</hi> in mind, and unless the <hi rend="italic">glass</hi> here is made to flatter, my face is much less haggard and ghastly&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580804-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-08-04">4 Aug.</date></ref>). In a letter to her maid Charlotte, she writes that &#x201C;this life is the very wholesomest that could have been cut out for me! Sea-air blowing round me day and night&#x2014;a drive in an open carriage every day &#x2026; perfect comfort, without too much ceremony; and kindness without fuss!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580805-JWC-CSO-01">JWC to <sic>CS</sic><corr>CSO</corr>, [<date when="1858-08-05">5 Aug.</date>]</ref>). Yet always there is the shadow of Cheyne Row and <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> clouding her horizon. In a curiously poignant and pointed admission, she remarks, &#x201C;I dont feel the least drawing to 5 Cheyne Row in your absence, indeed I dont mean to have any thing more to do with it than I can help, till you are there.&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t think me crazy! &#x2026; I have suffered so much &#x2026; that even a <hi rend="italic">month</hi> of respite looks to me a thing worth taking any trouble for! and spending any money for&#x2014;that I can lawfully spend!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580806-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-08-06">6 Aug.</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>TC&#x2019;s decision to travel to Germany in order to visit Frederick&#x2019;s battlefields prompts JWC to accept an invitation from her cousin Janet Pringle to visit Lann Hall, in Tynron, near where she had spent summers as a child. At the end of August, JWC passes through London on her way to Dumfriesshire, and stays only one night in Chelsea. If TC can escape, so too can she. As she explains to Henry Larkin, &#x201C;It is very dreary spending one&#x2019;s life coughing alone, in that House of Cheyne Row, with which I have hardly any associations that are not saddening, or worse!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> dreary! And why should I do it? &#x2026; Whether M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C goes to Germany or not, I dont think he will be home till October&#x2014;So I have still a good few weeks in which to &#x2018;wander at my own sweet will&#x2019;!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580809-JWC-HL-01">JWC to HL, <date when="1858-08-09">10 [9] Aug.</date></ref>). Her bristling language reflects her revitalized spirits. She warns TC against traveling with the liberal theologian F. J. Foxton, who &#x201C;will bore you twenty times worse than Newberg! A constant <hi rend="italic">scratching on plaster</hi> going on beside you! Please Heaven that he have an attack of rheumatism to confine him to his sofa till you are clear off!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580814-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-08-14">14 Aug.</date></ref>). With relief, she leaves behind Carlyle&#x2019;s brother John in London: &#x201C;Each time I saw him, he left me with the feeling of having been whipt with a flail!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580829-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-08-29">29 Aug.</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>In Scotland she savors a temporary freedom from pain, remorse, and regret. F&#xEA;ted by friends and relatives, she revels in the reception she receives: &#x201C;And it is so much <hi rend="italic">heartier</hi> a sort of hospitality than one finds in the South! It makes me feel younger by twenty years! I catch myself <hi rend="italic">laughing</hi> sometimes with a <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> that startles <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>, as being not like my own but my <pb id="pg-34-xvii" n="34:xvii"/>Mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;who was always so much gayer than I&#x2014;Indeed it is good for me to be here!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580910-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-09-10">10 Sept.</date>]</ref>). But her buoyant mood is punctured by the news of TC&#x2019;s plan to return home earlier than expected and by the sudden recurrence of a &#x201C;severe and dangerous illness &#x2026; [which] has quite snubbed my conceit about my <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580921-JWC-CSO-01">JWC to <sic>CS</sic><corr>CSO</corr>, [<date when="1858-09-21">21 Sept.</date>]</ref>). Inevitably, she must prepare herself for the awful prospect of &#x201C;returning to that horrid Cheyne Row where I am always ill and generally miserable!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580911-JWC-HL-01">JWC to HL, [<date when="1858-09-11">11 Sept.</date>]</ref>). Yet she cannot bear the thought that TC will arrive in her absence, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">seeking things</hi> like a madman, and never finding them!&#x201C; The predicament of her new maid increases her anxieties: &#x201C;[H]is depending on the tender mercies of Charlotte for his diet&#x2014;leaves me no rest&#x2014;partly on Charlotte&#x2019;s account, I confess, as well as on his own!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580921-JWC-HL-01">JWC to HL, <sic>[<date when="1858-09-22">22 Sept.</date>]</sic><corr>[21 September 1858]</corr></ref>). She feels that she must join him at once, no matter what the consequences.</p>
<p>The return journey reminds her of the heavy price she has paid for leaving her native home. She reveals to Mary Russell, &#x201C;[W]hen I travel from London to Scotland, I get quite fresh to the journeys end, however weakly I may have been at starting, But when I do the same journey back again, I am tired thro every fibre of me, and don&#x2019;t get over it for days? &#x2026; I do begin to believe London a perfectly poisonous place for me&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581001-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1858-10-01">1 Oct.</date>]</ref>). A week later, she complains that &#x201C;this London atmosphere weighs on me, I find, like a hundred weight of lead! no health no spirits one brings from &#x2018;the Country&#x2019; can bear up against it! &#x2026; So my evenings are now sacred to reading on [TC&#x2019;s] part, and mortally ennuying myself on mine!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581006-JWC-JGCO-01">JWC to <sic>JGC</sic><corr>JGCO</corr>, [<date when="1858-10-06">6 Oct.</date>]</ref>). She blames the outbreak of another cold on TC, who had apparently insisted that she rearrange a bookcase in order to hang Antoine Pesne&#x2019;s picture of Frederick and Wilhelmina given to JWC by Lord Ashburton. The removal of a staircase window brings an unwelcome draft, and &#x201C;now I am shut up for six months &#x2026; with my <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> and all the rest of it.&#x201C; JWC mordantly reflects that &#x201C;there is no sunshine in this world without shadow. That Picture is very charming to look at from my sofa; but <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a cold is a heavy price for the pleasure!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581123-JWC-JPR-01">JWC to <sic>JP</sic><corr>JPR</corr>, [ca. <date when="1858-11-23">23 Nov.</date>]</ref>). Unaware that he has caused this relapse, TC tells his sister that he had wished the picture &#x201C;had gone down the river rather!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581113-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1858-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>An unforgivable blunder, for which the painter Robert Tait took the brunt of the blame, sours JWC&#x2019;s mood further and conjures up painful recollections of her Haddington past. In a biographical article in the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> of <date when="1858-10-23">23 October</date> (possibly by TC&#x2019;s former secretary, Frederick Martin), the author erroneously describes JWC&#x2019;s father, Dr. John Welsh, as &#x201C;a veterinary surgeon of good fortune&#x201C; (372). Determined to prevent her from reading the passage, TC instructs relatives and friends not to mention it and hastily forwards without explanation the Cheyne Row copy of the paper to James Carlyle. Meanwhile, Tait, &#x201C;who always does the flatsoled underbred <pb id="pg-34-xviii" n="34:xviii"/>thing&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581101-JWC-JC-01">JWC to JC, [<date when="1858-11-00">early Nov.</date>]</ref>), eagerly informs JWC of the error and compounds his gaffe by mentioning a correction by an M.D. from Walsall (probably John Burton; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581101-JWC-JC-01">JWC to JC, [<date when="1858-11-00">early Nov.</date>]</ref>), &#x201C;a townsfellow of Miss Welsh&#x2019;s,&#x201C; published in a subsequent issue. In his letter, the M.D. extols Dr. Welsh as &#x201C;one of the most highly cultivated and locally eminent medical men of his day in Scotland&#x201C; and JWC as one of &#x201C;the most rare and happy combination of the beauties of mind and person.&#x201C; But in his closing comments, he notes that JWC was an &#x201C;early acquaintance of Edward Irving, who &#x2026; used to call her his &#x2018;child of intellect&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>, <date when="1858-11-30">30 Oct.</date>, p. 404). Reporting the episode to James Carlyle in early November, JWC says nothing about the allusion to her former admirer. Instead, she claims that both she and TC are offended by the remarks about &#x201C;my &#x2018;charms of body and mind&#x2019;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581101-JWC-JC-01">JWC to JC, [<date when="1858-11-00">early Nov.</date>]</ref>). On the subject of Irving and his relationship with her, both JWC and TC instinctively agree to invoke &#x201C;the doctrine of silence.&#x201C;</p>
<p>TC&#x2019;s decision to seek refuge from his Prussian labors at The Gill, home of his sister Mary Carlyle Austin, inevitably inspires restlessness rather than rest. At first he enthuses about the &#x201C;best of eggs &#x26;c, the best of coffee;&#x2014;and such brown bread as &#x2026; is hardly procurable in Great Britain elsewhere&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-19">19 July</date></ref>). Idleness soon grows tiresome though, and his immersion in &#x201C;six weeks of nightmare sleep&#x201C; becomes intolerable. Like JWC, he is troubled by thoughts of the past, and in his solitude he has &#x201C;felt and remembered only too many things&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580804-TC-LS-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, <date when="1858-08-04">4 Aug.</date></ref>). In a vividly wrought passage, he expresses his sense of distance from the people whom he encounters on his daily rides: &#x201C;A man at 63 has a strange feeling when visiting his native country,&#x2014;as of a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> coming back to the Earth! I rode one day, market-day, thro&#x2019; [An]nan; did not see one soul whose face was known to me; only the old stone-walls were familiar; and strangers gazed at my &#x2018;wide-awake&#x2019; hat and old grey beard,&#x2014;asking, as their fathers or grandfathers would not have needed to do, &#x2018;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x2019;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581015-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref>). Thoughts of Lady Harriet Ashburton&#x2019;s death fill him with sadness and regret: &#x201C;Last time I quitted these parts it was on a certain <hi rend="italic">Highland</hi> Journey: a thing never to be forgotten by me&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580804-TC-LS-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, <date when="1858-08-04">4 Aug.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>The looming demands of his only partially completed Prussian history oblige him to abandon these somber reveries. He is determined to realize his long-contemplated plan to visit Germany in order to see Frederick&#x2019;s battlefields for himself. The maps and sources he uses are almost completely useless to him unless he can visualize the physical features of the landscape in which particular events occurred. His primary material too often impedes his vision of people and places: &#x201C;Alas, I am aware withal what a melancholy poverty of help lies in all such <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> as are conceivably extant; not to speak of <hi rend="italic">probably attainable.</hi>&#x201C; He knows that an &#x201C;actual sight &#x2026; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be of real value, beyond any other likelihood there is!&#x201C; In a manner that anticipates Proust, he <pb id="pg-34-xix" n="34:xix"/>tries to extract the life of the past from inanimate &#x201C;localities&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580722-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1858-07-22">22 July</date></ref>). With the help of the indispensable Neuberg and the &#x201C;scratchy&#x201C; Foxton, he organizes an exhaustive itinerary that includes visits to Zorndorf, Liegnitz, Leuthen, Mollwitz, Hohenfriedberg, Sohr, Chotusitz, Prague, Hochkirch, Torgau, and Rossbach. The prospect of the journey troubles him, yet he feels compelled to undertake it: &#x201C;The enterprise, I confess, seems horrible to me: but a certain uneasy feeling,&#x2014;something connected with literary <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> among other more questionable elements,&#x2014;urges me forward; and it must be done&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580816-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1858-08-16">16 Aug.</date></ref>). On <date when="1858-08-21">21 August</date>, he leaves Scotsbrig for Edinburgh, where he catches a steamer for Hamburg.</p>
<p>In his letters, and in a remarkable journal that he writes during the trip, TC records his impressions with energy, insight, and intelligence. The manuscript of the journal, which TC may have given to Alexander Carlyle, was eventually purchased by the Yale University Library. In <date when="1940-00-00">1940</date>, it was meticulously and scrupulously transcribed, edited, and annotated by R. A. E. Brooks, who published it as <hi rend="italic">Journey to Germany, Autumn <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date></hi>. His eloquent verdict on the manuscript is equally pertinent to TC&#x2019;s letters of this period: &#x201C;The &#x2018;Journey&#x2019; &#x2026; clearly shows how sharply Carlyle was impressed by a human or personal detail and a study of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> &#x2026; only confirms this. With all his insistence on fact and with all his careful and discriminating search for the facts, Carlyle was most deeply moved by, and most clearly apprehended history through the action, gesture, tone, or emotion of a discrete human individual&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> xxxvii). Together, the journal and the letters provide a luminous record of TC&#x2019;s visit to Germany, and a crucial testimony of the manner in which past and present telescopically converge in the composition of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>.</p>
<p>Exhausted by three sleepless nights at sea, TC arrives on the Continent disoriented and irritable. After a brief tour of Hamburg, he decides to accept an invitation to visit Baron and Baroness von Usedom at their home in Carsitz on the Baltic island of R&#xfc;gen. A long train journey to Rostock, and the prospect of a longer one to Stralsund, weakens his resolve. But, at Rostock, he is saved by the &#x201C;hand of an angel&#x201C; in the person of the &#x201C;incessantly explosively demonstrative&#x201C; Baroness Olympia von Usedom, who escorts him by carriage to their home, from where TC writes to JWC, &#x201C;a considerably rested man&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580827-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref>). The features of this &#x201C;German Isle of Wight&#x201C; fascinate him, &#x201C;with endless <hi rend="italic">paths</hi> but no <hi rend="italic">roads</hi>, strange oak-brick, red beehives of cottages very exotic looking &#x2026; in the moonlight.&#x201C; The Usedoms&#x2019; estate &#x201C;is like nothing you ever saw; medieval, semi-patriarchal; half a farm-house, half a palace.&#x201C; Amidst this whirl of new faces and scenery, TC frets about JWC, and wonders where and how she is: &#x201C;Oh my poor little Jeannie, if I knew you were but <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, I think I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be almost happy here today, <pb id="pg-34-xx" n="34:xx"/>in the silent sunshine, on these remote Scandinavian shores&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580827-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>The pleasures of the Usedoms&#x2019; Baltic paradise fade quickly, as TC is &#x201C;made [to] do the &#x2018;picturesque&#x2019; all the time, and there was no end to the talk [he] had to carry on.&#x201C; By the first week of September, he is in Berlin steeling himself for battlefield tours: &#x201C;[S]leep or no sleep, we are off tomorrow, and hand sticks to plough till the furrow is <hi rend="italic">complete</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580905-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-05">5 Sept.</date></ref>). Repeatedly, TC compresses narratives: &#x201C;Plenty to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> my poor Goody, had I once got speech of her again!&#x201C; His descriptions often suggest her presence, as if he were trying to visualize scenes through her eyes. Breslau &#x201C;is as queer an old City as you ever heard of. High, as Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or more so; streets very strait and winding: roofs 30 feet or so in height, and of proportionate steepness, ending in chimney-heads like the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of a Butterfirkin, set on its side&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580910-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-10">10 Sept.</date></ref>). Again, in his account of a drive through the Riesengebirge into Bohemia, TC comments, &#x201C;[L]ikest to it was that drive we once had from Buxton in Derbyshire across the Hills to Sheffield: you remember it no doubt&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580914-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-14">14 Sept.</date></ref>). They both perhaps realize that his promises to share these experiences with her later are hollow. The recollections he gives in letters and in his journal will serve as raw material for imaginary conversations he conducts with Frederick, rather than with JWC.</p>
<p>During his journey, details from his historical sources constantly overlap in TC&#x2019;s mind with his observations. One of his most uncomfortable moments occurs at Pardubitz, in Bohemia, in a &#x201C;[b]ig noisy inn, full of evil smells; contemptible little wicked village; where a <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than Jerry-shop [beer house] close over the way raged like Bedlam or Erebus,&#x2014;to cheer one in a &#x2018;bed&#x2019;. . . 18 inches too short, and a matrass forced into it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> cocked up at both ends, as if you had been lying in the trough of a saddle.&#x201C; The episode contributes to his harsh portrait of the Bohemians as &#x201C;liars, thieves, slatterns: a kind of miserable subter-Irish people; Irish with the addition of ill nature, and a disposition decidedly disobliging&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580914-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-14">14 Sept.</date></ref>). In <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> memories of this inn surface in the &#x201C;Tourist&#x2019;s&#x201C; sketch of the Czaslau hotels, which &#x201C;offer little of humanly edible; and, in the interior, smells strike you as&#x2014;as the <hi rend="italic">oldest</hi> you have ever met before&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:349). TC later conceives the Bohemians from Frederick&#x2019;s viewpoint, as &#x201C;[p]oor dark creatures; not loving Austria much, but loving some others even less, it would appear. Of bigoted Papist Creed, for one thing. &#x2026; We do not meddle with their worship more or less; but we are Heretics, and they hate us as the Night&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:27). The smallest detail can possess revelatory possibilities. At Hochkirch, where Marshall Keith and 700 Prussians were killed by the Austrians, the doors are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">still</hi> holed with the musketry&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580923-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref>). In <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, TC recalls this &#x201C;Fact&#x201C; in order to demonstrate the illuminating power of history: &#x201C;The strong outer Door of the old Church, red oak &#x2026; is <pb id="pg-34-xxi" n="34:xxi"/>still retained in that capacity; still shows perhaps half-a-dozen rough big quasi-<hi rend="italic">keyholes</hi>, torn through it in different parts, and daylight shining in, where the old bullets passed&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:424).</p>
<p>With great relief, TC reaches London on <date when="1858-09-22">22 September</date>. An early favorable review of the first two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C;the history is marvellously true and allusive&#x201C; (<date when="1858-09-18">18 Sept.</date>, 351)&#x2014;does little to diminish his concern about the work that remains to be done. To his French correspondent, &#xc9;mile Mont&#xE9;gut, he writes, &#x201C;I have still lying ahead a mass of dreary chaotic labour, which, in my now state of bodily strength and spiritual, is enough to make me shudder! I mean to get thro&#x2019; it, if I can, and then rest forever&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581015-TC-EM-01">TC to <sic>&#xc9;M</sic><corr>EM</corr>, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref>). But TC himself seriously underestimates the length of time he will need to complete the task. He confesses to his sister: &#x201C;I have still a formidable two years ahead, if I live so long; and after that, I mean to <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, at least <hi rend="italic">hard work</hi>, no more, however long I live. My scheme is, To get mainly away altogether out of this ineffable <hi rend="italic">pluister</hi>, where there is less and less left that is helpful or delightful to me&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581113-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1858-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref>). Engulfed by self-pity, he blames his <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> research for cutting him off from the world: &#x201C;I live altogether <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> from my fellow creatures and their ways; I am often very miserable over my sad problem,&#x2014;and may be said in general to resemble a man sunk to the eyebrows in quagmire, and left to help himself out, in a wet night, miles off any <hi rend="italic">house</hi>, if he can!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581224-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1858-12-24">24 Dec.</date></ref>). Although, like JWC, TC has his moments of despondency, a significant amount of his correspondence tends to contradict these lugubrious intimations of his declining reputation.</p>
<p>Mont&#xE9;gut&#x2019;s example illustrates the ways in which TC&#x2019;s influence could be felt by those working outside English political and intellectual circles. TC had apparently offered to send the Frenchman ten volumes of his recently published collected works, to which Mont&#xE9;gut responded with enthusiasm: &#x201C;I accept with gratitude your offer to send me the new edition of your collected works. Above all other contemporary books, these are the ones that I have read most often. It will be a great pleasure to read them in this new form. I always remember the moment in which I first discovered them, and the sense of wonder that I experienced. &#x2026; It has been a very long time since then; it was <date when="1844-08-00">August 1844</date>. A happier time will never come again&#x201C; (trans.; <sic>&#xc9;M</sic><corr>EM</corr> to TC, undated [<date when="1858-08-00">Aug.</date>/<date when="1858-09-00">early Sept.</date>]). Soon after he receives these volumes in early <date when="1858-09-00">September</date>, Mont&#xE9;gut writes again to thank TC &#x201C;for this precious gift, which is more precious to me than any other gift&#x201C; (trans.; <sic>&#xc9;M</sic><corr>EM</corr> to TC, undated [<date when="1858-09-00">late Sept.</date>]).</p>
<p>Mont&#xE9;gut had already sent TC a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Essais sur l&#x2019;&#xE9;poque actuelle: Libres opinions morales et historiques</hi>, which had been published in June. In these essays Mont&#xE9;gut explores a wide range of subjects in an overtly Carlylean manner: &#x201C;Du g&#xE9;nie fran&#x26;ccedil;cais,&#x201C; &#x201C;La Renaissance et la R&#xE9;formation,&#x201C; &#x201C;Des <pb id="lastpage-34-xxii" n="34:xxii"/>controverses sur le XVIIIe si&#xE8;cle,&#x201C; &#x201C;De toute puissance de l&#x2019;industrie,&#x201C; &#x201C;De l&#x2019;individualit&#xE9; humaine dans la soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; moderne,&#x201C; &#x201C;De l&#x2019;id&#xE9;e de monarchie universelle,&#x201C; and &#x201C;De l&#x2019;homme &#xE9;clair&#xE9;&#x201C; [&#x201C;Of French Genius,&#x201C; &#x201C;The Renaissance and the Reformation,&#x201C; &#x201C;Controversies of the Eighteenth Century,&#x201C; &#x201C;The Powers of Industry,&#x201C; &#x201C;Individuality in Modern Society,&#x201C; &#x201C;The Idea of a Universal Monarchy,&#x201C; and &#x201C;Enlightened Man&#x201C;]. What unites them is an unsystematic and paradoxical approach, which Mont&#xE9;gut defends in his preface: &#x201C;These are not the expression of a system, they are not guided by any partisan spirit, nor are they inspired by any particular sect or school&#x201C; (1; trans.). TC is impressed by the volume, which he finds &#x201C;excellent reading&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18581015-TC-EM-01">TC to <sic>&#xc9;M</sic><corr>EM</corr>, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref>). Mont&#xE9;gut replies several weeks later and urges TC to persevere with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. Having been crippled by disease, he sympathizes with TC&#x2019;s mental and physical struggles to overcome his Prussian nightmare: &#x201C;I understand too well the worries that <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> has caused you, but in spite of everything you say, I know that this will be the best book that exists on this subject, so interesting and so unbearable, so original and so dry&#x201C; (trans.; <sic>&#xc9;M</sic><corr>EM</corr> to TC, undated [late <date when="1858-09-00">Sept.</date>]).<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I am grateful to Catherine Heyrendt, lecturer in British civilization at the Universit&#xE9; de Paris III and XII, for her expert transcriptions of these previously unpublished letters.</note></p>
<p>In spite of persistent &#x201C;worries&#x201C; about their irrelevance to the age in which they lived, TC and JWC continued to play a vital part in shaping its identity and in generating its debates, &#x201C;consciously and unconsciously,&#x201C; for both their present and our past.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">July.</hi> TC, resting on holiday at The Gill with his sister Mary, asks his sister Jean in Dumfries to organize new clothes for him from local tailors (<date when="1858-07-02">2</date>), and his brother John to find him a horse, on which he begins to ride regularly (<date when="1858-07-08">8</date>). JWC has been to Rottingdean and Brighton in search of a holiday cottage away from London, where TC now feels like &#x201C;a ghostly phantasm hunted by Demons&#x201C; (<date when="1858-07-02">2</date>), but she subsequently catches cold and rests at Chelsea reading Turgenev, which both she and TC read with interest. JWC is happy with the new maid, &#x201C;Little Charlotte&#x201C; (<date when="1858-07-04">4</date>). Tait&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior</hi> is bought by Lord Ashburton, though there is misunderstanding about the price, which JWC tries to smooth over. Neuberg calls for books from TC&#x2019;s study, presumably for work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1858-07-03">3</date>). Henry and John Larkin are preparing maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> with TC&#x2019;s advice (<date when="1858-07-08">8</date>), with publication scheduled for <date when="1858-10-01">1 October</date>. TC, recovering from a sprained ankle, enjoys the peace and silence of Scotland and postpones thinking about his trip to Germany. J. S. Mill replies to TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1858-06-28">28 June</date> (<date when="1858-07-08">8</date>), the first since <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. TC worries about JWC&#x2019;s health and suggests she visit the Russells at Thornhill for medical advice and possibly consider a winter in Europe; Eliza Forster lunches with JWC. Louisa Baring invites a reluctant JWC to Bay House, Alverstoke (<date when="1858-07-09">9</date>). JWC is irritated by TC&#x2019;s continual demand for letters (<date when="1858-07-10">10</date>). Charlotte, &#x201C;a good biddable clever little creature,&#x201C; looks after her in Chelsea; TC writes to Louisa Baring (<date when="1858-07-11">11</date>) privately, to encourage JWC&#x2019;s visit to Bay House. JWC describes to TC a difficult visit from Botkin to Cheyne Row (<date when="1858-07-11">11</date>). David and Eliza Aitken visit, also the Forsters (<date when="1858-07-12">12</date>). JWC sends details of the Bulwer Lytton scandal (<date when="1858-07-12">12</date>), and TC responds supporting Lady Bulwer Lytton (<date when="1858-07-14">14</date>). The postal arrangements irk both of them. JWC takes an excursion to Richmond (<date when="1858-07-14">14</date>)&#x2014;for her health, by omnibus&#x2014;and begins to ride them regularly when she feels unwell. JWC sends TC a map of Carlyle Township in Australia, named by Charles Gavan Duffy for TC (<date when="1858-07-19">19</date>). TC tries to persuade her to consider a holiday in Annandale, while himself very reluctantly beginning to think about his visit to Germany (<date when="1858-07-20">20</date>). Tait and Neuberg visit JWC at Chelsea (<date when="1858-07-18">18</date>), and JWC visits the Larkins (<date when="1858-07-20">20</date>) and dines with the Forsters. The tailors finish TC&#x2019;s new outfits (<date when="1858-07-20">20</date>), and JWC suddenly decides after all to go to Alverstoke (<date when="1858-07-21">21</date>). TC thanks Neuberg for his continuing help and asks for his advice in planning the German visit (<date when="1858-07-22">22</date>). Bramah the builder&#x2019;s bill is bitterly contested; JWC visits Macready (<date when="1858-07-22">22</date>) and writes, and then loses, a long letter to TC, which <pb id="pg-34-xxxii" n="34:xxxii"/>mysteriously arrives safely (<date when="1858-07-24">24</date>). JWC, in a flurry, preparing to leave for Bay House, has to take time to look for TC&#x2019;s passport for the trip to Germany. JWC gives a tea party for the Larkins and Emilie Hawkes (<date when="1858-07-28">28</date>), while TC and Lord Ashburton agree on a long-discussed bequest to TC by the late Lady Harriet Ashburton (<date when="1858-07-29">29</date>). JWC leaves by train for Bay House and the Barings (<date when="1858-07-31">31</date>), while Charlotte begins a &#x201C;thorough cleaning&#x201C; at Cheyne Row.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">August.</hi> TC makes an inspection of Craigenputtoch with his brother James (<date when="1858-08-05">5</date>), while JWC enjoys the company at Bay House, her health improving steadily; postal delays make TC nervous about her. She tentatively plans a Scottish visit. TC tries sea bathing, and continues desultory plans for the trip to Germany, but &#x201C;I shudder at the German hurlyburly&#x201C; (<date when="1858-08-03">3</date>). JWC sails round Portsmouth harbor (<date when="1858-08-03">3</date>), takes daily carriage rides, writes encouragingly to their servant Charlotte in Chelsea (<date when="1858-08-05">5</date>), and keeps in touch with Larkin, who sends her his watch when hers breaks down. She visits the Isle of Wight (<date when="1858-08-07">7</date>) and nearby military camps. TC meets with Lord Ashburton in Dumfries (<date when="1858-08-09">9</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-08-10">10</date>). Lady Sandwich invites JWC to Addiscombe, but JWC prefers Bay House, where her health is really improving, despite her breaking a tooth (<date when="1858-08-11">11</date>). TC invites Neuberg to join him in Germany (<date when="1858-08-16">16</date>) and asks Larkin to send him maps (<date when="1858-08-18">18</date>); leaves The Gill for Scotsbrig (<date when="1858-08-19">19</date>) and Edinburgh (<date when="1858-08-21">21</date>) and embarks with Foxton for Germany, arriving Hamburg (<date when="1858-08-24">24</date>) and on to Rostock (<date when="1858-08-26">26</date>). TC and Foxton part company, and TC goes on to the Usedoms at Isle of R&#xfc;gen (<date when="1858-08-27">27</date>) for sea bathing; unfortunately he catches cold and is unwell for several days. Meanwhile JWC leaves London (<date when="1858-08-27">27</date>) and spends the night in Carlisle with Janet Pringle, then on to Thornhill (<date when="1858-08-28">28</date>) to stay at Lann Hall in Tynron.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">September</hi>. JWC writes Charlotte in Chelsea about her gold ring that she has lost (<date when="1858-09-03">3</date>). She goes to Craigenputtoch (<date when="1858-09-08">8</date>) but remains Janet Pringle&#x2019;s guest till she moves to Mary Russell&#x2019;s home. Thornhill (<date when="1858-09-15">15</date>); there she becomes ill and is tended by Dr. Russell; she writes Charlotte to prepare for TC&#x2019;s return (<date when="1858-09-16">16</date>). In Germany TC leaves Isle of R&#xfc;gen for Berlin (<date when="1858-09-03">3</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-09-06">6</date>), meets up with Neuberg, and visits Varnhagen von Ense. Then he goes on to C&#xfc;strin, Liegnitz, and Breslau (<date when="1858-09-08">8</date>), where he bases himself, and visits Leuthen (<date when="1858-09-09">9</date>) and Mollwitz (<date when="1858-09-10">10</date>). He leaves Breslau for Striegau (<date when="1858-09-11">11</date>); visits Landshut, Pardubitz, and Kolin, then Prague (<date when="1858-09-13">13</date>) and Dresden (<date when="1858-09-15">15</date>); sees Weimar and Aix-la-Chapelle; and concludes the trip in Ostend (<date when="1858-09-21">21</date>), taking the steamer to Dover and train to London (<date when="1858-09-22">22</date>). TC writes to Charles Butler thanking him for looking after his Illinois bonds and asking his advice on a further investment of &#xa3;1,000 (<date when="1858-09-23">23</date>). He recuperates, invites his brother John and Neuberg to tea (<date when="1858-09-26">26</date>); vols. 1 and 2 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> published (<date when="1858-09-27">27</date>), selling out quickly. JWC abandons plans to visit Scotsbrig and returns to London, visiting relatives in Dumfries and stopping <pb id="pg-34-xxxiii" n="34:xxxiii"/>at The Gill with Mary Austin (<date when="1858-09-27">27</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-09-29">29</date>); she finds Cheyne Row cleaned and in good order, with a new cat in residence (<date when="1858-09-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">October.</hi> JWC writes Mary Russell with thanks for her Scottish holiday and describes an unpleasant train journey (<date when="1858-10-01">1</date>). TC orders three copies of Neuberg&#x2019;s German translation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> from Tauchnitz (<date when="1858-10-01">1</date>); Chapman&#x2019;s edition goes straight to a second printing (<date when="1858-10-05">5</date>), with minor changes to text and maps that occupy TC and all his assistants. TC declines an invitation to a Burns Centenary celebration in Edinburgh (<date when="1858-10-11">11</date>). He tells his brother Alexander that the remainder of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> should take &#x201C;perhaps two years of hard work, if I still live,&#x201C; something of an underestimate. He adds: &#x201C;A man at 63 has a strange feeling when visiting his native country,&#x2014;as of a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> coming back to the Earth!&#x201C; (<date when="1858-10-15">15</date>). He writes to Lord Ashburton, congratulating him on his engagement to Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie (<date when="1858-10-25">25</date>), while JWC confides to Mary Russell &#x201C;I shall never like the new Lady Ashburton&#x2014;that I am sure of!&#x201C; (<date when="1858-10-30">30</date>). JWC offers &#xa3;50 to John Welsh (who has tuberculosis) to help him go abroad. TC and JWC welcome their nephew James Aitken, now working in London (<date when="1858-10-26">26</date>) and looking for lodgings in Islington. TC thanks John Fergus in Kirkcaldy for a present of two dozen bottles of whisky (<date when="1858-10-27">27</date>) and supplies of potatoes and oatmeal (<date when="1858-10-28">28</date>). They both go to dine with Lady Sandwich and Lord Ashburton (<date when="1858-10-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">November.</hi> JWC writes James Carlyle at Scotsbrig to refuse more meal and potatoes from Scotland; they have them in excess. She has taken to a nightly whisky toddy. An illustrated newspaper article (possibly by Frederick Martin) publishes wrong information on her father, which irritates and upsets her (<date when="1858-11-00">early Nov.</date>). TC wants very much to improve the illustrations in the reissue of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1858-11-01">1</date>), but he approves Neuberg&#x2019;s German translation (<date when="1858-11-02">2</date>), which has arrived. He is still thinking vaguely of buying a cottage in Scotland but cannot bring himself to begin the next vols. in continuation of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1858-11-13">13</date>). Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s second marriage, to Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie, takes place (<date when="1858-11-17">17</date>). JWC catches a bad cold during the reorganization of the house for the hanging of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s gift to her of his copy of Pesne&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Little Drummer.</hi> TC refuses further invitations to do with the Burns Centenary celebrations to come in <date when="1859-00-00">Jan. 1859</date> (<date when="1858-11-22">22</date>). Mary Hoggan from Thornhill visits (<date when="1858-11-22">ca. 22</date>). JWC is bedridden until the end of the month.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December.</hi> TC refuses another invitation to a Burns Centenary celebration (<date when="1858-12-01">1</date>); he writes Edward Chapman about the disputed skull of Cromwell exhibited as a curiosity (<date when="1858-12-14">14</date>). JWC again presses Margaret Welsh to take advantage of TC&#x2019;s offer to help John Welsh spend the winter in a warmer climate. TC visits his nephew Jamie Aitken (<date when="1858-12-15">15</date>), who then visits Chelsea (<date when="1858-12-23">23</date>). JWC <pb id="lastpage-34-xxxiv" n="34:xxxiv"/>writes to console George Cooke when she hears about his mother&#x2019;s death (<date when="1858-12-21">21</date>); William Coningham calls and is consoled for the death of his daughter (<date when="1858-12-27">27</date>). TC sends New Year&#x2019;s gifts of money to Scotland (<date when="1858-12-28">28</date>) and enlists his brother John&#x2019;s help in sending a gift of money to his sister Janet Hanning in Canada, while JWC sends a photograph of Tait&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Chelsea Interior</hi> to Mary Russell (<date when="1858-12-30">30</date>). TC thanks Julia Margaret Cameron for her New Year&#x2019;s gift to him of a magnifying glass (<date when="1858-12-31">31</date>).</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Many thanks, many excuses, about the trouble you take. I perceive there is no use taking such pains in the roasting of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an egg,&#x2014;partially rotten to the same human nostril. Unless I bargained with a Country Wife to spin me, honestly of good fine wool, a bit of honest blanket and dye it with lichen (<hi rend="italic">Stane-raw</hi>) into indelible russet,&#x2014;I see the thing I want is not wanted (or is supposed not) by other people; and I must pay toll and tribute<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels, Works</hi> 24:81; cf.

<p>Those tartans are all too <hi rend="italic">thin:</hi> perhaps the <hi rend="italic">niched</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; possibly for &#x201C;nicked,&#x201C; cut off.</note> bit of tweed (come this morning) may do for a dressing-gown; I shall get a cape out of some specimen;&#x2014;and Mary<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin.</note> at Annan found me a thin rag of pepper-and-salt colour wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may do for a jacket in defect of better.

If you can find any genuinely <hi rend="italic">good</hi> thick flannel (that is to say spun of good fine wool), I believe that would do: spun of <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> wool, I know very well what they all turn to (stiff as yellow plank, &#x26; shrunk <hi rend="italic">unequally</hi> all into bags and strings;&#x2014;Sorrow upon Cheap &#x26; Nasty<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first published use of the phrase is in the title of Charles Kingsley&#x2019;s pamphlet &#x201C;Cheap Clothes and Nasty&#x201C; (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), written under the pseudonym of Parson Lot. The phrase was also frequently used by TC (see, e.g., 27:367; <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 16:307; and &#x201C;Shooting Niagara,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:2); it is uncertain whether he or Kingsley originated the phrase. In his novel <hi rend="italic">Alton</hi> <hi rend="italic">Locke</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), Kingsley based the character of Saunders Mackaye on TC (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500908-JWC-TC-01"><sic>25:201</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1850-09-08">8 Sept. 1850</date>]</corr></ref>).</note> altogether!) &#x2014;but we must be content with the best we can get; and that will <hi rend="italic">end</hi> the problem.</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Note came this morning by <hi rend="italic">post:</hi> yesterday morning a short Note from the Doctor<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their brother John A. Carlyle.</note> led me to guess he might call <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in the course of the day; but he did not, nor have I heard farther of him. I only infer he stuck stamps on your Note, and put it in some post-office.&#x2014; My ancle <hi rend="italic">improves</hi> (I think), does not worsen by any means: I fetch long stretches round by Ruthwell, by the Brow &#x26;c,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruthwell, a hamlet 1 mi.

Tolerable news from <hi rend="italic">Jane;</hi> who had been to Brighton not to her profit but was now out of that again.</p>

This Brighton journey you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to do; that I foresaw; and that is the only comfort for the deplorable night and day it brought you.

If it had been possible to <pb id="pg-34-7" n="34:7"/>form an Establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there, it might have had fine effects! Nothing is hourly made more evident to me than the excellence of clean air, silence and milk-diet: that is nearly the whole sum of my privileges here; and I calculate I am daily attaining some slight increase of improvement by these means. I calculate I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at length get into human health again by such help, and be only a wearied old man, not a ghostly phantasm hunted by Demons as I usually am in London.

Pfui! But I <pb id="pg-34-8" n="34:8"/>see no help for it; the only thing is, I will give that &#x201C;Picture&#x201C; a wide berth for the future, &#x26; study to sweep it out of mind.&#x2014; God bless thee, Dearest; I had much to say still; but will put it off till a new day.

<p>Tait was here&#x2014;on Thursday or Wednesday&#x2014;I forget which with a note he had received from Lord A&#x2014;perhaps he forwarded it to you&#x2014;such an unaccountable note!

In fact I am quite disgusted with him!</p>
<p>I find in reading his letter to you, which I did not do till after that interview, that he had told <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a downright lie&#x2014;for he had told me he had never told Combe that Lord A had spoken of buying the picture at all!</p>
<p>Newberg came on Saturday evening and being told I could not see any one, he went up to the Study &#x201C;to get some books&#x201C;&#x2014; Half an hour after I was going to my bedroom and came on him, standing quite noiseless on the landing place, so I had to take him in, and give him a cup of my tea which was ready, and then he had the sense to go&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am rather better today&#x2014;had about four hours of sleep, and came down to breakfast. It is still very cold. I look forward to spending the day on the sofa under my fur rug reading Tourgueneff,&#x2014;nobody to be let in but M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hawkes who will come at four o&#x2019;clock&#x2014; I have a nice little fire opposite me in my back room&#x2014;and the prospect of the noblemans seat!</p>

<dateline>The Gill, Monday <date when="1858-07-05">5 july, 1858</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p>My dear little Woman,&#x2014;I begin the day with a few words to you, lest something occur to obstruct afterwards. There are always 3 days of interval, I see; from Friday to Monday, no writing here, nor after Saturday anything received of written; that is the fruit of the Scotch Sunday, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> stops the very railway here, and reduces all things to a silence, really grateful to the mind, however bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> about. For three days one is reduced to one&#x2019;s books, one&#x2019;s reflexions; to chew the cud, as it were, and do a little wholesome <hi rend="italic">rumination,</hi> perhaps too apt to be neglected otherwise.</p>
<p>Nothing of historical occurs here, as you are aware; and the trifling matters we have do not go on with the definiteness that might be expected. For example the Tailor &#x201C;cannot say &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">will</hi> say what day he will come&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has inserted &#x201C;will say&#x201C; above with a line drawn to &#x201C;what.&#x201C;</note> so we are <pb id="pg-34-11" n="34:11"/>still at our old point in the Cares of Cloth; have not needed to run in to Dumfries on Saturday, and plunge for a decision; in fact are reduced to a dirty patience in that matter. Nor is the horse settled: I cannot yet know whether John&#x2019;s animal will prove rideable, nor even whether he feels himself quite able to spare it me: yesterday he was to ride over with it, and let us try; but yesterday broke out into wild storms of windy rain, right ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the teeth of John; and he is only expected, not with confidence today. There is nothing for it but the above kind of dirty patience,&#x2014;and in the meanwhile to make good use of one&#x2019;s own legs (May the Devil reward the inventor of iron pens, and this method of writing, as if it were with the point of a dagger upon leather!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Alonso de Ercilla y Zu&#xf1;iga had to do when he had no paper; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>33:205</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1858-04-15">(15?)</date> <date when="1858-04-16">[16] April</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;Husht!)&#x2014; My ancle does not fail; and I do what walking will; but undoubtedly a horse w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be beneficial.

I sleep tolerably well always (&#x201C;What a blessing!&#x201C; your poor little heart will say); they are all as kind and attentive here as they can be. <hi rend="italic">Fractus bello, fessus annis</hi> [broken by war, worn out by years], I ought to think myself lucky in such a niche; and try to gather my wayward wanderings of thought, and compose myself a little. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have not yet in the least done since I came hither.&#x2014; My best time is usually the evening: never saw such evenings for freshness, brightness; the west one champaign of polished silver or silver-gilt (as the sun goes down); and I get upon the wastes of the &#x201C;Priestside,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sands on the N side of the Solway Firth, 3 mi.

I go 5 or 6 miles, striding along under the western twilight (I can read my watch here quite distinctly sometimes at 11 p.m.); and return home only because <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> ought not to be belated over much.

<p>My poor little Woman! Alas, alas, what can I say to you: it grieves my very heart to hear of that sad sofa-and-fur apparatus, and the terrible misery my <pb id="pg-34-13" n="34:13"/>poor little Dame has had again from the foolish Brighton adventure. No, truly you are not strong enough for any such exertion;&#x2014;I often think if it were not her <hi rend="italic">spirit,</hi> her unquenchable courage, my poor little Jeannie has no strength left. Oh dear, oh dear! I ought to be able to suggest something for you; but I cannot, I am myself so weak and planless,&#x2014;used to have all things of that sort suggested to me by her who is now with her back at the wall. God help us. Keep up thy heart at any rate, dear little Being&#x2014;Oh I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> burst into <hi rend="italic">greeting</hi> if that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> serve: but times will mend <hi rend="italic">a little,</hi> soon, I hope; nay I try to believe are already mending towards at least the old poor pitch again! Nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be more ingenious than that mode of &#x201C;getting into the country&#x201C; on brief &#x26; easy terms.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s rearrangement of the two parlors; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580704-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-04">4 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I figure it a very pretty little shop for you,&#x2014;altogether according to the Goody genius it surely is. Write me one word from it tomorrow; one word daily till these sad phenomena are off again.</p>
<p>Never mind the Tait Picture any more. L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A&#x2019;s Note to Tait, accusing you of fault on the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side, is surely clear absolution on this side; if Tait put in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> paragraph with either &#x201C;null&#x201C; or an equivalent, there needs nothing more from <hi rend="italic">us.</hi> Not to say that it is evident, and was from the beginning: nothing can save the &#xa3;500;&#x2014;practical result of all our bothering is <hi rend="italic">nil</hi> or &#x201C;null.&#x201C; Let Tait go with the sum then; we shall always silently know what his <hi rend="italic">methods</hi> in such a case are capable of being; and rejoice that neither &#xa3;500 nor 5 million ever fell or c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fall to some others by such methods!&#x2014; Finis to it therefore; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> surely are clear of it as spring water; and there is nothing more to be said or done.</p>
<p>Yesterday going out for a weary walk, as my Letter indicated, I strolled along my fair distance between showers; then turned, and nearish to home, a windy shower made me pause, &#x26; seek a bush with my umbrella. There I stood for ten minutes and more, &#x201C;patter patter,&#x201C; Nith &#x26; Criffel<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The river Nith flows through Dumfries into the Solway Firth, overlooked by the Criffel mountain range.</note> yielding watery ammunition to unexpected length. A rider coming against the storm appeared dim in the distance; visibly took shelter under trees in a hollow not far behind me; till the shower ended I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not emerge, or discern&#x2014;that it was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Taeng-leg</hi>&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of John&#x2019;s family nicknames, meaning with long, thin legs, like tongs; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201207-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:296</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1820-12-07">7 Dec. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> he in person, poor soul, with the big dromedary of a horse for me!

It will be highly beneficial I expect.</p>
<p>The Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> comes <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> (as I said yesterday);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had mentioned only <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>.</note> nothing for America from <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> On Sunday we have no post <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> by sending to Annan, I <pb id="pg-34-14" n="34:14"/>might have got a word to you on <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> morning,&#x2014;and w<hi rend="italic">d,</hi> had I known how things were.&#x2014; Tailor &#x201C;cannot come <hi rend="italic">till friday,</hi> mournings to make&#x201C;:&#x2014;well, well.

I am a prey to doleful considerations; and my solitary imagination has free field with me in the summer silence here. My poor little Jeannie, my poor ever-true Life-partner, hold up thy little heart! We have had a sore life pilgrimage together; much bad road, poor lodging, and bad weather,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">little</hi> like what I could have wished, or dreamt of, for my little woman!&#x2014;but we stood to it, too; and, if it please God, there are yet good years ahead of us, <hi rend="italic">better</hi> and quieter much than the past have been now and then!&#x2014; There is no use in going on with such reflexions and anticipations: no amount of paper w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hold them all at this time; nor could any words spoken or written give credible account of them to thee. I am <hi rend="italic">wae</hi> exceedingly, but not half so miserable as I have often been. Courage, courage; write me you are at your old poor pass again; out of that ugly Brighton fit,&#x2014;and thinking of some usefuller expedient while the good weather is here.</p>
<p>I went out on my big Dromedary of a Horse yesterday; had a slashing ride upon it of a dozen miles, in spite of the rain; with jolting enough, and considerable speed: I am <hi rend="italic">better</hi> today, in consequence, than any day since I came hither. It is the most awkward of long-legged animals; but has sure hoofs, a great shambling stride, not without capabilities of better; and has a willing mind, poor brute. Let me be thankful for it. The day was dark with heavy electric showers, one of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> caught me with its skirt,&#x2014;but I had, purposely, the worst of <hi rend="italic">clothes,</hi> and got not the least harm; nay great part of the road (from the Lime Kilns towards Annan)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There had been a lime quarry at Kelhead, 3&#xBD; mi.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have been twice on the back of your excellent dromedary mare,&#x2014;really a valuable creature, and to me most salutary and charitable;&#x2014;and make no doubt the good beast will be of the greatest use to me. She is totally untrained; seems never to have been crossed by a breaker or accurate rider; but she is very obedient (so far as she can <hi rend="italic">understand</hi>); has a fine long stride, considerable velocity for a little while, sound hoof, and a willing mind. I believe her well worth the money she costs, if that lump<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably on the horse&#x2019;s back, as on a dromedary&#x2019;s.</note> <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> where it is, not going farther. To me surely you have done real good by her; and I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <pb id="pg-34-18" n="34:18"/>ungrateful not to feel obliged. I am already better for my ride yesterday, part of it in rain. In fact, the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> I am jolted, it is the better! I believe the mare too may profit by her careful keeping here, and the apprenticeship she gets. On the whole, <hi rend="italic">vivat</hi> Dromedary!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your glove has turned up here; it will go to you tomorrow, along with some nightshirts Mary is sending. I send the <hi rend="italic">Carlsruh</hi> Book,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a vol. from <hi rend="italic">Mittheilungen &#x2026; Besorgt durch Dr. Rob. Volz,</hi> 11 vols. (Karlsruhe, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), a popular German collection of medical cures and healing methods; or the first vol. of the new series, <hi rend="italic">&#xc4;rztliche Mittheilungen aus Baden</hi> (Karslruhe, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>).</note> not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> entertainment; but by no means with thorough understanding; the poor author being somewhat of &#x201C;Academic-Pedant&#x201C; nature, and a good deal destitute of natural gumption, and human principles of method. The <hi rend="italic">West</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> is come, as well as Fraser; both will gradually reach you. Did you see that new Book of Chambers&#x2019;s ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Scotch History?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Chambers, <hi rend="italic">Domestic Annals of Scotland from the Reformation to the Revolution</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>).</note> A sack of Excerpts<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> described it as &#x201C;not a composition, but a compilation&#x201C; (n.s. 14 [<date when="1858-07-00">July 1858</date>]: 53). The review also cites <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>: &#x201C;Lightning, as Carlyle says, must precede the light. &#x2018;The light is beautifuller. Ah, yes! but until by lightning and other fierce labour your foul chaos has become a world, you cannot have any light, or the smallest chance for any&#x2019;&#x201C; (57); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 7:226&#x2013;27.</note> (probably in a very blind condition) w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I should like to have a look at.</p>
<p>I have bad news from my poor Jane,&#x2014;yesterday slightly <hi rend="italic">improved,</hi> nothing at all today except the <hi rend="italic">cover</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">W</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Review.</hi> She had caught new cold,&#x2014;poor little Jeannie, she is so terribly weak otherwise! I wish I knew rightly what to decide on for her and myself!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Do not <hi rend="italic">chace</hi> the two Boys<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Watt, who had come north in June (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580622-TC-JAC-01"><sic>33:247</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1858-06-22">22 June</date></corr></ref>), and William, about to go to Woolwich (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date></ref>).</note> away, poor innocent souls, on my account; I will come riding up some day<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Scotsbrig.</note> whether they are there or not. I was thinking even of an early day, were the skies once knit up again. But there are heavy electric showers all round; and Dumfries is <hi rend="italic">black</hi> steadily for the second day: &#x201C;excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> weather for filling corn; but for&#x2014;&#x26;c &#x26;c!&#x2014; &#x2014; Besides my Tailor is not gone, nor even <hi rend="italic">come:</hi> I shall have to communicate with Dumfries,&#x2014;perhaps by return-ticket tomorrow?&#x2014; &#x2014; Affectionate regards to all.</p>

<p>Again nothing: Oh my Dear! And the Newspaper is addressed in a shaky hand, and &#x201C;Annan&#x201C; is misspelt. What can I infer, in my gloomy thought, but that you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> better, more likely worse, and so in spite of my express request have kept <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> lest the real news might drive me crazy altogether! For God&#x2019;s sake write me a word; hardly any reality can be worse than the notions I form of it here. I said, you were to write daily till this fit were over. One word; I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not weary you with writing; but surely it is right that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send me the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> whatever it is!&#x2014; I lay awake all last night,&#x2014;some accident or other;&#x2014;and never had I such a series of hours filled altogether with <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> Any conceivable Letter from your own hand this morning w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been better than such a <hi rend="italic">night&#x2019;s</hi> gazette. Do not neglect again in such a case! If nothing come tomorrow, I shall not know what hand to turn me to.</p>
<p>Last night&#x2019;s vigilance, I suppose, had to do with <hi rend="italic">bile,</hi>&#x2014;probably developed by the new Dromedary. I took a famous long ride, again; got well jolted, and took in much ground; my dinner (mutton-chop, <hi rend="italic">oldish</hi>) was of my own choice, but none of the best; then in the evening I wandered by byepaths into the &#x201C;Marquis&#x2019;s Park,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wooded parkland, N of Cummertrees, between Dumfries and Annan; part of the Kinmount estate (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410429-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:118</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-29">29 April 1841</date></corr></ref>) where, since <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>, the marquesses of Queensberry had their family home.</note> an immense expanse of rough graziery with lines of timber, no company but rabbits and a few ruminating oxen, a <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> especially wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surprised and flurried me, before I got home to porridge: enough, getting into bed ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midnight (after a bit of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> &#x26;c), I felt no disposition towards <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi> one of the dogs here had been left out and took to <hi rend="italic">vigilance,</hi> railway trains came screeching thro&#x2019; the silence; I was asleep for some moments, but woke again, was out, was in the bathing-tub;&#x2014;it was not till about 5 that I got into &#x201C;comatose oblivion&#x201C; rather than sleep, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> ended again towards 8. My poor suffering Jeannie was the theme of my thoughts;&#x2014;nay if I had not had that, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have found something else. But in very truth my soul was black with misery about you,&#x2014;past, present, future yielded no light-point anywhere. Alas, and I had to say to myself, <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is something like what she has suffered 700 times within the last two years,&#x2014;my poor heavy-laden, brave uncomplaining Jeannie! Oh forgive me, forgive me, for the much I have thoughtlessly done and omitted,&#x2014;far, far at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> times, from the poor purpose of my mind! And God help <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> thee, poor suffering soul, and also me.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-20" n="34:20"/>I have been thinking, Ought you not to come at once to Mrs Russell&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell.</note> Thornhill?

It is clear as can be, this air &#x26;c w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do you benefit. The train I came in is not difficult: a perfectly good bed, and treat<hi rend="italic">t</hi> unsurpassable in friendliness, awaits you <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> if you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> pause a little,&#x2014;and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> escort you up to Thornhill,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About 30 mi.

And I bid you consider it, and think seriously of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> it or something better.&#x2014; I had thought of <hi rend="italic">going to bed,</hi> so soon as this poor message was written: but now the drowsy idea is off,&#x2014;perhaps till I <hi rend="italic">read</hi> in some of my dull Books a little farther.

<p><salute>Oh my Dear</salute>! I am very sorry! But indeed I wrote on Wednesday; and I hope you have by this time got my letter.

I slept last night some five hours; and tho my cough is still tearing, my aches and pains are greatly abated. It is not weather at present to get rid of a cold in. Today for example is sharp and blowy like October.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I must not worry myself with <hi rend="italic">projects!</hi> I believe to travel to Scotland <hi rend="italic">just now,</hi> or to take any long journey whatever would be as much as my life is worth.

<p>I dont mean, that if this explosion of Cold were over I should be wholly disinclined to stir but I should like to do it on very easy terms.</p>
<p>Miss Baring<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring.</note> has invited me to Bay House&#x2014;with leave to wear high dresses and caps. If she had said <hi rend="italic">for how long</hi> and the term of the visit made it worth the trouble of packing up &#x26;c I would have fixed positively to go, so soon as I was up to travelling.

<p>It does not strike me as <hi rend="italic">probable</hi> that I shall be strong enough for going all that way. still I have many a time out-gone the probable&#x2014;</p>

<p>You said, I think, that, altho&#x2019; letters did not reach you on sunday in the course of nature, you <hi rend="italic">did</hi> sometimes get one by accident. Trusting to such happy accident, I write today; as otherwise you could not possibly hear till Tuesday and might find <hi rend="italic">that</hi> long to wait; especially if Jane<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken, visiting from Dumfries.</note> be no longer there to advise you to make yourself easy.</p>
<p>I wish however that in laying down your fears&#x2014;by advice; you had not taken up displeasure instead&#x2014; You might have been quite sure that I would not have willingly inflicted anxiety on you&#x2014; and that there must be something else in it than neglect on my part either intentional or unintentional&#x2014; It has not been pleasant or even easy for me to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> since I took this cold; I have had much pain in my head&#x2014;in my shoulders, my side, everywhere; <pb id="pg-34-27" n="34:27"/>besides that my spirits have been quite crushed down by having it so brought home to me; that even in <hi rend="italic">summer,</hi> now, I am &#x201C;fit for nothing.&#x201C; Still, while writing to nobody else whatever, I have not failed to either write to you, or <hi rend="italic">address</hi> something to you every day.</p>
<p>On Monday I wrote&#x2014;on Tuesday I sent the Review and the newspaper<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>.</note>&#x2014;on Wednesday I wrote (a long and I flattered myself <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> letter, <hi rend="italic">considering</hi>) on Thursday I sent Tourgeneff<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">Sc&#xE8;nes de la vie russe</hi>.</note>&#x2014;on Friday I wrote&#x2014;and today (Saturday I am writing)&#x2014;</p>
<p>What has become of the Wednesday letter, I have no notion. Charlotte went across to the Church-Street post office<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Wiltshear, grocer and Post Office Receiving Office, 59 Church St.</note> on purpose with it, about 2 o&#x2019;clock. She is positive she put it in; and it is incredible that she shouldnt have put it in! It must have misgone at the other end, I think.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I sent the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol of Tourgeneff, because it was the one I had done with; having by mistake read the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> first. It is the only book I have read since you went away!</p>
<p>Fairie is going to translate him;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie, trans. Goethe and August von Haxthausen; no translation of Turgenev has been traced.</note> Plattnauer<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Plattnauer, the Carlyles&#x2019; friend, tutor, and political refugee from Prussia; see <ref target="volume-33/ed-33-biographical-notes">33:biographical note</ref>.</note> told me&#x2014;but there is much between what Fairie is <hi rend="italic">going to do</hi> and what he <hi rend="italic">does!</hi> He (Fairie) called here in a cab, yesterday, to inquire for me&#x2014;he was not let in&#x2014;for I only see the people I am most intimate with&#x2014;and only one or two in the day&#x2014; Talking makes me as hoarse as a crow&#x2014;besides wearing me out&#x2014;</p>
<p>The best news I have to give is that I have now had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> tolerable nights&#x2014;and am coughing less today&#x2014; It is wretched weather to get well in!&#x2014;cold and windy with frequent splashes of rain.</p>

<p>My own little Jeannie, alas, there was no neglect on your part; you had done for me what you could: the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Letters came together on Saturday (yesterday) morning; but the news they brought was not what we could have wished. Letter <hi rend="italic">first</hi> had gone round by <hi rend="italic">Ardrossan</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaside resort on W coast, the Firth of Clyde, about 20 mi. WSW of Glasgow.</note> (Ayrshire, near Glasgow), and perhaps to other places, seeking its goal, the &#x201C;A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>an&#x201C; being very indistinct Letter <hi rend="italic">first</hi> had gone round by <hi rend="italic">Ardrossan</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seaside resort on W coast, the Firth of Clyde, about 20 mi. WSW of Glasgow.</note> (Ayrshire, near Glasgow), and perha; supposed to be &#x201C;Ardr<hi rend="italic">n,</hi>&#x201C; &#x201C;Montrose,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town on E coast, about 28 mi. NE of Dundee.</note> or what not: the stupid people <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have read it better; but they are not inexcusable. Pray write it unmistakably distinct, and always with two <hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x2019;s. You may think whether I was glad of the Letters! Indeed had nothing come that day too, I think I must have got into the rail myself to come up and see. It was a great relief from the blackest side of my misgivings; but also a sad fall from the brighter side I had been endeavouring to cherish, and hold by, for the day preceding. Oh me, Oh me, I know not what has taken me; but ever since that sleepless night, tho&#x2019; I am <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> &#x26;c tolerably well again, there is nothing but wail and lamentation in the heart of all my thoughts; a voice as of Rachel weeping for her children;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 31:15 and Matt. 2:18.</note> and I cannot divest myself of the most pusillanimous strain of humour: all yesterday, I remarked in speaking to Jean,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken.</note> if any tragic topic came in sight, I had a difficulty to keep from breaking down in my speech, and becoming <hi rend="italic">in</hi>articulate with emotion over it! It is as if the scales were falling from my eyes; and I were beginning to <hi rend="italic">see,</hi> in this my solitude, things that touch me into the very quick. Oh my little woman, what a suffering thou hast had; and how nobly borne,&#x2014;with a simplicity, a silence, courage and patient <hi rend="italic">heroism,</hi> which are now only too evident to me! Three <hi rend="italic">waer</hi> days I can hardly remember in my life;&#x2014;but they were not without worth either; very blessed some of the feelings, tho&#x2019; many so sore and miserable. It is very good to be <hi rend="italic">left alone</hi> with the truth sometimes; to hear in all its sternness what <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will say to one.&#x2014; But surely too there is much weakness, and the working of a morbid habit of mind, in all this. I ought to <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> my thoughts, as poor old Graham<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham.</note> used to say, &#x201C;round to the sunny side of the hill,&#x201C;&#x2014;at least not trouble poor sick <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with them, tho&#x2019; you are the subject they all turn upon at present.</p>
<p>Saturday was the first of the <hi rend="italic">return</hi> of Summer; perhaps far too warm in <pb id="pg-34-29" n="34:29"/>Chelsea; here one of the beautifullest days and evenings I ever saw. About sunset I took Jean to the railway; coming home, I walked the gig, and sat looking at such a western sky and Gallow<hi rend="italic">y</hi>-Nithsdale wall of Hills<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hills about 30 mi. NW of The Gill.</note> as no Londoner can ever know. &#x201C;Cremorne&#x201C; with the quality<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date>]</ref>.</note> is but a poor sight in comparison, if one have eyes of one&#x2019;s own.&#x2014; The question was, however, &#x201C;Will this new weather have helped <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> or has it been too suffocating in the brick labyrinth, with no &#x201C;country&#x201C; except the size of two bed-quilts to look out upon?&#x201C; I wish with my whole heart you were in a case to go, and had gone, to <hi rend="italic">Alverstoke.</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Louisa Baring at Bay House, Alverstoke, nr.

Nothing w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be welcomer to me than to see <hi rend="italic">Bay House</hi> for a date from you: but I know too how ticklish it all is; and therefore I will give no advice, except with <hi rend="italic">proviso</hi> that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can see your way thro&#x2019; it. Perhaps you might then get over to the Tennysons<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred and Emily Tennyson lived at Farringford House, Freshwater, Isle of Wight, across the Solent and about 24 mi. from Alverstoke.

But remember there is <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> between you and that; and study well if you think of such a thing.&#x2014; Alas, alas, must I remind myself that all this is yet theory; that, most likely, you are still tearing yourself to pieces with cough &#x26;c &#x26;c from that unblessed Brighton adventure. A thrice miserable business. I think sometimes, had <hi rend="italic">we</hi> managed to get that Monday we tried, I might have taken better care of you. And yet, woe&#x2019;s me, I know what impediments, <hi rend="italic">spectral</hi> yet practically as good as insuperable, might have lain in the way there too!

<p>Perhaps you are right about the Russell business: but take the truth of it along with you; for I spoke to Jean, and it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from her that Mrs Russell&#x2019;s notion originated: certainly not. Mrs R<hi rend="italic">l,</hi> in great haste, with the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R &#x26; another lady waiting the while, asked after you.

This was the real tenor of their brief dialogue.&#x2014; But any way, I like your own present view of that matter fully the best. And it can be altered at discretion, if need arise.</p>

<salute>Dear Miss Baring,</salute>
<p>I find you have been so friendly as to ask my Wife to come and see you at Bay House; and that she is (irresolutely) well inclined to go, tho&#x2019; uncertain as <pb id="pg-34-31" n="34:31"/>to suitableness of times &#x26;c &#x26;c. I write privately to say that, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the project could be well realised, it would give me also, as matters are, very great pleasure. She is very weak, this long while, as you know; and at present, has caught new cold, and done sad mischief, by some inconsiderate attempt on Brighton lately. But, were that over, so that she could travel again, and put herself under your kind guidance on that bright shore, I am convinced it might be of real benefit to her, as well as pleasure while the days run. Only she is weak exceedingly; indisposed for adventure of any kind,&#x2014;indeed liable to take cold &#x26;c from the slightest occasion;&#x2014;so that I almost fear this promising half-person will somehow or other misgo, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to effect, as I could for my own poor sake well wish it to do.</p>
<p>It is in the hope or wish of doing something to further the business that I now write;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; there is a fear too that I may be only spoiling it by interfering! For wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> reason, please keep this message strictly <hi rend="italic">private:</hi> to me you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> mention it (Rowland Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The postal service; as TC has not given her his address, he cannot be contacted.</note> <hi rend="italic">not</hi> being a witch); and please do not say a word about it to <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> at least not till you have her with you, if I am to be so lucky as hear that the result has been that good one.</p>
<p>And in any case accept my friendly salutations and kind remembrances; while, with the like to Miss Emily,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her sister, Emily Baring.</note> I am always</p>

    <p>Botkin (what a name!), your Russian Translator, has called, Luckily Charlotte had been forwarned to admit him if he came again&mdash; He is quite a different type from Tourg&eacute;n&eacute;ff tho&rsquo; a tall man, this one too. I should say he must be a Cossack&mdash;not that I ever saw a Cossack or heard one described!&mdash;<hi rend="italic">instinct</hi> is all I have for it!! he has flattened, high-boned cheeks&mdash;a nose flattened towards the point&mdash;small very black deep-set eyes, with thin semi-circular eye brows&mdash;a wide thin mouth&mdash;complexion whity-grey, and the skin of his face looked thick enough to make a saddle of!

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest</salute>, for the trouble you took to write on Saturday: the Saturday Letters arrive regularly on <hi rend="italic">Monday,&#x2014;</hi>as this morning; when, coming out of the scrags and bushes where I go to stroll and smoke after breakfast, I met Mary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin.</note> coming along, Letter in hand; good soul, for she had known it was yours. How precious to hear that you had got another tolerable sleep, I need not say. The other <hi rend="italic">burble,</hi> of the Letter going to <hi rend="italic">Ardrossan</hi> &#x26;c, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> all be explained to you this morning:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580711-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-11">11 July</date></ref>.</note> and I too have gained a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> over my expectations from the Post; and hope to hear again tomorrow,&#x2014;may the news again be good! So soon as you are able again to stir, everybody seems to advise that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seek a little &#x201C;change of air&#x201C;; all Doctors give it as a specific in cases of cold; and I really believe, if it be a change <hi rend="italic">to the country</hi> (say only to Richmond,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Surrey, where Margaret Welsh and her son, John Welsh, lived.</note> where you might make acquaintance with the <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s horse Fritz had been turned out to grass in Richmond Park; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580622-TC-JAC-01"><sic>33:247</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1858-06-22">22 June</date></corr></ref>.</note> at least!), the effect w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> infallibly be beneficial.

But I hardly doubt it will have taken a turn by this time; the rain is all gone, even out of Cumberland (where they have from 60 to 180 inches in the year), and Summer prevails again, tho&#x2019; with more wind than on Saturday. Yesterday was very bright and very windy,&#x2014;Jamie (Carlyle) prophesying rain, &#x26; the other Jamie (Austin) drought; <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> proving true today.</p>
<p>Nothing coming from Scotsbrig yesterday, Austin &#x26; I had resolved for Annan in the afternoon, to post there the poor Note you will have read this morning,&#x2014;no weightier errand, but indeed that was weightier than necessary. I went swinging out on my Dromedary who swept along with me nicely thro&#x2019; the pure clean winds and thro&#x2019; the utterly vacant roads and lanes: that is a great charm of my riding here; the authentic face of poor old Scotch existence, and oftenest (especially on Sunday) not 3 living mortals to meet you in a dozen miles!

Austin is always eager for <pb id="pg-34-35" n="34:35"/>any amount of driving. Off we went therefore, in that direction; past Hoddam Hill, Repentance,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hoddam Hill, where TC lived with his family, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>-<date when="1825-00-00">26</date>, and Repentance Tower, about 4 mi.

Meanwhile Lady B presented herself at the house of the Mayor,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> and demanded as a British subject to hire the Town Hall&#x2014;therein to deliver a Lecture on her Husband! The Mayor horribly perplexed refused to see her; sent his wife to her to&#x2014;offer her a glass of wine! which her Ladyship politely declined, saying that if anything but water passed her lips that day, her Husband would call her drunk.

<p><salute>Dearest</salute>, take a very short Note from me; for the <hi rend="italic">doxology</hi> is hanging at my nose,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The doxology was sung at the end of a Scottish metrical psalm; unexplained; apparently referring to the cold.</note> and it is time I were out getting back my <hi rend="italic">heat,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has suffered by the opened windows &#x26; sedentary fiddlings in this grey windy day. For the rest I am very well; and in such spirits as I have not known for a week past! You may judge whether I was eagerly expecting y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter, and whether I was glad in reading it. The <hi rend="italic">week</hi> of misery I can now think is near ending; that horrible &#x201C;Brighton Adventure&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580701-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-01">1 July</date>]</ref>.</note> about summed up, and the damages of it <hi rend="italic">paid.</hi> My poor Jeannie getting back to her poor normal state;&#x2014;writing like her own self again: certainly I have not had such a message by post for months, I might say years! Thank God;&#x2014;as I do sincerely &#x201C;with the sentient heart,&#x201C; whether piously &#x201C;with the spiritual,&#x201C; to the due extent or not. And rejoice with me, my little woman; for this day, were it ten times colder, is a right glad and good one!&#x2014; Only take care, too, take care; no more of these relapsings, if you please,&#x2014;at least not till I come back to be beside you.</p>
<p>I hope you will now get out to the Country, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> one of those excursions you used to speculate of. If thy Bay House <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to perfection, well, right well; but if it do <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> contrive another. W<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not Mrs George<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Welsh, widow of JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle George.</note> at Richmond simply <hi rend="italic">change</hi> with you, for a week? That, after all, might be the handiest, after all. And you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find Richmond pretty much <hi rend="italic">real</hi> &#x201C;Country,&#x201C;&#x2014;in all things except the quiet of it, perfectly real; and might have fine walks and sittings in the sun, and in good <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> terms,&#x2014;especially if <hi rend="italic">John</hi> were left with you while his Mother was enjoying Town-life. But this latter clause, I suppose, is futile; poor John being off northward.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh was in Ardrossan; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-19">19 July</date>]</ref>.</note> Indeed, I know nothing; and cannot counsel, can only wish.&#x2014; If the Bay H<hi rend="italic">se</hi> aspects do not please you at <hi rend="italic">last,</hi> you must even give them up. &#x201C;Dignity, Mr Arnot&#x201C; is much my mind too; the rather as any sacrifice of it might make the visit distasteful to you (in secret), and therefore unprofitable. Scan it strictly, <hi rend="italic">calculate</hi> all things well; and if it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> thoroughly suitable, how glad shall I be! I guess too you may be right ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Tennysons; if the poor Lady is <hi rend="italic">unwell,</hi> it will much obstruct on both hands,&#x2014;but I do not think there is any doubt of her or his <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> to see you there: keep assured of that, too. On the whole, Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a <hi rend="italic">pis aller</hi> <pb id="pg-34-42" n="34:42"/>[last resort] worth considering? And let us hope, <hi rend="italic">next</hi> year, we may have perhaps <hi rend="italic">some</hi> scheme adjusted rendering us independent of &#x201C;invitations,&#x201C; and superseding all this weary haggling, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one is so little fit for when one is really ill. And again I say Take care, take care.</p>
<p>These &#x201C;Notes&#x201C; on Life at Chelsea are capital; the Picture of Botkin (coming on me in such a mood too) seemed unsurpassable for fun &#x26; truth recogniseable thro&#x2019; it. To all appearance he is a Cal<hi rend="italic">muck</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kalmuck, a Mongolian people living on the NW shore of the Caspian Sea.</note> (the &#x201C;Cossacks&#x201C; are fine Polish-looking fellows, I believe); he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be thrown into paroxysms of embarrass<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and his agitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">extreme,</hi> poor soul&#x2014; The poor Aitkens too, poor Bess &#x26; dilettante David! Under the frosts of <hi rend="italic">Time,</hi> they come hovering like ghosts upon one, that kind of human phenomena.</p>
<p>I went to Dumfries yesterday; and had <hi rend="italic">such</hi> an Afternoon&#x2014;Ach Gott! But it is all over now; and I am well &#x26; happy this day; and make everybody happier by telling my good news. Jean was unweariedly diligent, patient almost beyond human; I cannot think of that with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a fine kind of feeling wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> brightens the <hi rend="italic">chaos</hi> of accompaniment the mean <hi rend="italic">problem</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c. But 3 snips<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The tailors.</note> (&#x2153; of a man) <hi rend="italic">are</hi> steadily sewing, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> their material lies round them: <hi rend="italic">basta</hi> [enough].&#x2014; One other bulletin (return of post to <hi rend="italic">this</hi>), and then I will let you off,&#x2014;if you be good. Adieu, dear little woman <name>T. C.</name></p>

<p>A bad night again&#x2014;Oh my poor little suffering Jeannie! I was halloohing <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I was out of the wood; I come <hi rend="italic">down</hi> a good few pegs again, by the news of this morning. But we must not be disheartened either; I will hope for <hi rend="italic">un</hi>steady progress; I remember that it cannot always be steady. Take care, only take care: we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do nothing more; and I will depend for that on you; for my sake and for your own, neglect nothing on that side.&#x2014; The ugly Bramah<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-JWC-TC-02">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date>]</ref>.</note> botheration too! At least dismiss that from your poor head, once and forever; say I will settle it, on my return: far better pay the whole account, and end it, than haggle in your present state. Have done, you, with the wretches at any rate! The entire matter, so far as I remember, was a burble; <hi rend="italic">drunken</hi> workmen &#x26;c &#x26;c: and perhaps there is a kind of natural necessity that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> bear our share of that. It is nothing like the heaviest case of such nature we have <pb id="pg-34-43" n="34:43"/>had in our time and place! Think of Parsons, of Morgan:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Parsons, carpenter (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530922-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:275</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-09-22">22 Sept. 1853</date></corr></ref>), and Joseph Morgan, builder and carpenter (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520713-JWC-MR-01"><sic>27:165</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1852-07-13">13 July 1852</date></corr></ref>), who had worked for the Carlyles during the alterations to 5 Cheyne Row in 1852&#x2013;53; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530705-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:184</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-07-05">5 July 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> an insensible flea-bite compared with the vast blistering bug-and-spider operations man is liable to, placed down amid Anarchic Londoners at present! And on the whole come <hi rend="italic">away</hi> from it, Dearest. Say, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will pay it; they shall get their money from me (tell them), and are commanded only to hold their tongues at present!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here too our weather is all gone to anarchy again. Grey blustering winds, oftenest driving. Scotch mist along with these; coming out occasionally in fierce batterings of rain. Yesterday I missed my ride on that account; might have had it <hi rend="italic">earlier;</hi> but when the appointed after-dinner hour came, all was peppering and pelting; I went to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> instead. Waited so till tea; then took <hi rend="italic">Mackintosh</hi> and stick, and executed good 5 miles of independent walking,&#x2014;very wild, grandly ugly and vacant, really rather interesting. As Darwin says of the bad tobacco, &#x201C;It does just as well!&#x201C;&#x2014; I am not going <hi rend="italic">back</hi> in health; I really believe myself on the advance all the same. The only thing mournfully certain to me is, my perfect <hi rend="italic">do-nothingism:</hi> about that there can be no doubt at all. Scarcely 20 pages of a Book (some unimportant Book too, a German-Swedish <hi rend="italic">Charles XII</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Knut Lundblad, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Karl des Zw&#xF6;lften, K&#xF6;nigs von Schweden</hi>, 2 vols.

Karl XII (<date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1718-00-00">1718</date>), king of Sweden.</note> it is at present) are found read, when midnight comes, and I tumble into my horizontal posture again,&#x2014;such a lullaby of roaring winds as you never heard; louder than a moderate cannon-battery, only constant. I write nothing; I think nothing,&#x2014;dwell in brown continents of half-thought, of painful reminiscence; in fact, of the <hi rend="italic">unthinkable.</hi> Being voluntarily idle, and here for the purpose of idleness, I never have &#x201C;any wish to sew.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <sic>30:209 and 31:204</sic><corr><ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-30">30 Oct. 1855</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560830-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1856-08-30">30 Aug. 1856</date>]</ref></corr>.</note>&#x2014;The three Tailors (I much hope) will get done before the week end: then that paltry care will be off me for long time to come.</p>
<p>I have read that Newspaper narrative of Bulwerism; your own (<hi rend="italic">Fosterian,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., from Mrs. Forster; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-JWC-TC-02">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I gather) as preface to it. Nothing can be more life-like than yours: the other too I perceive to be essentially true. A most sad and shocking story altogether. The &#x201C;Dr Thomson,&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Hale Thomson.</note> I think, has no business whatever with John&#x2019;s: I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> regard him as a man worth whipping at the Cart&#x2019;s Tail, and branding on both shoulders &#x201C;S. F.&#x201C; (Scoundrel Flunkey) that men might know to avoid him,&#x2014;him and his partner<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Ross.</note> in that detestable &#x26; damnable transaction of theirs. The poor woman, I perceive, is what we knew her in past years: no more <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> than <pb id="pg-34-44" n="34:44"/>I am,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; unwise, ill-guided to a high degree, and plunging wildly under the heavy burden laid on her. I was thinking the other night, by suggestion of this thing, of how one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> scientifically define <hi rend="italic">madness</hi> in contradistinction from <hi rend="italic">folly</hi> such as hers wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in common speech is called &#x201C;mad.&#x201C; I found that if you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> conceive a change of heart (total stilling of these wild ragings and jealousies and diabolic <hi rend="italic">passions,</hi> change such as the religious people call &#x201C;conversion&#x201C;), it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> entirely cure <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> whereas it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do nothing at a real <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>man; except <hi rend="italic">mediately</hi> and by degrees (altering <hi rend="italic">other</hi> derangements), <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> but alter the <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> of his madness. This, for the first time is a real distinction I have hit upon in that abstruse matter: if Goody take it in too, it shall be well.&#x2014;For the rest, I confess my mind is in open revolt ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the so-called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> vessel,&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Pet. 3:7; i.e., Bulwer Lytton.</note> and his conduct, especially in finishing this frightful affair.

<p>You wont get much of a letter today, dear; and yesterday you were put off with a volume of Tourg&#xE9;neff. I came down so weary and sick yesterday morning after a sleepness night, that I thought least said was soonest mended, and, that the day being remarkably fine, I should be doing better for myself, by driving in an Omnibus than by sitting writing at home. So I went to Richmond! by <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Omnibuses, so that I had no more walking to do than from the bottom of St Johns Grove to no 19. I found M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Welsh.</note> absolutely <hi rend="italic">alone&#x2014;</hi> she had parted with her little maid from motives of economy; so that the project of changing houses is fallen to the ground, like so many others, as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could not do without somebody to light my fire &#x26;c, and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> dispense <pb id="pg-34-46" n="34:46"/>with Charlotte in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had suggested JWC exchange houses with Margaret Welsh (widow of George Welsh) for a week; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580713-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-13">13 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Besides I think she has it in view to <hi rend="italic">let</hi> her house if possible&#x2014;as she now considers it would be quite rash to leave it locked up. No matter! I think it is a dreadfully <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> little house, and I have no fancy for the &#x201C;air&#x201C; of Richmond. I did not however give it a fair trial yesterday; for I missed everything in the form of a dinner and had instead tea&#x2014;twice over&#x2014;the first doze&#x2014;at Richmond&#x2014;was horribly coarse, and I dare say <hi rend="italic">that</hi> with the excitement of the drive was the cause of my having very little sleep after this first &#x201C;excursion.&#x201C; I mean to spend a day on Hampstead heath next! No word from Miss Baring and I dare say that scheme wont carry water either. It will need a very <hi rend="italic">cordial</hi> invitation indeed to make me go, <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> that I know there has been even the most delicate pressure brought to bear on it!</p>

<p>Two bad nights in succession, my poor dear Jeannie: it is no better than I thought; I got no news because there was none good! And I must put up with this till Tuesday:&#x2014;well, well, we cannot help it. &#x201C;A true speak&#x201C; indeed, that solemn one of the Aunt Grace. But we will hope neverthess;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> above all things, we will <hi rend="italic">try.</hi></p>
<p>Richmond seems to be quite out,&#x2014;would it had spared you that &#x201C;coarse tea by way of dinner,&#x201C; at least. Bay House too seems as good as out. Indeed I see nothing possible in the way of Country, unless you are strong enough now for the adventure of the railway <hi rend="italic">hitherward.</hi> You say nothing about your cough, your <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> under any form, in these two last bulletins: I hope what of it, but that is not much; I cannot think it has yet left you at the point where you were before that sad Brighton Enterprise. But the truth is, if you are able to get to Scotland at all, here would and could be right &#x201C;country&#x201C; for you; and I now see no clear chance of any elsewhere. It is certain, if you were simply in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> place here, you might have every advantage that is included under what people call country, and probably in fuller measure, and with fewer drawbacks, than in any place else in the world, Bay House, Undercliff Tennysons&#x2019;,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Undercliff, a range of cliff and terrace on S coast of Isle of Wight, nr. Farringford House, the Tennysons&#x2019; home.</note> Richmond, or whatever other! This is a clear fact, and you must think seriously whether it does not demand immediately being acted upon. I can, and right joyfully will, surrender you <hi rend="italic">my</hi> place here (I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> pig in,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370707-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:243</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-07-07">7 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> I doubt not, at Scotsbrig, certainly at Dumfries, 4 trains a day, time scarcely half an hour); <pb id="pg-34-48" n="34:48"/>and you would be a real <hi rend="italic">prize</hi> to the people; and nobody on earth w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be kinder and more tender than Mary and the rest of them from youngest to oldest,&#x2014;nice, clean, well-conditioned, modest sensible creatures all the Children<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and James Austin had eight das. and one son.</note> seem to me, and you might make more acquaintance with them then, and I really fancy grow to like their modest assiduities about you. The two little rooms are clean and neat; the Bed as good as any bed and room, in the most essential respects. There w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be nothing to hinder you to put up here for as many days or weeks as you found it,&#x2014;at lowest till I had discovered some Lodging for us both: I hear of Cottages about New-Abbey<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parish and village 6 mi.

In short it all turns on <hi rend="italic">yourself,</hi> poor Goody dear: whether you have strength to venture, strength to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it if you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> venture. For we must not have too much courage: &#x201C;courage to go whether you can or not,&#x201C;&#x2014;alas, we have had too much of that. In a word, I am practically pretty certain that if you just stood in my shoes, you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> immediately begin to get some sleep and improvement. And to give up my present &#x201C;shoes&#x201C; to you, never fancy that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a &#x201C;sacrifice,&#x201C;&#x2014;the reverse rather, having had three weeks of this perfect &#x201C;silence&#x201C; (and gloom enough of mind along with it):&#x2014;so that to change <hi rend="italic">for my poor Goody</hi> (all things considered) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a triumphant and joyful issue, if we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to it! I beg you dear think seriously of this; &#x26; do what is wise in it. Nothing more <hi rend="italic">like</hi> a Sister (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you never had) or a still <hi rend="italic">Dearer</hi> than any Sister (which we never will have more in this world) could be found than poor Mary;&#x2014;there is a namesake of yours among the children, too, whom Jean is greatly praising, a nice young lass:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Austin (b. <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), the 4th da.</note> she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wait on you; and be your maid, on the most devoted terms, if you permitted it.

<p>For the rest; you dont at all estimate my difficulties in writing a letter every day, when I am expected to tell <hi rend="italic">how</hi> I am&#x2014;and when Is &#x201C;ashamed to say Is no better.&#x201C; Dispense me from saying anything whatever about my health&#x2014;let me write always &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Notes</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and it would be easy for me to send you a daily letter&#x2014; As easy at least as it is to be <hi rend="italic">lively</hi> with the callers, who go away in doubt (like George Cook)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John George Cooke.</note> &#x201C;whether I am the most stoical of women, or whether there is nothing in the world the matter with me&#x201C;!

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>The pretty Letter did not fail on Saturday; and today (while you yourself get nothing) there has come a Newspaper, with strokes on it, one of them so manifestly dwarfish as to indicate not &#x201C;good&#x201C; but only, &#x201C;I wish it were good, for your sake!,&#x201C;&#x2014;thank you all the same, or <hi rend="italic">more,</hi> my poor little Jeannie. I can persuade myself you are not worse than when I last heard; alas, I must put up with that: who can send good news when there is not any?&#x2014; I long to hear tomorrow what you think of the Scotch expedition; I persuade myself confidently you would at once be somewhat better in the Country; and except the poor scheme last proposed, I can see no sure way of your getting a fair trial made. If you dare undertake the thing, all particulars can at once be settled; and the road, swept clear of loose obstacles, will be wide-open with only its <hi rend="italic">native</hi> difficulties, which I confess are neither few nor small in my poor woman&#x2019;s case at this bad juncture! John with his poor Boys appears to be <pb id="pg-34-52" n="34:52"/>actually about to evacuate Scotsbrig too &#x201C;in the first week of August,&#x201C; so that there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be another resource, were you in these localities. Come, poor Jeannie mine, if you at all dare! There is <hi rend="italic">gig</hi>-driving without stint, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think you might stand in the sunny intervals (of which we have some hours almost daily, weather fresh, airy, greyish, really not bad at all); and I am convinced, your poor faculty of sleep w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> immediately increase under such a regimen. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bedroom really, in all essential particulars, is excellent: clean, big (the two rooms together), may have what air you like or no-air; and a silence such as you have hardly known in any sleeping place, Town or Country. The best of eggs &#x26;c, the best of coffee;&#x2014;and such brown bread as I believe is hardly procurable in Great Britain elsewhere: &#x201C;Miss Hay&#x2019;s brown bread,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Maryann Hay (ca. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>), baker, Friar&#x2019;s Vennel, Dumfries.</note> a genuinely excellent article; at the easy rate of <hi rend="italic">5d per Quartern loaf</hi> (actually that); probably the cheapest bread you ever bought.&#x2014; &#x2014; But I will say no more. Only this of loitering in London, this will never answer at the present season in such circumstances!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The day before writing my last Letter I had ridden down by Annan,&#x2014;round the <hi rend="italic">North</hi> side of it this time, as I did round the South when last here, and up the main street again in both cases: this time, it was market day, but the sky and earth were all in friendly tune, and I had strange impressive ride of it, every stone and turn being familiar to me, and of the numerous human faces not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> recogniseable as ever seen before. One has in reality the privileges of a <hi rend="italic">beatified ghost</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Tarr, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 33.</note> in such case: at that is rather a sombre one, I can promise you! Jamie of Scotsbrig &#x26; his son John,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and John Carlyle.</note> I afterwards learned, were there; but I had missed them. The tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of this miss, the need of a longer ride next day, or perhaps mere accident sent me off on Friday after dinner to ride over Hoddam Hill (strange old scene, in wh<hi rend="italic">h you</hi> were still vividly present) and on to Scotsbrig. I found that a rather cloudy operation, owing mainly to Jack &#x26; the poor Boys; I got tolerably thro&#x2019; it however; and came trotting home with a f[l]ight<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of ghosts escorting me thro&#x2019; the dusk and damp, but with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> other accident, still in time enough. Unhappily I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> put on my <hi rend="italic">Mackintosh,</hi> but kept it tied to the saddle, tho&#x2019; a blessed wind was blowing, and my doublet none of the newest. I woke next morning far too early; and found, by symptoms, that I had taken cold by the bus<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> By heaping new wrappages on my bed &#x26;c, I immediately checked that bad affair, and it is pretty well in abeyance ever since (perhaps <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> altogether), and only the natural set of circumstances acting on me, &#x201C;milk diet&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> tend towards good in the end); but I will take better care another time. Another <pb id="pg-34-53" n="34:53"/>consequence was, Jamie &#x26; the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> came over yesterday to return my visit! Jamie I could have done very well with, much the sensiblest person I have spoken with in these parts; but John was very &#x201C;detached,&#x201C; flighty, flimsy (cannot help it, poor soul!) &#x26; tumbled my Day ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my ears a good deal. Alas, that is Life; that is what Life now has in it. Take it, and be thankful!&#x2014; &#x2014; In the evening, being quite driven off my <hi rend="italic">Charles XII,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-34/lt-18580714-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-14">14 July</date></ref>.</note> I read <hi rend="italic">Moumou,</hi> at your repeated recommendation. Truly it is an exquisite thing; pathetic in a high degree, tho&#x2019; not over true; what we may reckon T.&#x2019;s masterpiece in the Poetic line. Seduced by the title, <hi rend="italic">Faust,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fourth story in Turgenev&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sc&#xE8;nes de la vie russe</hi>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580701-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-01">1 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I read the next too;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Le Ferailleur.&#x201C;</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has high elements in it, but is not well done at all, and must be called bad rather than good. I expect to finish <hi rend="italic">Karl XII</hi> tomorrow; I get strange glimpse into old sunk <hi rend="italic">memorabilia</hi> out of that rather stupid Book.</p>
<p>A tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that sometimes rises minatory on me is, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Should</hi> not you go to Germany, Sir, and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> those Battlefields?&#x201C; Conscience is obliged to answer it knows not what! I believe I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be considerably stronger for such a journey than I was 3 weeks ago. I mean to look more into it, were my poor little Goody once settled in any tolerable way. <hi rend="italic">Idleness</hi> I believe will not permanently do for me, however old I grow. But truly, on other grounds I care less and less for disturbing myself with anything in the shape of &#x201C;work,&#x201C; of what I have to call &#x201C;work,&#x201C; bless the mark!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360904-JWC-MWE-01"><sic>9:48</sic><corr>JWC to MWE, [<date when="1836-09-04">4 Sept. 1836</date>]</corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Merchant of Venice</hi> 2.2.</note> The most deathless epics seem to me such a paltry thing to what they once did; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">frail craiters</hi>&#x201C;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>The 3 tailors <hi rend="italic">still continue,&#x2014;</hi>not to end till this evening at soonest. Properly they are perhaps but 1 &#x8532; (two of them being <hi rend="italic">sons</hi> of the chief (and perhaps only 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi> parts or so): at any rate, such indeed this whole clothes operation has been scandalous and disgusting to me in some measure,&#x2014;owing to the anarchy of things and shopkeepers in these parts. Never mind! I have <hi rend="italic">got</hi> a very <hi rend="italic">good</hi> dressing-gown (<hi rend="italic">colour</hi> only questionable; it is whitish-grey, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be helped), a good new cape, two wretched summer coats (cobweb &#x26; despicability all that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be done), 3 pairs <hi rend="italic">drawers,</hi> 3 waistcoats (sleeved), 2 p<hi rend="italic">r</hi> trowsers, and all things trim and repaired;&#x2014;and tomorrow I shall be free probably, and <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the cares of cloth.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I am glad to hear you have got your work so far advanced, and are about getting deliverance from the element of London for a while. You seem to stand it much better than I; tho&#x2019; of course it is wholesome for no mortal.</p>
<p>I have spent here one of the idlest months that I can remember in my life,&#x2014;just four weeks this day since I arrived in these solitudes;&#x2014;utterly and steadfastly <hi rend="italic">idle;</hi> yet far enough from easy; and not even left alone from talking, and jolting about on small errands, far more than I wished: in short I fear a disgracefully useless time,&#x2014;if there be not, on the side of health (as is possible) some stock of improvement laid in, under a <hi rend="italic">disguised</hi> form, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not always palpable to one&#x2019;s feelings at the present moment. I am so thoroughly smashed to pieces in late times, it is difficult to set me up again in any measure! My poor Wife&#x2019;s case too gives me great distress.&#x2014; But we must still try to hope, in this &#x201C;place of hope.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Tarr, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note> I consider for most part, I must really set myself to finish that unutterable business I have taken up; get my hands fairly washed of that; and leave the rest to follow as it can.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-62" n="34:62"/>Thank you for your continual helpfulness to me. There are some Books perhaps you might manage to pick up for me; one old <hi rend="italic">French</hi> Book there is, on the 7-Years War, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I sent for a long time since without effect: I unluckily, in this scene, cannot recover the name of it; <hi rend="italic">Bourchet</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre-Joseph Bourcet, <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires historiques, sur la guerre que les Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais ont soutenue en Allemagne depuis <date when="1757-00-00">1757</date> jusqu&#x2019;en 1762</hi>, ed.

<p>All tolerably well here; and the better, to hear my poor little Woman&#x2019;s news of herself,&#x2014;in expectation of more tomorrow.

<p>Jean came yesternight according to program. I fear I myself have been talking more than was good.

<p>I wonder what you made of the letter I wrote you yesterday? Could you so much as read it? If it were legible; it was &#x201C;more by good luck than good guiding&#x201C; for I could not steady my hand a moment&#x2014;nor yet my wits! I was in such a crisis of nervousness, when I wrote that note, that I could almost have wished I had the faculty most women have of falling into hysterics(!) and so working it off! &#x201C;The history of <hi rend="italic">Panizzi,</hi> Sir, was this.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see also <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440627-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:89</sic><corr>TC to JWC, [<date when="1844-06-27">27 June 1844</date>]</corr></ref>.

<p>I went on Tuesday, according to programme with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin, to see his Mother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Larkin.</note> and his garden and spend the best of the day in the open air. It was quite a successful little lark, <hi rend="italic">while it lasted.</hi> The little house is in the midst of green fields. The mistress of it just such a dear, simple, kindly woman as you can suppose M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin&#x2019;s Mother to be! All the family seem superior people&#x2014;one felt <hi rend="italic">well</hi> amongst them in the first minute! The dinner was perfectly charming&#x2014;a roast leg of mutton, very tender and well cooked, and three different kinds of vegetables out of their own garden! nothing else but a rice pudding. No pretension&#x2014;no fuss&#x2014;but radiant good humour, and hearty hospitality. Indeed it was not likely but I should be pleased, for they welcomed me as if I had been the Virgin Mary!</p>
<p>A gentleman (a <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> I took him to be) came after dinner with two ladies (his wife and her sister)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> who are devoted readers of yours. And having &#x201C;a horse and chay&#x201C; of his own, he insisted on driving me to the <hi rend="italic">Hoxton</hi> Omnibus,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hoxton omnibus ran between Hoxton, NE London, and Chelsea, a distance of about 5 mi. &#x201C;Chay&#x201C;: chaise.</note> to simplify my journey home&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin never leaving me till he saw me in the Omnibus, and hardly to be hindered from coming to Chelsea with me!

<p>I then sent Larkin to Bramah&#x2019;s with three proposals, of which they might take their choice.</p>
<p>I would pay them 2&#xa3; 15 / or I would let the matter be settled by arbitration, or they might prosecute me for the whole amount in the County Court!</p>
<p>After much discussion with the fat winking old man, who always smells of beer, this much was wrung from him by Larkin that he would &#x201C;send&#x2014;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Foreman</hi> (!) to look at the job!&#x201C;&#x2014;that man whom, I had told him, before the account was sent in, I never wished to see the face of again! So yesterday morning the foreman came, prepared to <hi rend="italic">threep</hi> that the one man never was drunk!&#x2014;never left the work!! and that the other was quite competent!! and that the job <hi rend="italic">required</hi> all the time that was charged on it!!!</p>
<p>To reduce such brazen impudence as <hi rend="italic">this</hi> to go away content with 3&#xa3; 10 / was no slight triumph of female eloquence but &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">did it</hi> Sir&#x201C;!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:55 and Charles Dickens, <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi> (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) chap. 24.</note>&#x2014;however the two hours talking, the wrath I had to swallow down, not to put myself at a disadvantage&#x2014;the force of <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> and of logic to be called up left me not worth picking up after the man was gone! For hours I seemed to have got St Vitus&#x2019;s dance in all my veins, and to fix my attention was impossible. Even my weekly letter to Sunny Bank<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Jess and Jean Donaldson, who lived at Tenterfield House, Haddington. JWC always referred to the house by its former name, Sunny Bank; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570919-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>33:89</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, [<date when="1857-09-19">19?

<p><pb id="pg-34-66" n="34:66"/>3&#xa3; 10/ was fifteen shillings more than I had decided to pay, but Hacking whom I sent for in the course of the dispute, failed me in his &#x201C;apprehension of <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi>&#x201C; and proposed <hi rend="italic">before the Man</hi> that I should give that much.</p>
<p>I learnt from the Foreman that the house of <hi rend="italic">Bramah and Co</hi> is reduced to two women and a boy; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Miss &#x26; Master Bramah! The man who smells of beer is sole &#x201C;Manager&#x201C; and the Foreman is &#x201C;Superintendent&#x201C; of Bestige<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> nothing was known!</p>
<p>I have been and shall be in many humours about Bay House before I get there but I have bound myself positively to go. I know that I ought to give myself any chance there is of getting rid of this wearing cough. and that a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> would order me &#x201C;change of air&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>If I find myself the better for being in the country, and that I cant properly stay <hi rend="italic">there</hi> as long as I should be benifited by it; I should then be more disposed, and perhaps a little fitter to take a longer journey.</p>
<p>The worst bother is, that I too must plunge a little into &#x201C;the cares of cloth&#x201C; preparatory to an aristocratic visit. My wardrobe has been the very last of my cares latterly! One new gown I have ordered, and I will send the one, given me by Lady Sandwich last Xmas, to be made&#x2014; But the trash of <hi rend="italic">caps</hi> is what plagues me always! How happy men are who wear, at all ages, their own hair, or somebody else&#x2019;s or their own bare skulls!</p>
<p>I have such a life with that sparrow!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-19">19 July</date>]</ref>.</note> gape-gaping for crowdy whenever I come within three yards of it! And it dont make the least progress in learning to feed <hi rend="italic">itself!</hi> And it dont <hi rend="italic">die!</hi> as was confidently predicted.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster is to send the Carriage for me today, instead of yesterday as had been arranged, that I may see poor Macready, who came to call for me while I was at Larkin&#x2019;s. It will be a melancholy meeting you know I was godmother and name mother to the girl he has just lost.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Macready&#x2019;s da.

<p><salute>Alas, Dear,</salute> there is not the least vestige of your lost Letter here; it had not fallen into Christian hands; probably had got run over by wheels, and reduced to pulp in the street-mud,&#x2014;that is the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> course we can scheme out for it! But perhaps too it may come tomorrow; some charitable mortal may have picked it up with good intentions, and held it too long in his pocket for yesterday&#x2019;s mail. That however is now very unlikely.&#x2014; I am lost in conjecture <pb id="pg-34-69" n="34:69"/>as to what you can have been doing; what you were in quest of at Chapman&#x2019;s especially? One thing only it is lucky I know: that you have Bay House in view in a week; therefore that nothing essentially is wrong with you, and that you have the outlook towards &#x201C;Country,&#x201C; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I confidently hope will do the poor little soul some good.&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t bother about the <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> of the Letter, or about replacing it too minutely: give me some outline, on loose terms rather than confine yourself at home writing more precise details. I have no <hi rend="italic">news</hi> to send you at any time; I ought not to be strict in bargaining with you on that head.</p>
<p>The Day is blustering and blowing with chaotic mixture of sunblinks, rainshowers, and tumbling masses of clouds, over a solitary sea and land. I shall get a good ride, if I manage; there is nothing else to be striven for. I began Tourg<hi rend="italic">ff</hi> last night,&#x2014;not till after the day had been wasted, and the good souls here had all gone to sleep and left me. The first story<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Les Deux Amis&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580701-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-01">1 July</date>]</ref>.</note> is not bad: I could read the rest, as a task of idleness, without difficulty; but there is no real solitude allowed till Jean go; and God knows the talk I have (tho&#x2019; good of its sort, too) is by no means charming to me!&#x2014; Poor Jean is assiduity itself, yesterday, and again this day, giving the last finish of perfection to a <hi rend="italic">Belt</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to make Larkin&#x2019;s machine the article for my wear.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The truss for bathing; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580708-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July</date></ref>.</note> She had unfortunately called in a <hi rend="italic">saddler</hi> to help, at Dumfries;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Lancaster (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), 16 St. David&#x2019;s St., Dumfries.</note> and the problem has become abstruse,&#x2014;to me inexpressibly wearisome; sad and mournful even when I witness poor Jean&#x2019;s industrious helpfulness, and my own unhelpable nature. Pardon me, pardon me, ye good souls! Oh, it is not that I am cruel or unthankful; but I am weary, weary; and it is difficult to get the galling harness from me, and the heavy burdens off the back of an old wayworn animal at this advanced stage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My practical tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> (if I had any) turn still on Germany: but I cannot dare not yet form any <hi rend="italic">resolutions;&#x2014;</hi>if I had <hi rend="italic">Maps</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have not, <hi rend="italic">Larkin&#x2019;s</hi> being yet waited for) I should get into poring over those at least, during the clear hours of the day. I ought also to write to people about flinging me ashore out of a yacht. It is much easier to sit and do nothing, or &#x201C;think and smoke tobacco&#x201C;! As if I were an &#x201C;only child,&#x201C; and even more, I have at this time &#x201C;no wish to sew.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580714-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-14">14 July</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>From Larkin there arrived yesterday a Parcel (not opened yet, but containing a <hi rend="italic">Cole</hi> of Charing Cross, &#x201C;intended for bathing&#x201C;): it seems to have been round by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by Glasgow, but lay waiting safe at Annan yesterday (Railway-Office, I suppose, or Post-Office?) nothing more to pay for it: &#x201C;paid thro&#x2019;&#x201C; by Larkin seemingly for &#x201C;6&#x201C; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I suppose is <hi rend="italic">pence,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">shillings</hi>). <pb id="pg-34-70" n="34:70"/>Such channel of conveyance is well worth our knowing, <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> in the interim; pray ask him punctually, &#x26; say meanwhile that the thing is safe in my hands. If the Sun will break out tomorrow, I believe the tide w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for a trial of this apparatus; I decidedly suppose, bathing w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be of advantage to me, among all my other advantages here.&#x2014; &#x2014; I sleep well; Oh if you but slept half as well; in fact, speaking in &#x2019;<hi rend="italic">spital</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., hospital.</note> language, I am doing well,&#x2014;in any other language, not &#x201C;doing&#x201C; at all; but lying dormant the victim of Human Indolence; for the time being, a disgrace to creation rather. Oh may God watch over thee, my poor little woman;&#x2014;may a little sleep visit thee at least! Adieu again <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>My poor letter!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lost letter of [<date when="1858-07-22">22 July</date>] arrived on Sat., <date when="1858-07-24">24 July</date> (see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580726-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-26">27 [26] July</date></ref>), but TC noted later on its MS: &#x201C;(<hi rend="italic">came</hi>: <date when="1858-07-25">25 july</date>, to The Gill).&#x201C;</note> I am afraid it could not have had the luck to get &#x201C;crushed in the mud&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580723-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-23">23 July</date></ref>.</note> for I was not in muddy places that dry day&#x2014; I am afraid it must have gone to gratifying some vulgar curiosity! Never mind there was no treason in it.</p>
<p>What I was doing at Chapmans?&#x2014;A stupidity!&#x2014;When the last packet of your Translations came.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Translations from the German</hi>, vol. 14 of the cheap edn. of TC&#x2019;s works (<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), pbd. <date when="1858-07-03">3 July</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/ed-32-athanaeum-advertisements"><sic>32:220</sic><corr>Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s Advertisements</corr></ref>.</note> I opened it in the parlour and two or three days after carried the volumes up to the Study.

Having satisfied myself no 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> copy was here; I went up to Chapman&#x2019;s to ask how many were sent&#x2014;and should have been sent&#x2014;and found it all right! What I &#x201C;had been doing&#x201C; before? was it not all <hi rend="italic">elaborately</hi> written in the lost letter?&#x2014; I had spent a pleasant half-day at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkins&#x2014;made acquaintance with a large family of simple intelligent kindly people all after the pattern of our friend. Had been much in the <pb id="pg-34-71" n="34:71"/>open air&#x2014;(the house is amongst green fields)&#x2014;had eaten goosberies off the bushes&#x2014;had been treated like a little queen&#x2014;and driven to the Hoxton Omnibus <hi rend="italic">in</hi> &#x201C;a chay&#x201C; (volunteered by a Builder&#x2014;one of your devoted admirers)&#x2014;had done nothing to hurt myself, so far I knew, and much to do myself good&#x2014;and the up shot had been a night of the very worst sort!&#x2014;No sleep&#x2014;burning fever&#x2014;and incessant coughing! I came down to breakfast all the same, and was found, in this defeated condition by&#x2014;Bramahs Foreman!&#x2014;All that Larkin had been able to elicit, from the winking old man in the shop, was; that &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Foreman</hi> would be sent to examine the work done&#x201C;!! The Foreman! whose unconcientius conduct caused the whole bother! <hi rend="italic">He</hi> to be arbitrator! I cannot write a detailed account of our discussion, a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> time! Enough to say, it lasted 2 hours! and ended in his taking 3&#xa3; 10 / instead of 5&#xa3;9 /6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014; But the mischief to my nerves from having to keep calm, and collected, under impudent denials and assertions, the only natural answer to which would have been a smash accross the skull with a poker&#x2014; From having to fence with my tongue for two mortal hours&#x2014;after it had been all night sticking to the roof of my mouth&#x2014;! It was more than I would have taken 10&#xa3; to suffer. But&#x2014;one <hi rend="italic">can&#x2019;t</hi> let oneself be imposed upon!&#x2014; There I was, however, when the wretch had fairly gone off, to a certain extent reduced to reason&#x2014;in a state impossible to describe unless you can conceive one having St Vitus&#x2019;s dance <hi rend="italic">inwardly.</hi> It was with the utmost difficulty I wrote you a few lines promising an explanatory letter on the morrow&#x2014;(the lost letter) but I did not say it was illness that hindered me&#x2014;not to make you anxious about what I knew would pass off&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">rest&#x2014;</hi></p>
<p>And accordingly&#x2014;I was able to keep my appointment when the Forster carriage came for me the following day&#x2014;to meet Macready&#x2014; He looked very quiet and sad but no older nor feebler&#x2014; It was not a <hi rend="italic">good go,</hi> that!&#x2014; Much pretension in the new Fosterian establishment!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At 46 Montagu Sq.</note> and a great falling off in comfort and ease from the pleasant old &#x201C;Chambers&#x201C;!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster was a nonpracticing barrister and member of the Inner Temple who lived in chambers in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields before his marriage.</note> Moreover I couldn&#x2019;t leave off coughing for a minute&#x2014;and Forster&#x2019;s lyrical recognition of the fact, embarrassed me and made me worse</p>
<p>I came away very soon, with closed carriage-windows, and got no harm&#x2014;beyond having been rather bored&#x2014;</p>

<dateline>The Gill, 27 <date when="1858-07-26">[26] july (Monday)1858</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p>Thanks for writing on Saturday: the good little Letter came to me this morning <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I had done breakfast; our Annan Postman (one of the loosest-looking old stumpy men, with his mouth always fallen open, whom they call &#x201C;Waldie&#x201C;; (that is, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Wellwood</hi>&#x2019; Richardson, of the Dumfries genealogy) comes always earlier on Monday, having no London Mail to wait for. I wished much I could have written to you on Saturday; for the missing Letter actually came, that morning: a romantic arrival! It had had the fate I guessed for it,&#x2014;crushed down by wheels, to all appearance; but at length a human soul had noticed it, and behaved to it in a human manner. This small act of virtue, very small but very genuine, has given me a kind of pleasure since. I return you the cover; by wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you may see with your eyes what the probable adventure has been. Pity only that I could not tell you of it till now; and clear away one little vexation from a poor heart that has too many. But there was no possibility: Ecclefechan was in abeyance for the time; and neither Dumfries nor Annan, as I now learn, can forward a Sunday Letter except at an early hour of theday.&#x2014;&#x2014;It grieves me to the heart to read of all these botherations falling upon on[e]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> so unfit to bear them. What a thing, to be welcomed after such a night by the Bramah Foreman and his provoking nonsense! However, I perceive you resolve not to be beaten at your post; and to do your function while a particle of life is left. The &#x201C;settlement&#x201C; was good and excell<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> far better than one could have expected; and that will be a kind of comfort to you also, that you went thro&#x2019; it all as if you had been a Railway Director or a Secretary of State, and came out of it victorious tho&#x2019; only half alive,&#x2014;poor litil<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> soul! That <pb id="pg-34-73" n="34:73"/>cough is a sore business; that weakness, not permitting you the least excitation, under penalty of a sleepless night. Yesterday morning it came into my heart like a dagger, that miserable cough, when I first opened my eyes. Caught in going to <hi rend="italic">Brighton</hi> too.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580701-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-01">1 July</date>]</ref>.</note> Oh take care; be <hi rend="italic">canny</hi>;&#x2014;get rid of that at least. I build myself up in the hope of Bay House; I do anticipate it will sensibly help you. But have a care, have a care; the weather is grown far cooler; the nights are even cold, if your weather resemble ours. This day week I hope to be reading you have got safe thither.</p>
<p>Jean, poor soul, did not want to go away on Saturday night; James (Aitken) had agreed, if she did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> appear, to come &#x26; seek her with a poney-vehicle which he has: so we let it stand that way; and he came accordingly, with their eldest son;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also James Aitken.</note> and a celebrated Poney, <hi rend="italic">white</hi> with age, but very wise and nimble, scarcely bigger than some Newfoundland dogs, but precious in that household. My day as, you can fancy, was not exhilarating on the spiritual side. But it went well enough too. A wildly windy, bright sunny day (night before was all thunder &#x26; rain, now quite away); and I had a useful long jumble on my dromedary, swift and rough by way of <hi rend="italic">intermezzo.</hi> Aitken has a good deal of sense; and has made strange sallyings into the scientific domains, botany &#x26;c; fringing the dusty highway of his life, poor soul, with a little greenness in this manner. I grew profoundly <hi rend="italic">wae</hi> in the end; and rebuked myself for my want of sympathy &#x26;c in past days.

<p>I might have written to you sooner; but in truth, except a sign of life and remembrance, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you did not otherwise doubt, I have not had anything to say. It is now the fifth week that I have been here; in the profoundest solitude, and the most perfect idleness, possible for a British subject; nothing of <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi> passing even in my mind; which does <hi rend="italic">think</hi> in the speakable sense, since I am here; but swims vaguely in waste oceans of reverie, of reminiscence, mostly sombre enough, and sometimes of a very sad character, tho&#x2019; I hope not unwholesome for the individual concerned. There is much unpleasant <hi rend="italic">sediment</hi> to be collected always, if the troubled element is to clear itself at all.</p>
<p>Nobody is entitled to speak to me here, nor does; I hardly now know a human being in these regions, where once everybody was known.

    <p>The little Letter was confidently expected this morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> and it was very welcome; tho&rsquo; small, it has left me cheerfuller than some big ones. No Bramah botheration this time, only sweeps and pacific noises; and it seems to my imagination, tho&rsquo; you never will tell me anything express on that head, as if you had got back a little sleep again, as if perhaps the cough were <hi rend="italic">abating?</hi> Alas, that is but a fancy either; and I have to build my day&rsquo;s satisfaction on very slight foundations.</p>
    <p>Yesterday morning I had made a confused sleep of it,&mdash;sleep divided into 3 (or 2&frac12;), and the last an hour <hi rend="italic">too long;</hi>&mdash;I concluded to execute, that day, a purpose I had been vaguely forming, <hi rend="italic">to go without dinner.</hi> Long ride, say to Scotsbrig; tea and caudled egg there, with certain Books from John: that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the method. Austin hearing of the thing, and finding the day bad for hay, proposed zealously the gig instead of riding, &ldquo;Mary to go too,&rdquo; &c &c: and for <pb id="pg-34-77" n="34:77" />a quiet life, I yielded. The gig did very well,&mdash;I got on <hi rend="italic">behind</hi> for most part (gig is of dog-cart build), kept the carriage steadier there, and was dispensed with in the way of talk (a very great convenience to me, and unluckily not common in such cases);&mdash;tea and egg did very well; everything did well enough; and today I am <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> all my lent Books (Tourg<hi rend="italic">ff</hi> vol II<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">

What words I said in reply, I have quite forgotten,&#x2014;probably few or none of a distinctly articulate sort;&#x2014; I suppose you mistook the purport of such silence (which was far from meaning <hi rend="italic">refusal</hi>); or still likelier, you fancied afterwards the thing had been executed straightway then, and forgot it afterwards. At any rate, it has never turned up between us since that day; and of late I have begun to see that I must some day speak of it again myself,&#x2014;under a penalty wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> would be heavy upon you, if you ever came to know of it, as well as upon me who do always know it, and specifically remember it from time to time. No wish or command of <hi rend="italic">hers</hi> but must be sacred to whoever was the object of it.</p>
<p>I have had a certain weak reluctance to write (and of course never once mentioned the matter to living soul); but at length I have here written, and so it is done.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I am chaced<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> for time this day at a most foolish rate; but cannot forbear sending you a word: poor soul, so involved in the &#x201C;cares of cloth&#x201C; and other businesses as you must now be! Lord Ashburton writes this morning that he found you &#x201C;looking much better than when he saw you last&#x201C;:&#x2014;I only wish I could believe him an <hi rend="italic">accurate</hi> reporter; but alas&#x2014;! He says farther you are for Sherborne<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Macready&#x2019;s home in Dorset.</note> after Bay House; and will not go to Scotland &#x201C;charm I never so <hi rend="italic">wildly,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;that is his witty phrase. On the whole his Letter did me good, in the absence of one from yourself. He and I had a little bit of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> to do, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will tell you about by and by: it is now got as good as finished in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>This will find you in the agonies of Packing. If you are writing today as I think likely, do not bother yourself with any <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> of writing to me,&#x2014;unless a vacant moment turn up of itself. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to know what <hi rend="italic">train</hi> you go by on Saturday; my thoughts will probably accompany you very strictly, if I know the hour. Nero,&#x2014;do you take Nero? I am sorry for the wretched Dog and his abstruse Town-life. But perhaps it will not do to fret yourself with him either. Unless you could resolve to be <hi rend="italic">open,</hi> and let him take his fate <hi rend="italic">unsmuggled?</hi> At Bay House there is no <hi rend="italic">game;</hi> he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be much in the way, poor wretch. I have often wished I had him here, beside this black young Collie (foolisher than himself), with whom, if not with the Gander &#x26;c, he might fraternise. Thousands of rabbits run skipping in the woods (and turnip-fields) all round: the bigger kind, with their tails turned up, have a gait and pace wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> often remind me of that less fortunate quadruped.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have asked myself, &#x201C;Will not she perhaps take Charlotte<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam.</note> <hi rend="italic">with</hi> her?&#x201C; But the answer was, &#x201C;No!&#x201C; On the whole, what have you done with Charlotte, with the House and the <hi rend="italic">Etcetera?&#x2014;</hi> Jean talks here of an eligible servant (now in Elliock House,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elliock House, Upper Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire, owned by James Veitch Jr.; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570324-JWC-MR-01"><sic>32:109</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1857-03-24">24</date> or <date when="1857-03-31">31 March 1857</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and decided to leave) who might be had: but I have no assurance that she is <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> importing;&#x2014;could inquire however if you gave command.</p>
<p>On Saturday I cannot expect the least word from you: but at Alverstoke the <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> (you are to remember) is a Post-day to and <hi rend="italic">from:</hi> if your Letters leave <pb id="pg-34-82" n="34:82"/>about 5 p.m. they will get hither as soon as from Chelsea; and London pushes them on, Sunday as well as any other day. Remember this point.&#x2014; It was the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> vol of <hi rend="italic">Tourgueneff,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had already read vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">Sc&#xE8;nes de la vie russe</hi>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-JWC-TC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580710-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-07-10">10 July</date></ref>.</note> was it not, that you never read? I have read it out all but one Tale;&#x2014;I am sorry to say I employed most of yesterday in that idle operation. It is inferior considerably to vol. I, but still worth reading. A fine faculty is in that Russian big man; the heart of him somewhat too <hi rend="italic">sensual,</hi> but full of noble melancholy, and fine qualities; a right gift of humour the most marked defect in his outfit. George Sand &#x26; Company have done him considerable mischief too.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Sand, pseud. of Amandine Aurore Lucile Dudevant, b. Dupin (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), French novelist of whom TC disapproved; see <sic>13:54 and 154</sic><corr><ref target="volume-13/lt-18410309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1841-03-09">9 March</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410621-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1841-06-21">21 June 1841</date></ref></corr>. Turgenev himself said that George Sand had had &#x201C;an immense influence&#x201C; on his early prose writing, particularly on his tales of Russian peasantry (Patrick Waddington, <hi rend="italic">Turgenev and George Sand: An Improbable Entente</hi> [<date when="1981-00-00">1981</date>] 27&#x2013;28).</note> You shall have his volume at Bay House one morning: and the <hi rend="italic">Chasseur</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Turgenev, <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;cits d&#x2019;un chasseur</hi>, trans. from the Russian by H. Delaveau (Paris, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>).</note> too if you like.</p>
<p>Something else I had to say, had not I,&#x2014;but have forgotten what. Nothing of the least moment, you may be well sure!&#x2014; Lord Ashburton <hi rend="italic">promises</hi> me a &#x201C;Cart to Stralsund,&#x201C; as if it were an easy certainty! There are steamers from Newcastle to Hamburg: that is the surest resource, failing others. Oh my Dearest, may thy little Journey go well! This is one of the finest days in Nature; and perhaps the beginning of steadily good weather. May it last over Saturday at least. Be <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> at any rate, and take care, take care.</p>

<dateline>The Gill, Cummertrees, Annan <date when="1858-07-29">29 july, 1858</date>&#x2014;</dateline><salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I am greatly obliged by your kind Letter of this morning; which suppresses, altogether as it ought to do, an unpleasant speck of disorder from one&#x2019;s mind, in a quarter where all is peculiarly bound to be clear and pure,&#x2014;sad but also beautiful, like the memory of the Departed. We will now proceed straightway and settle that matter; so that only pious silence henceforth may be the element of it.</p>
<p>According to what recollection I have, the Bequest was twofold: part <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> <pb id="pg-34-83" n="34:83"/>a sum of &#xa3;1,000 to me;&#x2014;this part will be easily settled, by a cheque from you, or a draft from me such as you have permitted: it is fundamentally indifferent which; but I somehow feel as if I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prefer the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> on a choice given. Part <hi rend="italic">second</hi> was of the nature of a charge or commission; a Sum annually (&#xa3;50, I think) to be bestowed on distressed Literary Persons; <hi rend="italic">her</hi> pious gift, my wisest <hi rend="italic">administration,</hi> year after year. Now about this there rises the question, Was it to be, during your life, during my life, or during yours <hi rend="italic">and</hi> mine? I cannot recollect at all; and think perhaps the point was not specified? In that case, will you, please, settle it, what way you see best: I should think, possibly the third form, &#x201C;during your life and mine&#x201C; (unless you <hi rend="italic">find</hi> it, expressly or by implication, settled otherwise): do you, please, decide, for I have no right to vote on it. The sum ought to be paid every <hi rend="italic">Fourth of May;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The anniversary of Lady Harriet Ashburton&#x2019;s death in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>.</note>&#x2014;and if, what is not in the order of Nature, I be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> left of the Three, it will be in my own power to take farther order for the times that Anniversary comes round.</p>
<p>This I think is all we have to do: and if you will now, before leaving Town, put Part <hi rend="italic">second</hi> into a settled shape, and write me one other little word on the subject, I will answer nothing more, but either <hi rend="italic">draw,</hi> or accept your cheques; and so terminate.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>What you say of my Wife is very encouraging,&#x2014;unless I consider you too sanguine a reporter;&#x2014;her weak coughing state, all this while, has given me great uneasiness. Poor Lady Elcho, poor Lady Elcho<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa, b.

For her own sake, and for that of Another,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Lady Harriet Ashburton.</note> I can never cease to regard her.</p>
<p>If you come by Carlisle, direct for Glasgow (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is 40 or 60 miles the shortest road thither), you will pass within 10 miles of me; but I cannot bid you pause for an interview; I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> chace you rather with new velocity into the mountains, well out of the way of <hi rend="italic">Gout</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From which Lord Ashburton suffered; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580117-TC-JWC-01"><sic>33:158</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-01-17">17 Jan.</date></corr></ref></note> the scoundrel!

<p>That wretched &#x201C;Passport&#x201C;: never mind it farther, dear little soul! Surely you have enough to mind, without that: besides it is of so little real importance (easy to replace by some substitute or other); and I cannot the least direct <hi rend="italic">you</hi> where my keys are! The keys that open all the Desk are in the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> (thin) <hi rend="italic">drawer</hi> of it; and the key of that drawer,&#x2014;it used to lie in the <hi rend="italic">little</hi> drawer where you found the dog-whistles; <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I put it, on leaving, is totally unknown at this moment! Probably in the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> drawer of the &#x201C;Pedestal Chest of Drawers,&#x201C;&#x2014;the key of <hi rend="italic">which,</hi> if Good<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C; &#x2018;Good&#x2019; is masculine for &#x2018;Goody.&#x2019;&#x2014;T. C.&#x201C; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 1:142), but the context suggests that here TC uses it as a shortened form of &#x201C;Goody,&#x201C; i.e., JWC.</note> have it not, is gone out of sight from the present witness.&#x2014; Never mind it, Dear; never mind it; I am myself to blame for any possibility of inconvenience there may be.</p>
<p>You do not tell me what train: but I will guess it may be about 1 p.m.&#x2014;not later I hope, lest you fall into the breezes of the evening sea. That cough, that cough! Yes, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> cannot too soon be got under. But for the rest, keep your heart, don&#x2019;t flurry your poor nerves: Miss B.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring.</note> I calculate, is a solid good Lady, and will know how to welcome the like of you without fuss. And for God&#x2019;s sake, be quiet, you, and let things take their course.

<p><salute>Here it is Dear!</salute> I found I was going to have no peace if I waited till Saturday on the chance of your sending the key, or remembering where you put it, which was as good as no chance at all! So, after another fruitless search, I sent for Hacking<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hacking.</note> to pick the lock. But &#x201C;Providence <hi rend="italic">did</hi> show some little mercy&#x201C; (as Grace Macdonald<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x2019; servant, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369&#x2013;90</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> said when her arm was broken and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the glass of her watch) Hacking brought with him a bag full of keys, one of which opened the top, shallow drawer; and in that lay the key of the top part&#x2014; The passport was in one of the pigeon holes. Hacking said it was too good a lock to have spoiled with <hi rend="italic">picking</hi> and that one <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have tried a thousand keys without getting one to fit&#x2014;so you see there was &#x201C;some little mercy&#x201C;&#x2014; But yesterday was doomed to be a day devoted to the intolerable business of seeking lost keys! Before calling in Hacking, I had collected all the keys in the house to try on these drawers; amongst the rest the key of my portmanteau, and that one (to be needed on <hi rend="italic">saturday</hi>) in a manner altogether mysterious, &#x201C;bank- raipet and geid oot of sicht&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310826-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1831-08-26">26 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I was driven so desperate with the fag <pb id="pg-34-87" n="34:87"/>and worry of seeking <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> next&#x2014;that I ordered a new key; to escape recommencing on the morrow!</p>

<p>I wish to Heaven my little journey were over!&#x2014;and that the good I shall get of it may turn out greater than the harm I have got in the prospect! Last night <hi rend="italic">again,</hi> not a wink of sleep till after five; and from then till seven a succession of little nightmares! &#x201C;Pleasant, Miss!

<p>If I find that the railway journey does me no harm, and that the &#x201C;change of air&#x201C; does me good, and that I shall not have it for long enough at Bay House; I shall try to go to Scotland after all. Lann Hall would suit me well, I think&#x2014; I should have no fear of being a trouble there, and no misgivings about my welcome; it is a beautiful place, with associations to make it more beautiful; I should have a close carriage to drive out in every day; and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle is very quiet, and kind, and sensible. I should like <hi rend="italic">that</hi> better than Cressfield under the <hi rend="italic">present circumstances.</hi> At Cressfield I should have &#x201C;cares of bread,&#x201C; &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520723-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:179</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-07-23">23</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-07-24">24 July 1852</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and I am hardly <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> them in their simplest most familiar form.

The dog has really kept wonderfully well in your absence&#x2014; About Charlotte? She will take care of the house, and go on with the chimney sweeping, and &#x201C;thorough cleaning&#x201C; that is begun. Not a carpet left on but in the parlour and my bed room! and these to be <hi rend="italic">up</hi> too, so soon as I am gone.

I can depend on her that the thing I bid her do, she will do&#x2014;when my back is turned, the same as before my face. Her Mother<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact her aunt, who brought her up.</note> will come and sleep with her. I have no wish to change Charlotte for an older woman&#x2014;as she has strength and sense enough for the place I dont see what I should gain by changing her. She is a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good housemaid and is already a better cook than Ann was. Above all she is my <hi rend="italic">servant&#x2014;</hi>does what I order at the first word&#x2014;and not my <hi rend="italic">mistress!</hi> For the satisfaction of your imagination, you will find her much bigger and older looking when you return&#x2014; A scotch servant, above all out of a large house, would be a risk I would only run in case of necessity.

<p>Just one word, to bid thee welcome to thy new Lodging, my poor little wearied Jeannie: Oh God grant there may have been some right sleep by the time this greets you! It will be too horrible otherwise. That was such a preparation: nightmare from 5 to 7; packing done in the dead of the night, and the rest of it, on the eve of starting! You are just now (2 p.m.) on the road, as I conjecture;&#x2014;you will <hi rend="italic">get</hi> for your own money a vehicle to drive you the mile and half; and that will be more &#x201C;dignified&#x201C; (Mr Arnott) than being sent for, tho&#x2019; it is not so kind or so considerate to one&#x2019;s poor feelings. For one thing, Dearest, do not <hi rend="italic">repent</hi> coming; not tho&#x2019; you had to come away again on the third day. No: it was a deliberately settled thing; <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> to be done, with whatever result!&#x2014; The one point indisputably favourable is, the steady bright weather that has come; I think you will have it there too; nothing can be brighter than these skies for 2 or 3 days past,&#x2014;and with an autumnal aspect too; our Summer gone again with its good and evil.&#x2014; &#x2014; One thing I do very much regret, that you had not come along with me, been <hi rend="italic">able</hi> to come,&#x2014;and to find Mrs Pringle waiting for you, five good weeks ago! You w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have escaped that unblessed Brighton adventure; alas, you could have been so well there, and I either <hi rend="italic">here</hi> or beside you.

I suppose the Sunday night has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> answered for the Rowland Hill from Alverstoke hither? I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly expect it; tho&#x2019; it was possible, and I much wished it,&#x2014;yet with a <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> that the news might <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be &#x201C;good.&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Wae&#x2019;s</hi> me!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 6:5.</note>&#x2014;I went to bed on Saturday night, a most dejected mournful mortal: thinking of your sleeping place (uncertain for any &#x201C;sleep&#x201C;) at Alverstoke, mine here; and how our poor Household was all scattered to the winds. The truth is, I was out of sorts,&#x2014;on the dietetic side: &#x201C;milk <hi rend="italic">cure,</hi>&#x201C; I find, might deserve a name as well as Water-Cure, for indeed it is very <hi rend="italic">medicinal;</hi> therapeutic (i.e. curative) too we will hope;&#x2014;out of sorts on the dietetic side and others: one has to keep silence, and wait. Next morning (yesterday) was hot to a degree, bright and windless; I, still good for nothing, had intended a ride to Scotsbrig perhaps: no riding possible for the heat; wherefore I took to <hi rend="italic">Orlich</hi> (dullest of created writers, but useful to me), and so sat quiet. Dinner a Cup of <hi rend="italic">Hen</hi>-soup (nothing more); then Austin,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin, TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</note> earnestly urgent, <hi rend="italic">drove</hi> me to Scotsbrig and back: wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has proved a useful kind of exercise; and was without external adventure of any kind. One single glimpse I got of <hi rend="italic">something</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s grave.</note> generally at Ecclefechan, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is grand to me and stern and sad beyond all else in Creation;&#x2014;beggaring all <hi rend="italic">words</hi> whatsoever.</p>
<p>Jamie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle.</note> and I are to visit Craigenputtoch, day settled to be <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>next,&#x2014;I have just written to warn the Farmer<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Common.</note> to be there. This is a poor dusty unwelcome duty; but it is an evidently authentic one; and it can be done with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> much martyrdom. Jamie runs over to Annan that morning; passes this way in the train, I joining him at Cummertrees: at Dumfries we take a gig;&#x2014;are here by the train again at 11 (eleven) p.m.&#x2014;&#x2014; Today continues dry; but there has risen a loud dim east wind, &#x26; cold enough.&#x2014; Oh if I but knew that <pb id="pg-34-91" n="34:91"/>you were doing tolerably!

<dateline>Bay House&#x2014;Monday [<date when="1858-08-02">2 August 1858</date>]</dateline>
<p>All right Dear; only the Post arrangements for Sunday not what you took them to be! no letters received on Sunday; and none sent after nine of the morning. So your letter and books reached me only this morning. and before I had written yesterday, it was become impossible. Miss Baring communicated the fact to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Mildmay; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date>]</ref>.</note> at breakfast; that there would be no more chances to the Post office. But could you not send to Gosport in case of necessity asked M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> M, &#x201C;Well&#x2014;in a case of life and Death I might, said Miss B but for nothing short of that.&#x201C;</p>
<p>So&#x2014;there was no more to be done as I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not have <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> to Gosport even if it had been but &#x201C;a mile and half&#x2014;&#x201C; as you say, instead, of 2 and a &#xBD;</p>
<p>I got thro my journey much better than could have been expected; having <hi rend="italic">slept,</hi> even <hi rend="italic">soundly</hi> (mercifully!) just the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night before leaving.&#x2014; A fat, old, <hi rend="italic">real</hi> Lady in the carriage opposite me, paid me &#x201C;delicate attentions,&#x201C; lent me her smelling bottle, <hi rend="italic">gave</hi> me her nosegay, put her dressing-case under my feet! &#x26;c &#x26;c having commenced acquaintance by asking &#x201C;have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> been poorly <hi rend="italic">long?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; When she changed trains at Bishopstoke,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bishopstoke, railway junction 5 mi. NE of Southampton, Hampshire.</note> she looked over her shoulder to say, &#x201C;I sincerely hope you may soon be better Mam&#x201C;! How differently one&#x2019;s looks impress different people! The man who drove me from the station, (and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">chaarged</hi>&#x2019; three and sixpence!) evidently took me for <hi rend="italic">well enough</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">going to service</hi> at Bay House; for he turned round so soon as we passed thro the gate, to ask &#x201C;Was he to drive round to the back door?&#x201C; and then the footman who received me took me for <hi rend="italic">deaf!!</hi> coming close up to me, when he had any thing to say, and <hi rend="italic">shouting</hi> it&#x2014;into my ear!! <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was the only person I saw for three hours after my arrival! The &#x201C;Miss Barings out walking&#x201C; &#x201C;would I wish to be shown my room?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Certainly&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;would I wish any refreshment?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes&#x2014;a cup of tea&#x201C;&#x2014; It was brought, and then all lapsed into the profoundest silence! I could have fancied a pleasanter reception&#x2014;at the same time &#x201C;it was coostom in part&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; &#x201C; &#x2018;Why are these mills going to-day?&#x2019; (<hi rend="italic">Sunday,</hi> in Cumberland.)

<p><pb id="pg-34-92" n="34:92"/>Having had lots of time to unpack, and dress myself, I was first in the drawing room before dinner&#x2014; A gentleman came in, whom I liked the look of&#x2014;but no word passed between us&#x2014;then M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay came&#x2014;and finally my Hostess, who assured me she was &#x201C;delighted to see me&#x201C;! and so I was installed! Another Lady entered, with Emily,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emily Baring.</note> whom I recognised as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Frederick Baring, and the Gentleman was Frederick Baring!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederica Mary Catherine and Frederick Baring, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sister-in-law and brother.</note> whom I had never seen before, and of whom I had got the most absurdly unjust impression. Both he and his wife are kindly, unaffected, sensible people&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> indeed strikes me as quite a <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> man&#x2014; I had a good deal of talk with him yesterday and am sorry he is gone today. His wife went with him&#x2014;so there is now only M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay and her son<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herbert Alexander Mildmay.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The railway journey made me so sleepy that I could hardly keep my eyes open till I got to bed! and in bed I slept in a wonderful manner!&#x2014;my room is the same where I lay three days in a sore throat<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had been ill at Bay House in <date when="1847-01-00">Jan. 1847</date>; see <sic>21:149&#x2013;50, 151&#x2013;52, and 154&#x2013;55</sic><corr><ref target="volume-21/lt-18470128-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1847-01-28">28 Jan.</date>]</ref>, <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470202-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [<date when="1847-02-02">2 Feb.</date>?]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470205-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, [<date when="1847-02-05">5 Feb. 1847</date>]</ref></corr>.</note>&#x2014; and the boy &#x201C;Jack&#x201C; had to bring in my breakfast! But no associations could keep me long awake that night!&#x2014; certainly if pure air and quiet and wholesome food and freedom from all &#x201C;cares&#x201C; but of <hi rend="italic">dressing</hi> oneself can cure me; I shall be cured&#x2014;in a few days!</p>
<p>It is Louisa Baring who is &#x201C;my sister&#x201C; that goes with Lord Ashburton to Scotland on Monday; I thought if Emily was going somewhere too, I might be wished to go away in less time than a week, and at all events living on in that sort of fear of overstaying ones welcome is very disagreeable&#x2014; So I thought I had best go frankly to the end of it at once&#x2014; I said to Emily when we were walking this morning, that I had meant to stay till the end of this week; but as Miss Baring was leaving the place so soon as Monday, perhaps it would be more convenient that I should go on an earlier day? would she kindly tell me?&#x2014; Emily protested against my going this week&#x2014; She and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay are to be here till the 24<hi rend="italic">th&#x2014;</hi>and I &#x201C;had better stay over next week&#x201C; The invitation was given with cordiality enough to make me feel quite at ease for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week anyhow&#x2014;the rest will disclose it self!&#x2014; The Baring manner is naturally so shy and so cold that I dare say one may easily <hi rend="italic">under</hi>rate the kindness of feeling which accompanies it.</p>
<p>My second nights sleep was not equal to the first, but, still, better than <hi rend="italic">usual&#x2014;</hi>and I feel less sensitive about the throat and breast&#x2014;indeed I have not coughed a twentieth part, these two evenings, of what I carried on in London, when obliged to talk.</p>
<p>I am going with the others for a drive&#x2014; So good by</p>

<p><salute>Alas, my Dear,</salute> I have got nothing this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> either; my expectation was confidence itself, and there has not the least word come from you! I try not to give way to fancies, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a kind of problem too, here in this vacancy; but I am terribly in want of news from you. Yesterday, when it was too late, I bethought me of examining the Newspaper <hi rend="italic">Cover</hi> more strictly; it might have a date, a postmark of <hi rend="italic">place</hi> (who knew but &#x201C;Alverstoke&#x201C;!) upon it:&#x2014;alas, I found it had been already <hi rend="italic">crumpled</hi> as useless, and I myself had assisted in helping it to kindle the fire: whether it was posted <hi rend="italic">before</hi> your departure as I had at first guessed, or <hi rend="italic">after</hi> your arrival as I now wanted to guess, there was henceforth no saying! Of course you wrote, I do not surmise neglect on your poor part: probably the Rowland Hill is alone to blame; his rapid posts, wh<hi rend="italic">h might</hi> so easily take in London-Scotland, do not, I suppose; but bring your letter to Annan <hi rend="italic">at night&#x2014;</hi>that is, detain it from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for a 24 hours more! I must have patience: let me hope again on &#x201C;tomorrow morning,&#x201C; in this place of Hope!&#x2014; If only the news be <hi rend="italic">good:</hi> but alas who can promise me that? Write at any rate; be diligent in writing, at least a word or two. This new quirk of the posts, I fear, has thrown you twice as far away from me. But we will hope!</p>
<p>No Letter came at all (if I had been wanting other Letters) but one from Foxton, answering that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is ready for the German Journey; most ready, but a dyspeptic, rheumatic &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;who in fact seems to me questionable for the job. Happily I have him quite loose. Indeed the whole Enterprise is yet <hi rend="italic">loose,</hi> as water; cannot be fastened at all, till I hear about L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton and his Yacht, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> cannot well be before this week end. After that I must perforce make some decision. My life here is growing to seem little better than a nightmare Sleep to me: yet I shudder at the German Hurlyburly, and only Conscience is emphatic upon it. On the 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> you <hi rend="italic">decide</hi> on your little project: write to me that same day what your decision is: I shall then have pretty much the whole matter before me.</p>
<p>Yesterday a threatening of rain attended me angrily thro&#x2019; all my ride,&#x2014;which nevertheless I persisted in to the utmost length:&#x2014;after dinner the rain <pb id="pg-34-94" n="34:94"/>came; battered along all night; I sitting within, quiet over B&#xE9;ranger&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Biography,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Jean de B&#xE9;ranger (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), lyric poet and republican activist, <hi rend="italic">Ma biographie: Ouvrage posthume</hi> (Paris, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), trans. as <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of B&#xE9;ranger</hi> (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>). B&#xE9;ranger wrote several collections of <hi rend="italic">Chansons</hi> satirizing both Napoleon (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>) and the Restoration (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>) and was twice imprisoned. The French govt., fearing political disturbances, deployed troops at his funeral, <date when="1857-07-00">July 1857</date>, though the crowds that lined the streets of Paris were silent and respectful.</note> and omitting my walk wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter was a bad clause for the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> that followed! I finished the poor <hi rend="italic">Chansonnier</hi> [balladeer] (a very good Autobiography; perhaps worth sending to you, tho&#x2019; it is a heavy volume): his curious French death and life; his eminently truthful, discerning, loyal and ingenious character, <hi rend="italic">good</hi> every way tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> than I had expected,&#x2014;all was very entertaining to me; and took its place among the confused nonsense I dreamt after ending it. <hi rend="italic">Orlich</hi> is not yet finished,&#x2014;wretched fiddle-diddle of an Orlich! I have other Books too; but that is the dreary book of duty for the present.&#x2014; Craigenputtoch is for <hi rend="italic">Thursday;</hi> Jamie &#x26; I to rendezvous at Cummertrees and do that little feat between noon &#x26; midnight. <closer><salute>God bless thee, Dearest</salute></closer></p>

<p>&#x201C;All right,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561227-JWC-KS-01"><sic>32:63</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1856-12-27">27 Dec. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> my Dear&#x201C;&#x2014;yes indeed! You have made me a happy man, for this day at least; and neither the damp grey skies with their morning wind, nor any other item, can affect me as yesterday. It is just as I supposed: the <hi rend="italic">evening</hi> post makes you 12 hours farther from Annan, 24 hours farther from The Gill: remember that, at any rate, if you cannot help it. If you have any morning or forenoon post accessible; a post <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> than 4 p.m. or the like: that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> still save Annan and me: but probably there is no chance? Saturday night you always have at any rate.</p>
<p>Oh if the poor soul could but <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> sleeping! But I dare not hope that; the best I look for is some sensible improvement, in that and the adjoined particulars; that I do let myself anticipate; and it will be an infinite relief to me. To think of you coughing and languishing in the foul element of London all this while has poisoned many a fresh breeze for me here. Take care, take care; and do and avoid, according to your very best ability!&#x2014; I do not imagine you need have the least shadow of disturbance about &#x201C;staying too long&#x201C; &#x26;c as <pb id="pg-34-95" n="34:95"/>matters are. <hi rend="italic">Till</hi> &#x201C;the 24<hi rend="italic">th,</hi>&#x201C; if you could stay so long, it is inconceivable to me that such a <hi rend="italic">canty</hi> little <hi rend="italic">gleg</hi> phenomenon sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be worth its keep ten times over, in an Establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> so circumstanced. The very sight of you, and changes of your physiognomy, even tho&#x2019; you did not speak at all,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> pray do not too much! You may safely dismiss all that part of your account as a thing settled. Think of that no more. Who is the &#x201C;Mrs Mildmay&#x201C; that has &#x201C;a son&#x201C;?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Mildmay; her son was Herbert Alexander Mildmay.</note> Not &#x201C;Geraldine&#x2019;s&#x201C; mother!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Mary Buckley, b.

Perhaps it was his being doomed to Parsonhood,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Baring was rector of Itchinstoke, Hampshire, nr. The Grange.</note> and a life of Donothing Hypocrisy that was alone the marring of him, so far as marred. I am rather sorry he is gone. But for the rest, the <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi> the better. Don&#x2019;t look out after 5 or 6 o&#x2019;clock by any means! The evenings are decidedly cold. As to the mornings&#x2014;for example, it was a furious <hi rend="italic">drumming on the window</hi> that awoke me this morning: one small robin (I perceived) who had already looked in upon human habitabilities, and could not (for the glass) quite see his way out again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last night I made a long stretch of walking; solitary, sombre, not ugly, under the inarticulate winds. A long shore ride I had had too,&#x2014;dromedary much astonished at the wonders of nature.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>I wish I could provoke you to write me a little Note about what you are doing, and how going on. One definite glimpse I had, thro&#x2019; Lord Ashburton last week: you were &#x201C;better again, and out at Addiscombe,&#x201C; he just going to <pb id="pg-34-96" n="34:96"/>join you,&#x2014;he did not say whether you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> continue long. Nor in fact have I heard at all as I wanted: my poor Wife has been so extremely weak all this while; unable to keep my small circle present to me in such measure as she was wont.</p>
<p>Of myself and my history I can say nothing; said &#x201C;history&#x201C; having been literally <hi rend="italic">zero:</hi> &#x201C;six weeks of nightmare sleep,&#x201C; as I sometimes define it. I have ridden extensively on the waste Solway sands; thro&#x2019; old Scottish lanes, and wildernesses, full of old meaning to me: I have in general said nothing; felt and remembered only too many things. Some tolerable Books I had;&#x2014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> let me recommend two if you don&#x2019;t know them otherwise: <hi rend="italic">Tourgueneff: Sc&#xE8;nes de la Vie Russe</hi> &#x26; his <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs d&#x2019;un Chasseur</hi> (both full of Russian novelties, and both by a man of real faculty &#x26; worth),&#x2014;and see that you get the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> Translation (that is the <hi rend="italic">last,</hi> just published)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;cits d&#x2019;un chasseur</hi> (Paris, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), trans. from the Russian by H. Delaveau.</note> of these <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs,</hi> for there is a wrong one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires d&#x2019;un seigneur russe</hi> (Paris, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), trans. Ernest Charri&#xE8;re.</note> I also liked B&#xE9;ranger&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Ma Biographie;</hi> and Mignet&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Marie Stuart</hi> (so far as I have gone): but these two you probably know already.</p>
<p>I am speculating now about a run to Germany: four weeks, to see the Battle<hi rend="italic">fields</hi> (at least) of an unfortunate King Fritz fallen to me unfortunate! But it is quite uncertain whether I dare undertake such an adventure,&#x2014;with the horrible remembrance of <hi rend="italic">Trough</hi>-beds<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520909-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:274</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-09">9 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26; German <hi rend="italic">Etceteras</hi> still so vivid in me! So soon as the weather is cool enough, I hope to be back in London,&#x2014;and that you will perhaps be in Grosvenor Square<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich lived at 46 Grosvenor Sq.</note> again, accessible in the solitary season?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last time I quitted these parts it was on a certain <hi rend="italic">Highland</hi> Journey:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s journey to Kinlochluichart, the Ashburtons&#x2019; highland estate, nr. Dingwall, <date when="1856-08-00">Aug. 1856</date>. It was the last time he stayed with the Ashburtons before the death, <date when="1857-05-00">May 1857</date>, of Lady Harriet Ashburton, Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s da.</note> a thing never to be forgotten by me; nor ever to be repeated, I believe!&#x2014; We have to take what a Higher is pleased to appoint, in all things; and be silent,&#x2014;not forbidden to <hi rend="italic">hope.</hi> God bless you, dear Lady; and strengthen you for all the loads you have to bear.</p>
<p>I end by asking a little Note from you, the first day you have leisure. <closer><salute>Yours every truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>All right Dear! I get along very nicely! only the letter at breakfast is missing! What should have come, in London, at nine o&#x2019;clock, comes, here, at five p m&#x2014;an hour too, when one is generally out driving!&#x2014; But, for the rest, I have not a single thing to complain of; and I agree with the place famously. I get a fair amount of sleep, am much less sensitive about the throat and breast, much less <hi rend="italic">shivery</hi> in mind, and unless the <hi rend="italic">glass</hi> here is made to flatter, my face is much less haggard and ghastly, I could not but think this morning when I took a last look at myself in my new grey gown, and smart lilac cap, that I looked a decidedly presentable woman&#x2014;for my years!&#x2014; Not at all the same &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">seedy Party</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilie Hawkes&#x2019;s description of JWC; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date>]</ref>.</note> that Fairie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie.</note> was lyrically recognising only a week ago, as &#x201C;the most decided case of <hi rend="italic">needing to go out of Town,</hi> that was ever seen&#x201C;! To be sure the Howell &#x26; James dressmaker,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Howell, James &#x26; Co., muslin warehouse and haberdashers, 5, 7, and 9 Regent St.</note> seeing the necessities of the case, had <hi rend="italic">padded</hi> the new gown in a very artistic manner&#x2014;&#x201C;chiefly <hi rend="italic">wadding</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle!&#x201C;&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> it wasn&#x2019;t, who had added the touch of human colour to my face.</p>
<p>Besides the benefit to my health, I am very well situated in moral respects The only visitors besides myself, (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay and her Son), whom she calls &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Light of our Soul,</hi>&#x201C; are good humoured lively people And the Miss Barings, without seeming to take any <hi rend="italic">pains</hi> to be kind to me, contrive to make me feel quite <hi rend="italic">at home.</hi> They are not at all <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> in their own house, only <hi rend="italic">rational&#x2014;</hi>occupying themselves in some work, or some reading, or some conversation, and expecting the visitors to do likewise. In fact I feel as if I had sat down to rest a while in a little green <hi rend="italic">clearing;</hi> after struggling till I was exhausted thro a tangled wood, <hi rend="italic">getting</hi> myself scratched and torn! As you <hi rend="italic">did</hi> write to Miss Baring before (she has never spoken of <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">I</hi>) perhaps it might be well to send her <hi rend="italic">now</hi> a few lines of thanks for making me so comfortable.</p>
<p>I went yesterday with the Mildmays on board <hi rend="italic">The Urgent,</hi> in Portsmouth Harbour. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> M wished to see the Cabin in which <hi rend="italic">Light of our Soul</hi> is about to sail to Malta &#x201C;The sky was so blue!&#x201C; and &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> was so green! and I was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sick,&#x201C; and it was <hi rend="italic">a good joy!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:167</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept. 1838</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> Only I got a touch or two of brown paint on the new gown!&#x2014;</p>

<p>You need not ask whether I am delighted with the second despatch, received this morning! I hoped always a taste of the country might at once do you good; and see, has it not? You look to be a new woman; and have even had a &#x201C;good joy,&#x201C; larking on a Man of War. Pray Heaven only that it continue! I hope you are deciding this day that the country is beneficial,&#x2014;&#x26; practically that you will and can undertake the Landhall adventure.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Janet Pringle at Lann Hall.</note> Pity only that I cannot hear of that till Monday morning; so remiss is Rowland Hill in some points notwithstanding his impetuous velocity concentrated upon others. The Letter which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot get at breakfast is lying safe in London from 4 a.m; and he cannot get it 90 miles farther for 13 hours! He is, by all symptoms, an ostentatious person, and quack proper, working only for applause of the Newspapers, which I can define to him as a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bad</hi> joy&#x201C; in the long run.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Craigenputtoch expedition was achieved.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC joined his brother James on the train to Dumfries at Cummertrees; they traveled the rest of the way by gig; Craigenputtoch, which was about 25 mi. from The Gill.</note> Battering showers attended us (from Irongray Kirk neighbourhood to Sunday Well,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Irongray, about 4 mi.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I have written to the Dumfries Banker<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson, manager of the British Linen Bank, Dumfries.</note> to complete that matter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton&#x2019;s bequest to TC.</note> in the good way you prescribe. It is finished therefore. Amen, Amen.&#x2014;</p>
<p>The way to hit me here is, To take the morning mail train <hi rend="italic">for Carlisle;</hi> 9.15 a.m. from Euston Square: by Crewe, Lancaster &#x26;c,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the London and North Western Railway.

If intending <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> for Glasgow, one sits still, at this Carlisle Station; one is pushed along again, in 5 or 10 minutes, by the same Carriages (I think), called now of &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Line.</hi>&#x201C; But you, who intend by Ayrshire, you step out; get a new Ticket, for <hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi> (&#x201C;Glasgow and South-Western,&#x201C; they call the line, but you need not <hi rend="italic">recollect</hi> it, only recollect &#x201C;Dumfries&#x201C;): 3 or 4 minutes after the Caledonian is gone, you also start (7.10 p.m.); for some miles by the same train of rails; but at Crossing of Sark or near it, you branch off to the right;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Caledonian Railway main line from Carlisle crosses the river Sark on the border with Scotland just S of Gretna, and immediately reaches the junction with the Glasgow and South Western main line, which runs (left not right) to Annan and Dumfries, then through Ayrshire to Kilmarnock and Glasgow.</note> go thro&#x2019; Annan, a brisk little Town, getting fast <hi rend="italic">ruined</hi> by these vehicles of yours<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained; perhaps Lord Ashburton had shares in the railways.</note> (glance back at the place, for the sake of many sore young school days I passed there);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC attended Annan Academy, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809-00-00">9</date>.</note>&#x2014;and at 8.30 you are in Dumfries, where the train <hi rend="italic">stops</hi> for that night. It is usually a nice quiet little thing, often a carriage all to yourself; &#x26; goes charmingly. At Dumfries I hope to be in waiting.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-103" n="34:103"/>There are good enough inns in the place; and I can <hi rend="italic">prophecy</hi> you a few hours beforehand at the one I hear to be the comfortablest. <hi rend="italic">Prince Charlie&#x2019;s</hi> (&#x201C;Commercial Inn&#x201C;)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Commercial Inn (now the County Hotel), High St., Dumfries; Charles Edward Stuart (<date when="1720-00-00">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>; <ref target="volume-34/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5145"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the Young Pretender, retreating N after having reached Derby with his troops in the second Jacobite rising, used it as his headquarters for three days, <date when="1745-12-00">Dec. 1745</date>.</note> where he lodged in <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date> with the Duke of Cumberland pursuing<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Augustus, duke of Cumberland (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">65</date>), commander of the British army pursuing the Jacobites from <date when="1745-11-00">Nov. 1745</date> until after the final defeat at Culloden, <date when="1746-04-00">April 1746</date>.</note> is still, to my own knowledge, or used to be, a tolerable place;&#x2014;but we are not tied to Antiquarian Considerations. King&#x2019;s Arms<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The King&#x2019;s Arms Inn, High St., Dumfries.</note> is the chief Inn best or not.</p>
<p>We might have a pleasant drive along the Hill sides (especially if the weather were fair) next day,&#x2014;and about, till 4&#xBD; p.m.; at which time you must go for Glasgow;&#x2014;and may have the house warmed there for Miss Baring and Rous,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring and Dr. James Rouse.</note> if they go by the mail train of <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> morning. I think that would do very well. If you like it, write one word, any time before 5 p.m. of <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> (tomorrow when you get this): it will reach me here on Monday morning; and send me off at a nice pace to Dumfries.</p>
<p>Miss Baring has been very good to my Wife, who writes to me already a much improved creature by these 4 days at Bay House.</p>

<p>To be sure I might go into <hi rend="italic">lodgings</hi> nearer hand&#x2014;but horrible is the thought to me! and in lodgings I should have the cares of bread! One of the reasons I eat so heartily here is, that I have had no fore thought about the thing set before me! Eating the dinner one has ordered oneself, is to a sick person as ungrateful as wearing the gown one has made oneself is to an inexpert sewer!</p>
<p>So please dont think me crazy! and above all dont fetter yourself with me the least in the world.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin</salute>
<p>Will you give my Charlotte the half-sovereign on Saturday&#x2014;I am not coming for some time yet. The place suits me famously! and already I both feel and look quite different from the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Seedy Party</hi>&#x201C; that took leave of you at Chelsea! I get some <hi rend="italic">human</hi> sleep here, and no longer <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> at all in the <hi rend="italic">evening,</hi> and very little at any time. I have a long drive in an open carriage every day; and every day eat <hi rend="italic">two</hi> dinners!&#x2014;one at half after one, and the second at eight! this system answers perfectly!</p>
<p>But oh M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin!&#x2014;my watch!&#x2014; If it didn&#x2019;t go and stop, at a quarter to <pb id="pg-34-106" n="34:106"/>five, the very first morning!&#x2014; I tried every persuasion to make it go on again, but beyond <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> it positively would not go!&#x2014; I now for the first time see the sense of those Great <hi rend="italic">Bells</hi> which make such a devil of a row in aristocratic Houses. They are in aid of visitors whose watches refuse to go! If it were&#x2019;nt for &#x2018;the getting up Bell,&#x2019; and &#x2018;the breakfast Bell,&#x2019; and &#x2018;the servants&#x2019; dinner-Bell,&#x2019; and &#x2018;the Lunch Bell,&#x2019; and &#x2018;the dressing-Bell,&#x2019; and &#x2018;the dinner Bell,&#x2019; I dont know what would become of me! for to <hi rend="italic">tell the time</hi> by <hi rend="italic">feeling,</hi> in a strange house thrown loose from ones home habits and occupations is quite beyond me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin recalled: &#x201C;Reading this pleasant little letter, at once suggested to me to give her an equally pleasant surprise in return. So I wound up my own watch, packed it carefully in wadding in a little box, put the key inside, and upon the watch a slip of paper on which I had written, &#x2018;Please wind me up!&#x2019; This I posted, together with a letter; picturing to myself what her surprise would be, but little thinking how deeply she would feel such a simple act of playful goodwill&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 56).</note></p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is still in the vague about Germany. His going will depend, I think, on Lord Ashburtons success in looking up &#x201C;a man with a yacht&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I had a fine sail in Portsmouth Harbour the other day, and went on board The <hi rend="italic">Urgent,</hi> and got to <hi rend="italic">splatches</hi> (scotch) of brown paint on my new dress!&#x2014;There are <hi rend="italic">Forts</hi> here,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fort Blockhouse, built over many centuries; Fort Victoria, built <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; Fort Albert, built <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; Fort Freshwater Redoubt, built <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>; Fort Gomer, built <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>; and Fort Lumps, built <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>.

<p>There then! I have gone and done it! and if you find it strange&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi> of me; blame <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> young woman! It is all along of your stinginess in writing to me, while I was so many weeks ill and alone, and your not seeming the least <hi rend="italic">curious</hi> whether I was coming or not, the summer meanwhile passing away&#x2014;all along of this <hi rend="italic">unnaturalness</hi> on your part, that I have gone and been so <pb id="pg-34-107" n="34:107"/>unnatural as to tell M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that I was coming, and to engage to go straight to <hi rend="italic">her!!</hi> Now! what do you think my Dear??&#x2014; I have no purpose, however to be &#x201C;off with the old love, before I am on with the new.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverb; quot. by Mme.

So I seriously intend, <hi rend="italic">calling upon you</hi>(!!) altho&#x2019; upon my honour, with your long silences when I was so needing to be written to, you have made me doubt whether you care for seeing me in reality or not! We shall see! I can swear to it, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> care very much for seeing <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> at all rates! and that I should be hard to persuade, and very sorry to be persuaded, that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">new</hi> friendship for me is warmer than your <hi rend="italic">old</hi> friendship; altho&#x2019; she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">shown</hi> more interest about my coming, and indeed supplied the <hi rend="italic">courage</hi> that was wanting to me by all sorts of promises held out&#x2014;even the promise of &#x201C;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell to bring me round&#x201C; if I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be knocked up by the journey.</p>
<p>I have been here with the Miss Barings (Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sisters) for the last ten days and remain till the 24<hi rend="italic">th.</hi> As soon after my return to London as I can manage it, I mean to start for Dumfriesshire. I had no such thought&#x2014;at least only in the form of &#x201C;a devout imagination,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">On Heroes</hi> 130 and 325.</note>&#x2014;when I came away. But the journey did me so much good, and I have been such an improved woman ever since&#x2014;so unrecognisable as the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">seedy Party</hi>&#x201C; (so a Lady described me) that I was for a long time back in London; that I think it would be stupid not to take <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of the country; and spend my time as pleasantly as I can; while M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is still out of harness. I dont think he will be returning to London till the end of September and September is often a fine month in Scotland&#x2014;so since I have got up my strength enough for a journey to Scotland (taking it in two halves) I see no reason why I should remain &#x201C;like owl in desert&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 102:6.</note> on the banks of that horrid Thames,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the stench of the Thames, see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580617-TC-JF-01"><sic>33:242&#x2013;43</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1858-06-17">17 June</date></corr></ref>.</note> waiting M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s return. I had some idea of going from here on the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to Sherborne House in Dorsetshire, where I had a pressing invitation from Macready (the actor)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macready wrote to JWC, <date when="1858-08-11">11 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Do, let us depend upon seeing you: I have not many happinesses left in life, but this would be <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> one.&#x201C;</note> a family I have long been much attached to: But in that case I should have made myself quite too late for Scotland, and while I was wavering between the two directions, exactly at the right moment, came M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle&#x2019;s last letter, giving me the <hi rend="italic">push</hi> I needed towards the north! So I shall go straight to London on the 24<hi rend="italic">th&#x2014;</hi>and then&#x2014;!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am in no haste to be gone from here. It is the place of all others to get strong at&#x2014;close by the sea&#x2014;nothing between me and the sea <pb id="pg-34-108" n="34:108"/>but a lawn, a terrace walk, and a little fringe of <hi rend="italic">scotch</hi> firs. then such a lofty airy house, with such beautiful grounds; long drives in an open carriage every day, <hi rend="italic">sails</hi> too in the Bay<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bay House overlooked Stokes Bay.</note> when I like! quiet, kind, clever people to live with. What more could one wish to have? But one likes and feels grateful to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> place where one sleeps, better, and eats better, and feels less weak and miserable! I have not been so <hi rend="italic">well</hi> for ten months as since I came here&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; I dont expect I have got over my tendency to catch cold, and to spend my life, nine tenths of it, in having cold; I am unspeakably thankful for the present respite. and am as anxious to prolong it a few weeks as if it were a question of good health for all the rest of my life!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is still at <hi rend="italic">The gill&#x2014;</hi>beginning to weary of it I think&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh there is the carriage come round! and the rest are all ready</p>
<p>&#x2014;No! a false alarm it was only a Butcher&#x2019;s cart!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was going to say I think M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is tiring; for Lord Ashburton told me he had written to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> requiring him to find &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a man with a yacht</hi>&#x201C; to take him to the Baltic Sea&#x2014;on his way to Germany! Perhaps Lord A who was to have a meeting with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C this evening at Dumfries, may persuade him, in defect of the yacht to follow <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to the Highlands.</p>
<p>I have written to tell him not to tramell himself in the least with <hi rend="italic">me&#x2014;</hi>and that is all I have to do with it. He tells me he saw my Aunt Ann in Dumfries&#x2014;If she is at Thornhill by now, give her my love and I say I hope to come accross her&#x2014;</p>

<p>Thank Heaven for such news; Oh my poor little woman, what a relief and comfort to me! Rowland the Charlatan has kept it at Annan since Saturday night; but here it is this morning, all the welcomer when it comes.</p>
<p>Never mind Cheyne Row, or <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> never mind &#x201C;expense,&#x201C; at any rate: no amount of &#x201C;expense&#x201C; but will be cheap to me if it can do my poor Jeannie the least good. What a pity we had not tried you with the country months ago; you might have been in far better ease, by this time, than by haggling on with the miseries of broiling and tumultuous London. Landhall is clearly the best for <pb id="pg-34-109" n="34:109"/>you: I, if I go to Germany at all, must be off thither before you end Bay House: but that only leaves you more at liberty: according <hi rend="italic">as you report,</hi> I could make thither, or direct for Chelsea, after accomplishing my little German feat. The Yes or the No of that must be decided now in a day or two: after sight of Lord Ashburton (this night, as you will see!) I shall have the whole of the facts before me. <hi rend="italic">Then</hi> must a decision come. I am to be off to Dumfries to meet that erratic Peer of the Realm in about &#xBE; of an hour hence; and have my dinner to eat withal!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John is on the road to London today; express Train scouring along; will meet Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> about Preston perhaps! He undertakes to get my Passport <hi rend="italic">vis&#xE9;</hi>-ed at London; puts one of his &#x201C;poor Boys&#x201C; into Woolwich Seminary;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Watt, John Carlyle&#x2019;s stepson, who became an officer in the Dragoons.

He was here yesterday with Jamie taking leave; a dreary kind of day for me in the furious heat.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if there be time after <hi rend="italic">parting</hi> with Lord <hi rend="italic">An,</hi> I will write you a word from Dumfries. Pray Heaven there be a word of news from you when I get home hither, at 11 the same night! It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been more comfortable to the natural man to have lain and slept here <hi rend="italic">without</hi> stirring? I have been in the sea, an hour ago (for the first time), a very nice bathe; but it has made me <hi rend="italic">sleepy,</hi> indisposed for locomotion altogether. The Adamsons<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert and Ann Adamson.</note> announce that they may have <hi rend="italic">found</hi> me a Craigenputtoch <hi rend="italic">wood</hi>man;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Preacher; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580810-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1858-08-10">10 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> that &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short, it is better I go. Off therefore,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the heat is again excessive.</p>
<p>A terrible affair befel in this neighbourhood on Friday last; just after my last Letter went away. The Marquis of Queensberry, a flourishing man in the flower of his age, but much haunted by the demons it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem, went out into his Park<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinmount.</note> with a gun in his hand, 4&#x2013;5 p.m.; and was bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> home, about 5, shot thro&#x2019; the heart,&#x2014;all silently surmise, by his own hand!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald William Douglas, 8th marquess of Queensberry. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported that Lord Queensberry had &#x201C;shot himself by accident&#x201C;; &#x201C;in excellent spirits,&#x201C; he had told his da. &#x201C;he was going out to shoot rabbits.&#x201C; Later his cousins had gone looking for him and discovered his dead body: &#x201C;The gun, a double-barrelled one, was found lying by his side, one of the barrels empty; and it is supposed that when loading the emptied barrel the piece had unexpectedly gone off and caused instant death&#x201C; (<date when="1858-08-10">10 Aug.</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> obituary (<date when="1858-08-16">16 Aug.</date>; from the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Standard</hi>) also described his death as accidental. G. E.

<p>How curious if Lord A be at this moment on the road to Dumfries! Miss Baring started an hour ago in full assurance of finding him waiting to go with her tomorrow. Not one word has been received from him since they parted in London, on the understanding they were to go north <hi rend="italic">together</hi> on the 10<hi rend="italic">th!</hi> And I thought it best to say nothing of your news that he was to be at Dumfries on the 9<hi rend="italic">th!</hi> She might have felt mortified at the new arrangement being communicated thro only <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> and nervous about what would await her in London. Rousse no doubt will smooth all down! But what an odd man Lord A is! I hope it will come off all right the meeting at Dumfries; and that it will enliven you for some days. Perhaps he will persuade you to go to Loch Luichart? Miss Baring is most anxious you should come! By the way, please to send the remaining volume of Tourgenef<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Sc&#xE8;nes de la vie russe</hi>; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580729-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-29">29 July</date></ref>.</note> to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> She has taken the others, &#x26; fears there will be great dearth of literature in the Highlands.</p>
<p>I felt quite sorry to see her drive off this morning. She has really been most kind to me, and took leave of me quite affectionately. &#x201C;Now that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> found <pb id="pg-34-111" n="34:111"/>my way to them; she hoped I would never be so hard to persuade here again?&#x201C; We are now reduced to three; but Bingham Mildmay<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Bingham St. John Mildmay, nephew of Lord Ashburton and of Louisa and Emily Baring, as well as of Mary Mildmay, who was still at Bay House.</note> is expected.

But there are some two thousand soldiers in these tents. Near it, there is a most beautiful new Fort abuilding<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fort Brockhurst, built <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>.</note>&#x2014;the Guns of which, if they ever come into action, will smash <hi rend="italic">right thro</hi> Bay House!</p>
<p>On Saturday we left for <hi rend="italic">the Island</hi> at eleven and did not return till six. Emily M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay and I. At Ride<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ryde, coastal town on the Isle of Wight, 3 mi.

<dateline>Bay House Alverstoke / Hants Monday [<date when="1858-08-09">9 August 1858</date>]</dateline>
<p>Oh thank you dear Lady Sandwich! Your letter is so welcome! I was wishing to hear from you, and did not like to ask you to write, lest you should find it a bother, and do it nevertheless out of politeness; and I was wishing to explain what had kept me from going to see you in London, to deliver M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s farewell greetings which he had charged me with three times over. But I did not like to do that either, lest you should think it too superfluous, accounting for the nonappearance of anything like <hi rend="italic">me!</hi></p>
<p>Now, encouraged by your kind recollection, I <hi rend="italic">may</hi> tell you, that three days after M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s departure I caught a fresh cold, in going to look at a cottage at Rottingdean<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580701-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-01">1 July</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; and was laid up all alone at Cheyne Row for a month; more like <hi rend="italic">dying</hi> in fact than I had yet been! A <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> Lady<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilie Hawkes; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580709-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-09">9 July</date>].</ref></note> of my friends told me she had &#x201C;never set eyes on a more <hi rend="italic">seedy</hi> looking <hi rend="italic">party</hi>&#x201C;! and various men, who came, <hi rend="italic">kissed</hi> me at parting; which, in the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> state of things, I took to be a clear indication of their conviction that they should never see me again!</p>
<p>Happily for me, the Miss Barings came just before they left town, and seeing me the &#x201C;seedy Party&#x201C; I was; humanity prompted Miss Baring to invite me to Bay House, and afterwards to write and urge me to come. For my nerves were in such a <hi rend="italic">shivery</hi> state that I took a deal of pressing! But I knew, in my inner woman that I was a decided case of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">needing to go out of Town,</hi>&#x2019; in spite of my superficial reluctance and terror. So ten days ago, I shut my eyes, and clenched my teeth, and pitched myself into a railway carriage to Gosport. And actually I was in better health before I was gone ten miles! <hi rend="italic">Here,</hi> I have been flourishing &#x2018;like the green Bay Tree&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Ps. 37:35; see also &#x201C;I have beheld them that were flourishing like the green bay trees, made desolate, and their branches scattered&#x201C; in John Galt, <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Parish, or The Chronicle of Dalmailing</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>) 396.</note>&#x2014;indeed nothing, I should think, can exceed the healthiness of the situation, and of the Life one leads here. I <pb id="pg-34-114" n="34:114"/>stroll by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the multitudinous</hi> sea&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note> and try to get into <hi rend="italic">The Ideal!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:57.</note> but hitherto I have only succeeded in getting to feel singularly hungry and sleepy&#x2014;which conditions were perhaps more needed!</p>
<p>How I wish you were here! I am sure this sea air would refresh you as it does me.</p>
<p>The next thing I wish is that it were possible for me to be in two places at once, and that I could accept your invitation to Addiscombe, without breaking my engagement to stay here till the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> when Emily Baring leaves for Norfolk! I should have liked so very very much dearest Lady Sandwich, to be living alone with you at Addiscombe It would have been like the days of long ago when I stayed there so often alone with <hi rend="italic">Her.</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton.</note> But I am here&#x2014;and to stay till the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> so there&#x2019;s an end of it!</p>
<p>What a very odd man Lord Ashburton is! You tell me He is to be till today at the D of Somersets at Wimbledon;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Adolphus Seymour (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; <ref target="volume-34/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25164"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 12th duke of Somerset, whose estate was at Wimbledon Park, Surrey.</note> and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle writes to me that he is to be with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> this evening at Dumfries!!</p>
<p>Miss Baring went to London today, expecting to find him there, and to accompany him tomorrow to Glasgow, but Lord A told M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C he would leave Dumfries at four on Tuesday, to <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> Miss B and Rouse at Glasgow!! I did not say a word of this Dumfries project to Miss Baring; as I thought it might annoy her to learn it round about thro <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> instead of direct from Lord A&#x2014;who had not written one word since they parted in London, on the understanding they should start for the North together on the 10<hi rend="italic">th&#x2014;</hi></p>
<p>If he has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone to Dumfries this morning&#x2014;my silence will have been doubly <hi rend="italic">discreet&#x2014;</hi></p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Mildmay is here and also stays till the 23<hi rend="italic">d&#x2014;</hi> She is very good humored and lively. She took Emily and me over to The Isle of Wight the other day, to call for certain Mildmays rusticating there, and to show us St Clair the most beautiful little Paradise of&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">geraniums!</hi> ever seen! Colonel Harcourt and Lady Catherine were very civil to me, and I found with them <hi rend="italic">your</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Malcolm whom I did not recognise in her broad brown hat; till she pronounced the name of &#x201C;Lady Sandwich&#x201C; &#x201C;pleasure of meeting us &#x26;c&#x201C;</p>
<p>Oh you never saw such a beautiful gown as <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is, made up! the gown you gave me on Xmas day! I had it made up to come here<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580722-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-22">22 July</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay even, who professes to be a judge <hi rend="italic">in raiment,</hi> said &#x201C;surely it had been made in Paris&#x201C;&#x2014; It fits beautifully, and makes quite a presentable woman of me! I felt, <pb id="pg-34-115" n="34:115"/>the first time I put it on, such a <hi rend="italic">besoin</hi> [need] to go and show myself to you, and ask your blessing!</p>
<p>A carriage has driven up since I began writing&#x2014; Perhaps it is Bingham Mildmay&#x2014;who was to come some day this week&#x2014;</p>
<p>The letters dont go from here but once a day&#x2014;at five&#x2014; I did not get your letter till that hour&#x2014;so I am afraid this wont reach you till the day after tomorrow&#x2014; I never saw such a place for posts!</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Oh, my dear Mr. Larkin</hi>,</salute> upon my honour I all but burst into tears (!) this morning, at your kindness! and I astonished the company at breakfast, by the new views of the world it had given me! It was impossible to keep one&#x2019;s stand on Misanthropy in the face of that watch! &#x2018;Excuse me,&#x2019; said a Lady-visitor to the mistress of the house, who had taxed her with not returning her salutation on entering the room, &#x2018;I was so confounded at hearing <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Carlyle</hi> say, &#x201C;It was a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> world,&#x201C; that I quite forgot myself!&#x2019;</p>
<p>It came to hand <hi rend="italic">going,</hi> the watch! and I wound it up immediately. It gave me such an odd feeling of <hi rend="italic">aliveness,</hi> that ticking away amongst cotton, all along the rail from London to here; I felt inclined to say to it, &#x2018;How do you do? dear little thing,&#x2019; and to expect an articulate answer.</p>
<p>I am all the more thankful for it, that the Bells were no longer to be trusted. On Sunday morning I sat reading, wearying for my breakfast, till a House-maid bounced in with dust-brush and pitcher and the usual &#x26;c.&#x2019;s. I stared, and so did she. &#x2018;It is not time to go down, is it?&#x2019; I asked. &#x2018;Oh yes, Mam, breakfast must be nearly over!&#x2019; &#x2018;But only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Bell has rung yet.&#x2019; &#x2018;Yes, but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was the Breakfast Bell; no Prayer-Bell rings on Sundays!&#x2019; And so I had to go down to reproaches on my laziness, accompanied by the coldest tea and the toughest toast!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I had almost no sleep last night here; but have otherwise been very fortunate and nothing has gone wrong with me. I duly met Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at 8.30 yesternight; walked him about till bedtime; caught him up again this morning (7 a.m.), and went whirling off in a drive round by New Abbey, Lochrutton<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Loch and village, <hi rend="italic">5 1/2</hi> mi. NW of Dumfries.</note> &#x26;c;&#x2014;and fairly set him off for Glasgow about 3 hours ago, where he will arrive a while before Miss Baring &#x26; Rouse.

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I am well this morning, after a good sleep had, and a good letter from you (with your excellent news, the chief comfort I have): nothing is wrong,&#x2014;except the total want of repose, visible especially for some hours to come! The two Scotsbrig Boys are come (Jamie home from Glasgow just now) &#x201C;to see their uncle&#x201C; for-sooth, and little Jenny between them:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James, John, and Janet, James and Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s children.</note> bathing, welcome in these circumstances and in the dreadful heat, lies close at hand too. And Hamburg <hi rend="italic">steaming</hi> &#x26; German voyaging lies <hi rend="italic">close</hi> over the hill besides: No rest for me longer here; no rest, Macbeth can sleep no more!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note></p>
<p>Lord Ashburton &#x26; Miss Baring are steaming thro&#x2019; the Western Sounds this morning, I have little doubt: he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be first in Glasgow yesterday afternoon; and the others w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> join him between 8 &#x26; 9 in the ev<hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Our rencounter did very well as you have heard. It was right of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to say nothing to Miss Baring. I will send the Tourg<hi rend="italic">ff,</hi> and perhaps another little Book or two, this afternoon or tomorrow. What nice voyaging you have to the Island and up and down: right fair blow the winds for you in these same! It has been a lucky trip this to Bay House. Only again I say, Take care, take care!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My stay here, I find, for even <hi rend="italic">dietetic</hi> reasons, must now soon end, if I am wise. It is clear to me I have <hi rend="italic">overdone</hi> rather than otherwise the milk-diet system, and committed excesses in <hi rend="italic">whey.</hi> Ought to end; to change.&#x2014; &#x2014; Lord Ashb<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> report of the <hi rend="italic">Yachts</hi> puts an <hi rend="italic">end</hi> to that part of the speculation: no yacht clearly enough. And yet the voyage itself gloomily demands of me to be done. To be done without delay, therefore; while the days have still some length, while &#x26;c &#x26;c. Alas for the lazy weakly man! But there is no help. Hull steamers are good; but they are as <hi rend="italic">far</hi> off me as London:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hull, port on the E coast of Yorkshire, is 285 mi. SE of Dumfries and 157 mi. N of London.</note> a day or more of railway torture will never do. Newcastle or Leith steamers are bad;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Northumberland, on England&#x2019;s NE coast, 91 mi. from Dumfries; Leith, on the Firth of Forth, nr. Edinburgh, 80 mi. NNE of Dumfries.</note> but they are attainable from Scotsbrig, by 100 miles of rail: them I must put up with,&#x2014;and that soon! Either Tuesday next (17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> 8 p.m.) from Newcastle, or else Saturday following (21st 7 p.m) from Leith,&#x2014;I must be off. That is my pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> tho<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> the best I can form, in my sickly bewilderment &#x26; deep abhorrence, <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> alone imperatively driving me. Neglect no post in writing to me <pb id="pg-34-119" n="34:119"/><hi rend="italic">till</hi> then. I appoint Foxton for Newcastle or at least for Hamburg on those terms. Woe&#x2019;s me, woe&#x2019;s me!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isa. 6:5; Mic. 7:1.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; Bathing <hi rend="italic">has</hi> occurred: at the middle of last page an inexorable notice of the flight of time came: off by Austin in the gig accordingly; and I have had a very nice bathe,&#x2014;if that were the end of it!

<p>Good little Woman! It was a nice thought in you to write to me, and nicely carried into effect!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Charlotte&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1858-08-07">7 Aug.</date>, see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580809-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-08-09">9 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> There was both <hi rend="italic">consideration</hi> and <hi rend="italic">energy</hi> in the small action, and I am glad to see these qualities in my little Woman, as they will be very useful to her in Life; if she give them fair play!</p>
<p>But the penmanship of the letter was never your own surely! It would have been too much modesty to tell me you &#x201C;could not write,&#x201C; if you were up to writing like <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> It might very soon be made into an excellent hand, that! and I shall feel it more than ever incumbent on me, to make you write a little every evening instead of looking out at the upstairs window!</p>
<p>I had a most pleasant letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin, in which he told me all looked right at home, and your door-steps nice and clean! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin must certainly be an angel in man&#x2019;s clothes! I am sure if one stript him he would be found to have beautiful wings!! I told him my watch stopt the day I came, and would not go again! And Imagine! on Monday morning came a small box, registered, which was found to contain a nice, gentleman&#x2019;s watch, <hi rend="italic">going&#x2014;</hi>ticking away like anything, when taken out of the cotton! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin&#x2019;s own watch I dare say, or someone&#x2019;s who needs it for himself. But it is an immense accomodation to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> who am accustomed to look what o&#x2019;clock it is, twenty or thirty times every <hi rend="italic">night!</hi> and who was depending for my knowledge of the time of <hi rend="italic">day,</hi> on a <pb id="pg-34-120" n="34:120"/>great Bell, ten times greater than M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chalmer&#x2019;s;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Chalmer, 4 Cheyne Row.</note> which stunns this house <hi rend="italic">six</hi> times betwixt our getting up and lying down!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Huxham wrote to me a touching effusion about &#x201C;the Bird.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580809-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-08-09">9 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> From which I could only gather <hi rend="italic">this&#x2014;</hi>that if he lived he would live, and if he died he would die! and that meantime he &#x201C;spent whole hours&#x201C; (I should think not very happy ones) in M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Huxham&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bosom</hi>&#x201C;!!&#x2014; I hope he wont expect <hi rend="small-caps">us</hi> to keep him in our <hi rend="italic">bosoms,</hi> when he returns to his anxious family! Nero wouldn&#x2019;t approve of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at all; and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> feelings must always be consulted <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> as the oldest favourite.</p>
<p>I have been several times sailing in Portsmouth harbour, and on board some of the vessels&#x2014;but I have not fallen in with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newnhams son!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Newnham occasionally cooked for the Carlyles; her son, Samuel Richard (b. <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), apparently in the Royal Navy.</note>&#x2014;Perhaps I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> him without knowing it&#x2014; I think &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">The Excellent</hi>&#x2019; <note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Originally built as the <hi rend="italic">Queen</hi> <hi rend="italic">Charlotte</hi> in <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date> at Deptford, she was officially renamed HMS <hi rend="italic">Excellent</hi> in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> and became the Royal Navy&#x2019;s gunnery training ship, permanently moored at Portsmouth.</note> is his ship, and I sailed close by <hi rend="italic">it</hi> yesterday.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is still in Dumfriesshire but thinking of going to Germany soon&#x2014; Lord Ashburton was to spend yesterday with him at Dumfries&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope you mind to <hi rend="italic">water</hi> my little green children; especially the gooseberry bush, the sweet-briar, and the infant <hi rend="italic">tree,</hi> without a name.</p>
<p>I am not coming home this week either, not till the Saturday of next week&#x2014;Miss Baring wants me stay till the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> when she goes herself into Norfolk&#x2014;But I think I will leave, by myself, on the Saturday which will make <hi rend="italic">even</hi> time&#x2014;and my luggage will be so much safer with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> footmen to take charge of it!</p>
<p>I will tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin to give you&#x2014;six more shillings next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>I continue much better in health&#x2014;sleep more like a Christian&#x2014;eat regularly <hi rend="italic">two</hi> dinners, one at half past one, and the other at eight! Cough very little, and am up <hi rend="italic">to</hi> whatever is proposed. But my bonnet ribbons are getting frightfully dirty and my white shawl <hi rend="italic">ditto!</hi> I had to buy galoshes at Portsmouth having forgot my own&#x2014;all good be with you little woman</p>

<p>I return your Proofsheets, after a little inspection. That is certainly a beautiful bit of Psalmody in its kind; a fine pious harmony sounding in it, and good and ingenious ideas, especially one good and greatly true idea, running thro&#x2019; it. The more people that read it, to my notion the better we shall be. But for a great many reasons it will not suit that I should preface it, or appear upon it at all.</p>

<p>This day I can fancy you steaming, in crowded circumstances, towards Inverness; with a fair prospect of reaching your own Mountain Fastness<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinlochluichart.</note> tonight, where silence and civilised sleeping quarters will be very welcome after such a hurlyburly. I send you, by command, a small fraction of Literary Provender:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580809-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-08-09">9 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> may it find you safe, and disposed to enjoy it by and by. Our hot weather has suddenly, last night, broken into extensive thunder, and today all over our world is a downpouring of tepid rain: what is called &#x201C;the Lammas Flood&#x201C; in this country, such a phenomenon being usual in the early part of August. You are not to be discouraged: ply your reading, and hope, &#x201C;the Lammas Flood&#x201C; lasts only a little while, and then there are commonly two months of goodish weather still in store.</p>
<p>You have done a fine feat of hospitality, and really with almost miraculous success, in my Wife&#x2019;s case! Beautifully managed in all points. She writes in <pb id="pg-34-122" n="34:122"/>great terms indeed about Bay House, about the fine unquestionable style of her welcome, about &#x26;c &#x26;c; and in short, has beyond question got a great deal of good of it already. I find also, what was very pretty and right, that you have been entirely <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> as to my small diplomatic movement in the matter. I can only thank you; and say in all points, Well done! Truly you have done me a great favour; and I am much obliged, I for my own behoof.</p>
<p>Within 10 days hence,&#x2014;most likely Saturday 21st,&#x2014;I am off for Hamburg; bent on a small German Tour of four weeks; which is in some sort necessary tho&#x2019; the thought of it is horrible to me. I wish I were well back, and safe in my own bed again,&#x2014;where at least one can lie <hi rend="italic">flat,</hi> and have nobody blowing cowhorns in one&#x2019;s ear to tell what o&#x2019;clock it is!&#x2014; &#x2014; I commend myself to Lord A.; and recollect with great pleasure the morning we had in Dumfries together. May all go well at Loch Luichart, and on the road back. I am always, <closer><salute>Sincerely Yours</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> How little it takes to &#x201C;dash the cup of Fame from one&#x2019;s brow!&#x201C; Yesterday morning being &#x201C;intangled in the details&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520925-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:305</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1852-09-25">25 Sept. 1852</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> of a bit of tough toast (aristocratic toast always <hi rend="italic">is</hi> tough, as you know!) a foreign substance improvised itself in my mouth, which on private investigation proved to be half of a <hi rend="italic">tooth!</hi> Not a front one thanks God!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:209</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-01">1 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> a quite unimportant tooth, back most but one, and useless to eat with these two years! The accident therefore was of the most trivial; but the part of the tooth left in my head was broken in the manner of a <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> and in process of time cut into my tongue! and a miserable day and miserable night were the consequence of this trumpery little misfortune! If I had been within reach of Stokes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Stokes, M.R.C.S., surgeon-dentist, 65 Brook St., Hanover Sq.; see also <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:261</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-06-30">30 June 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> the thing could have been rectified in a minute&#x2014;but I needed to draw inspiration from desperation before I went in search of a <hi rend="italic">file</hi> and proceeded to act upon the tooth myself&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay, who has everything, had the requisite little file&#x2014;and in spite of the pain, I filed down the jagged points, and now I am all right and can speak without my mouth filling with blood!</p>
<p>I am glad the meeting with Lord A came off, and so successfully. But what of the &#x201C;man with a yacht&#x201C;? such a lot of yachts are doing nothing in Portsmouth <pb id="pg-34-123" n="34:123"/>harbour!&#x2014; I have been on board a man of war and shown every corner of it by the Captain. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay hearing me say I had never seen one, immediately recollected that the Captain<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt.

Another day, she stops the carriage on meeting a certain Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Hamilton,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt.

I never saw a more goodnatured woman, or a more lively. She never lets Emily and me stagnate. She was telling us a deal about the Duke of Malakoff our present Russian Ambassador<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amable Jean Jacques P&#xE9;lissier (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), duc de Malakoff, marshal of France; he was made a duke, <date when="1856-07-00">July 1856</date>, by Emperor Napoleon III; French (not Russian) ambassador to Britain, <date when="1858-03-00">March 1858</date> to <date when="1859-05-00">May 1859</date>.</note>&#x2014;a great Bear, and a great Profligate. He was dining in company with Lady Jersey<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Sophia, b.

Je voudrais bien la regardez pres [I would very much like to have a closer view of her]&#x201C;! (I am not sure of my French but you see what I would say) and thereupon he ordered his aid de camp to go, and bring Mademoiselle Skittles to him! A nice commission for a gentleman! which however the aid de Camp felt bound to execute. But Miss Skittles being politely stopt and told the Duke&#x2019;s wish, answered scornfully; &#x201C;say to the old Brute if he wants to see me he may come here&#x201C;! and set off at a gallop!</p>
<p>After all, there never was or will be such a man as Larkin! My watch took to stopping about the time I was leaving town, and I gave it <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to see if any <pb id="pg-34-124" n="34:124"/>thing could be done to it, to keep it going on till there should be time for having it cleaned&#x2014; He brought it back <hi rend="italic">going&#x2014;</hi>having &#x201C;had a touch of oil&#x201C;&#x2014;and it went till the morning after I came here&#x2014;and stopt&#x2014;dead.</p>
<p>I told this to Larkin when writing to him for Charlotte; and the other morning arrived a little box <hi rend="italic">registered</hi> containing a nice little gentleman&#x2019;s watch&#x2014;his own most likely, or somebody&#x2019;s that is inconvenienced by lending it to me! and such a pleasant letter with it&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lady Sandwich, supposing me still at Chelsea, wrote to invite me to Addiscombe.

<p>No news from you today nor yesterday, my little Child: I try to hope all is still going well. Tomorrow there <hi rend="italic">must</hi> a letter come!&#x2014;</p>
<p>All is haste and hurry here since the Post came this morning, with a Letter from Jack; settling that Foxton and I are to meet at Newcastle and embark on Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> next! No man being so learned as our Doctor in the Bradshaws<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bradshaw&#x2019;s Monthly General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide</hi>.</note> foreign and domestic, I had entrusted to him the task of <hi rend="italic">appointing</hi> with Foxton (who was asking <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about Passports &#x26;c &#x26;c): and he has appointed <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> liable still to my <hi rend="italic">refusal;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> however, I have taken good care not to give, but the contrary. My own speculation had been that <hi rend="italic">Leith,</hi> 21st (Saturday 21st) was to be <hi rend="italic">my</hi> place of embarkation; and so I was lounging about with time enough ahead: but, after reflexion, I am forced to admit that &#x201C;Tuesday,&#x201C; and &#x201C;sooner the better,&#x201C; is the real rule of the case; and have written to say so and engage. The anchor is up, then; no more rest or loitering; &#x201C;Yo heave Oh!&#x201C;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> that we may <hi rend="italic">end.</hi> Oh dear, oh dear:&#x2014;but there is no help. Nay I cannot but admit that I have completely finished here; my &#x201C;milk-diet&#x201C; becoming questionable if further continued; and in the middle of next week (days <hi rend="italic">shorter</hi> so much) there must have been precisely what there is in the <pb id="pg-34-125" n="34:125"/>end of this. I had begun to consider, too, that on the 21st I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be perhaps within a few days of a possible sight of <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> Goody dear; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might have tempted me to prolong the thing to the 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> (if that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done for you),&#x2014;and the days are already <hi rend="italic">short</hi> enough! Better as it is, Dear; let me be content and you.</p>
<p>If Foxton and I go right, we <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> Newcastle 8 p.m. Tuesday next; and arrive at Hamburg <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> following: our first stage, a day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">rail</hi>ing thence, must be to Halle or Merseburg<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Towns on the Saale River.</note> (thro&#x2019; Hanover, a stupid country),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At that time an independent kingdom.</note> for the &#x201C;Battle of Rosbach&#x201C;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rossbach, a village where Frederick defeated the French, <date when="1757-11-05">5 Nov. 1757</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:263&#x2013;93; for map of battle of Rossbach, see 17: after 435.</note> and thence on to Dresden, only a 60 or 70 miles, for other <hi rend="italic">items</hi> to right and left. Prag<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prague, town in Silesia (now capital of Czech Republic); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:120&#x2013;46 and map, 17:opp. 223.</note> (100 or 150 miles) comes next: within a week after Prag we may have done with Bohemia and be climbing (in leathern diligences) the <hi rend="italic">Riesengebirge,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain range between Silesia and Bohemia.</note> towards Breslau<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >City in lower Silesia (now Wroclaw in Poland), captured by Frederick, <date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:38&#x2013;44.</note> where also lies about another 4 days or 5; after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we have only Frankfurt on the Oder,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Prussia, where Frederick was defeated by the Austrians and Russians at the battle of Kunersdorf, <date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:58&#x2013;86.</note> with at most two days there; whence home, by Berlin likely, and either by Ostend if for London, or by Hamburg again if for a <hi rend="italic">Scottish</hi> port (Goody needing to be bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> home or the like)&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Ach Himmel,</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> we were well there!&#x2014; &#x2014; I will appoint <hi rend="italic">where</hi> your <hi rend="italic">Postes Restantes</hi> are actually to be: meanwhile if you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> written for tomorrow, and have nothing more to say <hi rend="italic">specially,</hi> let that suffice till you hear again. Your &#x201C;God speed you&#x201C; would be so welcome too:&#x2014;but unless you sent it (perforce) by y<hi rend="italic">r Sunday</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> post, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not find me here on Tuesday <hi rend="italic">morn</hi>g. Do if you can, Dearest; but don&#x2019;t bother to do it!</p>
<p>I am well again; had a grand ride on dromedary yesterday (the first since <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>); a grand walk in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (caught up by a central battery of the <hi rend="italic">thunder</hi> now prevailing,&#x2014;one hour or so of it, 9 p.m., standing plumb up under a hedge and wood near Brow Well, my umbrella running like the dumb-waiter in Trafalgar Square;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> got no hurt, not much of wet, and rejoiced the world by my reemergance here); grand walk, as you see; and had a <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in proportion,&#x2014;w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to Heaven you had but the like of it, poor soul! So that, you see, I start on fair terms; and might easily have been set to sing &#x201C;Yo heave Oh,&#x201C; on worse.&#x2014; Today is Lamb Fair of Lockerby;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580806-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref></note> a great day for Austin <pb id="pg-34-126" n="34:126"/>and certain of the girls;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin, TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law, and some of his eight das.</note> who are tasting of the skyey waters, from time to time, poor souls. Air still hot, sky leaden, and almost no wind yet risen. I got a good bathe on Wedn<hi rend="italic">y;</hi> but that was my last: none yesterday owing to thunder-rains at the time.&#x2014; Jean talks of coming <hi rend="italic">out</hi> tomorrow, with 3 or 4 <hi rend="italic">collars</hi> &#x26; small items I set her to buy: I will make her bring me the necessary <hi rend="italic">money</hi> withal, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a real benefit.</p>
<p>Yesterday the unfortunate Marquis<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The marquess of Queensberry.</note> was buried in Cummertrees Aisle, an immense procession escorting:&#x2014;I rode in the other direction, and saw nothing of it; but Austin was there. A funeral service according to the English form was read in the Kirk (understood to be by the poor old mother&#x2019;s<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah, b.

The astonishment and disappointment I felt on seeing only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> letter on the Hall table at five oclock, and that one in another Handwriting than yours, would have been reasonable <hi rend="italic">perhaps,</hi> if I had not got a letter from you for a week!</p>
<p>Possibly you went to Scotsbrig to see how it looked without &#x201C;the poor Boys&#x201C;!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">very well;</hi> I should expect; an immense improvement on Scotsbrig, in what is become its normal state, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> &#x201C;the poor Boys&#x201C;!&#x2014;But perhaps you didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;and were not well enough to write&#x2014;the handwriting of your last was shaky&#x2014;and the sense a little shaky!&#x2014;were you getting into what you call &#x201C;a bilious crisis&#x201C;? Dear me! I hope I shall hear to day it is all right! My nerves are not so strong yet as I had flattered myself!&#x2014;in spite of all these fine drivings and sailings under the blue sky!</p>
<p>And Foxton! mercy of Heaven! you are actually going to Germany with that comfortless, rheumatic talking man! He will bore you twenty times worse than Newberg! A constant <hi rend="italic">scratching on plaster</hi> going on beside you! Please Heaven that he have an attack of rheumatism to confine him to his sofa till you are clear off! That is the worst I wish him, but I should careless of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> welfare not to wish him that!</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">one</hi> letter that came yesterday was a very bulky one from&#x2014;Percy Hunt!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Percy Bysshe Shelley Leigh Hunt (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1899-00-00">99</date>); see <sic>7:152&#x2013;53 and 13:3</sic><corr><ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May 1834</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410101-TC-HC-01">TC to HC, <date when="1841-01-01">1 Jan. 1841</date></ref></corr>.

<p>Your advice on the new phasis of matters (if all is not already advised) is now expected.

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I snatch a momentary opportunity to say that our <hi rend="italic">sailing orders</hi> are, since yesterday, altered a little; that we do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go from Newcastle on Tuesday, but are to wait five days longer and go from &#x201C;Leith on Saturday 21st at 7 p.m.&#x201C; A shriek of weak but intelligible horror came, yesterday, from Foxton at the sudden date assigned him; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">w</hi>d do it if within possibility,&#x201C; &#x26;c but passionate <pb id="pg-34-129" n="34:129"/>entreating for Leith. Seldom in my life had I a more contemptible forenoon; than debating this utterly obscure and small matter; deciding it, reversing the decision, then re-reversing: finally I settled as you see.&#x2014; Happily I had read my dear little Goody&#x2019;s Letter the <hi rend="italic">first:</hi> that was pretty much all the comfort I had in my despicable burble of a day.&#x2014; A chance of somebody &#x201C;going to the preaching at Annan&#x201C; will get this Scrap into a Post box there, if taken <hi rend="italic">in time:</hi> therefore I write to bring <hi rend="italic">you</hi> back from the false notion I had put you on.</p>
<p>After all, there will be two benefits in this new course of &#x201C;Leith 21st&#x201C;: I shall get my little Prussian Major<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron von Usedom; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580811-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-11">11 Aug.</date></ref></note> <hi rend="italic">warned</hi> more deliberately of my advent to those fields of war,&#x2014;give him a better chance to help me (by <hi rend="italic">Officers</hi> in the neighbourhood &#x26;c);&#x2014;and secondly I shall hear again, and also again, from my own little Goody, and in a more deliberate manner. Thank Heaven.</p>
<p>That tooth; that miserable <hi rend="italic">filing</hi> operation, and the distracting sleepless night:&#x2014;Oh take care!</p>

<dateline>The Gill, near Annan / <date when="1858-08-16">16 Aug<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> 1858</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>Excuse this coarse bit of paper; it is the only one at hand that will consent to be written upon with the perverse materials I have: and my hurry to save the Post is very great.</p>
<p>There is to be a visiting of Fr<hi rend="italic">h&#x2019;s</hi> Battlefields, <hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi> [one way or the other], after all! The enterprise, I confess, seems horrible to me: but a certain uneasy feeling,&#x2014;something connected with literary <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> among other more questionable elements,&#x2014;urges me forward; and it must be done. One Foxton (an acquaintance of Tait&#x2019;s whom you may know) is to start with me from Lieth,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> on Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (21st Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7 p.m.) for Hamburg; where if all prosper we are to be on Monday night (very <hi rend="italic">late,</hi> I suspect); after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> our movement is direct upon <hi rend="italic">Halle</hi> (with intent on Torgau<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town on the Elbe where Frederick defeated the Austrians, <date when="1760-11-03">3 Nov. 1760</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:296&#x2013;330.</note> and on Rosbach from that centre); after which to <hi rend="italic">Dresden,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Prag,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Breslau,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Frankfurt on the Oder;</hi> successive centres, which complete the operation if well done. Foxton knows nothing about the subject; and I think is not unlikely to strike off for <pb id="pg-34-130" n="34:130"/>Weimar (where Wilson,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> his acquaintance, may more invite) from the Halle or Dresden region: going or staying, he is a social intelligent fellow, thorough gentleman in habits and character; speaks a little German;&#x2014;and will conform to my wishes either going or staying. There is even talk of my Brother joining us somewhere on the route; but that is not very certain. I write now to apprise you of this; and ask whether you have any heart for joining in such an adventure. You, I am well aware, would be worth all the others in practical help to me: but perhaps you are too deep in your <hi rend="italic">motionless</hi> humours at Kissingen<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg was visiting Kissingen with his sister, Rosetta Frankau; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-19">19 July</date>]</ref>.</note> or elsewhere; and would not except on harder compulsion tear up your moorings? In which case I should be sorry; but w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have to submit. This thing has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been too well managed! In fact it has hung idly vague, these many weeks (for some <hi rend="italic">in</hi>sufficient reasons); and now it comes tumbling home all in a heap,&#x2014;the more is the pity for me, whose <hi rend="italic">blame</hi> also it partly is.&#x2014; Write at any rate: <hi rend="italic">Halle</hi> (24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) is the <hi rend="italic">first &#x201C;Poste restante&#x201C;:</hi> the rest Dresden, Prag &#x26;c follow in the order above given; at what distances of days you nearly as well guess as I. I think you will be best within reach at Dresden,&#x2014;or almost as well at Prag, where our real <hi rend="italic">difficulties</hi> begin. Happy enough sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I be to see you at Halle itself! But I must take what is arranged.</p>
<p>My Brother is in London since a week or so; uncertain whitherward for a little while next. My Wife has been on the Hampshire sea-coast for a week or two; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has done her so much good that she now proposes taking Scotland shortly, and passing the Autumn (till my return or later) with some quiet friends in this region. I am not in brill<hi rend="italic">t</hi> spirits, brilliant condition of body or of mind; far enough from it: but I do believe myself to have improved in health a little; at any rate, solitude and idleness could do no more for me. Enough. Let us hear of you, or if possible see you, somewhere in the above route!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I am in a sufficient horror at the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Foxton and my German Journey (especially since it has been all overset by the new appointment &#x201C;to Leith&#x201C; instead of &#x201C;Newcastle&#x201C;): but what can I do?

<p>Foxton is commonplace, &#x201C;scratchy-plastery&#x201C; as you say: but he is a gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> too; he is&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, I cannot go alone&#x2014; &#x2014; Mary enters saying &#x201C;Waldie coming!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wellwood Richardson&#x2019;s nickname.</note> (20 minutes before his time &#x201C;Waldie&#x201C; is the Postman) I must end abruptly: for if you get no letter at all, you will fall into one knows not what quandary.

Write <hi rend="italic">you hither</hi> still till <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Wednesday: I may perhaps be off on Thursday to Scotsbrig; but your Letter will follow thither.</p>
<p>Send the stock, send it Dearest. Take care of yourself Oh take care; and tell me what <hi rend="italic">your</hi> precise days and plans are. And pity the most dyspeptical of mortals.</p>

<p><salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin&#x2014;</salute>nothing is badly arranged here except the Post. I had opened my desk to write this note yesterday morning, when it occurred to me that till 5 of Monday, no letter could leave for London, according to the actual arrangements!! Plainly neither of the Miss Barings has ever had lovers&#x2014;a lover! the slightest expectation of a <hi rend="italic">declaration by post</hi> would have sufficed to change all this!</p>
<p>Will you, at your first convenience give Charlotte six more shillings. I allow her eight shillings a-week with <hi rend="italic">et ceteras.</hi> and that will make her right,&#x2014;up to Saturday, when, I return, please god. I am wanted to stay till the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (Monday) but I think I had best get home this week; that I may the sooner be ready to start for&#x2014;&#x2014;Scotland! yes indeed M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin! to such pitch of <hi rend="italic">courage</hi> (in the groom&#x2019;s sense of the word)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580704-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-04">4 July</date>]</ref>.</note> have I arrived!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is to sail from Newcastle to Hamburg tomorrow&#x2014;may be absent still four or five weeks; having then nobody to <hi rend="italic">do for</hi> at home (for I dont consider myself indispensable to Nero and the Sparrow) why should I sit there &#x201C;like <pb id="pg-34-132" n="34:132"/>owl in desert&#x201C; sinking down into depths of blue-devilism again!&#x2014; Especially as I have a dear little cousin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Pringle.</note> so bent on my coming that she will meet me at Carlisle &#x201C;to have my bed and tea ready for me&#x201C;!!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin! Dont you foresee what will happen?&#x2014;dont you feel as sure as if I had already told you; that I will be wanting next to know about trains to Carlisle&#x2014;the times? the fares? Yes! it is a fact! I want you to riddle <hi rend="italic">that</hi> out of Bradshaw for me! But what you <hi rend="italic">can&#x2019;t</hi> be foreseeing, the least in the world, is, that I shall also want you to find out about trains to <hi rend="italic">Liverpool!</hi> and then about trains from Liverpool to Carlisle! Some weeks ago there was a train from London to Liverpool, the fare by which, <hi rend="italic">first class,</hi> was only a pound. If this continues; I have been thinking I might go that way, and take a nights rest at Liverpool, for about the same money as going all the way from London to Carlisle at &#x201C;one fell&#x201C; rush!</p>
<p>You will help me, with your miraculous capacity of understanding Bradshaw, when I come&#x2014; Shall I see you at tea, at six o&#x2019;clock on Saturday evening? Dont mind writing&#x2014;I shall hear when I arrive.</p>
<p>Please to tell Charlotte she need not be putting down the drawing room carpet. She wrote to me the other day, to say that she &#x201C;thought M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin a very nice gentleman, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> the house was still <hi rend="italic">on the same spot</hi>&#x201C;!!&#x2014; You need not prepare her for my second Exodus. I will <hi rend="italic">break it</hi> to her with feminine tenderness on my return. Poor Child! I hope she wont go to the bad, with all this cessation of work and of supervision!</p>
<p>Your watch ticks loving compliments, and would like to known when it is to be restored to its native fob? like the Pope at Avignon &#x201C;what surprises it most is to find itself here&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quotation untraced; possibly Pope Clement V (<date when="1305-00-00">1305</date>&#x2013;<date when="1314-00-00">14</date>), who, because of unrest in Rome, moved the papal seat to Avignon, <date when="1309-00-00">1309</date>, where it remained until <date when="1376-00-00">1376</date>; or Pope Benedict XII (ca. <date when="1280-00-00">1280</date>&#x2013;<date when="1342-00-00">1342</date>), who began the construction of the papal castle in Avignon, <date when="1339-00-00">1339</date>.</note> I promise it the joy of <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> you on Saturday evening&#x2014;But whether it going home with you; that will depend!

<p>I cant but feel glad that you are not off this morning, and that there will be a letter for me on the Hall table at five&#x2014;for almost as long as I am here to clutch it! Won&#x2019;t there? Oh that Foxton! What a companion for <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi>!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had written to Charlotte I would return next Saturday (the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> instead of the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) that I might have time to put fresh ribbons on my bonnet, and make a few other feminine arrangements, preparatory to starting off again in the end of the week. But Emily<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emily Baring.</note> and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay press me so kindly to stay over Sunday, that we may all break up together on Monday; that it would be ungrateful and uncivil to refuse. So I am about writing again to Charlotte, ordering dinner for <hi rend="italic">Monday.</hi> After all; what could I do with a <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> at Chelsea if I had it? with a Presbyterian pedigree and education, one cant trim ones bonnet and wash ones <hi rend="italic">laces</hi> on the Lord&#x2019;s day!</p>
<p>I think to be on the road on Friday&#x2014;perhaps on Thursday, if I go by Liverpool&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> was my plan before I got M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringles last letter&#x2014;to go by that train to Liverpool at a Sovereign first class&#x2014; and sleep either at Alicks<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One pound; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580816-JWC-HL-01">JWC to HL, [<date when="1858-08-16">16 Aug.</date>]</ref>; JWC&#x2019;s cousin Alick Welsh.</note> if a bed were offered me beforehand, or at the Inn&#x2014;and do the rest of the journey next day. But M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle proposed another plan, so kind and thoughtful, that I accepted it at once&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">She</hi> would be waiting for me at Carlisle, and &#x201C;have a bed and tea ready for me <hi rend="italic">there.</hi>&#x201C; and her carriage would be waiting for us next day at Dumfries. &#x201C;She was very glad of my improved health&#x201C; she said; &#x201C;but it would be a positive disappointment to her, if she were <pb id="pg-34-136" n="34:136"/>not allowed to consider me and treat me as still a sort of invalid&#x201C; That was putting the thing gracefully and with the same <hi rend="italic">tact</hi> she added&#x2014;I was not to fancy it any effort her coming to meet me at Carlisle, for &#x201C;she <hi rend="italic">had friends there whom she would much like to see</hi>&#x201C;! The vision of her, with her calm kind face, waiting for me on the Platform at Carlisle to take me to tea and a bed, has the encouraging effect on me of a bit of red cloth flashed before the eyes of a pusillanimous Turkey!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drovers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries urged turkeys forward on the journey from Norfolk and Suffolk, where they were bred, to London, where they were sold, by means of a piece of red rag tied to a long pole; turkeys were believed to dislike red.</note> I have written that I accept the offer&#x2014;and will appoint the Train on my return; This makes the nights rest or at least <hi rend="italic">the nights lying</hi> at Liverpool of less moment. But I had written to Maggie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maggie Welsh, one of her Liverpool cousins.</note> who is still there, of my possible passage that way. If Alick and John are gone to Fife,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit their brother Walter Welsh in Auchtertool.</note> and Sophy<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick Welsh&#x2019;s wife.</note> (who has lately added to the Happiness of the nations, with another child)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret.</note> wishes to see me, there would be a spare bed, and she will offer it cordially&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I expressed my intention to sleep elsewhere <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I came. In defect of such <hi rend="italic">cordial</hi> offer, I shall now I think &#x201C;pass by on the other side.&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 10:31.</note></p>
<p>But I must stop if I am to have any exercise before dinner No I&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is still fine but I shouldnt wonder if it rained before night&#x2014;</p>
<p>Emily is making such a pretty drawing of this place for me! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Huxham writes that my invalid Canary (left to her care) has &#x201C;washed and pecked himself&#x201C; &#x201C;Praised be his name&#x201C;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 113:3.</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Charlotte,</salute> (This pen will hardly mark, but it must do, there is no other.) I told you in my last letter that I should be home next Saturday; and I sent you a message yesterday, thro&#x2019; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin, to the same effect. As I like keeping my word, even in matters of <hi rend="italic">no</hi> moment; I should not have altered my day for my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> pleasure; but it would be both ungrateful and impolite if I did not alter it for Miss Baring; she wishing and pressing me to stay over Sunday&#x2014;that we may all leave here the same day&#x2014;viz on Monday (23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)</p>
<p>After all it will be better so! What could I do with the Sunday at home if I had it?&#x2014;since improved tho I am in strength and <hi rend="italic">courage</hi> I have not enough of either, yet, to <hi rend="italic">go to church!</hi> And I am too good a <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian</hi> (if you have the slightest conception what <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is!) to pursue either business or amusement on Sundays! So you are not to expect me till Monday&#x2014;in time for dinner&#x2014;About three oclock you can have it ready&#x2014;I shall probably arrive soon after two. That you mayn&#x2019;t be troubling your youthful brain with uncertainties as to <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I would like; I will order the dinner <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> a week before hand!! &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newnham&#x2019;s dish (the minced mutton browned before the fire) and a ground rice pudding.&#x201C; And you must please to give me <hi rend="italic">enough!!</hi> I should like, you see, to be <hi rend="italic">let down soft;</hi> for all the time I have been here I have eaten <hi rend="small-caps">two</hi> considerable dinners a-day!</p>
<p>I hear from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Huxham this morning that &#x201C;the bird&#x201C; is not only &#x201C;still living&#x201C; but &#x201C;picking up&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;washes and pecks himself&#x201C;&#x2014;for which the Heavens be duly praised! and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Huxham&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bosom</hi>&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I told M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin I should like that he came to tea on Saturday evening I must now put him off till Monday evening</p>
<p>You can take the inclosed down to the <hi rend="italic">Bridge</hi> Pier in time for him tomorrow <pb id="pg-34-138" n="34:138"/>morning&#x2014;as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle used to leave <hi rend="italic">his</hi> notes with the man at <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Pier<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571213-TC-HL-01"><sic>33:131</sic><corr>TC to HL, <date when="1857-12-13">13 Dec. 1857</date></corr></ref>; Larkin worked from Battersea Bridge as a collector or cashier on the Chelsea steamers; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-19">19 July</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;love to Nero</p>

    <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
    <p>Many thanks for your kind Gift of the Book this morning; whatever the worth of it as a Book be, I take it as a mark of your attentive affection, which is always valuable to me.</p>
    <p>Will you write one other Note to Foxton; mentioning merely <hi rend="italic">what Hotel;</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Princes Street,</hi>

       I said, it was to be, and that you would appoint, and give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the name of it.

And you will have <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> this bothering negociation I put you into. We are not to look for you at Hamburg, it seems; but I hope you will turn up somewhere with your friendly countenance to enliven the dreary scene for me.</p>
    <p>I have lost my sleep, and gone all to nonsense, by these sudden revolutions in arrang<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> and indeed all yesterday was not far from determining to give up the disagreeable enterprize and uncertain companionship altogether: but today has arrived a very cheering new element: an invitation from the Usedoms (by the <hi rend="italic">Gn&auml;dige Frau</hi> [gracious lady],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Olympia von Usedom; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580811-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-11">11 Aug.</date>

    <p>This is capital, this first renders the enterprise fairly double with effect (for Usedom will fit me out with counsels, with introductions &c); and the tone of the invitation was such that I at once accepted. At Hamburg, therefore, it seems likely I will part with Foxton for a while; send him off to Tom Wilson, to&mdash;where he likes: and in fact I shall be able to <hi rend="italic">study</hi> during the voyage what are the best methods with such qualities as his are. To Neuberg I had already written; N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> is all-skilful in mechanical helps; and probably, as you say, Foxton and he may be got to &ldquo;neutralise one another&rdquo; in the troublesome particulars there may be!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Goodykin,&#x2014;</salute>You got such a Letter yesterday as was seldom sent by post. I am still short of sleep; and have been in great confusion and tribulation by all those fiddling arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> &#x26; rearrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and German and Foxtonian Question abilities. But now it is happily over; and I perceive a real gleam of daylight thro&#x2019; the thing; and will go resolutely forward to <hi rend="italic">constrain</hi> my nervous-system, and execute the operation with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> thought of drawing back.</p>
<p>There is a Letter from the Isle of R&#xfc;gen this morning; which has worked this benefit. You see the Usedoms invite me in right hospitable style: I accept at once; and doubt not to find in my &#x201C;three days or two&#x201C; in their establishment a real possibility of equipping myself for the enterprise on hand. Truly I rather like the style of the people both <hi rend="italic">Frau</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herr:</hi> from the latter, if I <pb id="pg-34-141" n="34:141"/>even did not like him, I can first get right instructions, introductions &#x26;c;&#x2014;in short I have said heartily, &#x201C;I will&#x201C;; and so it now stands in a hopeful condition before my mind. R&#xfc;gen, Stralsund &#x26;c are places of interest to me themselves;&#x2014;and I even mean to <hi rend="italic">bathe</hi> in the Baltic, on some safe sandy bottom thereabouts: I understand the bathing is very good!</p>
<p>By this means Foxton, too, will be put on his <hi rend="italic">trial,</hi> before definite acceptance. <hi rend="italic">At</hi> Hamburg it is likely I shall dismiss him towards Weimar &#x26; Tom Wilson; according as his behaviour on the voyage has been, shall my <hi rend="italic">re-summoning</hi> of him be! I have also written hypothetically to Neuberg: John suggests that &#x201C;Neuberg &#x26; he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> neutralise each other&#x201C;; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an idea I myself have! John himself talks sometimes of coming to intersect us somewhere: fortified by two such buttresses as N. &#x26; F. I could welcome him in my choicest mood,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; the Carlyles give two different sources, Edward Irving (4:424) and a story about George IV in Edinburgh in <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> (4:436).</note>&#x2014;as a soul that really loves me, tho&#x2019; apt to fret me into strange humours by the ways he has. In short all is greatly improved on that side, Goody sees:&#x2014;and it is probable I shall have better sleep tonight. Saturday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> sail from Leith; Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (late) at Hamburg; Tuesday 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> off for Rostock<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Port in Mecklenburg-Schwerin province, 32 mi. ENE of Weimar.</note> (expect a Letter there from Usedom), same day or next get to <hi rend="italic">Carsitz</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carsitz, about 6 mi.

<p>My packing &#x26; settling is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to do yet:&#x2014;poor Jean is here again, most affectionate of sisters doing <hi rend="italic">her</hi> best to help me:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken helped TC with transactions at the bank: &#x201C;14 or <date when="1858-08-15">15 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1858</date> / for self (thro&#x2019; Jean) / (going to Germany) / &#xa3;25..0..0&#x201C;; &#x201C;<date when="1858-08-18">18 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1858</date> / &#x2026; / Letter of Credit to Germany / &#xa3;25..0..0&#x201C;; TC had to redo this check, <date when="1858-08-19">19 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">for</hi> the preceding / (no stamp! w<hi rend="italic">dn&#x2019;t</hi> do!).&#x201C; James Carlyle gave TC &#xa3;10 in cash for the trip: &#x201C;Jamie, for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, in gold),&#x201C; TC repaying him by check (MS: NLS 20753).</note> she returns this night, and then I am fairly in handgrips with my task. Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> (tomorrow) for packing &#x26; strapping, all manner of things; some time on Thursday it is likely I will make my way to Scotsbrig (<hi rend="italic">after</hi> Post-time n.b.); rest there over Friday; then off for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Saturday, morning train 9.40 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> arrives at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> about 1; and there Foxton is to be in waiting, and begin &#x201C;scratching the plaster&#x201C; according to faculty!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I wrote to you two days ago about a German Tour. The German Tour still holds: but there is this change, since yesterday morning, That I am to go by <hi rend="italic">R&#xfc;gen,</hi> first after Hamburg; and commence my special pilgrimage from Usedom&#x2019;s House, and fortified with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> instructions,&#x2014;in that nice Island, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I wanted to see at any rate.</p>
<p>What the good Freiherr may counsel when there, I do not know,&#x2014;perhaps that I <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> by Frankfurt (C&#xfc;strin &#x26;c),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fortified town 19 mi. NE of Frankfurt am Oder; Frederick had been imprisoned there by his father in <date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570611-TC-HL-01"><sic>32:166</sic><corr>TC to HL, <date when="1857-06-11">11 June 1857</date></corr></ref>; see also <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:326, 334, and 371. The castle at C&#xfc;strin was destroyed by the Russians in <date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>, during the Seven Years&#x2019; War, at the battle of Zorndorf; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:373&#x2013;97.</note> <hi rend="italic">Breslau;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">end</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Halle?</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s route, see map, Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey,</hi> endpapers.</note>&#x2014; One thing only is certain, you must now write to me <hi rend="italic">to R&#xfc;gen</hi> in the first place (not to <hi rend="italic">Halle</hi> or where I formerly directed); that Foxton will now hang looser on me;&#x2014;and that you, if you can come, will be of essential help in getting me forward thro&#x2019; the problem.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Freyherr v. Usedom,<lb/>
Carsitz, Insel R&#xfc;gen<lb/>
Stralsund&#x201C;:</p>
<p>that is the Address;&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">times</hi> are as follows:</p>
<p>Embark at Leith, Saturday 21 Aug<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> 7 p.m.; hope to be in Hamburg Monday (late) 23<hi rend="italic">d;&#x2014;</hi>24<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> get, by Rostock &#x26;c, to Carsitz (Foxton perhaps running for Weimar &#x26; Tom Wilson in the interim); stay at Carsitz, &#x201C;three days or two&#x201C; (I have said),&#x2014;whence, on reading your Letter there, and making out my program, I will write, and appoint an <hi rend="italic">intersection,</hi> according to what best possibilities there are.</p>
<p>I regret to go so far round as R&#xfc;gen, for I have really nothing else to do but &#x201C;see these Battlefields&#x201C;: however, it was only by Usedom&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">help</hi> (directions, introductions &#x26;c) that I could fairly see a possibility of in actual fact (and not in sad semblance only) <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the small problem; wherefore I was very glad of the offer made me.</p>
<p>Come if you can; I count on your coming! The crossing of the <hi rend="italic">Riesengebirge</hi> ought to be a picturesque kind of thing? The rest is all scientific <hi rend="italic">slaving,</hi> and no &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ruhige Zimmer</hi>&#x201C; [quiet rooms] to be had.&#x2014; Perhaps Usedom will send me by Berlin &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Dresden,</hi> after all, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> to begin (somewhat according to the old scheme)? What is your <hi rend="italic">convenience,</hi> your impartial <hi rend="italic">notion?</hi> Let me hear at Carsitz. <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>It is not easy to say whether you meant me to write today or not&#x2014;I was to go on writing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">till</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">on</hi> Wednesday&#x201C;!&#x2014; I think a nice Chancery suit, might be based on that expression, made to last thro forty years if a fortune lay on it!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case in Dickens, <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi> (<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>); the Carlyles had been sent the novel as it was serialized, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520410-TC-MAC-01"><sic>27:84</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1852-04-10">10 April 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> Best to err on the safe side and write &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">on</hi> Wednesday&#x201C;&#x2014;anyhow&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have no time however for a long letter&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mildmay having decided that we are to take our drive before Luncheon instead of after&#x2014;in case the day &#x201C;brews up&#x201C; as yesterday did, and we get cut out of our drive altogether&#x2014;And as I am to send <hi rend="italic">the stock,</hi> I must take it myself to the post office at <hi rend="italic">Fareham&#x2014;</hi>which is the destination for today&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had a very comforting letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh to whom I had written to ask after John. He had been much improved by the better weather when he last wrote&#x2014;his cough was <hi rend="italic">much</hi> less troublesome&#x2014;his strength surprisingly increased, for the day before writing, he had walked <hi rend="italic">seven hours</hi> without feeling the worse for it! <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> with my own peculiar experience, should not build much on such a development of <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> power: if it were not that <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> <hi rend="italic">sleeps soundly</hi> after such exertions, and that his appetite is good&#x2014;But oh Dear! it was just the same last summer&#x2014;and the winter undid all the good he had got.</p>
<p>His Mother says &#x201C;a load is taken off her heart&#x201C;&#x2014;it were safer that the load should merely be a <hi rend="italic">little lightened&#x2014;</hi></p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>I am very glad to hear of you again; especially today just in the nick of time.</p>
<p>I agree altogether in your notion about <hi rend="italic">Table of Contents;</hi> with such farther suggestions as you will see marked in pencil,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> not very distinctly marked (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I leave to your own consideration and decision) as to putting in the <hi rend="italic">page-numbers</hi> for the Subaltern Sections<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the table of contents of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> the page numbers of the subsections immediately follow their headings, while the page numbers of the section headings are justified down the right-hand margin.</note> where such occur? It might be a kind of improv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> if it were not found to look too badly. Do it as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like.</p>
<p>If you have quite done with the <hi rend="italic">Stieler Maps,</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like very well to have <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> the 3 or the 4 pieces we talked of;&#x2014;for I am just on the wing for Germany, to <hi rend="italic">execute</hi> that little project you heard of, if the Fates still permit! I sail from <hi rend="italic">Leith,</hi> Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> for Hamburg; go from Hamburg to Stralsund (and Isle of R&#xfc;gen); then am to be in and about the following places, <hi rend="italic">Frankfurt</hi> on Oder (for C&#xfc;strin, Zorndorf &#x26;c); <hi rend="italic">Breslau</hi> (Silesia generally); <hi rend="italic">Prag</hi> (Riesengebirge &#x26; upper part of Bohemia); <hi rend="italic">Dresden; Halle</hi> (for Rosbach &#x26; Torgau, two famous fights):&#x2014;all this, I think, will be in about 5 of those Stieler Pieces; if you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">quite</hi> done with these (not otherwise), and can roll them all together, and despatch by tomorrow (Thursday&#x2019;s Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Post) addressed &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan N. B.,&#x201C; they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> still find me at that Scotsbrig,&#x2014;and might save me some trouble in Hamburg, and be worth scanning during the tedium of a long sail thither.&#x2014; I can also answer any farther doubts you may have ab<hi rend="italic">t Table of Contents,&#x2014;</hi>specially any part of the pencil marking wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may have proved unintelligible.&#x2014; I am in very great haste today; having too long delayed <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> my final arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> here. So dubious has the whole project been till quite lately.</p>
<p>As to the <hi rend="italic">Map of Prussia</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have never seen, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are quite sure about it, I will make myself quite sure, and think of it no more. If on any point you <pb id="pg-34-146" n="34:146"/>have doubt, there is a Mr Chorley<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley.</note> (76. Chester Square Pimlico) whom you might securely consult: he has read all the <hi rend="italic">Proofs,</hi> has heard of you too; is a man <hi rend="italic">painfully</hi> exact; and will give you any amount of &#x201C;instruction,&#x201C; of wh<hi rend="italic">h you</hi> will separate the essential from the unessential!&#x2014; The mere mention of your name and business will at once introduce you: but I hope there is no doubt left in you, &#x26; that you will not have occasion to try. The Number of <hi rend="italic">Provinces</hi> that belonged to Fr<hi rend="italic">h</hi> W<hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and the d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> to our Fried<hi rend="italic">h;</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> you give to the Map: these seem the chief points; and on these B&#xfc;sch<hi rend="italic">g</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anton Friedrich B&#xfc;sching; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580708-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July</date></ref>.</note> has probably left no doubt in you. If so, I will (once more) consider all secure.</p>
<p>You oblige me much by your help to Mrs Carlyle, who expresses her admiration from time to time of your skill and felicity in managing for her. Indeed I am obliged to you in all ways, for real <hi rend="italic">help,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a rare thing in the world just now,&#x2014;and we need not say more on it at present.</p>
<p>I expect to be home, if all go well, in some 6 or 7 weeks, or little more;&#x2014;and to find <hi rend="italic">Fried</hi>h, I &#x26; II volumes, lying on Chapman&#x2019;s Counter by that time.</p>
<p>With many thanks and good wishes</p>

<p>It was an immense relief to me that Note of yours, Dear: I had been considerably flurried by the Nothing of yesterday, tho&#x2019; I tried &#x201C;not to&#x201C;: but here is the bright blue <hi rend="italic">fleuret</hi> [sweet flower]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably JWC had enclosed a blue flower.</note> today, and the news altogether such as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have wished. Thank that excellent Mrs Pringle for me; and say how much I admire her graceful dexterities, as well as her considerate kindness, in <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the sacred rites to my poor Goody. That of Carlisle was excell<hi rend="italic">t:</hi> a difficulty I had often been thinking of. You can have a nice <hi rend="italic">Mail train</hi> 9.15 (I think) a.m. Euston Square, Carlisle n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 7 p.m.,&#x2014;if you do not care to trouble Liverpool. And keep within the &#x201C;close carriage,&#x201C; especially if there be damp, and night coming on! I hope really Mrs Pringle will be able to say something satisfactory of you, nay to <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> you a much-improved creature, when I return.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-147" n="34:147"/>This morning, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> your flower or Note had come, I plucked a bonnie <hi rend="italic">red</hi> gowan for you, and stuck it in my buttonhole;&#x2014;but, alas, the fury of packing has sunk it utterly in the universal hurlyburly, and you must dispense with that small blessing.</p>
<p>I have had such a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">packing,</hi>&#x201C; today and all yesterday, as man need not&#x2014;long for at all! In fact I am utterly worn to ruin; and had tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of taking a stretch on <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> before going farther. But the time presses: gig to Scotsbrig, Mary accompanying to bring it back,&#x2014;and all things <hi rend="italic">are</hi> really sorted here in some measure; an immense package of <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> (new <hi rend="italic">and</hi> old) left lying here, in Mary&#x2019;s care (and yours, if you <hi rend="italic">can;</hi> not if you cannot). Mary &#x26; all her household have been according to their wont; kindness itself,&#x2014;as poor Jean has been too, whose embarrassed shortcomings, only render her conduct more pathetic to me. Be good, be tolerant, in these quarters for my sake. Were you ever otherwise! No, never at all; and I know what praise is in that, too, my little woman.</p>
<p>While you are at home in Chelsea, give Till&#x2019;s groom<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pearson Till&#x2019;s groom, Eaves; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580910-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, 9 [<date when="1858-09-10">10 Sept.</date>].</ref></note> the Horse-<hi rend="italic">Ticket</hi> and Half-a-crown (or so&#x2014;on <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> 2/6 w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do; but perhaps not on a weekday: ask Larkin again!)&#x2014;and request said groom to go &#x26; have <hi rend="italic">a look,</hi> in the Old Deer Park,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richmond Park, where TC had left his horse, Fritz; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date></ref>.</note> at his and my old fourfooted friend, and report candidly upon him. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like that done.&#x2014; Poor dromedary here, one of the stupidest of contented awkward animals, looks quite pathetic on me today, as if it <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> that we were to travel together no more, or hardly more!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If John call, bury old grudges;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC resented John Carlyle&#x2019;s often unsympathetic diagnoses of her illnesses; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330715-JWC-EMI-01"><sic>6:411</sic><corr>JWC to EMI, <date when="1833-07-15">15 July 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> there has been enough of the scourging system I should say. Ag<hi rend="italic">t you</hi> the poor soul, I believe, has never deliberately had one hard tho<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> much less spoken any unfriendly word.</p>
<p>Tomorrow again will be a day of tumult and fatigue (I doubt), several things still to <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> but I will try to send you one word more,&#x2014;indeed I <hi rend="italic">must</hi>; appointing (<hi rend="italic">so</hi> far as possible) my times and seasons. Once in the week, after that, will be a liberal allowance. You little Cutty,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Old Scots; affectionate term for a mischievous girl.</note> you have not written one Note for 3 of mine, all this time. And I promise never more to do the like!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Adieu, Dearest; I am at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of my time, &#x26; far beyond the end of any real <hi rend="italic">business,&#x2014;</hi>to be called such in the awful hurlyburly round me today. <closer><salute>God bless thee ever.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I forgot to say you must put a good fire in my bed-room the day <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I come (Sunday); and keep it up all day, taking off the bedclothes that the bed may be well aired. It would be too dreadful if I caught cold the first thing!</p>

<p>The weather is rather broken&#x2014;we have had more or less rain the last three days&#x2014;but there has always been two good fair hours for my drive in the open Carriage.</p>

<p>&#x201C;If this meet your eye,&#x201C; (as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> advertisements say,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For example, <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1858-07-24">24 July</date>.</note> &#x201C;you are requested to communicate&#x201C; with Mrs. Carlyle, 5 Cheyne Row, Chelsea.</p>
<p>In fact, my present note is by way of <hi rend="italic">dove</hi> sent forth from the ark, to try if it can find rest for the sole of its foot, and bring back an olive leaf from you<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 8:8&#x2013;11.</note> to <pb id="pg-34-149" n="34:149"/>the effect that you are still in Carlisle, and still recollecting me with the old kind of feeling.</p>
<p>In that case, I should direct my energies towards &#x201C;carrying out&#x201C; an idea that has suggested itself to me of a meeting between us face to face.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently they did not meet this time, but Smith wrote later: &#x201C;When passing through Carlisle&#x2014;perhaps, always when she stopped&#x2014;she sent me word beforehand to meet her at the County Hotel&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 244).</note></p>
<p>I am going to Scotland, please God, the end of next week; and have arranged to sleep at Carlisle on the road. I cannot nor shall I be able to tell you beforehand what inn I shall stop at. I am in the hands of a lady who will meet me on my arrival, having come all the way from Nithsdale &#x201C;to have my tea and bed ready.&#x201C; But if I were sure of your being still in Carlisle, and sure about your present address, I would find some means of letting you know my whereabouts and the hours of my stay.</p>
<p>I return to London on Monday next (23rd). If you get this note in regular course, please to send an answer to the old address. But besides the probability of your having changed your old address, I do not even remember quite certainly what it was!! So my dove goes forth &#x201C;under difficulties&#x201C;&#x2014;decidedly.</p>

They are at shearing here; d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> still more decisively at the Gill: but perhaps no body is more pressed, running the <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>-race, than my poor self just now.</p>
<p>I found your Letter (on emerging from my second sleep) this morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> tomorrow we will intercept the Post for what else you send. Sorry I hurried you so.&#x2014; Jane returns to Chelsea Monday next (<hi rend="italic">first</hi>); is for quitting Chelsea probably <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> (this day week) for Nithsdale;&#x2014;under improved omens still; and likely to be well nursed by Mrs Pringle, who &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">meets her at Carlisle</hi>&#x201C; &#x26;c, a very kind hostess. Much to my comfort in way-faring.</p>
<p>I begin to <hi rend="italic">scunner</hi> at the long <hi rend="italic">roundabout</hi> of R&#xfc;gen; great expenditure of &#x201C;railing&#x201C; truly,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like well to be there too! The Maps (from Larkin) <pb id="pg-34-150" n="34:150"/>have come this morning; and I find the <hi rend="italic">Task</hi> lie all in a <hi rend="italic">ring,&#x2014;</hi>to which that of R&#xfc;gen is a mere <hi rend="italic">shank;</hi> formidable to the weak mind and body!&#x2014; Before Hamburg, I shall have seen how Foxton <hi rend="italic">proves,</hi> and settled all that.</p>
<p>Your surest <hi rend="italic">first</hi> point to write to me is, &#x201C;(Poste Restante) <hi rend="italic">Dresden,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and write on or before this day week; otherwise wait till you hear <hi rend="italic">again.</hi> Settle if you can then,&#x2014;or at least <hi rend="italic">say</hi> (<hi rend="italic">if you have</hi> settled), as to our meeting &#x26;c, or whether you decide to wait for the Ship in your pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> whereabouts.</p>
<p>If you are in Town in Jane&#x2019;s time, go and see her,&#x2014;she will expect it. But you are to be at Chelt<hi rend="italic">m</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cheltenham, spa town in Gloucestershire.</note> again, perhaps, all that time (Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g&#x2014;</hi>Thursday d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>)? If so, nothing can be done.</p>
<p>Arthur<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Watt.</note> is off himself this morning to meet <hi rend="italic">Dromedary,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was to be left by Gill people at <hi rend="italic">Jeffrey&#x2019;s</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> of Hoddam Moor (7 or 6 a.m.) and be called for by somebody from Scotsbrig in the course of the day. A<hi rend="italic">r</hi> was just crossing the <hi rend="italic">Burn</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Middlebie Burn, tributary of Mein Water, which runs SW through Annandale to join river Annan.</note> (9 a.m.), when I looked out after final rising. He is eager for &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">tides</hi>&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> next week. Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle, TC&#x2019;s nephew.</note> here; and all very quiet &#x26; good.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I am here at Scotsbrig; still in a considerable whirl of &#x201C;business,&#x201C; petty, incessant and annoying;&#x2014;full of all the tho<hi rend="italic">ts,</hi> too, wh<hi rend="italic">h this</hi> nearly preternatural apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> may be supposed to give me. Oh Time, Oh Death&#x2014;Oh Life! But we must not falter, must not loiter: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Doch unbeschrecket</hi> / Dringen wir vorw&#xE4;rts [Thus we drive forwards without fear],&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

There is a certain blessedness and sacredness in this kind of pain and heaviness of heart to me. <hi rend="italic">Vorw&#xE4;rts!</hi> [Forwards]&#x2014;</p>
<p>Arthur (one of &#x201C;my poor boys,&#x201C; grown very civil, and voice <hi rend="italic">bass,</hi> poor creature) is still here, and Jamie jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from Glasgow: but they are all very quiet, keep well out of my way. Weather bright and airy,&#x2014;seems to tell me, &#x201C;I <pb id="pg-34-151" n="34:151"/>will be kind to thy little Goody, thou fool!&#x201C;&#x2014; That is the most comfortable element in my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>!&#x2014; And here is Isabella up to ask ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> dinner (&#x201C;smallest fraction of roast chicken, then,&#x201C;&#x2014;if not &#x201C;2 eggs,&#x201C; as yesterday, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> did very well); and Jamie, it seems, is off catching the Horse; journey to Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (for &#x201C;10 more sovereigns,&#x201C; no less!) being just at hand, <hi rend="italic">time</hi> ebbing fast for that operat<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> And I have had Proof Titlepage again, and maps from Larkin; and&#x2014; You see what flurry I am still in.</p>
<p>Nothing having come from you this morning, I think you must aim for <hi rend="italic">tomorrow;&#x2014;</hi>and we will <hi rend="italic">intercept</hi> the Postman (are to be <hi rend="italic">off</hi> &#x201C;by the stroke of 9 a.m.&#x201C;), and will catch up what there may be,&#x2014;a box of <hi rend="italic">pills</hi> from Jack,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580817-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1858-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note> among other things!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Write &#x201C;Poste Restante Dresden&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">the next morning</hi> after your arrival at Landhall: I can give no better guidance;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">be punctual</hi> and sharp!

<p>And may I but hear you do well at Land<hi rend="italic">ll,</hi> it will be such a comfort to me in the Bohem<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26; Silesian wildernesses;&#x2014;and perhaps I may come round, and pick you up, a <hi rend="italic">mended watch</hi> (in some measure), and carry you home in my pocket, you fool!&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Some</hi>thing more I had to say; but it is gone, and I have not half a moment.

<p>Adieu then my own dear little Jeannie. Take care of thyself, care, care! And God keep thee well to me while I live. Ever affectionately my good little woman&#x2019;s own</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The maps have come punctually and safe, along with your Note. <hi rend="italic">Five</hi> of them contain what I most essentially wanted; the other 4 may be of a certain use too, and are easily carried. Thanks again.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-152" n="34:152"/>I had begun to <hi rend="italic">doubt</hi> my suggested changes as to that small item in the Table of Contents.

Perhaps, also, <hi rend="italic">not!&#x2014;</hi> You and Robson must settle the matter as you find best. If the <hi rend="italic">pages can</hi> be specified with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> too much expense to <hi rend="italic">appearance,</hi> do so by all means.&#x2014; Pray give Mr R the enclosed (2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) Proof of <hi rend="italic">Titlepage;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also is left hanging.&#x2014; Chorley, if tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> needful; but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (Mr Larkin) are <hi rend="italic">final.</hi></p>
<p>I go tomorrow morning; hope to see you again (if all go well) about end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Let me see the Book <hi rend="italic">out,</hi> and fairly off our hands, on my lucky return! And so Good b&#x2019;ye, in haste.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Here we are at last, Foxton and I, after a voyage distinguished by tedium &#x26; misery (owing to rough weather &#x26;c) rather than otherwise:&#x2014;we arrived 2 hours ago (did not sail till <hi rend="italic">midnight</hi> &#x201C;Saturday&#x201C; nor arrive till 3 p.m. <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>); and are already <hi rend="italic">washed</hi> thoroughly, and well <hi rend="italic">dined;</hi> in an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> airy h&#xF4;tel.&#x2014; My room in 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> story, and looking to rearward promises to be clean and good;&#x2014;so that I may hope to <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> and in all points be ready for <hi rend="italic">the road,</hi> whithersoever it lead; having rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> no damage except a 2 days of sordid temporary wretchedness wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will soon be forgotten.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Above was rainy wind; the tumbling of apple-hampers, herring-barrels, uncertain steps of seamen heard overhead, ship dancing rather madly &#x2026; no existence above board: what a night! &#x2026; staggered upstairs &#x2026; decks all wet with spray &#x2026; no standing possible, nor even sitting, except by aid of hands as well as feet. &#x2026; Sea dim and angry&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 5).</note></p>
<p>Pray communicate this to Jane, at Chelsea (since <hi rend="italic">Monday,</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">till</hi> Thursday) to Dumfries and the Gill and Scotsbrig, where friends are anxious about that initiatory fact. More I cannot say; for all is confusion as to our <hi rend="italic">plans</hi> of journey, owing to Notes from Neuberg, to No-notes from Usedom &#x26;c; and I think it is likely we may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go off at all till the day after tomorrow, and then perhaps towards Dresden <hi rend="italic">direct,</hi> rather than towards Usedom and the Isle of R&#xfc;gen:&#x2014;but all this <hi rend="italic">bleibt schwebend</hi> [remains pending] till once <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can decide it, poor I!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Enough I am well as commonly, and able to go <hi rend="italic">whither I like.</hi> Report this, and my love to all my loved ones; and let nobody <hi rend="italic">write</hi> (except Jane who was <hi rend="italic">already</hi> bidden write to Dresden) till once I write again.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your ingenious Mr Rosdal<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosdal was Jewish, as was Neuberg; TC described him as &#x201C;a bright young gentleman, with fine black eyes, ditto macassar [maccassar] hair, and long hook-nose, evidently of Abrahamic lineage&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 10). It was Brooks&#x2019;s editorial practice to insert correct spellings with TL&#x2019;s misspelling in sq. br.; see Brooks&#x2019;s introduction xii.</note> found us today in stepping out of the Steamer; and your Note, delivered by him, has thrown me into such a quandary of uncertainties as has seldom been my experience before! And yet a decision must be hit upon at once: Whether to persist in Carsitz, or thriftily rush off upon Leipzig on the chance of still (after my 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Letter) finding you there?&#x2014;On the whole let the course be this:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">If</hi> you are already arrived at the <hi rend="italic">H&#xF4;tel de Bavi&#xE8;re</hi> in Leipzig on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> when this finds you, <hi rend="italic">continue there</hi> till you either see us arrive too (as is probable on <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>), or else till I write again. We have Rosbach &#x26; Torgau to do, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I now find <hi rend="italic">Leipzig</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">Halle</hi> is the centre. It is probable we may stay here a day, and then <hi rend="italic">go</hi> at once upon our <hi rend="italic">Task,</hi>&#x2014;there being some uncertainty as to Usedom&#x2019;s being <hi rend="italic">at</hi> R&#xfc;gen yet and a great evidence as to the large increase of <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> there will be in R&#xfc;gen for me.</p>
<p>Leipzig either tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> or as soon as possible! In this sense I write also to Heidingsfeld<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. W&#xfc;rzburg in Bavaria, home of Neuberg&#x2019;s mother; see <sic>28:220 and 28:269</sic><corr><ref target="volume-28/lt-18530725-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1853-07-25">25 July 1853</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530915-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1853-09-15">15 Sept. 1853</date></ref></corr>.</note> tonight.</p>

<closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>P.S.

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Here I am safe enough since 8 hours, after such a voyage for tumult and discomfort (now forgotten) as I have seldom made. The Leith people, innocent but ineffectual souls, forgot every promise they had made,&#x2014; except that of sailing, 5 hours after their time, and landing us at last, 15 hours after d<hi rend="italic">o.</hi> We had baddish weather all Sunday, mediocre till this morning, and such a scrambling dogkennel of a sickly life: however, the sail up <hi rend="italic">the Elbe</hi> all this day was bright, sunny and beautiful; and our history since, a fair prospect even of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> being superadded, has been favourable in all points:&#x2014;so that thanks to Heaveven<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> are alone due from me in that matter, and thy little heart, poor woman, wherever this find thee may set itself at rest on my score. We have the finest airy H&#xF4;tel (cheap too, they say), my room is <hi rend="italic">five</hi> stairs up, looking over mere roofs; we dined wholesomely; Neuberg had a man <hi rend="italic">in wait</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosdal.</note> (poor good soul, after all!) to say that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was ready any hour &#x26;c: in short, except a storm of fine wind-music spreading over the City, and not yet concluded, there is a right fair share of comfort, and good omens round me here on firm earth again. The music is excellently sweet, <hi rend="italic">pathetic</hi> withal to the worn soul towards midnight; and I write to my own little Partner far away, for tomorrow&#x2019;s post, till it cease. Again let us thank Heaven.</p>
<p>Foxton, poor fellow, is very good; stands snubbing into silence, annihilates himself whenever I like, and is verily a gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in air and heart: good for almost nothing in the way of <hi rend="italic">help,</hi> tho&#x2019; prompt as possible: but <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with Neuberg, he will do extremely well.</p>
<p>This of Neuberg, however, and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> relation to the Usedom enterprise, as the days have run, constitutes a considerable <hi rend="italic">burble,</hi> ever since his messenger appeared this afternoon;&#x2014;burble not to be explained with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> too much of circumlocution till we meet. But this too has at last been put in the way of solution by our deciding to stay here over tomorrow, and then in the evening send a &#x201C;telegraphic message to Leipzig&#x201C; perhaps,&#x2014;thereby to ascertain whether Usedom <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be abandoned (to my regret), and a junction formed with the said Neuberg immediately, and the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> of the Tour attacked at once with N&#x2019;s help, and pushed in one continued shove to its conclusion. This will be decided tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> not till then. I shall regret the miss of Usedom; <pb id="pg-34-157" n="34:157"/>but I find he &#x26; R&#xfc;gen mean for me 300 miles more of railing; and that will be a saving of good weight in the counter-balance. Never thou mind, Dearest, how that go; think me well; and be content till thou hear from me again. The music seems <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> I will add a word to-to-morrow.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC repeated &#x201C;to-&#x201C; when he turned the page.</note> A thousand good nights. How strange it was to picture from amid the tumblings and sloppy tumults of the greasy steamer and the German Ocean, to figure my poor Goody&#x2019;s voyage from Bay House in the Railway on Monday; and to think at night, Poor soul she is home now! Oh may God keep thee.&#x2014; Goodnight again. I will add a word were tomorrow come. <closer><salute>Thine ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>Wednesday, 7 a.m.</p>
<p>No great shakes of a night, Dearest; but better than many of yours: I have had an hour or two, and am fresh in the fine morning; and (thank God) <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to a decision during the night.&#x2014; We <hi rend="italic">go off</hi> at noon towards Usedom and R&#xfc;gen; to there<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; &#x201C;be&#x201C; omitted.</note> friday night (Foxton stopping <hi rend="italic">at Stralsund</hi> near by): there will we <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> Neuberg&#x2019;s advance, in safety, and can take a fine sea-bathing if we like&#x2014;for R&#xfc;gen is the &#x201C;German Isle of Wight.&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I found the German &#x2018;Isle of Wight,&#x2019; afterwards, a notable misnomer (Isle of Man, almost Isle of Lewis, were better)&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 21).</note> May it do us all good!&#x2014;&#x2014;Adieu my Darling; never was such hurry.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg</salute>
<p>We arrived here yesterday at 4 p.m after a rather frightful voyage &#x26; were met by your dextrous &#x26; excellent friend M. Rosval.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS for Rosdal.</note> If you wish to know what paroxysm of debitations your second letter threw me into, you may send for a letter I wrote last night to your address Hotel de Bavi&#xE8;re Leipzic.</p>
<p>But in the silence of the vigilant night it has now become manifest to me, that my second letter must have arrived before you came away;&#x2014;that you are not come away at all; &#x26; that last night&#x2019;s letter to Leipzic may be safely left to take its travels into infinite space.</p>
<p>The decision I arrive at this morning is; That Foxton &#x26; I proceed direct <pb id="pg-34-158" n="34:158"/>according to our original destination, this day about noon towards Stralsund&#x2014;arrive in those neighbourhoods on Friday evening, &#x26; there wait news of you&#x2014;nay a definite approximation from you since you are so good as join us in that prompt manner. We fancy we can bathe in the seas of R&#xfc;gen for a a<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> few days, at all events want better there than elsewhere to prepare for the <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> tour. My idea is, that you should come at once, at least to Berlin,&#x2014;if not to Stralsund or R&#xfc;gen itself:&#x2014;after which we constitute you Palinurus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aeneas&#x2019;s helmsman in Virgil&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>; see also <sic>4:304 and 15:4</sic><corr><ref target="volume-04/lt-18280117-TC-BWP-01">TC to BWP, <date when="1828-01-17">17 Jan. 1828</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420805-TC-SSR-01">TC to SSR, <date when="1842-08-05">5 Aug. 1842</date></ref></corr>.</note> of the enterprize; and all goes straight <hi rend="italic">von Statten</hi> [from Stettin]. Enough: I write in difficult circumstances dictating while I wash &#x26; dress to Foxton who is kind enough to hold the pen.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC scored out &#x201C;write&#x201C; (which was in Foxton&#x2019;s hand) and inserted &#x201C;hold the pen.&#x201C;</note> He cordially greets you as do I. <hi rend="italic">Gl&#xfc;ck auf den Reise</hi> [Good luck for the journey]!</p>
<p>On the whole, come directly, dear N<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> that is, as soon (and as far) as you can. I will write nothing more till I see <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Letter at Usedom&#x2019;s;&#x2014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> once more, this was to be the Address</p>
<p>via Baron v. Usedom</p>
<p>Carsitz, Insel R&#xfc;gen,</p>
<p>Stralsund.</p>
<p>Rosdal knows of our movements, and has been extremely kind;&#x2014;proposed even a &#x201C;telegraphic question to Leipzig&#x201C; (as to your <hi rend="italic">being</hi> come thither): but that I now see to be superfluous</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dearest,</salute> how glad am I to write to the[e]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> from here: since yesterday, my prospects &#x26; situation have miraculously mended, and at present I call myself a lucky kind of man! The special details remain for quiet evenings when we are together once again; but this is the summary, all that is needful at present: I am rid of Foxton, quite <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> [at liberty] free of scratching on the plaster; have had again a sound good sleep; and am lodged in the prettiest strange place you ever saw, among people kind to me as possible; am going to get my enterprise deliberately made feasible,&#x2014;and as a preliminary <pb id="pg-34-159" n="34:159"/>mean to have a bathe in the Baltic Sea, so soon as this Note and one to Neuberg is done! The course of things was thus:</p>
<p>Yesterday about 11 a.m. after two rather sleepless and miserable nights on land, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> with the 3 preceding at sea, had reduced me to a bad pitch,&#x2014;I had, with poor helpless but assiduous Foxton, stept out of the railway train at Rostock (biggish Sea Capital of Mecklenburg); and was hurrying along to get a place in the Stralsund <hi rend="italic">Diligence,</hi> with no prospect but eight hours of suffocation and a night to follow with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sleep, when a jolly plump Lady attended by her maid addressed me with sunny voice and look, &#x201C;Was not I Mr Carlyle?&#x201C; &#x201C;I am the Frau von Usedom,&#x201C; rejoined she on my answer; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">here</hi> to seek you&#x201C; (64 miles from home!) &#x201C;and you must go with me henceforth!&#x201C; Hardly in my life had such a <hi rend="italic">manus e nubilus</hi> [hand out of the clouds]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC translates as &#x201C;hand of an angel&#x201C; in Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 19.</note> been extended to me. I need not say how thrice gladly I accepted;&#x2014;I had in fact done with all my labour then; and was carried on thenceforth like a mere child in arms, nothing to do or care for, but all conceivable accommodations gracefully provided me up hither to this pleasant Isle of the Sea, where I now am, a considerably rested man! We posted 45 miles, I sitting mainly on the box, smoking and gazing abroad; Foxton (whom after a while I put inside to do the talking) we dropt at Stralsund (6 p.m.) other side of the little strip of sea; and he is off to Berlin, or whither he likes; and I need not recal him again, except as <hi rend="italic">sour</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">fat</hi> of Neuberg, who is worth a million of him for helping one on and making no noise about it. Happy journey to poor Foxton!&#x2014; After Stralsund, and our little bit of sea-steaming, in one of the brightest autumn ev<hi rend="italic">gs,</hi> we had still almost 20 miles into the strange Interior of this R&#xfc;gen, &#x201C;German Isle of Wight&#x201C; as they call it,&#x2014;a flat, bare, but cultivated place, with endless <hi rend="italic">paths</hi> but no <hi rend="italic">roads,</hi> strange oak-brick, red beehives of cottages very exotic looking, a very exotic scene altogether in the moonlight, and a voluble incessantly explosively demonstrative, but thoroughly good Madam v. Usedom beside me: most strange, almost as in a <hi rend="italic">m&#xE4;hrchen</hi> [folk tale] of Mother Buch&#x2019;s.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; probably a collection of children&#x2019;s nursery stories.</note> But we had four swift horse, a nice light carriage, and went spanking along roadless; and in fine I am here, and have <hi rend="italic">slept.</hi> The place is like nothing you ever saw; medieval, semi-patriarchal; half a farm-house, half a palace: but that I will describe some day at leisure.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 22&#x2013;24.</note>&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Herr</hi> who is at Berlin (telegraphing and be-telegraphed at a fine rate) returns this night; has made arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> &#x26;c, oh what arrang<hi rend="italic">ts,</hi> and even &#x201C;spoken of it to the Prince of Prussia.&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Wilhelm served as regent (<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>) after his brother, Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia, had a stroke.</note> What is also, for practice, definitely lucky, Neuberg&#x2019;s Letter appointed <pb id="pg-34-160" n="34:160"/>hither (from The Gill) finds me <hi rend="italic">this morning</hi> by post; and he will himself be in Berlin <hi rend="italic">tomorrow night,</hi> there to wait till what time I please to appoint. The Herr v. Usedom, were he once here, must appoint me the times and the ways: N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> thinks, in about 2 weeks after our meeting, the thing might be got completed. Would it were <hi rend="italic">so;</hi> and I home again, <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of these foreign elements, good and bad! In a word, Darling; be at ease about <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> and thank Heaven that I have human room to sleep in again, am seeing strange things not quite worthless to me, and in fact am in a fair way.</p>
<p>When I shall hear from you&#x2014;alas, it cuts me to the heart when I think of that! For perhaps <hi rend="italic">now</hi> (if N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> guess right) we shall not go to Dresden <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> but begin at the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> end of the circle. However, your Letter can be <hi rend="italic">sent for</hi> from Dresden: write <hi rend="italic">thither,</hi> immediately and largely as you can; I can still give you no better place, &#x26; need not confuse you by changing. &#x201C;Poste rest<hi rend="italic">te,</hi> Dresden Saxony,&#x201C; and you need not <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> unless you like:&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t, you see, and it comes to the same.</p>
<p>Probably this day you are in the railway train, my poor little woman! In my confusion yesternight, as I came along, I fancied that was Friday; and pictured out Mrs Pringle&#x2019;s reception of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at Carlisle, while my own here was going on: but perhaps you were only at Liverpool; perhaps&#x2014;Oh my poor little Jeannie, if I knew you were but <hi rend="italic">well,</hi> I think I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be almost happy here today, in the silent sunshine, on these remote Scandinavian shores. God be with thee, my little Dear; and keep thee my now one possession, pretty much, in this world! In native Nithsdale too I hope there will be good days for thee; and we shall return with something to tell one another before long!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to you from Hamburg instantly,&#x2014;only to say I had arrived safe;&#x2014;Letter was inclosed to John, that he might seek you out (if already gone, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I now find you will hardly be), and make no delay for you. The address of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is also a little uncertain to me; but I think Thornhill must be the Post-Office; at all events it is certain to find you,&#x2014;perhaps about Tuesday or Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> next.</p>
<p>My regards and best thanks to the beneficent Mrs Pringle: if she will nurse you I will be grateful as for no other favour;&#x2014;and I again I recommend you to your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> best care, first of all. <closer><salute>God bless thee, Dearest</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>The wind is singing and the sun sporting in the Lindens, and I hear <hi rend="italic">doos</hi> cooing: windows up&#x2014;two rooms all to mysell. &#x201C;Coo, coo!&#x201C;</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I am much contented to receive your Letter this morning, the very <hi rend="italic">first</hi> after my arrival here: it puts all things on a straight footing again, thank Heaven; and knits up what was lately a great and confused ravelment,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note> as you shall hear one day. At Hamburg on Rosdal&#x2019;s news to me, I was not far from running off direct to Leipzig, was for telegraphing, for &#x26;c &#x26;c. The meditations of the night (unhappily quite sleepless) first shewed me clearly how the thing w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be; and that I must <hi rend="italic">persist</hi> hitherward: whereby now again all is right. Nothing lost, nor wasted; nothing but a Note to &#x2018;Leipzig H&#xF4;tel de Bavi&#xE8;re,&#x2019; and then another wiser one to Heidingsfeld,&#x2014;both of which you may safely leave to complete their travels into infinite space.</p>
<p>Foxton and I were got to Rostock yesterday 11 a.m. with rather dreadful prospects ahead (8 hours of suffocation in Diligence &#x26;c), when, in a truly miraculous manner, the <hi rend="italic">Gn&#xE4;dige Frau</hi> [gracious lady] of this place picked us up; bore us along, angel-like; dropped Foxton in Stralsund (intending for Berlin vi&#xe2; Stettin), and landed me safe here bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 9 &#x26; 10 p.m.,&#x2014;into the celestial possibility of a little sleep, and in fact into the best quarters in the world, and the strangest when I consider it this morning.</p>
<p>Foxton will probably arrive about the same time with you at the same Hotel in Berlin,&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">H&#xF4;tel d&#x2019;Angleterre</hi>&#x201C; he called it, &#x201C;British H&#xF4;tel&#x201C; you (our old quarters, I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi>): if you find him there, give him what comfort you can, poor good soul, very well affected to me of a truth, but utterly with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> help for me! For the rest, if he have any plans of his own, let him execute them; for he is good for nothing, except as an adjunct, in our strenuous Enterprise; and has nothing like the &#x201C;strength&#x201C; a certain Herr had to manifest once before in the like case!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., Neuberg&#x2019;s &#x201C;strength&#x201C; during TC&#x2019;s trip to Germany in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520905-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:268&#x2013;69</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-06">6</date> <date when="1852-09-05">[5] Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> Other a good and friendly man. &#x201C;Will stay ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a week in Berlin, and wait&#x201C;:&#x2014;by all means see him at least, and be a consolation to him.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Herr</hi> von Usedom is at Berlin; returns hither <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi> (not till then, if then): I must first hear <hi rend="italic">him</hi> on all points, take all his help &#x26;c; I <hi rend="italic">then</hi> move towards Berlin to meet you, and go to business <hi rend="italic">stracks</hi> [immediately].

<salute>Dear Neuberg</salute>
<p>Here is your second Note, signal of your actual arrival; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great comfort to me. Yesterday I had written again, in my impatience; the posts go, not &#xE0; la Rowland Hill but as if drawn [by]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> tortoises, in this Country!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear of your illness; from what hints you give, it is a similar case to what has befallen myself since I reached these quarters: a &#x201C;horizontal position&#x201C; is for me also the best: I am however got steadily better by dint of care.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 29.</note></p>
<p>The hospitality of this Herrschaft [Master of the Household] is so extreme, I cannot yet prevail upon Usedom to let me <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> a day for meeting you at Berlin: he intends accompanying me so far, and will be useful there in certain points;&#x2014;one day will do the journey thither: but &#x201C;Shall it be Friday, then (day after tomorrow)?&#x201C;&#x2014; I perceive there is but little likehood<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of certainty in that; tho&#x2019; I will still <hi rend="italic">try.</hi> Saturday is likelier: for Saturday I will make a still more vigorous trial. But be not impatient! <hi rend="italic">Bleibe sitzen</hi> [remain seated] (<hi rend="italic">liegen</hi> [recumbent] rather); I will go nowhither <hi rend="italic">else;</hi> one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (Saturday if possible) the worn figure of me will darken your door.</p>
<p>Consider Breslau (if you can get a map, as I have): How we are to do <hi rend="italic">Liegnitz,</hi> Striegau, Molwitz, Leuthen;&#x2014;thence how one is to get to Sohr, Czaslau, Kolin, Prag:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liegnitz, Silesian city now in SW Poland, where Frederick defeated the Austrians, <date when="1760-08-15">15 Aug. 1760</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:263&#x2013;78); Striegau, Silesian town now in SW Poland, 30 mi.

<p>I hope, Dear, that you have stood it as well as I have! and that I shall hear to that effect tomorrow&#x2014; There may be a letter now lying for me perhaps: but none are delivered here on Sundays.</p>
<p>I left London at nine on Friday morning&#x2014;in a quiet and cheerful frame of mind&#x2014;having arrived at the station, without hurry, a quarter of an hour before the time, accompanied by Charlotte and Nero (who <hi rend="italic">would</hi> come to see me off) and met, on descending from the cab, by first, George Cook and then Larkin (!) with a fresh gathered bouquet&#x2014; The former had offered his services before I left Bay House&#x2014;but Larkin was quite unexpected. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle likewise had offered to see me off &#x201C;if I had nobody&#x201C;; but I was charmed to say <hi rend="italic">I had somebody!</hi> for he was &#x201C;very much detached&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Fanny Burney, <hi rend="italic">Evelina, or A Young Lady&#x2019;s Entrance into the World</hi> (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>) 2:192.</note> descending on one &#x201C;like not one crow, but a whole flight of crows&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Plutarch, &#x201C;Cicero,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Lives,</hi> trans. John Dryden, rev. A. H. Clough (<date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>) 222.</note>&#x2014;asking distracted questions and making equally distracted suggestions, all with a little air of ineffable selfcomplacency enough to drive Job to despair. Especially he secretly maddened me with repeated offers to let me know <hi rend="italic">your</hi> movements&#x2014;and when I said I hoped to hear direct from yourself&#x2014;he would not <hi rend="italic">take that in</hi> for more than a moment, &#x201C;Oh! he will write to <hi rend="italic">you?</hi> (!!)&#x2014;Yes! Yes! I suppose he will!&#x2014;Yes&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">Perhaps he may</hi>! but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall hear first&#x2014;I dare say I shall hear first&#x2014;I dare say you havn&#x2019;t given him the right address&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Lann Hall Tynron Dumfries!&#x2014;</hi>very wrong to put only Tynron&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;(But my letters to that address have always gone.)&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes&#x2014;Yes&#x2014;perhaps&#x2014;I dare say&#x2014;but its a wrong thing not to put <hi rend="italic">Thornhill&#x2014;</hi>depend upon it a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> wrong thing&#x201C;!&#x2014;Oh <pb id="pg-34-164" n="34:164"/>what a plague of a man! Each time I saw him, he left me with the feeling of having been whipt with a flail!&#x2014; Imagine his suggesting finally that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle would miss me at Carlisle! and &#x201C;what did I think I would do then?&#x2014;&#x201C; What I did at the moment was to thank Heaven that &#x201C;a previous engagement &#x26;c&#x201C;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> would have thrown me into a fever before ever I had started! &#x201C;Ah Dio <hi rend="italic">amo gli uomoni tranquili</hi> [Ah God, I love quiet men]!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> miss me&#x2014;before I was well out of the carriage an arm was put quietly round my neck and my face brought close to her kindly smiling one&#x2014;a waiter stood behind her to take immediate charge of my luggage and in two minutes I was in a beautiful <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> sitting room of the County Hotel&#x2014;and she was putting tea in the teapot&#x2014;and when I had put off my bonnet and shawl in the adjoining bedroom there was brandered chicken ham &#x26;c &#x26;c all ready for me&#x2014;my bed had been so <hi rend="italic">aired</hi> that the sheets were actually <hi rend="italic">warm.</hi> I slept wonderfully considering the squealing of Trains&#x2014;hardly awoke with them!&#x2014; I had been sleeping very ill at Cheyne Row&#x2014;and was very thankful I had made up my mind to be off again&#x2014; Next morning when I was thinking about getting up&#x2014;a white child-looking figure glided in thro the door opening into M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringles bedroom and sat down on her knees, at my bed side in night clothes and fell to kissing me! She is a very curious woman this M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle&#x2014;so enthusiastic and so calm, almost to outward chillness! so cultivated in mind and so deficient in all <hi rend="italic">accomplishment&#x2014;</hi>so devout and so liberal&#x2014; She will serve me to study for all the time I stay&#x2014; We went after breakfast to see the Cathedral<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlisle Cathedral, established 1133</note> and heard some beautiful music; service being going on&#x2014; It was market-day and I looked all about to see if Jamie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Carlyle, rather than James Austin; both were farmers.</note> might perchance turn up&#x2014;but without result!

It is a beautiful Place this, and the kindest Hostess that ever was seen&#x2014;and there are three charming little boys<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Pringle&#x2019;s sons.</note> of whom Nero would be dreadfully jealous if he saw <pb id="pg-34-166" n="34:166"/>how much I make of them.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I expected to have heard from you a second time before now. Your first Note hither came on friday morning; I answered instantly, and fancied my Note might reach Berlin almost as soon as yourself. That, I now find, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not do; nor did I much expect a letter yesterday: but this morning I expected to have heard for certain from the British Hotel, your &#x201C;Here I <hi rend="italic">am!</hi>&#x201C; Pray write me instantly when you do arrive.&#x2014; I should not have written today; but I have an unpleasant fear my former Note may have been <hi rend="italic">misdirected:</hi> &#x201C;H&#xF4;tel d&#x2019;Angleterre&#x201C; instead of &#x201C;British Hotel,&#x201C; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I find are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> synonymous by any means!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delays in the mail had caused confusion between TC and Neuberg. Neuberg wrote from Bonn, <date when="1858-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Your letter of the 25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> arrived a day later than it should have done. &#x2026; I know not therefore whether this will still reach you at Rotterdam; but, will at all events, send you a hasty line of hearty welcome on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> side the German ocean.&#x201C; Neuberg continued with advice on travel, suggesting a detour: &#x201C;These Dutch Cities and the Dutch Country generally are well worth looking at. The Hotels generally are comfortable (they make you capital beaf-stakes) and, on the whole, if you cannot immediately proceed on your Up-Rhine journey, it is what I should advise, and should, at all events, do myself. / Unless a letter from Rotterdam gives me exact information about your journey hitherward, I will wait quietly for you here. / And so, once more, welcome!&#x201C;</note></p>

<salute>Dear Charlotte</salute>
<p>I sent you, on my arrival here a few lines, inclosed to our Postman (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bullock) about a little gold ring, I hoped you might find for me in my bason-stand or somewhere. And I hoped to have heard from you, yes or no, before <pb id="pg-34-168" n="34:168"/>this. The ring is of little value in itself, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> valued it highly for the sake of the person<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Mazzini.</note> who gave it me. and should be rejoiced to hear that it was found</p>
<p>It is not about <hi rend="italic">that</hi> however that I write today; but to tell you that I dont expect M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle will stay long in Germany, and that you must get on with your house-sorting&#x2014;that you may not share the fate of the seven foolish virgins in the Scripture who were found with their lamps untrimmed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 25:1&#x2013;12.</note></p>
<p>It will be a great shame to you, if you have not the house perfectly sorted when we return&#x2014;having for so long had no family to attend to but Nero.&#x2014; In particular, I wish you would give the drawing room grate not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> but several good scourings&#x2014; I did not at all admire that state in which you were letting it lie over till wanted!</p>
<p>If the people at Waterloo House<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Halling, Pearce &#x26; Stone, famous drapery emporium at the junction of Cockspur St. and Pall Mall E; see also <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531229-JWC-TC-01"><sic>28:365</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1853-12-29">29 Dec. 1853</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> have not sent home the bed-tick;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strong mattress cover.</note> you had better ask M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gilchrist<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Gilchrist.</note> (if she have returned) or M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Royston to be so kind as hasten them about it; for it would be better to fill it in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyles dressing room as you proposed&#x2014;and at the same time, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> rooms ought not to be left till the last moment.</p>
<p>I dont remember the <hi rend="italic">name,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Waterloo House</hi> near Charingcross is direction enough</p>
<p>In the last letter I had from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle he said it was likely he would get thro all he had to do in Germany in a couple of weeks&#x2014;I dont know yet whether he will go straight to Chelsea or come back thro Scotland and pick me up. But even if he do come this way he wont like putting off more time here. And if he go home by himself, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should put off no time in returning. So you see the need of letting no grass grow under your feet! I think myself it will probably be three weeks before we return, but <hi rend="italic">as</hi> it may be <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> less you must be prepared for that&#x2014;</p>
<p>When you have put down the carpet in the drawing room don&#x2019;t bring out any china or little things&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is dangerous for <hi rend="italic">breaking</hi> when he has the run of the house.</p>
<p>When you clean the furniture ask M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newnham to mix you some beeswax and soap, as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> knows how&#x2014;and then use it <hi rend="italic">very sparingly</hi> indeed, having first <hi rend="italic">carefully washed the furniture with soap and warmish water&#x2014;</hi>you should rub up the fourposted beds as well as the dining room chairs &#x26;c&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you saw how all the things <hi rend="italic">do shine</hi> in this house! and yet I should say by the look of her face, that the housemaid here is neither so active nor so clever a girl as you are! and she is but some two or at most three years older But the <pb id="pg-34-169" n="34:169"/>Lady<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Pringle.</note> is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> particular and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have things right about her; and I observe that those who demand most of their fellow creatures always get the best attended to! which does not say much for human generosity&#x2014;</p>

      <salute>Oh my Dearest,&mdash;</salute>
      
      
      It is above a week since you heard of me; and I, unhappy that I am, have not heard from you one word since the day before you were to quit Bay House! God knows how my own poor Jeannie is, or even where, all this while; and many are the heavyladen anxious tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> I direct towards you: but it is all to no purpose; nothing but &ldquo;Dresden&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do anything for me in that essential respect; and Dresden is still (as matters have now gone) far from my hand! Oh my Dearest, may the like never happen between us again; may this be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> journey I take into foreign tumults and horrors, far away from all I love, and all that is really helpful to me.&mdash; But we will <hi rend="italic">write</hi> to Dresden; there will be means of getting the <hi rend="italic">Poste Restante</hi> there to deliver up any treasure it may have, surely within a week hence, and <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I get thither myself. Courage, courage; in a couple of weeks more I may be almost <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of this unblessed jumble of an expedition, and near home as a man that has done it. Only be thou well, my Dearest, and all shall be well!&mdash; But to my narrative in prose.</p>

      The Usedoms in R&uuml;gen were the kindest of Hosts to me; and the place and circle there had its interests and advantages: but, alas, I fell unwell, the day after writing to you; bathed in the Baltic, on the back of all my Hamburg and other adventures; caught cold (<hi rend="italic">had</hi> already caught it, but developed it by the vile &ldquo;bathe&rdquo;); felt as if I were getting into a fever outright,&mdash;and had to take decisive measures; namely <hi rend="italic">calomel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">castor,</hi> tho&rsquo; in a foreign house! That did prove effectual; but you can fancy what a two or three days I had;&mdash;the rather as they made me do the &ldquo;picturesque&rdquo;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01">

The Herr von Usedom is a fine fat substantial intelligent and good man; we really had a great deal of nice speech together, and did beautifully together; only that I was so weak and sickly, and except keeping me to the picturesque, he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not take almost any wise charge of my ulterior affairs. <hi rend="italic">At length,</hi> Friday afternoon last, he did set out with me towards Berlin and practicalities: &ldquo;To stay overnight at Putbus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Resort town and royal residence on the S coast of the Isle of R&uuml;gen.</note> the Richmond of R&uuml;gen, and there catch the Steamer for Stettin (& thence rail to Berlin) next day.&rdquo; We got to Putbus, doing picturesques by the way: a beautiful Putbus indeed; where I had such a night as sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be long memorable to me: big loud h&ouml;tel,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Crown Hotel; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 41.</note> sea-bathing lodgers with their noises, including plenteous coach-horses under my window, followed by noises of cats, item of brood-sows, and (at 2 a.m.) by the simultaneous explosion of two cochin-china cocks, who continued the play thenceforth, and left me what <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> you can fancy in such quarters. Never till the end of things may I visit Putbus again!&mdash;However, next day&rsquo;s (yesterday&rsquo;s) steam voyage and rail d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> was pleasantly successful; and at 10&frac12; p.m. I found the useful Neuberg here, who had secured me my <hi rend="italic">old</hi> apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in this good inn (&ldquo;British Hotel,&rdquo; unter den Linden);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Street in Berlin; for TC&rsquo;s previous stay in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> at the British Hotel, see <sic>27:313 and 316</sic>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You have heard nothing direct from me since that short Note directly after my arrival in Hamburg: I bade Neuberg write to you some 3 days ago; and his news w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> satisfy you about my existence and <hi rend="italic">befinden</hi> [condition], till now that I have the chance (once more within the range of swift posts) of writing you a word myself.</p>
<p>I have had a terrible time of it with <hi rend="italic">strapazen</hi> [fatigue] and <hi rend="italic">beschwerlickkeiten</hi> [burdensome things], especially with that fatal impediment, want of sleep! At Carzitz among the Usedoms in <hi rend="italic">R&#xfc;gen,</hi> I had a regular &#x201C;biliary crisis,&#x201C; feverish cold &#x26;c, needing <hi rend="italic">calomel</hi> &#x26; its accompaniments: very poorly &#x26; miserable for 3 days; but now I am out of that again, and beginning to run up a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> account, perhaps on surer terms than immediately on leaving Annandale with its kindly native ways. I got hither yesternight (10&#xBD; p.m.), found Foxton &#x26; Neuberg waiting, like greyhounds on the slip;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi> 3.1.</note> and Tomorrow morning (Monday 8&#xBE; a.m. towards C&#xfc;strin &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Zorndorf</hi>) we think to be off, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the first of our dozen &#x201C;battlefields.&#x201C; Or if it be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> difficult, we will <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> the first; &#x26; pass on towards Breslau &#x26;c: the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="italic">d,&#x2014;</hi>for time passes, and there must be at least no loitering now.</p>
<p>Neuberg says he gave you our list of stages as near as he could: Breslau for 2 or 3 days; thence to Prag and neighbourhood (N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> gave the approximate dates &#x26; <hi rend="italic">hostels,</hi> he says); thence to Dresden where <hi rend="italic">Poste Restante</hi> must afford me Letters;&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there are only two <hi rend="italic">fields</hi> both in the Leipzig quarter, <hi rend="italic">Rossbach</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">Torgau:</hi> these ended, we gallop off homeward, by Antwerp I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess; and are in London, if all prosper, about the 20-30 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> some time. Would to Heaven we were <hi rend="italic">there!</hi> Ach Gott, he sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a cunning fellow that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get me into the like of this again.&#x2014; If you did join us ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Prag, Dresden, or any of the places possible, doubt not it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a gladdest moment to me: but for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own sake, how can I advise it? My notion is, you will be far better in Brompton Row; and if you sit steady there, and things go not quite <pb id="pg-34-174" n="34:174"/>awry, in about a fortnight hence you might expect to see me turn up of of<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> my own accord there!&#x2014; I have written to Jane again today; you can report at Chelsea to little Charlotte that I am possible or likely &#x201C;within a fortnight,&#x201C; and that she must have the bed &#x26;c ready. Were we but there, were we but there!</p>
<p>I am dreadfully ill off for news; not the least whisper since I left home, so perverse have been the arrang<hi rend="italic">ts:</hi> God grant I did hear <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news of my poor weak Jeannie and you all. &#x201C;Dresden, Poste restante&#x201C; still; I am thinking to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> thither, and <hi rend="italic">get</hi> at once any Letters there may be.</p>
<p>Berlin is hot and close; a goodly jingling and rumbling here &#x201C;Under the Lindens,&#x201C; where two of my windows are open. Varnhagen &#x26; Painter Magnus I have to call on (civility prescribes); then on Usedom, who accompanied me yesterday: but all the Berlin world other is supremely indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to one with such a nervous system as mine now is. Courage, let us get done with it! N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> is not well; but he will carry me thro&#x2019;; <hi rend="italic">returns</hi> to London with me, and will be a great convenience. Foxton is luggage; but luggage that has to carry <hi rend="italic">itself.</hi></p>
<p>Much Berlin politics I have heard, much <hi rend="italic">R&#xfc;gen</hi> small talk (agreeable acquaintances the Usedoms): but all this will keep till we <hi rend="italic">meet,</hi>&#x2014;meet, if Heaven please! Let Annandale let Jean<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken.</note> &#x26;c know of me <hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;mprim&#xf9;m</hi> [as soon as possible], and of my changes, regards, my inexpressible confusions, hurries &#x26; botherations. God bless you, dear Brother, you &#x26; them all. <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<dateline>Lann Thursday [<date when="1858-09-09">9 September 1858</date>]</dateline><salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I have looked forward for three days back, to getting a <hi rend="italic">call</hi> on you accomplished this day, when the carriage should be going to the Station to bring back a visitor.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> And now it turns out no weather for anyone so good at catching cold as myself to go out in&#x2014;especially as there would not be time to get myself warmed and <hi rend="italic">changed</hi> on coming in&#x2014; The MacTurks<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert and Janet McTurk.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c being appointed to Luncheon at 2 oclock&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-175" n="34:175"/>But the same visitor has to be taken to the Station on Saturday&#x2014; Thank Goodness!&#x2014; So I calculate confidently on seeing you then&#x2014;for even if the day is bad, as there is no &#x2018;Lunch&#x2019; after, it won&#x2019;t signify so much. And I will tell you then, what day I will go to you to be &#x201C;under your own roof&#x201C;&#x2014;when I expect that your present system of calling me &#x201C;Mam&#x201C; and all that sort of thing will terminate of a sudden and we shall find ourselves in the old sisterly relation to one another&#x2014; You cant imagine how queer I feel it being so near you and not with you&#x2014; Tho&#x2019; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle does all that mortal can to supply length of kindness with warmth of kindness. I mean; to make up for being a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> friend by being a good one&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have promised her not to fix a day for going to you bodily&#x2014;just now&#x2014;and indeed until I hear again from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and know <hi rend="italic">his</hi> programme I cant scheme out my own. But my present notion is, I shall be with you the end of next week&#x2014;if it suit you then&#x2014;</p>
<p>We went to Craigennputtoch yesterday&#x2014;Ach!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Every day we go somewhere&#x2014;or somebody comes</p>
<p>My love to your Husband who, my dear, understands me better than <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do, begging your pardon!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> would never dream of calling me &#x201C;Mam&#x201C;&#x2014;and growing ceremonious at this time of day</p>

<p>Yesterday&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">delivery</hi> was the only one all the week that I did not wait for with a certain impatience. Yesterday, when &#x201C;the tutor&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of the Pringle children; otherwise unidentified.</note> returned from the post, I was not at the pains to come down to hear his tiresome &#x201C;nothing for <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201C;! so your letter was welcomed with the undeserved honours of a pleasant surprise! I was sure of it! knew, without being told, that the <hi rend="italic">bathe</hi> in the Baltic had given you cold. You ought to know by this time, that just the more you feel drawn to do these rash things, the more you should keep yourself from doing them! God grant this wild-huntsman rush over germany dont spoil all the good you got in quiet Annandale! But you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to do it! Would not have finished your Book in peace without having done it!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-176" n="34:176"/>Larkin writes to me yesterday that he has every hope now that the Map of Prussia with its old and its present boundaries<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580708-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1858-07-08">8 July</date></ref>.</note> &#x201C;will turn out better than he expected&#x201C;&#x2014; He had had to make a great rush at the British Museum, not knowing till he went there on the 28<hi rend="italic">th</hi> that the Museum would be closed for the first week of September.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly connected to the installation of hot water pipes in the King&#x2019;s Lib., for which the Treasury had granted &#xa3;750 in July.</note></p>
<p>I saw Eaves about the horse before I left, but he could not go out to Richmond till the following Sunday, when he got a good ducking to settle his account for the Sunday-breaking. He had no difficulty in finding the Horse, who was &#x201C;in capital condition,&#x201C; and &#x201C;as nimble on his feet as the Irishman&#x2019;s flea&#x201C; He (the horse) has no end of pasture to roam about in, and has &#x201C;found a friend&#x201C;&#x2014;formed a romantic attachment to another horse of his own way of thinking; they are always together, both in their feeding and their playing and evidently enjoy their liberty and their abundant grass. So you may be quiet happy in your mind as far as the blessed horse is concerned. Charlotte is behaving herself quite well so far as I can ascertain&#x2014; The sparrow whom I did design to train to flying and &#x201C;eventually&#x201C; to <hi rend="italic">flying away,</hi> died before my return from Bay House&#x2014;but the poor little canary has recovered health and feathers under the nursing of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Huxham&#x2014;in whose &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bosom</hi> it spends several hours every day,&#x201C;&#x2014;I should think not too happy hours!&#x2014;</p>
<p>To conclude about the live stock; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am as well here as I was at Bay House, tho&#x2019; terribly off for weather!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <sic>15:25 and 30:225</sic><corr><ref target="volume-15/lt-18420817-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1842-08-17">17 Aug. 1842</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-26">26 Nov. 1855</date></ref></corr>.</note> But a carriage that can be close or open as one likes, with a man and pair of horses that are not considered, nor consider themselves, &#x201C;either sugar or salt,&#x201C; that they should mind the rain, is an immense compensation for the wet days I have had&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest, one&#x2019;s life here is remarkably cheerful. It is the very loveliest glen, I ever saw, endeared to me by old associations. The people in it are all remarkably prosperous, and were always hospitable. They are glad to see me again and I am glad to see them. The practical result has been a perfect explosion of <hi rend="italic">Lunches,</hi> to my honour and glory, all over Glenshinnel<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glen through which Shinnel Water flows, Penpont parish, 10 mi. NW of Dumfries.</note> and Glencairne!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glencairn, a parish 3 mi.

It makes me feel younger by twenty years! I catch myself <hi rend="italic">laughing</hi> sometimes with a <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> that startles <hi rend="italic">myself,</hi> as being not like my own but my Mother&#x2019;s&#x2014;who was always so much gayer than I&#x2014; Indeed it is good for me to be here! and I wish my visit had come off while you were at the Gill that you might have tried it too. Better <hi rend="italic">material</hi> accommodation you could have no where and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle has tact and consideration enough, I think, to have suited the moral atmosphere to the shorn&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Lamb</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See &#x201C;God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,&#x201C; Laurence Sterne, &#x201C;Maria,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">A Sentimental Journey</hi> <hi rend="italic">through France and Italy</hi> (New York, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>) 386.</note>(?)</p>
<p>The question is now about your journey home? Are you going straight to London? If that is decidedly the most convenient way for yourself; of course I should not so much as suggest your returning by here&#x2014;and so far as my own journey back is concerned I should rather prefer doing it &#x201C;all to myself&#x201C; (as the children say) perhaps I might choose to stay a night at Liverpool: at all events I might need to have a window shut when you preferred it open<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561006-JWC-MR-01"><sic>32:6</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1856-10-06">6 Oct. 1856</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But if you liked to return by Leith and to be a little longer in the <hi rend="italic">country,</hi> under easy circumstances, you could not do better than stop <hi rend="italic">here&#x2014;</hi>about your welcome you may feel the most exuberant assurance.</p>
<p>If you decide to go straight to London, I should know as soon as possible: that I may shape my own course accordingly&#x2014; For I should not like your being <hi rend="italic">done for</hi> by only Charlotte&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a week&#x2019;s visit promised to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2014;and I also undertook to stay a few days at Scotsbrig in case D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and his &#x201C;poor Boys&#x201C; lingered on at London till the end of my time here. I will see Mary and Jane<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin at The Gill and Jean Aitken in Dumfries.</note> on my road back. But I need to give myself as little <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> travelling as possible not to be going and catching a cold after all these mighty efforts to strengthen myself&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Donaldsons and my Aunts<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s godmother, Jess, and her sister, Jean Donaldson, in Haddington; and Ann, Elizabeth, and Grace Welsh in Edinburgh.</note> wont believe I can mean to go away without seeing them&#x2014; To see the dear old women at Sunny Bank once more I would gladly incur the <hi rend="italic">expence</hi> of the journey there&#x2014;but that is the least of it&#x2014;the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">tasking</hi>&#x201C; myself which Betty<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> so strongly protests against <hi rend="italic">must not</hi> be ventured&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have had just <hi rend="italic">one</hi> perfectly fair beautiful day since I came (last Wednesday) and I spent it in an excursion to&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;Craigenputtoch! we took some dinner with us and eat it in the dining room!&#x2014;with the most ghastly sensations <pb id="pg-34-178" n="34:178"/>on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> part!&#x2014; The Tenant<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Common.</note> was at Dumfries&#x2014;the Wife very civil&#x2014;the children confiding to a degree!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Their</hi> Father &#x201C;had <hi rend="italic">wine</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;whiles took ower muckle&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x2014;We called on the Austins and Corsons<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Austin family at Carstammon and Samuel Corson (b. ca. <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>) and Margaret Corson (b. ca. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), farming at Nether Craigenputtoch, who had six children by <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>.</note> nobody knew me!&#x2014;could guess me!&#x2014; Peter<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Austin.</note> said I micht hae spoket to him seven year, and he wouldna hae found me oot&#x201C;!

<dateline>Brieg (Lower Silesia) <date when="1858-09-10">10 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (friday) 1858</date></dateline>
<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Having a little time here, at the turning point and <hi rend="italic">ultima Thule</hi> of our journey, I will write thee a few words,&#x2014;the first since I was at Berlin 6 days ago. For four days <hi rend="italic">more</hi> I must wait before any news is possible from your side; no help for it; we have written to Dresden to &#x201C;forward to Prag&#x201C;; on the 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> surely to Heaven there will be tidings of my poor little woman. I try to keep hoping: what can I do?&#x2014;</p>
<p>We quitted Berlin, under fair auspices, monday morning last; fortified with a general Letter from &#x201C;the Prince&#x2019;s Aide-de-camp&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustav von Alvensleben (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>).</note> to all Prussian Officers whatsoever: but hitherto, owing to an immense <hi rend="italic">Review</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Review of the troops; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 48.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> occupies everybody, it has done us less good than was expected. At C&#xfc;strin, that first monday night, a benevolent Major<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> did attend us to the Field of Zorndorf, &#x26; <pb id="pg-34-179" n="34:179"/>shewed us everything: but in other places hitherto the &#x201C;the review at Liegnitz&#x201C; has been fatal to help from such quarter. We have done pretty well without;&#x2014;have seen 3 other fields, and had adventures, of a confused, not wholly unpleasant character; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Goody, please Heaven, shall one day hear. Our second place was Liegnitz itself (full of soldiers, oak-garlands, coloured lamplets, and expectation of &#x201C;the Prince&#x201C;)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his journal: &#x201C;Nothing but endless tissue of Oakgarland, climbing, hanging horizontal, with coloured lamplets and illumination delicacies &#x2026; waiting to blaze forth at &#x2018;nine in the evening,&#x2019; when an august Prince should arrive . &#x2026; All Liegnitz, young and old, rich and poor, seemed to have turned out &#x2026; intent to <hi rend="italic">smell</hi> the Prince of Prussia&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 57); the &#x201C;august Prince&#x201C; presumably Wilhelm, prince of Prussia.</note>: we were <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the Battlefield, and could use our natural eyes; but for the rest had no guidance worth other than contempt. Did well enough, nevertheless; and got fairly <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of Liegnitz, to Breslau, Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been headquarters ever since (a dreadfully noisy place at night), out of which were excursions&#x2014;yesterday to Leuthen (the grandest of all the Battles); today hither, about 50 miles away, to Molwitz the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of Fritz&#x2019;s Fights; from wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we have just now returned, and have to wait for some kind of dinner, then for a train back &#x26;c: Tomorrow, if it please God, I quit Breslau again forever and a day: one other place in Schlesien [Silesia] (Striegau, they call it), then across to Prag (with Letters from Goody, ah me!),&#x2014;after Prag to Dresden, (probably 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of the month); and then there are but <hi rend="italic">three</hi> places more to do; and one turns homeward, full gallop, so glad to be out of all this with the life still in one!&#x2014; Home in Chelsea probably about the 20th of the month;&#x2014;and I will come to Tynron to seek my poor Goody if that is desirable to her; and we shall be quiet and thankful in our own house again, if the good Heavens permit! Ach Gott!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Sleep is the great difficulty here; but one does contrive some way. Occasionally (as at C&#xfc;strin) one has a night &#x201C;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is rather exquisite&#x201C;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430615-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:198</sic><corr>JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-06-15">15 June 1843</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but I lie down in the daytime, sleep better next night; in fine struggle thro&#x2019;, one way or the other. I do not think it is doing me much hurt; and it lasts only some ten days now. As to profit&#x2014; Well there is a kind of comfort in <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> what one intended. That at least is achievable.&#x2014; The people are a good honest modest set of beings; poorer classes, especially in the country, much happier than with us: every kind of industry is on the improving hand; the land (mainly sandy) is far better tilled than I expected. And oh the Church-steeples I have mounted up into, and the barbarous jargoning I have had, questioning ignorant menkind! Leuthen yesterday &#x26; Molwitz today, with their respective steeples and adventures, I shall never forget. Adieu Dearest, till I get back to Breslau: I will now (after smoking) try for a little <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> till dinner; being in an upper <hi rend="italic">room expressly</hi> intended for that object.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-180" n="34:180"/>Breslau, 11 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (10 a.m.) 1858</p>
<p>I finish this with endless flurry &#x26; haste in my upper room, <hi rend="italic">bedroom</hi> 5 stories high, in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Goose</hi> (zur Goldnen Gans)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goldene Gans, 13 Junkern Strasse.</note> in this ancient Slavic city, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (thank God) I hope to quit in about an hour forevermore. Three nights; not good, and the last (after my Brieg<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now Brzeg, town in Silesia, SW Poland, SE of Breslau on the Oder River.</note> Excursion) was by no means the best. However I am <hi rend="italic">r&#xfc;stig</hi> [vigorous], roadworthy: <hi rend="italic">Striegau</hi> Battle today; and then we bend across the mountains,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Riesengebirge.</note> and are in Prag 3 days hence,&#x2014;news from my Darling waiting me there? God grant it be good news!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is as queer an old City as you ever heard of. High, as Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or more so; streets very strait and winding: roofs 30 feet or so in height, and of proportionate steepness, ending in chimney-heads like the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of a Butterfirkin, set on its side.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has drawn a tiny ink sketch of a chimney head above &#x201C;on.&#x201C;</note> The people are not beautiful; but they seem innocent and obliging: brown-skinned scrubby bodies a good many of them, of Polack or Slavic breed, more power to their elbow. You never saw such Churches, Rathhouses [town halls] &#x26;c,&#x2014;old as the Hills &#x26; of huge proportions. An <hi rend="italic">island</hi> (in the Oder here) is completely covered with Cathedral &#x26; Appendages.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dom-Insel; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> 66.</note> Brown women with cock noses, snubby in character, have all got straw hat-umbrellas, crinolines &#x26;c as fashion orders, and are no doubt charming to the house men.&#x2014; Plenty to <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> my poor Goody, had I once got speech of her again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Please forward that at once (simply in a cover &#x26; stamp) to Chapman.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified enclosure.</note> Neuberg is a perfect Issachar<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Son of Jacob and Leah; see Gen. 49:14.</note> for taking labour on him;&#x2014;needs to be led with a strongish curb. Scratchy Foxton &#x26; he are much more tolerable <hi rend="italic">together:&#x2014;</hi>grease <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> vinegar; that is the rule.

<salute>Dear Charlotte</salute>
<p>It is one of the natural attributes of <hi rend="italic">girls</hi> to like Balls and all that sort of thing; so having taken a girl for servant, I must not wonder at her propensities!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-181" n="34:181"/>I have no objection to your going to this Ball, provided as you propose, that your Father<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Southam, Charlotte&#x2019;s uncle, who had adopted her.</note> will take care of the House for you&#x2014; But you must on no account leave it to take care of itself&#x2014;</p>
<p>It <hi rend="small-caps">was</hi> taking care of itself <hi rend="italic">one</hi> night when M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hawkes<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilie Hawkes.</note> made a great row at the door, and could get no answer!</p>
<p>We have dreadfully rainy weather&#x2014;but mercifully there is a <hi rend="italic">close</hi> carriage as well as an open one so I still get some driving daily</p>
<p>I hope you are attending to the ceiling in the spare bedroom&#x2014;to get M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chalmers<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Francis Chalmer, a helpful neighbor next door.</note> to look at it if any more wet come in&#x2014;</p>
<p>Also you should let off all the water from the upper cistern from time to time&#x2014;a quantity of stagnant water is not desirable in the house</p>

I believe they are to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour and glory these flare ups, but anything serves here for an occasion to make a feast.

<p>My journey was altogether prosperous, in spite of its being undertaken on a Friday&#x2014;except indeed, that I lost a ring from my little finger&#x2014;given me by Mazzini&#x2019;s Mother seventeen years ago, and engraved with the Young-Italy watch-word &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">ora e sempre</hi>&#x2019; [now and always]&#x2014;</p>

<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has been lost to that knowledge of his family and friends for more than ten days. retained by the blandishments of Olympia Baroness von Usedom, at her Shloss [castle] in the Island of R&#xfc;gen.

<p>In that case as I dont think he will return by Leith&#x2014;I may prepare my mind for returning to that horrid Cheyne Row where I am always ill and generally miserable! <closer><salute>My kindest regards to your Mother<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Larkin.</note> ever affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>This, you may believe, was a right pleasant morning to me. I had missed two nights sleep in succession; and last night on arriving here was in the saddest plight; but by the superior arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of the place got six good hours to start with again, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was itself a cheerful feat. Then going out to &#x201C;Poste restante,&#x201C; I found your Letter; actually got sight of your little hand again; and heard of your safe arrival in Tynron, and of your first night&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> there! I should not like to have such three weeks of uncertainty and guessing soon again; not one whisper had I heard from the time of leaving Scotland, or rather 4 days before it. Your &#x201C;sunday&#x201C; I find was the 22<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of August,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, Sunday, <date when="1858-08-29">29 Aug.</date></note> that first <hi rend="italic">sea</hi>-day of mine, when all was tumbling about in our dirty machine, and poor Foxton like the rest of the world lay sick and puking,&#x2014;I hidden in an upstairs crypt of <hi rend="italic">hencoops</hi> to at least have fresh air, and avoid a like fate. Alas, it is again above 3 weeks;&#x2014;but I hope to find something better tomorrow night at Dresden: pray Heaven the news it brings be only as good. Mrs Pringle seems to be the Queen of Hostesses; tell her that my obligations to her are great and lasting for the good work she has done upon you.&#x2014; Today there came a Letter from John too, dated five days later (27 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi>): but it contained of course nothing that you had not told me,&#x2014;except, what was rather bad, that Jean&#x2019;s Boy Jamie had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got the &#x201C;place&#x201C; he seemed clearly in view of at the <pb id="pg-34-184" n="34:184"/>time I went away. A sorish disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> upon poor Jean, who has her share of such just now to bear.</p>
<p>From Breslau, where I wrote, our adventures have been miscellaneous, our course painful but successful. At Landshut<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About 45 mi. SW of Breslau.</note> (edge of the <hi rend="italic">Riesengebirge</hi>) where we arrived near 11 the first night, in a crazy vehicle of one horse,&#x2014;you never saw such a scene of squalid desolation. I had pleased myself with the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of a cup of hot milk, such as is generally procurable in German inns: <hi rend="italic">Umsonst</hi> [in vain]; no milk in the house, no nothing;&#x2014;only a <hi rend="italic">ruhiges Zimmer</hi> [quiet room], not <hi rend="italic">opened</hi> for weeks past (by the smell of it), and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I judged by the description must abut on Cochin China Cocks; as N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> by sad experience found it do.

This is a grand picturesque Town, this Prag, in good part Bohemian:&#x2014;tomorrow before noon we hope to be quite out of Bohemian limits, and one of us will not be easily persuaded thither again.&#x2014; Today we had our own difficulties in getting master of the &#x201C;Ziscaberg&#x201C;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hills overlooking the E of Prague.</note> &#x201C;Sterboholi&#x201C;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Area of swamp below the E slope of Ziscaberg (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:128 and map opp. 223); scene of fierce fighting at the battle of Prague, <date when="1757-05-06">6 May 1757</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:133, 134).</note> and other localities of the <hi rend="italic">Battle</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> young Ladies play on the piano: but on the whole it was light compared with the throes of yesterday.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I write you a word from this strange old Bohemian City to indicate what terrible revolutionary hurlyburly has taken place in my affairs since that peaceable drive we had thro&#x2019; the precincts of Dumfries on the day you went northward.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580806-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1858-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580809-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-09">9 Aug.</date></ref></note> About a week after (Saturday 21 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, a dismal enough day to my lazy mind and body) I fairly took shipping in a Leith Steamer for Hamburg; arrived there after three of the most sordid days conceivable by human nature in bad weather at sea;&#x2014;and am roaming about ever since, in quest of &#x201C;Friedrich&#x2019;s Battlefields,&#x201C; my main wish and hope the humble one of <hi rend="italic">getting done</hi> with &#x201C;seeing&#x201C; them. Travelling in this country belongs to younger and healthier men; this is the last excursion of that kind I calculate on making while I live. Thank God, we have now <hi rend="italic">done</hi> 10 or so of those phenomena; and were 3 more done, I am a free man, bound for Antwerp and the Steamer to London again.</p>
<p>Hamburg is really a grand old merchant Town, cobbled together by Teutonic effort during the last 1,000 years: could I have got any sleep, in the trough-beds and distracting noises of the place, I should have enjoyed it much, and found abundant significance in the old physiognomy of it. From Hamburg thro&#x2019; Mecklenburg, by Schwerin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town about 60 mi. E of Hamburg.</note> and Rostock, is mostly cheerful flat but wood-fringed country, far better tilled than I expected; population much given to tobacco in railways; food and lodging unacceptable to the dyspeptic mind. At Rostock, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a fine old thriving seaport (as good as Greenock<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Port on the Clyde estuary, about 22 mi. NW of Glasgow.</note> or the like), the hospitable Frau von Usedom, whom I think you know, sublimely lay in wait for me; and right willing was I to go with her,&#x2014;for in truth I was nearly over with it, and longed for a human sleeping place as for the <hi rend="italic">summum bonum</hi> [highest good]. They retained me in their blessed Island of R&#xfc;gen (place sacred to <hi rend="italic">Hertha</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hertha Castle in Jasmund, part of the Isle of R&#xfc;gen, apparently sacred to Hertha, the earth-goddess; Tacitus refers to Hertha in <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> chap. 40.</note> formerly, in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they kept the white-horsed chariot spoken of by Tacitus): Herr von Usedom, who is an excellent solid and yet free-flowing brother mortal, made me faithfully do the picturesque in R&#xfc;gen, and talked de <hi rend="italic">omni scibili</hi> [of all that is knowable], accompanied me next to Berlin; where I rallied my staff (Neuberg equal to six Couriers for useful help, &#x26; Foxton a Welsh Englishman good for <hi rend="italic">neutralising</hi> <pb id="pg-34-187" n="34:187"/>Neuberg); and since Monday morning gone a week we are diligently upon the march; incessantly, thro&#x2019; multifarious obstacles, getting forward with the poor problem, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is now bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> near perfection, thank Heaven. Yesterday&#x2019;s work was the hardest job of all; Kolin and environment,&#x2014;undertaken after a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sleepless night; with no help but spavined horses, wicker chariots, lying thieving mendacious sluttish Czechs, not one in the hundred of whom spoke or understood the least word of German: an ugly unprofitable people. Not soon again shall I forget the Battles of Chotusitz and Kolin! Today, still under Czechish influence, but far more <hi rend="italic">resistible</hi> today, we did the Battlefield <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> a beautiful <hi rend="italic">drive,</hi> were there nothing more in it; and the thing fairly ascertainable, and manageable in spite of Czechs. Sunday morning last we drove many hours with the <hi rend="italic">Schneekoppe</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain, 5,200 ft., N side of the Riesengebirge.</note> (source of the Elbe) always in sight;&#x2014;crossed the Elbe at nightfall, not much bigger than the Itchin<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >River nr. The Grange, Hampshire.</note> there; and alas, came to a horrible inn, amid Czech <hi rend="italic">gents,</hi> nastier creatures than even the London are!&#x2014; The fact is, I have seen a good few interesting things and persons, were the soot-torrents once washed away from them in one&#x2019;s mind;&#x2014;and some day, in a ride, I hope to tell you this and that. By the end of about another week, I hope to be nearing <hi rend="italic">Antwerp,</hi> and have the London Steamer full in prospect: that is the best.&#x2014;&#x2014; If Miss Baring, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will not hope, ever play the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Prague,</hi> here is an authentic wild pink plucked for her on the actual Battlefield today.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever,</salute></closer> <name>T.

<dateline>Thornhill Dumfries / Thursday [<date when="1858-09-16">16 September 1858</date>]</dateline><salute>Dear Charlotte</salute>
<p>Your letter hit me today in the most beautiful manner just in the transit from the Place where I have been these three weeks, to this Place where I shall stay some days at least. I have only, a few minutes as usual for writing in; but if I wait till tomorrow the Sunday intervenes and you will not be able to get any letter till Monday.</p>
<p>The winter stock of coals had best not be ordered till I return and can see about the price &#x26;c, but if you are in danger of running out altogether, you must order a ton from Aldin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Isabella Jane Alldin, coal merchant, Arch-house Wharf, Lombard St., Chelsea; presumably the widow of Henry Alldin; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451008-TC-JWC-01"><sic>20:17</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1845-10-08">8 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> to be brought in on Monday morning&#x2014;that the oil cloth may be put down clean in time for Mr Carlyle. I have no further news from him; indeed ever since he went abroad, my knowledge of his movements has been gained chiefly from the newspapers<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent to her by TC instead of letters; see also <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580820-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-20">20 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;he has been too hurried and flurried for writing&#x2014;</p>
<p>If he keep to the intentions he expressed in his last letter to me he will be home to you next Monday&#x2014;that is the 20<hi rend="italic">th,</hi> but I hope you will receive some direct instructions from himself, thro&#x2019; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle.</p>
<p>I should like that he had stayed away a week or two longer that I might have been home to receive him; but not expecting him so soon, I have staid all my time at one place and have several friends and relations to visit still before I leave this country. and it would be a pity to have incurred so much expence of travelling for less than a month&#x2019;s stay. Besides <hi rend="italic">hurry-scurrying</hi> back in time for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> would probably undo any good I have got by coming</p>
<p>So I must just trust to your making him comfortable for a week or so; and the week after next I will return; and relieve you of your <hi rend="italic">responsibility</hi> at least.</p>
<p>You know his ways and what he needs pretty well by this time. Trouble him with as few questions as possible&#x2014; You can ask him whether he will take tea or coffee to breakfast?&#x2014;and whether he would like broth, or a pudding to dinner? you must always give him one or other with his meat. and either an egg to breakfast or a slice of bacon. I think you can now cook most of the things he likes oftenest boiled fowl, mutton broth, chops and bread and ground rice puddings&#x2014; If you take pains to please him I have no doubt you will. And if he look fussed and <hi rend="italic">cross,</hi> never mind, so long as you are doing <pb id="pg-34-190" n="34:190"/>your best; travelling always puts him in a fever. and nobody can look and speak <hi rend="italic">amiably</hi> with sick nerves&#x2014; I myself know and so do you, a young Lady called Charlotte Southam who whenever she is <hi rend="italic">sick,</hi> and has a headache, looks exactly as if she were ever so <hi rend="italic">sulky!</hi> and I dare say she isn&#x2019;t sulky tho&#x2019; looking it! any more than M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cross</hi>&#x201C; tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> it to perfection!</p>

<salute>Dear Charlotte</salute>
<p>I suppose you will have heard about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyles coming, as soon as I did, from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014; He says in his letter to me, which I received last night, that he means to sail on Wednesday and twenty four hours more will bring him to Chelsea&#x2014; So he may be expected on Thursday some time.</p>
<p>I dont remember any thing more to tell you; but shall commit you to Providence and your own good sense; which I know to be <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> the emergence!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Sarah Anderton had said of herself; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580922-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1858-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref></note> if you make a point of keeping <hi rend="italic">it</hi> (your sense) <hi rend="italic">awake</hi> and <hi rend="italic">alert.</hi> I mean to be home the beginning or middle of next week&#x2014; If it were only to help M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to <hi rend="italic">find</hi> all the things he will have <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> by that time!</p>
<p>Speaking of losses I have found my ring! In packing my boxes to leave Lann Hall something fell out of the new silk dress which had not been once worn&#x2014;and on looking at the bottom of the drawer to see what it was that had jingled; behold my poor little ring! come back to me as if from the other world! It had slipped off when I was packing my portmanteau at home&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had a severe and dangerous illness since I wrote to you the other day! If I had not been in the house of the only good Doctor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Russell.</note> I know I should not have got over it so soon&#x2014;if at all!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-34-191" n="34:191"/>It has quite snubbed my conceit about my <hi rend="italic">wellness</hi> However, I hope to reach home as strong at least as I left it. and am taking good care of myself to that end. You had better have a fire in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s bed room the first night. and put the fire in the dining room&#x2014; <closer><salute>yours truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>&#x201C;Let him that standeth on the house-top &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201C;!&#x2014; Ach! yes! dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin. I was standing on the top of the topmost chimney-pot of the house-top. and did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;take heed,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 102:7 and 1 Cor. 10:11.</note> till I found myself lying all of a heap on my Mother Earth, with such a dust raised about me as you have seldom seen!&#x2014; Which means without metaphor, That my very brilliant carreer in these parts has suddenly been cut short by an attack of Inflamation&#x2014;which would probably have saved myself and &#x201C;others&#x201C; all further trouble with me, had it not befallen in the house of a D<hi rend="italic">r!</hi> the one living Doctor I know, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> know of, in whom I have retained confidence. His judicious treatment and unceasing cares at the beginning and his wifes devoted nursing prevented the malady gaining ground, and I am up now&#x2014;after only two days and a half in bed&#x2014;about as well as I was before&#x2014;only a little uncertain on my legs, a little confused with the effects of morphia, a little less conceited about my &#x201C;improvement,&#x201C; and a great deal less impatient to set out for London! Set out I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> however as early as is consistent with ordinary prudence&#x2014;for the idea of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle going about at home, <hi rend="italic">seeking things</hi> like a madman, and never finding them! and of his depending on the tender mercies of Charlotte for his diet&#x2014;leaves me no rest&#x2014;partly on Charlotte&#x2019;s account, I confess, as well as on his own!&#x2014;</p>
<p>So far as I can make out from his programme written in the style of <hi rend="italic">The Lamentations of Jeremiah</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., a poetic lamentation; the five chaps. of The Lamentations of Jeremiah follow Jeremiah in the Old Testament.</note> he will arrive at Chelsea some time of Thursday&#x2014;He will sail from Antwerp on Wednesday he says &#x201C;if not sooner&#x201C;&#x2014;and &#x201C;twenty four hours more and then&#x2014;&#x201C;! &#x201C;then he will be at Chelsea,&#x201C; I fancy this to mean.</p>
<p>I write to tell you, that you may go and see after him on Friday&#x2014;and be a Mother to him poor Babe of Genius, till I come, which will be in the beginning of next week I expect&#x2014;if all continue to go well with my bodily affairs&#x2014;<pb id="pg-34-192" n="34:192"/>You need not give Charlotte any more board-wages&#x2014;she will live with her Mother<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her aunt, Elizabeth Southam.</note> on <hi rend="italic">tick</hi> as usual, till I come and resume the charge of that unhappy household.

Besides D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell was here to take good care I committed none! Can you figure any thing <hi rend="italic">more</hi> fortunate than my taking this illness&#x2014;since it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to be taken in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> house!&#x2014; Such a Doctor and such a Nurse &#x201C;all to myself&#x201C; (as the children say)!

What a blessing to Society is such a phenomenon; It reminded me of the good ald time when my childish mind could conceive of no higher mission than to &#x201C;ride about and see the folk&#x201C;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When she rode around Haddington with her father on visits to his patients; see Hansons, <hi rend="italic">NE</hi> 5; Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 46.</note> Not one useless question did that man bother me with, and not one necessary question did he omit to ask&#x2014;his quiet, clear decided manner inspired me with such faith in him that I would have swallowed prusic acid or strychnine at his bidding And so he gives me the character of &#x201C;a perfectly excellent patient.&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">C&#x2019;est Selon</hi> [That&#x2019;s the way it is]!&#x2014; As for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2019;s nursing it was as anxious and devoted as my own Mother&#x2019;s!</p>
<p>The practical deduction from all which is, that you must send D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> as soon as possible and be sure to write his name in it with your own hand,&#x2014;God knows if you dont owe him my life!</p>
<p>My original plan was to have spent a few days at Scotsbrig on the way home&#x2014;after staying over one night at Mary&#x2019;s.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin at The Gill.</note> But altho&#x2019; I am now as well as I was before my attack&#x2014;indeed better than I was during the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of my three weeks at Lann, where sleeplessness had again overtaken me, and I was having pains in my stomach and bowels&#x2014; Still, after such a blow to my conceit about my &#x201C;improved health&#x201C; I feel timerous about fatigues and exposures&#x2014;Changing my bed more than can be helped travelling in an open gig at this season&#x2014;risking being caught in the rain is not for the like of me! So I write <pb id="pg-34-194" n="34:194"/>today to ask Jamie to come<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Scotsbrig.</note> and see me at the Gill on Tuesday. I mean to leave here by the early train on Monday. Stop at Dumfries to see Jane<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken.</note>&#x2014;get on to Mary&#x2019;s before dark&#x2014;(there is a train about five I fancy) stay over Tuesday at the Gill (in expectation that Jamie can come) and then straight to Chelsea next day (Wednesday)</p>
<p>I made a stir to get away from here the day after tomorrow but D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell protested quite seriously against my travelling so soon after my illness. And since I could not be there to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> you, a day or too sooner or later would make small difference in fact. Meanwhile what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> you to do about <hi rend="italic">finding things?</hi> Charlotte is rather good at <hi rend="italic">finding!</hi> take her up gently, tell her what you want <hi rend="italic">in plain English,</hi> and I have no doubt you will find her very docile and &#x201C;quick at the <hi rend="italic">up take.</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>There are not all the usual silver spoons out&#x2014;but you will make what you have <hi rend="italic">do.</hi></p>
<p>It was stupid in me not to leave the key of the wine cellar in some accessible place&#x2014;but I never contemplated your being home <hi rend="italic">first&#x2014;</hi> It is hanging up (I <hi rend="italic">think</hi>) on a nail inside of the side-board drawer next the door&#x2014;the nail is on the side of the drawer facing your left hand, far back&#x2014;grope for it and you will find it. The key of the drawer I have here in my pocket fortunately and send it enclosed, so you will have no search to make for <hi rend="italic">it.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">sherry</hi> is furthest off on your left hand as you enter the cellar&#x2014; There is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> Brandy you know. Some bottles of whisky are in a long, narrow box I think, there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> wax on them</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have been roving about in Germany, absent in Scotland &#x26;c; and did not till last night get hold of your valuable little Note, dated &#x201C;12 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> New York,&#x201C; with the symbol of <hi rend="italic">Fourteen Pounds Sterling</hi> in it. You are very punctual always; and I am sorry not to respond (as has been my fate the two last times)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580609-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1858-06-09">9 June</date></ref><sic>; see appendix</sic>.</note> <pb id="pg-34-199" n="34:199"/>with the <hi rend="italic">cor</hi>responding promptitude. Pray believe me that it is the effect of accident, and that I shall do better in time coming.</p>
<p>I have not been here before since the end of june:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC left for Dumfriesshire, <date when="1858-06-23">23 June</date>; see <sic>33:248&#x2013;49</sic><corr><ref target="volume-33/lt-18580623-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1858-06-23">23 June</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580624-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, 24 June</ref></corr>.</note> I fled to Scotland at that date, having got the dreary first instalment of my Book<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</note> rolled off my hands, and myself not killed by it; I lay absolutely dormant there for two good months, in hopes I was considerably mending; then came this sore expedition into Germany (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of Friedrich&#x2019;s Battlefields,&#x201C; forsooth), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has lasted into the fifth week,&#x2014;and left me with a profound headache, this morning, for one thing.&#x2014; &#x2014; My Wife is still in Scotland; but is expected now in a day or two: she has been in poor health again; but professes, good soul, to have fortified herself a little against the coming winter, in those quiet native regions. I believe, too, I myself am rather better; in spite of the horrors of German Travelling, the greasy tepid cooking, the preternatural <hi rend="italic">beds</hi> (or torture-beds), and other practical stupidities of that good Country,&#x2014;acting on a man of distracted nerves!

<p>I <hi rend="italic">got</hi> your Letters at last yesterday afternoon Poor little soul, all is right at last; and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have omitted nothing. A blessing indeed, that you were with Dr Russell on that occasion: Heavens, what w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have become of my poor little Goody in some lodgings she has been in! Perhaps you will actually now be better; that crisis may have proved a <hi rend="italic">clearance:&#x2014;</hi>only take care, take care! It seems you will not be advised by me, but hurry hither to your post: well, can <hi rend="italic">I</hi> blame it? But ask Dr R.&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> counsel, and follow it, as to what you are fairly able for. Whether you had not better <hi rend="italic">break</hi> the long ride by express train, and stop at Liverpool? I tremble for that Express train! The days are bright, hot to inconvenience; but the nights are fairly <hi rend="italic">frosty,</hi> pernicious to the like of you; and you do not get to Euston Square till, I think, 9 or 10. Consider it, Dear; I am not in the least want of anything; busy up aloft here at my old <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> Table (thank somebody for that too); Charlotte manages like a right wise little handmaid:&#x2014;and I have my quiet bed; worthy to be called &#x201C;celestial&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500927-JWC-TC-01"><sic>25:235</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1850-09-27">27 Sept. 1850</date>]</corr></ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121, 348.</note> in comparison with late experiences, even when you lie awake.

<p>I hope the key reached you, and that your fatigues are wearing off. and that Charlotte proves up to the occasion.</p>

<p>This note I will post at Dumfries&#x2014;so you will know me so far on my road home.</p>

<p>I expect Jamie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle.</note> to come and see me at the Gill on Tuesday&#x2014; On Wednesday night it is, that I mean to be home&#x2014;</p>
<p>Please order a fire in my bed room on Wednesday morning, and the bed and blankets to be laid before it. I must not catch cold the first night&#x2014;if possible.</p>
<p>Moreover <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to come to meet me.

<p>I leave here tomorrow, but stay over tuesday at that same <hi rend="italic">Gill</hi> where M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was so long&#x2014;</p>

<p>I never saw such a thing in all my Life! I plunged into a carriage full of illbred disobliging English tourists&#x2014;they would make no room for me, with my bee-hive and all my little things! I had to force a way for myself, and my <pb id="pg-34-206" n="34:206"/>belongings, and when I had got my hands freed, and turned round to shake hands with you, before I sat down, behold the door was shut, and you had disappeared and we were in motion! I could have <hi rend="italic">cried</hi> for vexation, and could not get it out of my head all the road to London, that I had come off without a word of thanks for your kindness to me, or a word of leave taking! And I felt such a destation<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of these broad <hi rend="italic">hatted</hi> women in the carriage with me, whose disobligingness has been the cause of my flurry.</p>
<p>I went to the guard at Carlisle, and told him I would not go on with these people, and should like to have a carriage all to myself&#x2014; He seemed quite taken with my assurance, and asked if I could put up with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Lady beside me? I said &#x201C;Yes&#x2014;if she were not troublesome.&#x201C; He took me to a stout gentleman (the clerk at Carlisle I suppose) and said &#x201C;this Lady wishes to have a carriage all to herself!! but she would <hi rend="italic">allow one</hi> Lady with her.&#x201C; The gentleman said &#x201C;it was a very natural wish, but he did not see how it could be gratified however, if I would keep quiet beside him, he would see what was possible&#x201C;! and the result was, I got a carriage with only one Lady in it!!&#x2014;Nothing like a modest impudence for getting one on in this world!&#x2014; So far from objecting to the quantity of my luggage, they asked &#x201C;was <hi rend="italic">that</hi> all?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC has glued here a piece of paper on which he has written: &#x201C;Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date> (I home from Germ<hi rend="italic">y.</hi>&#x201C;</note> had I nothing more?&#x201C; and they put up <hi rend="italic">my</hi> things quite softly, whereas everybody else&#x2019;s, I noticed, were pitched up like quoits!&#x2014; The result is, that not so much as one egg was broken!&#x2014;and much satisfaction was difused over the house by the unpacking of that improvised hamper! When I found how much at ease I was in my carriage I regretted not bringing away that kitten! It might have played about! But <hi rend="italic">wasn&#x2019;t</hi> I thankful, prudence had prevailed, when I found myself already the enviable mistress of a kitten exactly the same size, but black as soot!! Charlotte had taken the opportunity of my absence to discover &#x201C;there were mice in the house&#x201C; and bring home a new pet to herself! The dog and it are dear friends for a wonder.

<p>Besides the Train did not behave itself at all like an <hi rend="italic">Express&#x2014;</hi>stopping at a great many places and for long whiles.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> my Dear! Will you ask &#x201C;the Doctor&#x201C;; what the Devil is the reason that when I travel from London to Scotland, I get quite fresh to the journeys end, however weakly I may have been at starting, But when I do the same journey back again, I am tired thro every fibre of me, and don&#x2019;t get over it for days? I do begin to believe London a perfectly poisonous place for me, and to wish that the projected Pimlico Railway <hi rend="italic">may</hi> actually tear our house up, and turn us adrift in Space!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1858-07-00">July 1858</date>, the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway Co. was established by act of Parliament to build a station nr. Victoria St., Pimlico (on the N side of the Thames), for the use of all S and SE coast railway companies, and a connecting line and bridge to Pimlico Station in Battersea (opened <date when="1858-03-00">March 1858</date>) on the S side of the Thames. Grosvenor Bridge, opened <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, at the same time as Victoria Station, is less than 1 mi. E of Cheyne Row.

<p>My little visit to Mary Austin was very pleasant. But I was obliged to <hi rend="italic">put on an additional box</hi> at the Gill, to hold the fresh eggs (!) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pookit fools,</hi>&#x201C; and other delicacies she loaded me with! Then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle had left an enormous bundle of new clothes to come with me!&#x2014;the produce of the indefatigable exertions of <hi rend="italic">three tailors</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580712-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-12">12 July</date></ref>.</note> whom he had kept sewing for him at the Gill for <hi rend="italic">four weeks!!!</hi> besides a large package of books! So I made the journey with <hi rend="italic">six</hi> pieces of luggage! <hi rend="italic">not</hi> counting my writing-case, travelling bag, and the bee-skepp, which last I let nobody carry but myself. It arrived in the most perfect state. I told M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C you had sent him &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">improper female</hi>&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">honey;</hi> and I think he is greatly charmed with your immoral present. I took out some for immediate use, but I think I will not displace the rest&#x2014; Dont you think it will keep best covered up, just as the Bees placed it?</p>
<p>My bit of ham too, that you would hardly let me take; has given high satisfaction, he helped himself three times this morning. But then <hi rend="italic">he</hi> cuts it as thin as gold leaf! How kind you are my Darling and that blessed Husband of yours, that everybody is pulling different ways at once, how good and <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> he is for me always!&#x2014; Is M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Patterson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the mother of James Paterson (b. <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>?) of Barrowsgate farm, nr.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>My Wife came almost a week ago; seems fairly a little better than when you last saw her. I am kept incessantly spinning about in a whirl of small matters; and have seldom a minute (except in sleep) when I am fairly at leisure. Come on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> we will then have a little speech.</p>
<p>Bookseller Chapman warns me today that the Book must go to press again, &#x201C;without delay, both volumes at once.&#x201C; This shews what a discerning public we have;&#x2014;and crowns so old a head as mine with sad remembrances and a kind of contemptuous weariness rather than otherwise. &#x201C;Ach mein lieber Sulzer, Er kennt nicht &#x26;c &#x26;c [Ah my dear Sulzer, you do not know]!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580603-JWC-TWO-01"><sic>33:234</sic><corr>JWC to TWO, [<date when="1858-06-03">3</date> and <date when="1858-06-06">6 June</date>]</corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:337.</note>&#x2014;However, do not fail to bring our <hi rend="italic">Errata,</hi> such as you have noted, all in precise order, that I may correct these at least, and deliver the thing out of my hands.</p>
<p>In these days I have found <hi rend="italic">Abel&#x2019;s</hi> little Tract upon <hi rend="italic">Names:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Friedrich Otto Abel, <hi rend="italic">Die deutschen Personen-Namen</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>); TC&#x2019;s copy: HCC.</note> I think you must let me keep that,&#x2014;get it bound up with other things of a like size, to be safe and accessible. That is to say, unless <hi rend="italic">another Copy</hi> for yourself is unattainable.</p>

<salute>Dear Chorley,</salute>
<p>They are going to print that Book again, to start almost immediately: we will have a great many <hi rend="italic">hyphens</hi> cut out of it, for one thing; &#x201C;Old-Dessauer&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leopold I (<date when="1676-00-00">1676</date>&#x2013;<date when="1747-00-00">1747</date>), prince of Anhalt Dessau, called &#x201C;the old Dessauer&#x201C;; Prussian field marshal for both Friedrich Wilhelm and Frederick the Great; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:327&#x2013;32.</note> and and<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> some others!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you can give me any help in regard to more important errors (one or two I myself am aware of, thanks to you for one), now of course is the time. Both Volumes are to go on together, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear; but we will take what time is necessary,&#x2014;were the hurry still greater than I believe it is.</p>
<p>Epecially<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> if you had any <hi rend="italic">general rule</hi> (about <hi rend="italic">hyphens</hi> or other things) to give the Printer, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to see it,&#x2014;for he is a man Capable of understanding such a thing, &#x26; following it.</p>
<p>I have been in a whirl of hurries, with a great many small matters, ever since my return; but hope to see you soon after so long an absence.</p>

You may believe me, you and all my Edinburgh friends, I am not insensible to this honour: but the sad truth is, I cannot come.

If a little change could be admitted wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> mend it, I should like;&#x2014;sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to try at any rate. But after all it is a fact of no interest, <pb id="pg-34-215" n="34:215"/>importance, or almost meaning, to the English reader of Fr<hi rend="italic">h&#x2019;s</hi> History,&#x2014;to confuse whom with commentary on such a point w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> error perhaps than what is already written amiss. If you know the place name it; if not, never mind it farther.</p>
<p>I find in Map II (the only I have yet looked at) a good many other misprints of Names; these must be rectified: I think of getting from Mr Larkin a <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> of the 2 maps<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581013-TC-HL-01">TC to HL, <date when="1858-10-13">13 Oct.</date></ref></note> to send them to you as Proofsheet.</p>

<p>I do not myself see anything to hinder your <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Thousand as proposed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</note> But you had better write to Forster upon it; Forster, I suppose, will have to be at the settling about these new finance questions as before,&#x2014;and I am far too busy for thinking ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> them just now.</p>
<p>I have written to Robson, earnestly requesting despatch; and indicating &#x201C;two months&#x201C; as my own guess.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have meant this long while to write to you, so soon as the hurlyburly would a little abate and now I had better proceed at once than wait farther. I might have written, with more seeming composure, out of poor old native Annandale, where I was not long since: but there I always felt so sad of heart, and several things (especially poor Jane&#x2019;s health here in London) were so uncertain with me, I never like to infect you with these humours. I am now home after unusual wanderings, one job (or half of a job) <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> the other not <hi rend="italic">begun:</hi> before beginning, I will ha[ve] a word with dear old Alick, faithful Brother Wayfarer wi[th me on this] Earth almost from my first starting,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s brother Alexander Carlyle was b. <date when="1797-08-04">4 Aug. 1797</date>, 20 months after TC.</note> and whose unalterable lo[ve] responded to by my own, is one of the sacred treasures I have still [left] here.</p>
<p>[Th]ose two V[olumes of] <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> were by far the hardest job ever laid <pb id="pg-34-219" n="34:219"/>upon me, even in the best of my strength; often enough I thought, within the last two years I have been pulling and toiling, that I sh<hi rend="italic">d never</hi> get thro&#x2019; it. I had to ride very diligently, and be <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> too; or that sad prophecy might have come true! However, they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> now done, those two Volumes (and people all reading them, with much noise wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I take care to hear little of);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner visited the Carlyles, <date when="1858-10-16">16 Oct.</date>, and wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1858-10-22">22 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Old Sir Francis is almost enthusiastic about Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, says that [it] is by far the best thing C. has done. He generally thinks and speaks of him as a wild man&#x201C; (Woolner 154). Sir Francis Palgrave (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-34/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21157"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archivist and historian.</note>&#x2014;and there are still Two more to be done (perhaps two years of hard work, if I still live); but they are not nearly so difficult, I expect, as the former were, if I can only keep my strength so long!&#x2014; &#x2014; I got out of these first Two Volumes in june last, or mainly out of them, for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> share: but the Bookseller did not <hi rend="italic">publish</hi> them till quite lately, the beginning of this month. A Copy (two big volumes) was sent off to you, and another to Sister Jenny (according to the old rule in such cases), duly <hi rend="italic">addressed,</hi> a fortnight ago. When they will get to you I cannot guess, nor by what route the Bookseller ultimately [will send] them; but upon <hi rend="italic">some</hi> route they actually are; and you need not be impatient for them farther. I suppose a Yankee Copy,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. by Harper &#x26; Bros.; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref></note> <hi rend="italic">cheap,</hi> [may be] procurable, if you are too ea[ger] [letter torn] A se[ ] is also [ ] way at its fastest; the people (for the first time in their lives and mine) having made a kind of <hi rend="italic">run</hi> upon my ware. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> amou[nts] to a little prospect of <hi rend="italic">money,</hi> but not of any other kind of profit or pleasure to me.&#x2014; Tell Tom, too, that I have some more volumes for him;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vols. of the cheap edn. of TC&#x2019;s works for Thomas, Alexander&#x2019;s eldest son; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570813-TC-AC-01"><sic>33:26</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1857-08-13">13 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> that there is still another of his set to publish; and that so soon as it is out, I mean to despatch the whole by post as formerly.&#x2014;</p>
<p>The instant I had got done with my part of the Task, I ran off for Annandale; end of june last;&#x2014;quite worn to the [gro]und, and in very great need of rest. John, with some of his Boys, was at Scotsbrig; otherwise perhaps I had aimed thither: as it was, I made for The Gill; and continued about two months there, as <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> as a dry bone; sauntering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in strict silence, riding a little, reading a little;&#x2014;peaceable, but in the natural sadness of humour all the time. Jane, whom [ ] was in very feeble state,&#x2014;as she is generally, poor thing, for [ ]&#x2014;and I had a great deal of writing and anxiety [ ] her; nearly all the <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> I could prevail on myself to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> [ ] is now fa [ . Jane] came to Scotland about the end of August (just when I was <hi rend="italic">leaving;</hi> so badly had we ordered it): I now have her here safe again, a little stronger against the winter-storms that are coming. Jean came often out to me from Dumfries; three times or so I rode over to Scotsbrig for an hour or two; Dr and Jamie came [ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>] as often to see me: from all the rest of the human species I was silent &#x26; withdrawn. A man at 63 has a strange feeling when visiting his native <pb id="pg-34-220" n="34:220"/>country,&#x2014;as of a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> coming back to the Earth! I rode one day, market-day, thro&#x2019; [An]nan; did not see one soul whose face was known to me; only the old stone-walls were familiar; and strangers gazed at my &#x201C;wide-awake&#x201C; hat and old grey beard,&#x2014;asking, as their fathers or grandfathers would not have needed to do, &#x201C;Who&#x2019;s that?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; All our kindred were rather well in Annandale, and doing well. The Railways in that Country still keep farming profitable; <hi rend="italic">California Gold</hi> (that is it, I privately believe) keeps all &#x201C;trade&#x201C; in a kind of [ ]. Jamie of Scotsbrig is a tight little fellow [ ] greyish as becomes that age; manages his sheep-hus[bandries] spl[ ] with evident success, and indeed is a very [ ] quietly este[emed.

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row <place>Chelsea</place> [late <date when="1858-10-00">October 1858</date>]</dateline><salute>Dear Lady Stanley</salute>
<p>I begin to think myself the victim-character of a Farce,&#x2014;the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Madame Torson</hi>&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> whom everybody has conspired to persuade of something against the evidence of her senses!</p>
<p>It is now more than a month that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has been <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">own house,</hi> palpable, &#x2018;before my eyes,&#x2019; and also very palpable to my ears! and still the first question of all my acquaintance is; &#x201C;how is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C getting on in Germany?&#x201C; or, &#x201C;Does he go into Silesia before his return&#x201C;? or &#x201C;when did you hear from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C?&#x201C; or something to the effect that I am under a hallucination in believing my Husband beside me, or the man that is beside me my Husband!&#x2014; He <hi rend="small-caps">was</hi> in Germany during the first three weeks of September; but put off no time he could help, in a country destitute of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Christian</hi> Beds&#x201C; and anything in the shape of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">human</hi> food&#x201C;! Ten days of the three weeks he passed in a Calypso Island (of R&#xfc;gen), where Madame von Usedom spirited him away in a carriage and four, and where, (the Calypso being <hi rend="italic">scotch</hi>), a <pb id="pg-34-224" n="34:224"/>certain approximation to Christianity in the Beds and humanity in the food appears to have been attainable. The other eleven days he was rushing from Battlefield to Battlefield, like a man chased by Devils! And arrived here in a condition that reminded one of <hi rend="italic">Cruiser</hi> after his fight with Rarey!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Solomon Rarey (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>), horse trainer from Groveport, Ohio, had recently tamed a particularly vicious horse called Cruiser, owned by the earl of Dorchester, who gave him the horse. On <date when="1858-06-28">28 June</date> Rarey showed the tamed horse to Queen Victoria. Cruiser apparently reverted to his untamed ways after Rarey&#x2019;s death.</note></p>
<p>As for me, whom you kindly ask about; I continued in a horrid way, till Miss Baring persuaded me away to Bay House (opposite the Isle of Wight) where in twenty four hours I became all healed&#x2014;like a cracked china basin boiled in sweet milk!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An old method of mending a broken dish was to fit the pieces together, tie them in place with string, and boil them for two to three hours in sweet milk.</note> They were kind as the Angels to me; and the place a Paradise! comparatively. I staid three weeks; then on the strength of my regained capabilities I went to Dumfrieshires (over the border) and staid there five weeks&#x2014;getting myself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">made of</hi>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> which always agrees with my constitution. So that I returned, to <hi rend="italic">fodder Cruiser,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., to look after TC.</note> in a state more <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> the undertaking.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1858-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, that JWC looked better in health but &#x201C;more sad than I think I ever saw her before, in fact it made me feel quite sad to see her&#x201C; (Woolner 153).</note></p>
<p>What do you think of <hi rend="italic">that marriage?</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the engagement of Lord Ashburton and Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie; they were married <date when="1858-11-17">17 Nov.</date></note> Oh dear Oh dear!

If he had only married a natural, good hearted, unpretending woman, who would have looked up to him, instead of a Brummagen edition of the same thing!&#x2014; Lady Sandwich takes it beautifully &#x201C;prepared to adopt as a Daughter any one who will make dear Ashburton happier.&#x201C; She told me Lord A had written &#x201C;such a kind letter about his marriage to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Frances Baring&#x201C;!&#x2014; But I can&#x2019;t see how he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> make a kind letter out of it to <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> unless in promising that he would have only a <hi rend="italic">daughter!</hi> at worst!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hortense Eugenie Claire m., <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s younger brother, Francis Baring.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your grand and unexpected news,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His engagement.</note> you need not doubt, is abundantly interesting here; nor, in its suddenness, and escorted by its echoes in one&#x2019;s memory, could it be otherwise than welcome and of glad omen. &#x201C;Life belongs to the Living,&#x201C; says a wise man; &#x201C;and he that lives must be prepared for changes.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Commonly attributed to Goethe; see also &#x201C;Novalis,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:17.</note></p>
<p>No friend of yours but must have seen with sorrow, little as you complained about it yourself, how in this late time your existence had become such a desert to you in comparison; not a solitude only but, as it were, a desert:&#x2014;some remedy much needed surely, could remedy be found. And now, beyond <pb id="pg-34-226" n="34:226"/>our expectation, here in some fair likelihood it is; a New Era actually rising for you, which may bring the future tense into some similarity to the past; and be a great improvement indeed!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had the honour to see that amiable Lady more than once;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570915-TC-LOA-01"><sic>33:83</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1857-09-15">15 Sept. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> nor has rumour been silent about her many qualities: she is very good to remember me on such an occasion. I beg you to offer her my homages, my congratulations; none can wish more cordially a prosperous and noble course to her under the name she will now bear. For her own sake, and yours, and that of many others, such may well be a general prayer.</p>
<p>I called twice at Bath House,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s London home.</note> on some false prophecy of you there. As matters have turned out, we will not lament the prophet&#x2019;s downbreak; on such terms it is worth while to wait a little. I will say only: May a blessing be on this new Epoch of Your Life; and may nothing but good (or if that is too much to <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> in terrestrial things,&#x2014;may a conspicuous overplus of good) follow from it to everybody!</p>

<salute>Dear Mr Fergus,</salute>
<p>About a week ago, there arrived here a Box, with shipping marks upon it, and a strong smell of intoxicating liquor about it;&#x2014;which contained, when opened, 20 Bottles, and had once contained 24, of excellent Scotch Whiskey. No mark or indication was discoverable from whom this beneficent Article proceeded: but I said at once, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Aut Fergusius aut Diabolus</hi> [Either Fergus or the Devil]!&#x2014;to which the female intellect, tho&#x2019; disposed to raise doubts, could not but incline assent. Happily, at an after stage, there was discerned the <hi rend="italic">Excise Permit,</hi> with a definite name on it, one Paterson of Dunfermline&#x2019;s;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Paterson, grocer and dealer in spirits, 17 Bridge St., Dunfermline.</note> who, application being made to him, pleads guilty; so that the matter is now certain. I can only say, Many thanks for your kind remembrance of me, when you have so much else to remember! There is something very beneficent in <pb id="pg-34-228" n="34:228"/>the little action; for which I am truly grateful (in this bad world, now growing so solitary to one too), and will have a pleasant memory of you,&#x2014;nay <hi rend="italic">shall,</hi> whether I will or not, till the liquor is all slowly spent, at least. Our old stock was not quite out, tho&#x2019; verging that way: of the new I have made my Wife even take a thimbleful, twice over, by way of close to the Day, and each time it has brought her a good sleep,&#x2014;could one but hope it would hold on at that rate.</p>
<p>Paterson declines the high honour I had offered him of <hi rend="italic">replacing</hi> the 4 Bottles spilt by his carelessness: but he may depend upon it, the blame <hi rend="italic">is</hi> his; I have had of <hi rend="italic">bottles</hi> perhaps 300 or 400 sent from Leith precisely in the same way; and of these there was never any broken before, except once simply <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> and this the Wine-merchant instantly made good, with apologies. The mind trusts that Paterson is not yet <hi rend="italic">paid!&#x2014;</hi> On the whole, once more, many hearty thanks; and as the Proverb says, &#x201C;May never <hi rend="italic">waur</hi> be among us!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I came home from Germany about a month ago; a totally broken man. Never was such lodging offered to a thinskinned mortal; never such food; and we went with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> resting, at the top of our speed, in railways full of tobacco for 31 days. The <hi rend="italic">Riesengebirge,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">S&#xE4;chsische Schweitz</hi> [Saxon Switzerland], I found very beautiful,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:52&#x2013;55. Leith wine-merchant: Hutchison &#x26; Co.</note>&#x2014;if I had been at all in quest of &#x201C;beauty.&#x201C; I wished to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> 13 different places, none of them beautiful, and escape home with my life.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have got back my Horse (not in the powerfullest condition), and am endeavouring to get into motion again, if I could. A bit of terribly rough way I still have, if I continue living; but after that, I lie down, and honestly do nothing for the rest of my life. Let us hope Dizzy will bring you back soon,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parliament had been prorogued <date when="1858-08-02">2 Aug.</date> and was not recalled until <date when="1859-02-03">3 Feb. 1859</date>; as an M.P., Fergus would not have been in London during the parliamentary recess.

<salute>Dear Mr Fergus,</salute>
<p>One bounty follows another; there appears to be no end of some people&#x2019;s goodness! Scarcely was the Missive about the Whiskey got under way, when a new Shippers Wagon appeared in this astonished Street; and disembarked from it two huge Barrels,&#x2014;which stand now safe down stairs, and were found to contain <hi rend="italic">solid</hi> provision, as the former package had done liquid,&#x2014;ample stock of Fife Potatoes, namely, and a sack of d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> new oatmeal. The <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> of these articles, I do think, will be pleasant and salutary <hi rend="italic">both</hi> to soul and body!&#x2014; In sober prose truth, we feel all this to be very kind; and are much gratified by such remembrance from an old friend. In my own name and that of another, I am to send you many thanks again,&#x2014;as if that were some kind of payment.</p>
<p>London is fast filling again with its motley populations: the weather is sometimes sharp, sometimes again dirty (as today); but oftenest beautiful, with its pale sunshine amid the red leaves, in a world all fallen silent;&#x2014;beautiful, tho&#x2019; earnest nearly sad; like a serene old-age among us mortals.</p>

<p>My cousin John (George&#x2019;s Son) was here again the other day, and I never felt so hopeless about him&#x2014; His countenance, his voice, manner, everything about him is changed.

He is paler and thinner&#x2014;and from being the shiest, most silent of men he now talks incessantly and excitedly&#x2014;and in this state he goes about, doing his usual work&#x2014;and he <hi rend="italic">left</hi> here the other day <hi rend="italic">after dusk!</hi></p>
<p>I am very grieved about him. He is the only <hi rend="italic">cousin</hi> I have that I have had any pride or pleasure in.</p>

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row <place>Chelsea</place> [early <date when="1858-11-00">November 1858</date>]</dateline><salute>My dear Jamie</salute>
<p>I was near <hi rend="italic">screaming</hi> when I read Isabella&#x2019;s note to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and found you were cherishing ideas of sending meal and potatoes!&#x2014; On no! For the love of god no more meal! no more potatoes! I went out for a drive the other day, and when I came home, there was hardly a possibility of getting in, for great <hi rend="italic">casks</hi> in the passage, and men with flaring tallow-candles, trying vainly to move them! I thought we must have got the forty thieves barrelled up in this devoted house! You never saw such enormous casks! As to getting them down the kitchen stairs it was out of the question, so the assistant<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (called in from the neighbourhood) had to knock the tops off in the passage, empty them, then roll down the empty casks and fill in the contents&#x2014;the casks being the only feasable place for keeping all those dreadful potatoes in! Oh I may well say <hi rend="italic">dreadful,</hi> Jamie Dear; for as sure as I live these potatoes have <hi rend="italic">the disease!</hi> and I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that in a short time they will have to be given to the pigs, and here one <hi rend="italic">has</hi> no pigs! At all events the last thing on Earth that would be welcome to us just now is clearly <hi rend="italic">potatoes&#x2014;</hi>and meal! for at the top of one cask was a &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">bole</hi>&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A boll: measure of oatmeal, about 140 lbs.</note> of meal!!! I gave away the half of <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> the first thing I did, to our next-door neighbour<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Gilchrists.</note> who has little children that like porridge. But I have still more than we should consume ourselves in six years, and am looking out for other meritorious individuals to give some to.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C dines so late at present (often not till seven of the evening) that he cant do with any supper. And I who dine like a Christian female at half after 2 have recently discovered that whisky toddy (good gracious!) and a biscuit is the best supper for a woman puzzled to get to sleep before four in the morning! You would laugh to see me measuring out my whisky in the sort of little glass thing the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> use for measuring laudanum and prusic acid in! I am so afraid of increasing the doze! It is <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> to me in the meanwhile really, but all that sort of thing loses its effect in longer or shorter time. I am not to be called an Invalid at present however, only a delicate woman who mustn&#x2019;t take the least liberty with herself. I am never out of doors after sunset; so I might as well be living at &#x201C;Craig o&#x2019; putta&#x201C; for any parties I get to! I do continue to go out in the forenoons tho&#x2019;; having kept off colds hitherto and my friends are <pb id="pg-34-235" n="34:235"/>very kind to me, in coming to see me at home <hi rend="italic">tho I</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">am</hi> &#x201C;a Vetrinary Surgeon&#x2019;s Daughter!&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi> <date when="1858-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, pbd. a memoir, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; which included the misinformation that JWC was &#x201C;the only daughter of a veterinary surgeon of good fortune, and a lineal descendant of the great reformer, John Knox.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Do you know <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was how you came to get the Illustrated news?

He then tried to smooth me down by showing a letter that had been published in last weeks Illustrated news signed M.D. and professing to be from &#x201C;a townsfellow of Miss Welsh&#x2019;s&#x201C; (poor Miss Welsh what has she done to be so shown up?) now about Birmingham<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;M.

If he had only stopt there but he proceeded to extoll my &#x201C;charms of body and mind&#x201C; (as <hi rend="italic">Miss Welsh</hi> of course) in terms that must make me the subject of infinite merriment I should say!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Museum Excerpts and Tickets:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg&#x2019;s notes and British Museum Lib. call slips.</note> there is nothing said about the poor Kaiser&#x2019;s &#x201C;indigestion of mushrooms,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl VI died from eating mushrooms; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:389.</note> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Bielfeld and others speak.</p>
<p>Your new <hi rend="italic">straw</hi>-paper is not of first-rate quality:&#x2014;here (what I am now writing on) is some of the old, old, or <hi rend="italic">primeval</hi> sort; why, in Heaven&#x2019;s name, did not they stick by that? There certainly was a &#x201C;work of the Devil,&#x201C; driving men upon roads that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lead to nothing,&#x2014;or towards &#x201C;cheap and nasty&#x201C; only, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a very bad goal for all parties concerned. If it be possible to procure some like this,&#x2014;well. If not, continue your experiment upon the <hi rend="italic">newest</hi> sort (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Excerpts are written upon); &#x26; endeavour to <hi rend="italic">choose for the best.</hi> On Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> you may bring me y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> selected specimen or specimens.</p>
<p>The Prussian Book<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Decker&#x2019;s German edn. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (vol. 1), trans. Neuberg (Berlin, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>).</note> looks perfectly well; the paper excellent, tho&#x2019; thin; at least no <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> Engravings to be dreaded!&#x2014; At p.11, I have marked a superficial error, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to some few in Deutschland, will be ugly: &#x201C;The Devil in Harness&#x201C; <pb id="pg-34-238" n="34:238"/>comes from <hi rend="italic">Hamlet,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The quotation is not from <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> but from J. W. Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi> bk. 5, chap. 11, trans. TC; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:359.</note> and the &#x201C;harness&#x201C; means <hi rend="italic">man&#x2019;s-armour</hi> not horse&#x2019;s draught-tackle at all! It sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be &#x201C;in (or im?) Harnisch.&#x201C; Goethe (<hi rend="italic">Wilh</hi>m <hi rend="italic">Meister,</hi> criticism &#x26;c on Hamlet) quotes &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Der Teufel ist in (im?) Harnisch; hat uns alle in Furcht gejagt</hi> [The Devil is in harness; he has put us all in fright]&#x201C;&#x2014; Of course the Text is irremediable to you at present; but perhaps you had better <hi rend="italic">make</hi> the change there, in Table of contents p.11, to shew critics that you are aware of the oversight. An extremely inconsiderable matter, after all! Yours sincerely / (in want of <hi rend="italic">Paper,</hi> and much else) / <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I must insist on that 1/6! I was far from <hi rend="italic">suspecting</hi> that you would suspect me of suspecting that you &#x201C;grudged&#x201C; &#x26;c: but in fine the Book was meant to be <hi rend="italic">franked,</hi> all the Gift Copies of it; and this one must be so, like the others. Mary, I find, has now <hi rend="italic">got</hi> her Copy; some dud of a Bookseller at Annan<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were three booksellers in Annan: William Cuthbertson and Wellwood Richardson, both in the High St., and Robert Watt in Murray St.</note> had kept it lying for almost a month. Jenny also, in Canada, has got hers, and, we may hope, Sandy also.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning and Alexander Carlyle; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581015-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct.</date></ref></note> On the whole that petty affair, loaded with whatever blunders by the follies of surrounding mankind, may be considered <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> as heavier portions of the business are.</p>
<p>I do not hear any more, and indeed have heard hitherto next to nothing but nonsense, as to &#x201C;the popularity, the&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini&#x2019;s reaction was negative; he wrote to Emilie Hawkes, <date when="1858-11-03">3 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I only had time to glance over Carlyle&#x2019;s book and found it unredeemably bad and immoral. It is Feudalism, worship of force, intellectual and brutal. Friedrich Wilhelm the father, made into a hero. &#x2018;C&#x2019;est trop fort&#x2019; [it&#x2019;s too strong]. Besides, as you noticed, the <hi rend="italic">people</hi> does not exist for him; Kings, Margraffs and Burgraffs are all Humanity to him; any corporal drilling men is a remarkable phenomenon, etc.&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Mazzini&#x2019;s Letters to an English Family</hi>, ed. E. F. Richards [<date when="1922-00-00">1922</date>] 114).</note> my next division of money will fall due a little earlier on account of it, and that is the one advantage it has (coupled with more drawbacks than appear at once) to a serious human soul.</p>
<p>I am praying daily I were <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> to Part 2<hi rend="italic">d:</hi> but as yet I shudder to engage again, and only keep poking about the outskirts, timidly skirmishing, or hardly even that. I have still a formidable two years ahead, if I live so long; and after that, I mean to <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> at least <hi rend="italic">hard work,</hi> no more, however long I <pb id="pg-34-240" n="34:240"/>live. My scheme is, To get mainly away altogether out of this ineffable <hi rend="italic">pluister,</hi> where there is less and less left that is helpful or delightful to me. I oftenest think of Scotland for a retreat, tho&#x2019; it is so far away,&#x2014;too far indeed! I wish, however, James w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make <hi rend="italic">practical computation,</hi> some time soon, as to that of a cottage (<hi rend="italic">good</hi> &#x26; sizeable) on the Colvend shore:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580728-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-28">28 July</date></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">grass</hi> for a horse &#x26;c;&#x2014;and I always think some reasonable female creature <hi rend="italic">might,</hi> with care and for honest recompense, be got, to keep the household in trim when one kindled it there. I have to say generally, There could not well any Son of Adam give a <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> account as to Household Service in his time and country, than I here in the crown of the &#x201C;New Era,&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:15&#x2013;16.</note>&#x2014;more power to it!</p>
<p>Poor Jane took cold the other day; risked herself too far, making rearrangements in the House, poor little soul; and now this is the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> morning she has to report herself, &#x201C;Never slept at all.&#x201C; Alas, alas!

<p>Gentlemen,&#x2014;I have received your Invitation to the Burns Festival;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ayr celebrated Burns centenary celebrations, <date when="1859-01-25">25 Jan. 1859</date>, with processions, banquets, and prayers.</note> and beg to express myself very sensible of the honour you do me.</p>
<p>It would have given me great pleasure to assist in any public testimony [&#x201C;expression&#x201C; crossed out], as rational as the times permit, of the reverence [&#x201C;feeling justly&#x201C; crossed out] entertained by Scotland towards this the most gifted of all her sons for some [&#x201C;in these recent&#x201C; crossed out] generations past; one whom she has good right to look upon with pride, and alas also with many other feelings, wherein sorrow, self-reproach [&#x2018;pity, remorse&#x2019; crossed out] and determination to treat her next Gifted One a little more wisely, should not be wanting. [&#x201C;To testify all this to one another and the world is not useless; but useful nor is the method to be quarrelled with, by Festival or such methods as the times permit&#x201C; crossed out]</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, the state of my engagements threatens [&#x201C;will&#x201C; crossed out] to detain me here [&#x201C;in this part of the world&#x201C; crossed out] thro&#x2019; August; and I shall only be able to contribute to your Meeting my sympathies thanks and good wishes.</p>

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row <place>Chelsea</place> [ca. <date when="1858-11-23">23 November 1858</date>]</dateline><salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle</salute>
<p>With a great effort I got up to breakfast this morning, the first time for a fortnight, having again my <hi rend="italic">cold;</hi> and by the disheartening light of a London Fog, I perceived one letter on the table for me, black edged&#x2014;which proved to be an announcement of your Uncle&#x2019;s death!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hunter d. <date when="1858-11-19">19 Nov.</date>, at Bennan, Tynron.</note> His poor Wife<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Hunter.</note> who seemed <pb id="pg-34-243" n="34:243"/>so fond of him! I feel <hi rend="italic">very</hi> sorry for her,&#x2014;if my sorrow could but do her any good! which it can&#x2019;t! I remember when I was there you considered his Life a precarious one; but he <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> so hale and hearty,&#x2014;was so full of kindness, and fun, and life, that day we dined with him,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580903-JWC-CSO-01">JWC to <sic>CS</sic><corr>CSO</corr>, [<date when="1858-09-03">3 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> that the news of his death has shocked me more than my slight acquaintance with him seems to make natural.&#x2014; Do write when you can find time, and tell me if his death was sudden, and what was his malady,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to the death cert., he had been ill for two years and d. of liver disease.</note> and how his wife bears it. And, when you find a fit opportunity, give her my kind regards, and tell her I have a grateful remembrance of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> and her kindness to me, and sincere sympathy with her affliction.&#x2014; Oh Dear! what a comfortable, hospitable cheerful House Bermin<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Bennan.</note> looked to me that day! And what fun we made about &#x201C;Aunt Kates&#x201C; puff-paste, and all that&#x2014;and now&#x2014;!</p>
<p>I have been expecting and wanting a letter from you. Plenty of people are kind to me here&#x2014;very kind; but when one has found a place so good and pleasant for me as Tynron was, one likes to attach a thread (like little Tom Thumb) to the bushes along the road! in plain prose one likes to keep up ones relations with those who made it so pleasant.</p>
<p>I was agreeably astonished yesterday, to receive a call from Mary Hoggan!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Hoggan, a neighbor of Janet Pringle&#x2019;s.</note> She is really a nice creature; and it was like a glass of &#x201C;Champagne&#x201C; to have her sitting here in my own room at 5 Cheyne Row Chelsea!</p>
<p>If you care to hear the last accounts of me &#x201C;from an eye witness&#x201C; drive over to Bellevue<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bellevue, Thornhill, home of Mary and her brother Edward Hoggan (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), Writer to the Signet and factor for the Waterside estate, nr. Thornhill.</note> some day soon; for she was going home this week. From her I heard that the &#x201C;new Tutor&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Irish Tutor&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581030-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1858-10-30">30 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> was come to Lann, and was &#x201C;a very gentlemanly young man&#x201C;&#x2014; So far so good!</p>
<p>It is rather vexatious, don&#x2019;t you think, to have gone and laid myself up so early in the winter? It was Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Picture</hi> that was the innocent ostensible cause! I told you I think of the beautiful Picture of little Friz and his Sister Whilelmina which Lord A <hi rend="italic">would</hi> give me,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580727-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1858-07-27">27 July</date>]</ref>.</note> and which I had no place for in all my house, unless I removed the great Bookcase from the Drawingroom to the room below. It was sent on his return to London exactly at the wrong moment, when the weather had become intensely cold. At least at the wrong moment when there was a remarkably impatient Husband in the case! I would have let it stand on the parlour floor, for my part, until there was fitter weather for a household Earthquake. But every day M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C suggested; <pb id="pg-34-244" n="34:244"/>&#x201C;My Dear when are you thinking of &#x26;c&#x201C; &#x201C;Is the paper made yet for that wall?&#x201C; &#x201C;Are you <hi rend="italic">never</hi> going to &#x26;c&#x201C;? till mortal patience could stand it no longer! and I sent for the Carpenter<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Parsons or Joseph Morgan; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580714-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1858-07-14">14 July</date></ref>.</note> and the paper hanger,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Walters, 22 Hasker St., Chelsea, or Oliver Osborn, 5 Bretton St., Chelsea.</note> and the staircase window had to be taken out; and all the doors flying, and myself flying&#x2014;to direct blockheads for a whole day. So at night I went to bed in a high fever&#x2014;quite another sort of &#x201C;fever&#x201C; from any <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever saw me in!&#x2014;and for three successive nights I never closed my eyes, and was in agonies of face ach &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; And now I am shut up for six months I expect with my <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> and all the rest of it. But the cough is not so bad as last year, and I have more <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> to bear it. Thanks to Bay House and Lann Hall! Pity there is no sunshine in this world without shadow! That Picture is very charming to look at from my sofa; but <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a cold is a heavy price for the pleasure!&#x2014; I remember as if it were yesterday travelling all night in a post chaise with my Mother and an old East Lothian Farmer,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who was going to meet my Father at Craigenputtoch, and advise about <hi rend="italic">drains.</hi> My Mother and I were to be dropt at my Grand Fathers,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either her paternal grandfather, John Welsh (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>), or her maternal grandfather, Walter Welsh (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>); they had both lived in Nithsdale.</note> I was mad with joy to go on my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> journey, but oh so <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> in a close carriage always! one minute I was chattering like a magpie, the next vomiting out of the window! In the course of the night I lay down at the bottom of the chaise, my head on my Mothers knees and whimpered and moaned. The old Farmer got tired of me&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;and said with a certain sharpness, words that cut into my small heart with a sudden mysterious horror! &#x201C;Little girl,&#x201C; he said, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t you know that there is no pleasure to be had in this world without pain!&#x201C; No! I didn&#x2019;t know it! But it was dreadful to hear for somehow I thought he who was <hi rend="italic">old</hi> must be speaking truth. And I believed him, all in shrinking from him as a sort of cruel ogre! That was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> initiation into the dark side of Life What was yours?</p>
<p>Now good night&#x2014; Love to the Boys<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her three sons; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580829-JWC-CSO-01">JWC to <sic>CS</sic><corr>CSO</corr>, [<date when="1858-08-29">29 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> Is the nursemaid<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> gone to fulfill her Destiny?</p>

<p>You darling Woman! Thanks! and a dozen kisses! It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so pretty, and soft, and warm! and above all it is the very thing I was wanting! something to keep my head from the cold without making a &#x2018;fright&#x2019; of me!&#x2014; For alas my Dear! I am in the depths of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Cold</hi>&#x2019; again, since yesterday gone a fortnight!&#x2014; That &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Picture,</hi>&#x201C; I foresaw how it would be! The House Earth-quake it would occasion would be the death of me! (<hi rend="italic">figuratively</hi> speaking, let us hope!) When it arrived I had it peaceably set down on the floor of the parlour down stairs&#x2014;promulgating my rational intention of leaving it there; till the weather should be more favourable for the shifting of our largest bookcase, containing some six hundred books, and for getting the wall behind it papered, preparatory to hanging up the Picture in the Drawingroom&#x2014; But I was mad to hope that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle could ever by possibility be <hi rend="italic">patient!</hi> Every day it was &#x201C;My Dear, I am much afraid that Picture will get mischief down there!&#x201C; or &#x201C;My Dear are you taking any steps yet about the paper for that wall?&#x201C; or &#x201C;My Dear I dont see what harm the Carpenter removing that Bookcase could do to <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;or &#x201C;My Dear something else to the same tune! till in desperation, I sent for the Carpenters and set them to work. But, as I expected, they could not do their own work without superintendence&#x2014; No London workman has a particle of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">shift</hi>&#x2019; in him. So when they had got the bookcase, which was only in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> parts, <hi rend="small-caps">stuck fast</hi> <hi rend="italic">in the staircase&#x2014;</hi>with every appearance of its sticking there till the end of the world, or at least till the end of the house I had to go and stand over them on the coldest day of the year, and make them <hi rend="italic">take out</hi> the staircase window, and show them how to get the heavy big thing out there, and in again by the back door. All day, doors and windows were wide open and I &#x2018;<hi rend="small-caps">about</hi>&#x2019; in the stairs, and that night I went to bed in a high fever&#x2014;and never closed my eyes for three nights in succession, with furious pains in my face and head and everywhere&#x2014;all ending, after a week, in my usual winter <hi rend="italic">cough</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">delicacy</hi>&#x2014; I locked the stable door very firmly after the horse had been stolen&#x2014; Have not been up or down stairs since that unlucky day&#x2014; But with all the care I can take; it will agreeably surprise me to find myself fit for going out of doors for some months to come!&#x2014; However I am quite used to confinement now, and take it very placidly&#x2014;remarkably well pleased to just keep <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> regulating my household affairs <hi rend="italic">out of this room;</hi> and receiving the people who, strange to say, never <hi rend="italic">weary</hi> of coming &#x201C;to sit&#x201C; with me!&#x2014; Among these <pb id="pg-34-246" n="34:246"/>who should present herself the other day but&#x2014;Mary Hoggan!&#x2014; I was so glad, for she brought with her &#x201C;airs&#x201C; from Thornhill! besides being really a good kind Soul herself. I desired her to go and tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> all about me&#x2014;and I showed her that dear little photograph &#x201C;The Doctor&#x201C; gave me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Mary Russell&#x2019;s dog, Ripp.</note> and the sketch of Templand you gave me, hanging, prettily framed, on the wall of my own room.</p>
<p>Thank you Dear for telling me about all the people&#x2014; Oh if the young Lady (Miss Howden)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes Catherine Howden.</note> who wrote to me from <hi rend="italic">Haddington</hi> this morning would but write like you, instead of treating me to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> moral reflections which cannot really be supposed to interest me the least in the world&#x2014; By the way did you read in The Illustrated News that I was the &#x201C;Daughter of a Vetrinary Surgeon&#x201C;!&#x2014; If M<hi rend="italic">r Tait</hi> had held his stupid tongue I should have never known! which would have been next best to the thing not having been written&#x2014; What could one say better than just what dear old Betty<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> wrote on the occasion &#x201C;Cumberers<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to <hi rend="italic">SND,</hi> &#x201C;cummer&#x201C; or &#x201C;cumber&#x201C; is a gossip or scandalmonger.</note> of the ground! not one of them worthy to take your Father&#x2019;s name in his mouth!&#x2014;&#x201C; Then some well meaning rather weak &#x201C;Towns-fellow&#x201C; wrote a contradiction in <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Paper, into which he introduced very superfluously my &#x201C;combination of charms&#x201C;!! (as <hi rend="italic">Miss Welsh</hi> of course) Lord preserve us! If they would but leave <hi rend="italic">me</hi> alone! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have done nothing to make myself public property&#x2014;and be d&#x2014;d to them! My cold <hi rend="italic">has</hi> its advantages&#x2014; It makes it out of the question that I should accept <hi rend="italic">with</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C Lord Ashburtons invitation to dine at Bath House next Wednesday when he and the new Lady<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Louisa Ashburton.</note> come to town, from the Grange (where the other Lady<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton.</note> was lately buried) I have heard nothing of them since the marriage<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Bath House, <date when="1858-11-17">17 Nov.</date></note> till that invitation came this morning&#x2014; Decidedly my Dear we wives should <hi rend="italic">live</hi> as long as we can!

<p>Meanwhile I am charmed with my little head-comforter&#x2014;</p>

<p>I wish very much you would write to me. It is cruel to leave me wholly without news of John, when the London fogs and my own weak health tend to make &#x201C;all the imaginations of the though[t] of my heart&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Chron. 28:9; &#x201C;though[t]&#x201C; runs off the paper.</note> as dark and dreary as possible! It is not to be hoped that you can have any material improvement to tell me of already; but at least you might tell me how you find the place, and the lodging, and the Foxes,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Maria and Caroline Fox.</note> and the climate.</p>
<p>John Carlyle has nearly driven me out of my senses, by assaulting me time after time about the <hi rend="italic">uselessness</hi> of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a change as from Richmond to <hi rend="italic">Falmouth</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">absolute necessity</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> change&#x2014;a change to a dry <hi rend="italic">tropical</hi> climate&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Australia</hi> for example. Then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle backs him out. and without knowing anything of the matter blames <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi> because I have not persuaded or compelled John to take a voyage to Australia!! because I dont even at this late date persuade or compell him! <hi rend="italic">Money</hi> need be no hindrance whatever&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would be positively <hi rend="italic">relieved</hi> and <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> by this voyage being undertaken at his expence.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581021-JWC-JWEL-01">JWC to <sic>JW</sic><corr>JWEL</corr>, [ <date when="1858-10-21">21</date> or <date when="1858-10-28">28 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> He thinks we are all <hi rend="italic">trifling</hi> with a very serious case, and that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am greatly to <hi rend="italic">blame&#x2014;</hi>because I have not succeeding in <hi rend="italic">doing the impossible&#x2014;</hi>viz in making John and you and Bence Jones and every body see with John Carlyles eyes, and carry out the measure <hi rend="italic">he</hi> recommends. I am told there are still vessels sailing from Plymouth once a fortnight&#x2014;and John Carlyle says that it would by no means be a bad time to set out&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle proposed sending John Carlyle down to Falmouth to try and persuade our John!!! and John Carlyle proposed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to go (he) and consult with Bence Jones about it; since I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> believe that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> (Jones) had probably as much skill and knowledge as <hi rend="italic">D</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Carlyle!</hi> But I got into such a phrenzy of nervousness, at all this urging and remonstrating, without any clear convictions of my own to bear me up; that I burst out crying! and told them&#x2014;to do what they liked, but not to hold <hi rend="italic">me</hi> responsible, and expect <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to play the part of <hi rend="italic">Fate</hi> any more; or they would throw me into a fever! Since that scene a few days ago, nothing has been said&#x2014;and indeed this morning, D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has started for Scotsbrig. But still all this that has been <hi rend="italic">laid</hi> on me, continues to <hi rend="italic">weigh</hi> on me. And in repeating it, I feel to be only discharging my conscience&#x2014;also I am obeying M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyles express command in urging upon John, that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Life <pb id="pg-34-250" n="34:250"/>is of more worth a thousand times in his (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s) eyes than <hi rend="italic">any</hi> sum of money that could contribute to its preservation&#x2014;</p>
<p>If I have <hi rend="italic">said</hi> what I had to say ill&#x2014;forgive me&#x2014;for the sake of my good meaning&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours affectionately</salute></closer> <name>Jane Welsh Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I hope you got well to Winnington,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where the Hostages lived; village in Cheshire, 16 mi. E of Chester, now part of Northwich.</note> and are enjoying yourself there for a couple of days. Your London life seemed to be very quiescent, much more monotonous &#x26; lonesome than I have known in past times. Even of me you could see very little: alas, alas, it is a sad <hi rend="italic">wirrwarr</hi> [confusion] this existence we have! But you always keep a cheerful heart,&#x2014;which I much admire;&#x2014;it is a real pleasure to me (and often a reproval withal) to see how blandly you welcome all things that come, and take with composure the good and ill that confusedly attends us all. Long may it last,&#x2014;and right long may <hi rend="italic">you</hi> last, to keep me company in this world, where one grows very solitary at these years of mine.</p>
<p>Had it not been for Rowland Hill and his penny, this Note had never been. For it contains nothing; there is no change or event at all, since you last saw me yesterday. I am still struggling, pretty fruitlessly, against my perverse subject, to <hi rend="italic">crush</hi> by human force some kind of meaning from the beggarly continents of mechanic pedantry and painful jargon; I have better <hi rend="italic">hopes,</hi> outlooks today; but, today too, no actual conquest. I am now going out, after 4 or 5 hours of it; out to <hi rend="italic">walk,</hi> horse being at his interval of rest today.</p>
<p>Last night I saw Jamie Aitken: he had just written to you; so I need not say all was going well with him. He looked a shade <hi rend="italic">paler</hi> perhaps, but otherwise, it seemed to me, better;&#x2014;was charged to write hither if anything recurred; to write on Monday at any rate when actually <hi rend="italic">back</hi> at his desk. The poor fellow seemed very glad to see me in his little domicile, a trim little place as you said; there was more vivacity in him than he shews here, &#x26; he altogether rather pleased me. I stuffed a little of his tobacco into my Neuberg pipe, ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the damp muddy weather, and rode my ways again. The ride, to and from, was in a sort magnificent; magnificently dismal, blazing with splendour, noise, dirt and confusion;&#x2014;rather slippery at times, but my horse is greatly improved <pb id="pg-34-251" n="34:251"/>now, and seconds me, like a hero (of 4 feet), on such occasions.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane continues no worse. I got this tagrag of a Pruss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Speech<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> with a Book from Neub<hi rend="italic">g</hi> this morning. My respects to Mr &#x26; Mrs Hostage. <hi rend="italic">Gl&#xfc;ck auf dem Weg unterhin</hi> [have a good journey]&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I may as well take this 10 minutes I have to send you the smallest of Letters,&#x2014;better than none at all. The Dr having quitted us, I must try to be more active in seizing odd moments for that object than formerly.</p>
<p>These two months I have been at my old job; struggling in the most disastrous manner to get on with it,&#x2014;to get fairly <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it; alas I cannot even do that, cannot fairly get my hand <hi rend="italic">in</hi> again, nor handsomely <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> in the way I could consider promising! During those vacant three months, I had banished the sorrowful affair completely out of my head: if I had not been in danger of <hi rend="italic">sinking</hi> altogether, I had better have held on, and lamely gallopped to the end. But it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have <hi rend="italic">broken the wind</hi> of me; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have fallen, all fours, upon the highway before getting home!&#x2014; I do mean however to hold on now, if life be left at all, till I see myself fairly quit of such a job as was never given me before, in my youngest and strongest days. I live altogether <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> from my fellow creatures and their ways; I am often very miserable over my sad problem,&#x2014;and may be said in general to resemble a man sunk to the eyebrows in quagmire, and left to help himself out, in a wet night, miles off any <hi rend="italic">house,</hi> if he can!&#x2014; My affairs have been sadly aggravated by my <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> too. &#x201C;Horse&#x201C; means &#x201C;health&#x201C; with me; and I have not had quite <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a Horse till lately,&#x2014;scandalous villains<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably at Pearson Till&#x2019;s stables.</note> (as I at last discover) having been changing his corn into <hi rend="italic">gin</hi> for themselves this long while back. However, all that is fairly at an end; &#x201C;persist, persist!&#x201C; the whole thing will get to an end,&#x2014;say in a twelvemonth or so, if I can hold out.</p>
<p>Jane is decidedly a little better this winter; sleeps better considerably for most part; and has no cough hitherto or special attack of cold, tho always weak enough, weak as possible almost, were it not for the spirit she has. This is a great kindness of Heaven, surely,&#x2014;both to herself and to me.</p>
<p>Your James was here last night; gave us a tune or two on the flute; very well again, and very good and honest, poor fellow. He certainly has every appearance of doing faithfully and being successful here. Last night I was introducing him to a Mr Larkin, an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> young man of mine, who with Mother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Larkin.</note> &#x26;c all of good quality lives on his side of the Town.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Larkin lived at Highbury Vale, Islington.</note> They went off together in time for the last Omnibus (10.45 p.m. bright moonlight, and the <hi rend="italic">warm</hi>est temperature you ever felt at Christmas).</p>

Let him consider it in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mind; and prepare himself to give advice. At present I can find time for no exterior enterprise at all: but I do right heartily mean to be <hi rend="italic">away</hi> from this, were my <hi rend="italic">sorrow</hi> once off my back; and something always draws towards poor old Scotland, far as it is away. To live <hi rend="italic">mostly</hi> out of London is always my intention (tho&#x2019; Jane I think likes better to be here). I would not <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> London either, however; not quite;&#x2014;but sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> so like to be able to run from it, quite out of hearing, whenev<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I liked!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have had one or two little Notes since you got to Scotsbrig; for which I am much obliged. The sight of a friendly handwriting is welcome in my present loneliness.&#x2014;&#x2014; I am not worse in health than when you left me, nor is Jane: I ride, like a ghost in the chill dusk, from half past 3, with extreme regularity; I am, for all reasons, bound to keep up my poor stock of health; below a certain pitch I can absolutely do no work at all of the kind I am now in. Alas, and I am in danger of sinking ever deeper into misery, because, with my pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> equipment <pb id="pg-34-256" n="34:256"/>in the way of <hi rend="italic">pepticity</hi> and clearness of nerves, I can get almost no work out of myself:&#x2014;but that would be a very <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> manner of proceeding! Nothing for it, in short, but to hold one&#x2019;s peace, try one&#x2019;s best, and ride like a ghost in the chill dusk.</p>
<p>Poor W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Conyngham<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coningham (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), John and Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s cousin; M.P. for Brighton, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391024-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:207</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-10-24">24 Oct. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> called yesterday; looking infinitely worse than any of us, indeed one of the miserablest of men.

<p>I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have told you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Bank Cheque inclosed, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> doubtless you are guessing about all this while!

<p>I send many brotherly regards to Jamie &#x26; Isabella; and wish (if the heartiest wishes availed anything) a right &#x201C;happy new-year&#x201C; to you and to all of them!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Oh young woman!</salute> there you go again! again a long silence!

And oh my Dear, who the Devil will be to blame for that state of things but yourself! Like all very sensitive <pb id="pg-34-257" n="34:257"/>people, you need an Atmosphere of <hi rend="italic">The Familiar</hi> to open the leaves of your soul in. <hi rend="italic">The Strange, the Unaccustomed</hi> blights you like a frosty night! And yet, by <hi rend="italic">Procrastination,</hi> which your Copy-lines told you was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the root of all evil</hi>&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Tim. 6:10.</note> you suffer the <hi rend="italic">Familiar</hi> to become, by little and little, that &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Strange</hi>&#x2019; which has such withering effects on you! Please don&#x2019;t! Not in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> case for Heaven&#x2019;s sake! The more you don&#x2019;t write to me, the more you will find it up hill, when you do write&#x2014;and from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to speaking about &#x201C;the accommodations of <hi rend="italic">Lann Hall</hi>&#x201C; is but a step or two, in a straight line! You write such nice letters <hi rend="italic">when your hand is in</hi> that they cannot be a labour to write. Then, do my Dear keep your hand in!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have sent you a newyears gift, which, if it come to hand safe, will, I am sure&#x2014;at least I hope, give you a pleasant surprise; for really it will be like seeing into our Interior in a peepshow!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reproduction of Robert Tait&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Chelsea Interior.</hi></note> It is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> one, <hi rend="italic">of the size,</hi> that exists as yet; and I had it done on purpose for you. Another, smaller, is gone, inside of a large Picture book for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringles children, to&#x2014;Robert MacTurk!&#x2014;a sort of <hi rend="italic">amende honorable</hi> [making amends] for having failed to give him&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">myself!</hi> Good God! when he had some right to expect it&#x2014;long ago&#x2014;when I was an extremely absurd little girl! His good feeling towards me, after all, deserves a certain esteem from me and a certain recognition&#x2014;which I hope has been put into an acceptable form for him in the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Peep-Show.</hi>&#x2019;</p>
<p>My last news of you was from Isabella Dunwoodie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Dunwoodie, Robert McTurk&#x2019;s sister, of Townhead, Dumfriesshire.</note>&#x2014; Poor &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Powfoot&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Mrs. Paterson; she had been ill; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581001-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1858-10-01">1 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> (as she insists on calling her) has given herself then, the supreme indulgence of disappointing her heirs!</p>
<p>But I must not be expatiating over things in general today for I am in a dreadful hurry!

<salute>Dear Mrs Cameron,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind Gift;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A magnifying glass. Julia Margaret Cameron had a reputation for being &#x201C;one of the most benevolent of human beings, always thinking of something for the good or pleasure of others&#x201C; (Hallam Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir</hi> [<date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>] 2:84).</note> a welcome and beneficent remembrance on your part at this black season of the year. I have had for a good while a big glass of that kind, indispensable, with maps, to eyes as old as mine: but this new circular Article shall hang in another room, ready for duty that may turn up there; and shall be valuable to me, both in a practical and <hi rend="italic">monumental</hi> or memorial sense. Again I say, many thanks to the kind giver.</p>
<p>We unfortunately cannot flatter ourselves with the least thought of getting to you on that interesting Tuesday,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her eldest da., Julia (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), was to marry Charles Lloyd Norman of Bromley Common, Kent, Tues., <date when="1859-01-18">18 Jan. 1859</date>, at St. Mary&#x2019;s Church, Putney.</note> of which I had already heard some hint. My wife is unable to go out at all; and for me I am buried to the eyes in such a <pb id="pg-34-259" n="34:259"/>welter of chaotic litter as is horrible to think of,&#x2014;in which I work all day, and all days; riding abroad a little in the dusk, like a distressed ghost, to try if I can keep alive till the thing get done, and gloomily returning to my den again. If I can live about a year at this rate, I hope to be free,&#x2014;and for the rest of my life, whatever that may amount to. Pity me; and ask me not to be corporeally present, but only spiritually!&#x2014;</p>
<p>With many thanks; with many good wishes to these Young People, and to yourself and all you are concerned for, I remain always</p>
