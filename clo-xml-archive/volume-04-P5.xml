<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>As I cannot conveniently come upon a newspaper, without buying one from an office, I think it will be more suitable to send you a sheet from myself, that so you may rather have a packet of intelligence from your <foreign><hi rend="italic">ain bairns</hi></foreign>, than from the crowned heads and other dignitaries of the Earth, with whom we have less to do. I know you are full of anxieties about us; therefore I delay not a moment in setting you at rest.</p>
<p>The first and most important piece of intelligence I have to communicate is the assurance that I am arrived in perfect safety, and proceeding in my affairs with all imaginable prosperity. Many a time yesterday, as the wild blasts came howling round me, I thought of your dismal imaginings, and wished that you could have known how snug I was, and how little I cared about the tempest. From the road on this side of AE<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ae is a river in Dumfriesshire.</note> Bridge I looked over my <hi rend="italic">right</hi> should<hi rend="italic">er</hi>, and saw Barhill and Burnswark, and the Tower of Repentance (no bigger than a moderate pepper-box) all glancing in the clear frosty breeze; and figured you out as smoking diligently, and wondering <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;how that poor <foreign>habbletree</foreign> was <foreign>fenning ava</foreign>&#x201D;</hi>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To <hi rend="italic">habble</hi> is &#x201C;to limp&#x201D; or &#x201C;to confuse.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Habbletree</hi> may be a family coinage. Carlyle says that his mother may be wondering &#x201C;how that poor perplexed boy is getting along.&#x201D;</note> while the &#x201C;poor <foreign>habbletree</foreign>&#x201D; was <foreign>fenning</foreign> as well as any one of you.</p>
<p>Sandy would bring up my history to the date of my parting from the hospitable home of John Grier;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Grier</hi> seems to be short for <hi rend="italic">Grierson</hi>. John Grierson of Dumfries had married Carlyle&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s sister Jean.</note> a parting so hurried that I had not time to bid a syllable of farewell even to my Brother. I buckled up my dreadnought, and thought that a better hour would come. On the whole that dreadnought did essential service throughout the day: cased in it, I turned my back to the breeze, lit my pipe as occassion served, and sat whiffing in the most composed frame of mind, defying all the war of the elements, and knowing chiefly by report that it was &#x201C;a very rough day.&#x201D; The poor &#x201C;mason lad.&#x201D; who sat beside me, suffered most: the rest left us at Moffat; so that he was exposed on all sides; <pb id="pg-04-4" n="04:4"/>and being very insufficiently wrapped, he grew exceedingly cold. I pitied the poor youth, and thought of the small vein of enterprize which he was pursuing thro&#x2019; such hardship, and of his parting from his mother, and the sorry welcome that his light purse would procure him at his journey&#x2019;s end. Twice I revived his fainting soul with a touch of tobacco-<foreign>reek</foreign>, which he inhaled with rapture from my instrument; I also now and then lent him a lap of my cloak, for which he repaid me gratefully with a bit of gingerbread; and the result was that when we reached Edinburgh about half-past four, he was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> either dead or speechless.</p>
<p>Jack was out of doors when I arrived; and his beef-steak waiting for him by the fire; an arrangement which I took the liberty to alter by consuming the victual myself. I had lain down on two chairs, to smoke and read, with a glass of ale at my head and a clear fire at my side, when Jack entered, and stared with delighted astonishment at sight of me. He had inquired out a very promising abode for me in this street; a place with two bed-rooms and a parlour, regulated by a landlady of good aspect and recommendation; the spot in short where I am now writing. I slept here last night, and finding every thing as quiet as possible, we bargained for the place this morning (at 16 / per week including fire&#x2014;in the parlour all day, in the large bedroom from five o&#x2019;clock): Jack has transported his luggage from the old lodging; settled with the landlady, and so forth; and here we are fixed down in the same habitation once more with every prospect of being as comfortable as it is in the power of Edinburgh in our department of it to make us. I slept last night a most sufficient sleep; and see nothing to hinder me from sleeping any night here as well as anywhere. The house too is at the very verge of the town, almost close on Salisbury crags; so that the air is almost generally altogether as fresh as Hoddam Hill or even Mountain Blow itself. On the whole I doubt not we shall be very well here in all points.</p>
<p>I have also seen Tait the Bookseller; and given him the stuff for setting on the Printer, who I expect will commence operations tomorrow. It also appears that the Books will not be difficult to get from Germany; so that for this matter likewise there is nothing but good aspects. And then when I have fished the little trifle of cash out of this tumultuous fishpond, I hasten home with my stock to old Annandale and my Mother, and have tea &#x201C;as well as ought in Ecclefechan,&#x201D; with friendly talk and much social smoking as in the days that are past.</p>
<p>I found Jack in perfect health; and as he declared, in want of <pb id="pg-04-5" n="04:5"/>nothing. He has drawers and night-shirts, or will get them from me; the butter holds out stoutly, and is of excellent quality; and the meal is still a considerable way from being done. When Farries comes out, I wish you would send a few eggs; for they are 1/6 per dozen here, and the st<supplied>[ock]</supplied> that I have will soon be done. Another little touch of oatmeal would also be acceptable; together with Jack&#x2019;s cheese; and any <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cockerels</hi> that may be superfluously crowing about the Hill, for Jack thinks they are much better and cheaper <supplied>[than]</supplied> beef. I must not forget to ask you for that copy of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, which I intended for Goethe: you can wrap it in gray paper, and stow it in the box. Also if you have any room, send <hi rend="italic">Monro&#x2019;s Anatomy</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Monro (<date when="1697">1697</date>&#x2013;<date when="1767">1767</date>) became the first professor of anatomy at Edinburgh University in <date when="1720">1720</date>; his son Alexander (<date when="1733">1733</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817">1817</date>) succeeded to his father&#x2019;s chair (<date when="1759">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808">1808</date>); his son Alexander (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>), also an anatomist, became joint professor with his father in <date when="1800">1800</date>. Carlyle probably refers to the <hi rend="italic">Outlines of the Anatomy of the Human Body</hi>, 4 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1813">1813</date>), by the third Monro.</note> with the <hi rend="italic">Plates</hi> for Jack: he intends selling it here. Perhaps it may be good, as you have so many packages, to take the household <hi rend="italic">bread-box</hi> from the nook for a week, and send it hither with Farries; using the press in <hi rend="italic">Tom&#x2019;s bedroom</hi> in the interim <supplied>[as]</supplied> a bread-store, now that Tom is not at hand to scold about the mo<supplied>[rsel]</supplied>s that may be scattered on the floor. We will return the box with the return of the Carrier, with a supply of letters in answer to the supply we hope to receive on his arrival. Before the end of next week, we hope to have engaged a newspaper, which we will send you regularly &#x201C;to let you know we are in being &#x2019;tis intended for a sign.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now, my Dear Mother, I have told you all my tale: hurried and irregular as the confusion of a new settlement allows it to be; I must now conclude, for plain reasons, and beg of you again to take no unpleasant thought for us here: but be certain that all is well with us. For yourself I must again repeat my strictest injunction that you take tea twice every day, and a bit of loaf to it, and make yourself as comfortable as the wild Hill-top will allow you till my return. Tell Jane that I <hi rend="italic">command</hi> her on pain of my high displeasure to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> you this same tea, evening and morning, whether you ask it or not. Bid her mind this as she loves me; for I will soon be back and require a rigorous account of her. I will tell the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Jane to write to you, and all of us will love you; and every thing will be well, as the kind Giver of all Good has hitherto ordered it. I also mean &#x201C;to go to the Kirk at least <hi rend="italic">once</hi> a day.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-6" n="04:6"/>Alick will not fail to write by the Waffler all and sundry that has befallen since my departure. Let him tell me how he sold his <hi rend="italic">beefers</hi>, what he is doing and purposing to do. He is a shifty<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ingenious, resourceful, handy.</note> little fellow, tho&#x2019; he cannot like the Engineer pull baskets from the well. I need not bid him keep an eye on His Honour<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General Matthew Sharpe.</note> and His Honour&#x2019;s man, and trust them no farther than his eye can follow them. Bid him keep an eye also on <hi rend="italic">farms</hi>, and try to <foreign><hi rend="italic">haud</hi></foreign> [hold] his gear together. Jane also must write to me by the box; positively must the old <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi>: I dreamed last night that she came gliding in with a shovel-full of coals, and alas she was sleeping then, on the other side of the hills. Jenny I saw <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping] within the window when I went away: say I will give her a penny when I return. To my Father and Mag and Jamie and Mary (that was to be my housekeeper) present my warmest affection; and ask them in my name for letters. Be good to me my dear Mother as you have ever been; trust in the bounties of our All merciful Father, who carries us all in the arms of his Love; and fear not for me or your self. <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate son</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>[In margin:] You need not mind sending any cakes. Tell Wightman the Elder that I mean to do his message tomorrow. Jack sends you all a thousand goodnights from his honest heart; and he and I are off to the Post office, so soon as I have supped my porridge, his being already down. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Finis</hi></foreign>.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I have been in Town for two days, and cannot rest any longer without sending you a token of my existence in your vicinity, and the constant occupation of my heart about you to whom it rightfully and more and more gladly belongs. I need not tell you that I vehemently wish for some tidings of you, and still more for another sight of your kind countenance, the fairest object that for me this universe holds in its domain. It seems almost an <hi rend="italic">aeon</hi> since I heard of you, tho&#x2019; on reckoning <pb id="pg-04-7" n="04:7"/>by the vulgar arithmetic of this Earth, I find that it is little more than a fortnight. Do write the first hour you have leisure, and tell me all and every thing; how your health is; what you do or think in this wild furious weather; and whether you still love me, or have at length opened your ear to Prudence, and determined on expelling me from my Elysian haven in your breast, to go and seek shelter in some meaner harbour. If you do, you little gypsy, I will&#x2014;&#x2014;die?&#x2014;no, not die; but come and raise such a hurricane of tempestuous eloquence about your ears, that you shall be glad to let me in again for peace&#x2019;s sake. So mind never once to think of it.</p>
<p>After all are you got well again, and cheerful or at least composed in spirits? Alas, my poor Jane! that she should have to battle with the dire fiends of Pain, and bend her neck to their crushing influences! But it shall not always be so: when we get together into our &#x201C;eight-day-clock&#x201D; routine, both of us will be happy and active and <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> like the other children of men. O! that <hi rend="italic">were</hi> existence; a new birth into a freer and brighter world, of which this is but the dull proscenium! Would that the days were here; would that we had patience to struggle for the hastening of them or to wait for their arrival.</p>
<p>But when am I to see you? I do not wish to visit Haddington in the present aspect of affairs; I should give little pleasure by my presence and get little. Yet it does seem hard that I cannot see my own little kind-hearted <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weibchen</hi></foreign> [little woman], and she within two hours&#x2019; travel of me. It is very hard. Nevertheless I will not aggravate your share of the evil by loading you with mine. Do even as it shall seem thee good, my own Darling; and I shall be ready to obey. Jack says you told him you would be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> shortly after the new-year began. It is begun now.</p>
<p>This Book <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For publication in his <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> (<date when="1827">1827</date>) Carlyle did not select the popular <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> (<date when="1811">1811</date>) by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu&#xE9; but rather his tale &#x201C;Aslauga&#x2019;s Knight,&#x201D; less substantial but shorter and adequately representative.</note> is worth little to you; yet I wish you to read it and tell me honestly what you think of it, for I have some purpose of introducing it into our Collection, as a Specimen of his Baronship. Scarcely half of the Tale is there, but if you care for it, I will send the whole when you return this. Or if you are engaged otherwise, or unable or disinclined for the task, throw this linsey-wolsey volume on the shelf, and think that it has already done sufficient duty, by officiating as the messenger between two such worthy souls as you and your future Helper. I know not how it is; but I fear you are not well, and I shall long to hear from you, and speak to you; for tho&#x2019; these suspicions <pb id="pg-04-8" n="04:8"/>may be light as wind, they have a weight in the imagination which no logic can take from them. Therefore be kind to <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi>, and write to me as she bids you.</p>
<p>I have also sent you Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s letter, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">na&#xEF;vet&#xE9;</hi></foreign> of which may amuse you, the truth and fervent simplicity of which would interest you if you knew the writer. Do you really think I love that lady <hi rend="italic">much</hi> more than I love you? That were a joke indeed!</p>
<p>The Printers are at work to day: I will send you a copy of the first sheet whenever it is thrown <supplied>[off,]</supplied> perhaps towards the end of next week. Tait the <supplied>[book]</supplied>seller is writing to Germany for more matter: I expect to be very busy for the next three months. I pray Heaven the thing were off my hands; for it is a sorry piece of work at the best, and written nearly altogether for the &#x201C;lucre of gain.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Will you write to my Mother? She wishes it earnestly. Will you write to me &#x201C;very instantly,&#x201D; and love me all the days of your life? I am too long here, for the hour is come. God bless you <foreign><hi rend="italic">mein Herzenskind</hi></foreign> [my darling]! <closer><salute>I am yours forever</salute></closer></p>
<name>Th: Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Jack, who is living with me here, sends his kindest regar<supplied>[ds]</supplied>: it seems he has written to you already.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> very, very hard that I must content myself with writing; when, with a speedy horse I might be in your arms in less than two hours<supplied>[.]</supplied> Sixteen miles is such a little way! And yet you must not come hither for the world; nor can I go to you till the middle of next month, at soonest. Indeed, perhaps it would be wise not to think of it even then; for those brief interviews before a cloud of witnesses are more tantalizing than satisfactory to either of us, and alackaday! I must not keep house with you in Salisbury street, as I did at Hoddam Hill&#x2014;dear, delightful <hi rend="italic">Hill</hi>, where we lived together so happily,&#x2014;so married-like! Oh when shall we have such sabbath weeks again? not, I suppose, till we are married in good earnest.</p>
<p>Your felicitations on the subject of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Johnston came in the very <pb id="pg-04-9" n="04:9"/>worst possible time,&#x2014;just when I had got news of the desertion of about half his party; so that it is more than possible he may not be the successful candidate after all. I cannot help it, no more can Gilbert Burns, who is as heartily grieved as myself at the turn things have taken. You will think I was premature in pronouncing so confidently on the event; but how should it have entered into the head of any honourable person, to calculate on such unfair dealing as this? M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Stewart of Alderston, who was fully determined to vote for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Johnston, is now as fully determined to vote for his opponent&#x2014;out of pure illwill to Gilbert Burns whom the other was found guilty of having engaged in his interest; Lord Wemyss too, and, I believe, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fletcher, whom your friend thought himself sure of thro&#x2019; the recommendation of the Ruthvens, have left him in the lurch, in a most abominable manner. To recall the Earl, if possible, to a better mind, I made my Mother write to his Lady, with whom she used to be intimate: but, unluckily, &#x201C;it is quite impossible for his Lordship, <hi rend="italic">situated as he is</hi>, to do himself the pleasure of meeting her (my Mother&#x2019;s) <hi rend="italic">views</hi>.&#x201D; The devil confound them, every one! The decision of the matter seems now to depend on the breath of Sir John Hepborn,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Steuart of Alderston; Francis Wemyss Charteris Douglas (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853">1853</date>), eighth Earl of Wemyss, Lord Lieutenant of Peebleshire; Andrew Fletcher of Salton; Sir John Buchan Hepburn (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">1833</date>), second Baronet of Smeaton, advocate. These were the &#x201C;heritors&#x201D; of Haddington who, having established a parochial school, had the right of choosing the master.</note>&#x2014;a born-idiot, who stoutly declares that he will give <hi rend="italic">his</hi> vote according to his conscience; if he keep in this mind, born-idiot tho&#x2019; he be, he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> give it to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Johnston&#x2014; But I fear much!</p>
<p>Never think, Darling, of employing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as your Ariel again! I am the most unlucky of creatures! nothing that I set my heart on ever prospers; no one that I wish success to ever succeeds. Would to Heaven we knew the upshot of Schawbrae! It would have been but civil in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Crighton to have answered my letter, or have made his Wife answer it&#x2014; Their silence, I fear argues no great zeal in the service&#x2014; Oh that I were an absolute Sovereign for one half hour!</p>
<p>With respect to my health, which you are not yet weary of enquiring about; I have reason to be thankful it is no worse, all circumstances considered. My nerves have had a tremendous time of it lately; it began on the last night of the year. My Mother had invited a party of young men or rather big boys, and we were making ourselves very merry, sitting round the table at a game of cards; when all on a sudden one of them,&#x2014;a Nephew of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Donaldson, and a gentle <pb id="pg-04-10" n="04:10"/>creature as ever you saw&#x2014;became distorted in the most shocking manner, and would have fallen off his chair if the Boy next him had not caught him in his arms. In the whole course of my life, I never witnessed any thing so appalling. One moment he was laughing as heartily as any there, and the next apparently in the agonies of death. In the greatest confusion and terror our little card-party flew asunder; one ran to seek M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Howden, another M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Donaldson, and I ran for &#x2014;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe! How the amiable Doctor looked,&#x2014;whether he turned red or pale, when the figure of his lost love stood so unexpectedly before him, I was not just at the moment in a condition of mind to remark; moreover, it was dark as pitch. All I know is that he came instantly to the assistance of the poor Boy, and staid with him while the convulsion lasted which was nearly an hour; every moment of which I expected would be his last&#x2014; Not till my terror subsided and the Doctor was about to depart, did it occur to me I had done any thing at all extraordinary; and then, to be sure, I was somewhat puzzled as to what I should do next<supplied>[.]</supplied> It ended in my holding out my hand to the creature, who, to do him justice, took it with the best possible grace&#x2014; &#x201C;But I am at the end of my paper&#x201D;; and the last and most serious half of the story is yet to come&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;<foreign>Console toi</foreign>&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;you shall have it next time. I will write to your Mother in a week or so, as soon as I have finished <hi rend="italic">the</hi> long projected <hi rend="italic">Cap</hi>. Thank you for sending M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Strachey&#x2019;s letter&#x2014;it was so considerate&#x2014;! I have been greatly more tranquil on this subject however, since I read the comedy of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Prince jaloux</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moli&#xE8;re (<date when="1622">1622</date>&#x2013;<date when="1673">73</date>) produced his dramatic failure, the heavy tragicomedy <hi rend="italic">Don Garcie de Navarre, ou le prince jaloux</hi> in <date when="1661-02">February 1661</date>. Carlyle brought back a copy of it to Jane from Paris in <date when="1824">1824</date>.</note> My Second best love to Johnathan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle.</note> whose kind letter shall be answered before he has time to forget me&#x2014;</p>
<p>Do not fail to send me some of this book as soon <supplied>[as]</supplied> you possibly can&#x2014; I would like to read it in your hand rather than in print&#x2014; Thank you for Undine which I will begin the day after tomorrow&#x2014;when I shall have finished the thirty years war<supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schiller&#x2019;s history.</note> <closer><salute>God bless you darling&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Best and Dearest!&#x2014;</salute> I have literally only two or three minutes, which I can abstract from a host of stupid and perplexing avocations that beset me; nevertheless your looking westward this day shall not be <hi rend="italic">utterly</hi> in vain; I will send you three lines to say that I am still alive, and still yours, and you still mine, forever and ever. Oh my kind Jane! why cannot I fly to <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> and tell you this! And clasp you in my arms, and swear that nothing earthly or unearthly shall ever divide us! But it is vain &#x201C;to kick against the pricks&#x201D;: let me be patient.</p>
<p>I knew you would write to me on Monday, and I was not disappointed. Your letter was handed in to me in the evening, along with one from Mrs Montague, which had picked it up by the way. Do you think I was such a fool as to read yours <hi rend="italic">first</hi>? What will you wager that I was? I send you the Noble Lady&#x2019;s letter, for your recreation, and to quicken you in her service, in which it would appear you are at present behind-hand. Nothing can bring her out of the <hi rend="italic">ideal</hi>: she is a born <foreign><hi rend="italic">Dichterinn</hi></foreign> [poetess].<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s letter, postmarked <date when="1826-01-08">8 Jan.</date>, must have been very annoying to Carlyle, filled with details, as it was, to show that her &#x201C;wayward Boy&#x201D; Charles and Carlyle were very much alike. Each had, she said, &#x201C;a mind too high-set for the common purposes, or the common people of this world, shy and proud, kind, and very distrustful of the kindness of others: very delicate, very fastidious abrupt and careless in his own demeanour yet sensible and alive to the least failure in the demeanour of another. &#x2026; He owns no authority, and bows only to Wisdom and goodness and if he finds Wisdom without goodness, he supposes there is an error somewhere, and sets about to discover it, as he would an error in working a problem. &#x2026; There is nothing strong enough to hold him or Yourself to any duty but the Love of something better and higher than either of you, and you will never find this but in God Himself. &#x2026; There is the same air of careless defiance, and studied indifference in both, which says, or seems to say, &#x2018;I care for none of you,&#x2019; but both may be startled into softness, and in the depths of your dark eyes, it is not difficult to read &#x2018;I would love you if you were worthy.&#x2019;&#x2014; So much for my Sons, real, and adopted&#x2014; May God mend you for nothing else can.&#x201D; She protests that Carlyle is much too melancholy to be young and in love. And she thinks that he probably has a disease of the liver which London doctors could cure.</note></p>
<p>I also send you the first two Sheets of that Book, which is giving me such trouble: I wish to Heaven it were off my hands; for there is much more cry than wool<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial: more ostentation than profit.</note> in the whole affair. I walked yesterday from 11 o&#x2019;clock till 4, seeking books and men to expedite the concern; the <pb id="pg-04-12" n="04:12"/>Bibliopolist<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tait, the Edinburgh bookseller.</note> himself, a Turk in grain, being also very stupid, and inexpert in devising ways and means, tho&#x2019; willing, poor profit-and-loss unit, to do the best he can. The second Sheet is full of blunders, never having got the smallest correction since it went to press, or rather since it was shoved into my drawer with its fellows, some night in <date when="1825-10">October</date>, at home.</p>
<p>You are not to be here till next month, and I must not think of coming out to see you? Good Heavens! I must leave Town in a few days; by the middle of next month I expect to be sitting at my own fireside in Annandale, eighty good miles from Edinburgh! Hard! It is unspeakable! When I think of it, I could find in my heart to drop a bitter tear, a tear of indignant sorrow at the perverseness of things. Are you not mine, my own chosen only darling of my soul? And I must not see you? Must not&#x2014; Peace! Peace! Where is the use of brawling: we <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> help it, and must teach ourselves to bend to it submissively. I could walk to Haddington to see you for ten minutes. But I yield implicitly and trustfully to your arrangement: I know your feeling on the subject is like my own. So God bless you my best beloved! Tho&#x2019; I cannot see you, none can hinder me from thinking of you, and anticipating the day when we shall no more be separated. O why did you join yourself with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? I declare I could sometimes weep for you; tho&#x2019; I love you as my own soul.</p>
<p>The day of my departure is not fixed yet; but I have already been too long here. The last sound sleep I got was in my own bed at Hoddam Hill: three months of Edinburgh would drive me to the verge of the churchyard. These are things not to be sighed over, but to be remedied. What do you think I am meditating? To rent me a cottage in the middle of a walled garden, if I can find one, in the neighbourhood of this city, and&#x2014;bring my sisters Mary and Jane to keep it for me! If they do not get Shawbrae, I shall have a house to provide at any rate: for tho&#x2019; I should live in a place no bigger or better than a hencoop, it shall be <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> from the threshold to the rooftree, and the curse of the abomination of tumult and smoke shall be shut out from it. Or would you&#x2014;?&#x2014;But no! you shall not: I love you, and will not make you miserable.</p>
<p>Professor Leslie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Leslie.</note> has another plan. This tunbellied philosopher met me on the North Bridge the other day, and wished me in the first place to write a prize Essay on Comets for a gold medal and fifty guineas, <pb id="pg-04-13" n="04:13"/>which he has got to dispose of in that way; a thing which I signified was a good way from my thoughts at that date: and in the second place to go to Munich (in Bavaria) with a German Potentate, who wishes to be instructed in English Literature and Science, and is a Courtier and apparently &#x201C;a very good kind of a man.&#x201D; On this subject, I told the oily mathematician, I was ready to talk farther, if the German Potentate inclined, and give him my decision when I heard his terms. Since then I have heard nothing; and very probably shall never hear any thing. At all events I durst bet a thousand to one that I should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go and teach this German Potentate English Literature and science. We must <hi rend="italic">take up house</hi>, Jane, at no distant date in some way or other!</p>
<p>Will you write again on Monday at great very great length: I will send you another letter before I leave this city, be that when it may. Indeed I have still many things to do; biographical notices to collect from the Advocates&#x2019; Library, books to gather, arrangements to complete. I would they were over and I home. The printing will proceed as at present; and fresh books are written for from Leipzig. Write to me my Darling: I have no friend but thee. Write all that is in thy true heart. <closer><salute>I am forever thine,</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>I make no excuse for this coarsest of letters. Its appearance makes its apology; and I know well it will be welcome where it is going. On Monday!</p></ps>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>The annunciation contained in your last letter has bewildered my intellect to such a degree, that I should hardly, I believe have minded the injunction to write on Monday were it not that I want your immediate counsel on a no less important subject than the affair of Schawbrae. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Chrighton has written to say that &#x201C;till the last day for taking offers her husband was on the look out for my friend; but that no such person appearing, nothing of course could be said or done&#x201D;&#x2014; Now, in all the world was there ever such an incomprehensible piece of bungling? It was utterly impossible for any one to misunderstand my letter which was legibly written and worded to the comprehension of the <pb id="pg-04-14" n="04:14"/>meanest capacity and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chrighton could not but be aware that a person bearing the name of Carlyle had made him an offer of two hundred and thirty pounds. Let me know as soon as possible when the farms are to be let, and what you think best to be done&#x2014; If the matter is to rest till the Major&#x2019;s return from London you could perhaps see him yourself, and I would give you an introduction to him. If not, I will&#x2014;do any thing you bid me. Positively I am more annoyed at this contretems, than at the idea of your departing without my seeing you, tho&#x2019; that God knows is vexatious enough&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last night I had serious thoughts of setting out for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> forthwith in spite of all and sundry objections; I felt as if it would do me a world of good just to fall upon your neck and weep, and tell you once more what I have told you so often already, that you are dearer to me than aught on earth&#x2014; But it must not be! Things are bad enough already; I must not make them worse if I can help it&#x2014; And you will return ere long, to take up house <hi rend="italic">with Mary and Jane</hi> in the middle of a walled garden? Indeed you will do no such thing, for this project you will find on reflection to be none of the wisest. The Bavaria one pleases me just as little, unless the German Potentate would find room in his establis<supplied>[h]</supplied>ment for me also; otherwis<supplied>[e]</supplied> you may tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Leslie if he says any more on the subject that you have got a wife to take care of at home. Meanwhile she must take care of herself, and close her letter, short as it is, and go to bed for her head is aching beyond all bearing.</p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have just received a letter from Haddington, enclosing one from Mrs Crichton to Miss Welsh on the subject of <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi>, which has <pb id="pg-04-15" n="04:15"/>put me into no little astonishment and embarrassment. It runs as follows: (<date when="1826-01-13">13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Jan<hi rend="italic">ry</hi></date>)</p>
<p>&#x201C;Last Sunday my Husband gave me your Letter with strict charges not to delay carrying a message to you, and to say that only very constant business had prevented his writing to you himself. The message is that to the last day of taking offers, he had been on the look-out for your Friend; but that no such person had appeared. Of course nothing could be done or said: but I am sure there was more than a <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> of your letter having been a good introduction.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now what in all the wide world of art and nature are we to make of this? Did you not publickly give him in the offer in my Father&#x2019;s name? Has the man lost it, or does he mean to <hi rend="italic">sham</hi> by this appearance of mistake? The latter I can hardly think; for it were a trick unworthy of a Bewcastle horse-couper.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A village and parish in Cumberland, sixteen miles northeast of Carlisle. A horse-couper is Scots for horse-dealer.</note> Jane Welsh is in despair at the business; and professes her entire readiness to do <hi rend="italic">any thing</hi> that I shall bid her in this affair. To her I shall write to-morrow by the earliest post; instructing her to explain to Mrs Crichton (who as ill luck would have it is gone out of Town, neither I nor I fear Jane knows whither <hi rend="italic">for a week</hi>) that an offer most certainly <hi rend="italic">was</hi> made and a good one too. The Major, she says, is not to be back for <hi rend="italic">a month</hi>; in which case perhaps some good may still be done. I think I never was more irritated in my life than at this piece of misunderstanding. We must haste, haste to see if we can remedy it, while time still is.</p>
<p>Can you by any manner of means learn Major Crichton or Lord Montagu&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry James Montagu Scott (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845">1845</date>), who succeeded to the Barony on the death of his grandfather George, Duke of Montagu. He had four daughters but no son, and the title became extinct upon his death.</note> address in London? If not, it might almost be worth while to gallop off to Dabton and seek it, and send him off without delay some such letter as the following.</p>

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I have just had a letter from Miss Welsh of Haddington on the subject of the farm of <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi> containing an extract of one from Your Lady to the following effect:</p>
<p>(<date when="1826-01-13">13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Jan<hi rend="italic">ry</hi></date>) &#x201C;Last Sunday my Husband gave me your Letter with &#x26;c &#x26;c [copying all the rest of it to the word] good introduction&#x201D;&#x2014;[and marking the sides of it as I have done].<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brackets.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-16" n="04:16"/>There must be some unaccountable mistake in this matter; for to a certainty my Son did make offer to you in my name for this farm of Shawbrae at Dumfries on Wednesday the &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of <date when="1825-12">December</date>, the public day appointed for taking in offers. The rent proposed by me was &#xa3; 230 (for the lands which you intended to constitute the future farm of Shawbrae <hi rend="italic">together with</hi> the lands of Lower Bogside at present occupied by Mr Hunter); and you yourself had the goodness to specify on the margin of the paper which he signed, the particular pieces of ground which he had in view.</p>
<p>If this document is lost, may I hope that you will be so obliging as to consider the present letter in the light of an equivalent for it, that so the recommendation of my kind friend, and your kind attention to it may not be utterly lost.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With much respect, I remain, Sir &#x26;c</salute></closer></p>
<name>James Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<p>Some such letter as this would still have the force of an offer; and to me it seems quite possible that nothing whatever may have been determined about the matter yet. But I am appointed to dine with Brewster, and the last moment of my time is run. Heaven keep us all! and help us out of this and every difficulty! I am coming in a <hi rend="italic">few days</hi>! I will write to you before then, and you will now get a paper regularly every Saturday. My Heart&#x2019;s Love to our Mother and all about the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Hills. Believe me ever My dear Alick</p>
<closer><salute>Your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>P.S. 10 o&#x2019;clock. I left this letter with Jack, for him to fill with an epistle to our Mother; which the judicious Jack has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done; but on the con<supplied>[trary]</supplied> has gone out, and left me to manage the affair as I think proper myself. P<supplied>[er]</supplied>haps it is as well after all.&#x2014; On maturely thinking of this matter, I cannot but believe that there is <hi rend="italic">no sham</hi> in it, and that you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get the farm, <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> your offer reach London in time. Unless the decision is arrived when you get this, I would therefore counsel you to write off to him (Crichton) at all hazards, without the loss of a moment. The Major may still have your offer for Shawbrae among his papers, but it has <hi rend="italic">never</hi> struck him that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were the party recommended by Miss Welsh. Perhaps he may discover this at London; perhaps not. There is not an instant to be lost in setting the matter in a clear light. As I said, I will write to Haddington tomorrow; and do you write off to Crichton some such letter as I have composed for you; and if you are expeditious, the thing may still be well. I fear <pb id="pg-04-17" n="04:17"/>you will be able to make little sense of this, certainly the most confused and <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbled</hi></foreign> epistle that ever I wrote in this world. I have been hurried and perplexed in the writing of it as never man on Earth was, and have sent it off in the most pressing haste, that all we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do in this affair may be done.</p>
<p>As to my own concerns, they go on well enough. The printing has commenced and proceeds apace: I am still at a loss for books; but they have sent off to Germany in quest of some, and I hope they will be here in time. I fixed my bargin <hi rend="italic">in writing</hi> with Tait to-day: he is a Turk in grain this Tait; but I have him fettered by black and white. So soon as I have got books and other implements collected, I purpose to go home, and carry on the printing and writing as I did the other year. I will write to you when to expect me: it may be <hi rend="italic">next week</hi>, perhaps even earlier; but things are in a state of uncertainty as yet. When is the Carrier coming out? Write by post, if he is not coming directly; and let me know <hi rend="italic">the instant</hi> any thing definite occurs about this farm, at all events. Write soon, whether any thing occurs or not&#x2014; Ever yours.</p>
<p>Leslie the Professor, whom I saw the other day was speaking of a German Nobleman that wanted some one like me to go to <hi rend="italic">Munich</hi> and teach him English literature and science. I said I was ready to hear the Nobleman talk on the subject; but I expect to hear no farther tell of it, and at any rate have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> mind to go.</p></ps>

<dateline><place>21. Salisbury-street</place>, Tuesday [<date when="1826-01-17">17 January 1826</date>]&#x2014;</dateline>
<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your letter of yesterday threw me, for some minutes, into no small perplexity; nothing but &#x201C;confusion worse confounded&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 995.</note> appeared on all aspects of the matter. The true state of the case, however, now seems plain enough; and what is better, still some hope (tho&#x2019; not too much) is left of bringing the affair into order. Haste! Haste! is the word at present, if we would do any good: for this reason I am troubling you again on this most prosaic of concerns.</p>
<p>In making his offer Alick naturally enough did not give the smallest hint of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, not knowing at that time whether you would be generous enough to write in his favour or not; tho&#x2019; as it afterwards <pb id="pg-04-18" n="04:18"/>turned out, you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> already done so at that date. Major Crichton again had never suspected that he was the party recommended by you; and had huddled in his <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> among the thousand and one which he was that day publickly receiving; and in the press of business, the oversight continued still unnoticed. Perhaps he may still of his own accord discover the mistake; perhaps not, for it is possible enough that he may forget my Father&#x2019;s name as mentioned in your letter, and turn over his <hi rend="italic">offer</hi> as he will have to do some hundreds with slight notice. It is even possible that he may have lost the document altogether: but this seems very unlikely.</p>
<p>Now unless the Major protracts the term of his decision beyond the appointed day, we are all lost, and need not wrinkle a feature of our face on the matter, for it is already settled, and nothing short of the King, Lords and Commons of this realm can produce any change in it. The offers were given in on Wednesday three weeks, and he told the offerers at that time that in <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> the business would be finally determined, and he would <hi rend="italic">write</hi> to his Baronry-officer from London, communicating the result. I hope, however, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yet determined, and that the whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> may be happily unravelled.</p>
<p>Do you know at this moment where Mrs Crichton is? In Fife, she says; for a week: but can your letter find her there? A week may be as good as an age; a single post may be fatal to the whole scheme. At all events, write to her the first moment; ordering the letter to be &#x201C;forwarded&#x201D; if you think that best, or to wait for her here, if not: she cannot be away above a few days longer at most. Tell her to transmit instant intelligence to her Husband that the &#x201C;James Carlyle&#x201D; recommended by you did actually offer; a rent of &#xa3;230 for the lands of <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lower Bogside</hi>; and that if the Major look among his papers, he will assuredly find it written so there, and in his own or his clerk&#x2019;s handwriting, for he himself specified on the margin of the printed paper the particular pieces of ground which his offerer had in view, that day at Dumfries when all and sundry were offering. If this notice reach him in time, the whole will be well: if not, we have done all we can, and <hi rend="italic">Shawbrae</hi> may go to&#x2014;Jericho if it like.</p>
<p>To guard against the only remaining possibility of mistake (the Major&#x2019;s having <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> the paper containing this offer), I have despatched the speediest intelligence to Mainhill, advising them to send off <hi rend="italic">another</hi> offer with express mention of your name, and explanation of the mistake. If Alick can find the Major&#x2019;s address, this will do of itself; only I fear it will not be discoverable in Annandale; and they must go <pb id="pg-04-19" n="04:19"/>to Dabton for it, which will cause the loss of another post if not of two. I gave them the first paragraph of Mrs Crichton&#x2019;s letter to you to copy.</p>
<p>By these sagacious measures, I am in hopes, the whole business may still be satisfactorily adjusted. For the rest, if it come to nothing, never mind it; you have done your part, and so have all the rest; and your kind feelings towards me and all that concerns me are as apparent as if I had actually <hi rend="italic">got</hi> by your means the fee-simple of the British Islands<supplied>[.]</supplied> Let us rest contented with this; for it is of value by itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps if you do not know Mrs Crichton&#x2019;s address in Fife, the speediest and surest way would be to send your letter in a parcel to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; directing me where to find her abode in Edinburgh; and there I can investigate her present whereabout, and despatch the letter to her by post. I shall wait in the house tomorrow forenoon in case you think of this expedient.</p>
<p>I make no excuses and feel no &#x201C;shame&#x201D; for troubling you in this way: I can hardly even &#x201C;regret&#x201D; that you are getting so many stupid commissions on my account. For it is on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> account; and I am yours, and you are my little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Br&#xE4;utchen</hi></foreign> [little bride], and a part of my own self, and I love you&#x2014;very considerably.</p>
<p>This plan of taking up house in the vicinity of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> has not left me, nor does it seem so foolish as you appear to think it. I must and will have shelter from the horrors of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lodgings; and unless my scale of expences be graduated on the minutest principle, I am like to find it in an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> jail. Can <hi rend="italic">you</hi> suffer poverty? Do you know what it means? It is a word of three syllables, easily written, and looks romantic when spoken by the side of household love. Alas! Alas! The bearing if it is a different matter. For myself I am happy, and <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> in the midst of it; but you, my poor Jane, would <hi rend="italic">die</hi> before you learned this wisdom as I have had to learn it. There are many miracles in this world: but for a woman to descend from Superfluity to live with a sick ill-natured man in Poverty, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in wretchedness, would be the greatest miracle of all. But I will tell you about this at large some other day. For the present it is but diverting you from your appointment. Tomorrow I expect to hear. <closer><salute>Rich or poor, sick or well, you have me altogether and forever.</salute></closer></p>

<salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebstes Weibchen</hi></foreign> [Dearest little woman]!</salute>
<p>I cannot but regret that you have had such a poor pennyworth in me of late: I have never had it in my power to write to you with the smallest portion of deliberation; and what I have written, in the midst of bustle and perplexity, has been nothing but a series of commissions involving you in toil and trouble. My good kind Jane! I do wonder at your patience and long-suffering; at the unwearied love and helpfulness with which you meet me in all the purposes that it enters into my heart to imagine. I have not found such Faith; no not in Israel.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 7:9; Matt. 8:10.</note> But it shall all be rewarded, if Fortune be not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hard a mistress, and my life more implicated and perverse than I have reason to expect. O Jane! I will love thee as thou wert never loved: I feel it in my secret heart that thou art dear to me beyond the utterance of words, that we are bound together by invisible ties, and cords of inmost affection stronger than the arrows of Death! No, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebchen</hi></foreign>, there is nothing that shall part us: for thou lovest me, and thou art worthy the devotion of <pb id="pg-04-21" n="04:21"/>an undivided soul, and there is a soul which shall yet be thine in all its entireness. I am the &#x201C;Doubting Thomas,&#x201D; it is too true; but there is a strength of generous faith in thee which will call me back to life and hope and boundless love.</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Monday.</hi>&#x2014;So far had I written on Saturday-afternoon, in the full faith that my words would reach your ear that night, when a &#x201C;Curious Impertinent&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Cervantes&#x2019; interpolated tale of &#x201C;The Curious Impertinent&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>, Part I.</note> knocked at my door, and favoured me with a transition into quite a new set of ideas. I was still in hope that I might get the man despatched in time; but just as the ceremony was concluding, who should enter but your famous Pedagogue, James Johnston from Broughty Ferry! Of course all thought of writing was banished for the day; and it is not till this moment, such has been the empty bustle round me, that I have got an hour&#x2019;s composure to conclude my letter. James is off to Haddington, to drink tea with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> this evening! <hi rend="italic">He</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">I</hi>! My heart is rather sad; but we shall say no more of it.</p>
<p>I meant to tell you that your punctuality in the affair of Major Crichton was not in vain: I carried your letter to his Father-in-law&#x2019;s; had it properly addressed, and put it into the office that night. The Major would receive it on Saturday morning; and I am in good hopes it would not be too late. Last time I heard from home, no shadow of a decision had reached them. Alick missed the Major at Dumfries, by two minutes, on the day of his departure; otherwise this part of the perplexity need not have occurred. I owe you much for the spirit of devotedness which you have shown me in this small concern: <hi rend="italic">the Duke</hi> has no farm or class of farms in his possession which I would accept in exchange for my glorious lordship in your bosom; he has not, and will never have, so precious an inheritance, tho&#x2019; all his manors were enlarged a thousand fold. O Jane, why do I murmur at my Destiny! It is no girl&#x2019;s-fondness that irradiates my path with false and transient splendour: it is the calm deliberate love of a noble-minded woman that has given her generous self to me without reserve, the influences of whose fair spirit shine over my life with the warmth and light of a mild <date when="--05">May</date> Sun. And I complain, and call myself unhappy? Shame on me, for a discontented misanthrope!</p>
<p>On the whole I do not mean to <hi rend="italic">weep</hi> much more over you; but to try what I can do to help you, and make the most for you, of your bad bargain. I feel more and more the need for both of us of being mingled with the current of human business; of being united in the eye of God <pb id="pg-04-22" n="04:22"/>and man, and beginning a new life in each other&#x2019;s arms. Who knows but by this time twelvemonth we may be married! Married&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">O Du guter Gott</hi></foreign> [O thou good Lord]!&#x2014;and Jane shall be mine, and I shall be hers and not another&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Him had I chosen from all others, / His would I be, and not another&#x2019;s; / To me his love was all in all.&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, Book VI&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). See Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIII, 413.</note> and the soft breath of wedded love shall shed its balm over us, and refresh the thirsty desart of existence into fragrance and verdure as of Heaven! My kind little <foreign><hi rend="italic">T&#xF6;chterchen</hi></foreign> [daughter]! And you will scold me, and quarrel with me, and then kiss me into peace; and be my true wife, and attend me in my pilgrimage thro&#x2019; height and depth, and take poverty with me, before wealth and honour with another! But is it really so? Or is it only opposition that excites you, that you <supplied>[think]</supplied> a union with me precious because it seems difficult of attainment? If I were to become happy and a Seladon, would you become a coy Phillis?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pastoral lovers C&#xE9;ladon and Phillis occur in the romance <hi rend="italic">Astr&#xE9;e</hi> by Honor&#xE9; d&#x2019;Urf&#xE9; (<date when="1567">1567</date>&#x2013;<date when="1625">1625</date>), though in fact Astr&#xE9;e herself was C&#xE9;ladon&#x2019;s mistress, not Phillis.</note> Indeed you would not: you are mine thro&#x2019; good report and bad report; and you have loved me with a noble trust, which might make you worthy of the best on Earth, and which my poor fortunes cannot diminish or increase.</p>
<p>But I must descend from the heights of sentiment into the level of sense, and tell you what I mean to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for realizing all these glories. Something I must and will do; and that without undue loitering. Of late I have been meditating more intently than ever the project of that Literary Newspaper. Brewster is still full of it, so is the Bookseller Tait: I myself think it would pay well, but the labour is tremendous. Brewster, it seems, had engaged Lockhart to take a third share in it along with him and me; in which case, I should have closed with the proposal without hesitation. Now Lockhart&#x2019;s preferment has overturned all that, and the matter rests where it was. I view it with wavering feelings, in which on the whole hope and desire predominate. As to the nature of the business it may be honourable or base according to the nature of its accomplishment. Did not the great Schlegel edite a literary Newspaper at Jena? Did not Wieland and Schiller at Weimar?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wieland was editor of <hi rend="italic">Der Teutsche Merkur</hi>, to which Schiller was a frequent contributor (but not editor) in the years after his arrival at Weimar in <date when="1787">1787</date>. The brothers Schlegel edited the <hi rend="italic">Athen&#xE4;um</hi> (<date when="1798">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800">1800</date>), official organ of the Jena romantic group. By &#x201C;the great Schlegel&#x201D; Carlyle probably means Friedrich Schlegel.</note> By and by the business would get lighter, and I should get help in <pb id="pg-04-23" n="04:23"/>carrying it on, and find leisure for more permanent and weighty undertakings. Brewster would have it begun at Whitsunday or <date when="1826-11">next November</date>: in either case I should have to live in this vicinity, in my own hired house. Twice have I actually been out spying the aspects of the country; <supplied>[it]</supplied> is not an hour since I returned from Morning-side, where there are houses in plenty <supplied>[of]</supplied> every quality. My plan would be to take a small one; bring in Mary and Jane to keep it for me, till I saw the promise of our enterprize, and then bring in&#x2014; If she would come! Would she? How do you like this form of action? Give me all your criticisms without stint or reservation. It is right that we should both be satisfied, for it is strictly an affair of the <hi rend="italic">common-weal</hi>. Poor old common-weal! It is pity that it should not flourish better: but we will manage it and force it to flourish.</p>
<p>At present I am sicker than usual, and must not think of staying here. Will you write to me, before I go, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ein langes und breites</hi></foreign> [at length]? I talk of setting off on Thursday morning: perhaps it may be Friday; for I should like to see the termination of the schoolmaster concern before I went. Honest James<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnston.</note> must surely prosper: he is grown five years older since I saw him last spring; for &#x201C;care sits on his faded cheek,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 601&#x2013;2.</note> and the world is to him a <foreign><hi rend="italic">fremmt</hi></foreign> [foreign] abode. Write largely in the interim if you have any time; if not I shall be patient as possible. Have you written to my Mother at the Hill? In your own good time. Alick sent me some kind thanks to you, the terms of which I have forgot, the spirit of them you can easily figure.</p>
<p>The other day I was walking along Princes-street in company with Dr Brewster, and saw Eliza Stoddart&#x2019;s kind face as she was turning up a cross street. She evidently noticed me, and was pointing me out to another young lady who was holding by her arm. I turned away my eyes; for the pressure of etiquette was too heavy for me to bear. Tell Eliza that I saluted her in my heart, and wished her all good things; and if you like you may give her a kiss in my name, and I will pay you at the rate of two thousand per cent on sight. This is fair trade; is it not?</p>
<p>My sheet is done, and the hour of four is just at hand. Tonight I have to write to Goethe, and send him the Copy of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> by a person that is going to London. Therefore I must on all accounts have done.&#x2014; There is nothing but bankruptcy going on here. Constable the huge bookseller has failed; then Ballantyne (my present printer); and <pb id="pg-04-24" n="04:24"/>today Sir Walter Scott. Sir Walter was deeply involved with both: his debt is said to be &#xa3;60,000; and it seems he takes it heavily to heart; is fallen sick and gone to bed, and refuses to be comforted. <foreign><hi rend="italic">O curas hominum! O quantum est in rebus inane!</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;O the cares of men! O the emptiness of human affairs!&#x201D; (Persius, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, 1). The news had fallen on Scott between <date when="1826-01-17">17</date> and <date when="1826-01-20">20 Jan.</date> and was soon known in Edinburgh, although it did not become public knowledge until the following week.

<p>Are you got well again? Or is the headache still perplexing you? I shall never forgive myself if I have made you worse. But you must and shall get well; for you are mine, and I would not give you for the Universe. God keep us both!</p>

<p>Here are letters for your Mother and Jane, but none, my Beloved for you&#x2014; Your last deserves a fuller and more deliberate answer than I have yet had leisure to give it; as, for some days and <hi rend="italic">nights</hi> past I have been wholly occupied about the momentous <hi rend="italic">election</hi>; and this morning I feel spiritless and worn out to the last degree;&#x2014;much more inclined to sleep than to write. But you shall have a long letter from me, presently, at the Hill; in the meantime, taking it for granted that you have not left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I send the rest of my commands, for Annandale, which in the bustle of yesterday I was prevented from getting ready to go along with James Johnston. He is a worthy creature that, as ever I saw but oh far too nervous for this world. He had nearly given up the Gohst [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] under the operation of examination. The hard and stony hearts of all present were melted at his state&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carry my most affectionate regards to all your people, and a Sister&#x2019;s kiss to my dear Child&#x2014; Say to Alick that if good wishes were farms he would not be long without one&#x2014; Farewell my own Brother&#x2014;or Husband if you like that better&#x2014; I live in the hope of your speedy return, <pb id="pg-04-25" n="04:25"/>when perhaps you will find things wearing a more prosperous aspect&#x2014;Yesterday, when I was packing up your Mother&#x2019;s caps&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">my</hi> Mother with a sort of half kind air brought me a little handkerchief and said &#x201C;you may put in that if you choose for Jane&#x201D;&#x2014; You may believe I thanked her with all my heart for this small mercy, and hailed it as an indication of returning good humour, with great joy<supplied>[.]</supplied> Oh Yes, Love, all will come right in process of time&#x2014;only&#x2014;I am afraid we shall die in the interim&#x2014; God bless you at all events&#x2014;expect to hear from me very soon</p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle</salute>
<p><hi rend="italic">Thomas</hi> mentioned your wish to hear from me, more than two weeks since, and the intimation, I assure you, would have placed me at my writing-desk forthwith; but that it happened I had a cap for you just then on hands, which, I somehow settled in my own mind <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go along with the letter&#x2014; Now, I am by no means, the very speediest needle-woman in the world, as you had ample opportunity of noticing, while I sojourned at the Hill; and besides I have been unfitted for working at anything lately, but by starts, owing to an almost continual severe pain in my head: so that, all things considered, it is sufficiently intelligible, how, with the best intentions I should not have put the finishing stitch to this labour of love, till within the present hour&#x2014; And what is it after all my pains? Alas that I have to fall on so paltry a shift to manifest my affectionate remembrance of you! Alas that it has not pleased Fate to make me a powerful Queen, or even a powerful subject!&#x2014; Alas, finally, that the whole universe is not ordered just according to my good pleasure!&#x2014; It is better, you are thinking, as it is&#x2014; Well! at bottom, perhaps I think so too&#x2014; But yet the wide discrepancy <pb id="pg-04-26" n="04:26"/>between my wishes and my powers <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, at times, send a sharp pang thro&#x2019; my heart, and tempt me to doubt, if <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> whatever is be best&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you believe it, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has been within sixteen miles of me for three weeks, and we have not once seen each other&#x2019;s face! Now, is not this a pretty story? Can any one fancy a severer trial of patience? Positively, I am expecting to have my name transmitted to posterity along with the Patriarch Job&#x2019;s; for the <hi rend="italic">woman</hi>, who could undergo this thing, and yet not die of rage, could also survive, with a meek spirit, the carrying away of oxen and apes, the burning up of sheep, and even the smothering of sons and daughters&#x2014; However, it seems probable that he will speedily return for a longer period; and in the meantime, perhaps Fate may get into a more gracious humour: if she does n<supplied>[ot,]</supplied> I see nothing for it, but to take the upper hand with her&#x2014;if we can&#x2014; Enter James Johnston&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well! here is one thing settled to my heart&#x2019;s content; the Parish school is actually ours. Honest James was told the good news of his election, sitting by my side, and it would <supplied>[be]</supplied> difficult to say, whether he or I was the happiest. For, besides the pleasure which, I knew, this termination to the business would give to <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Somebody&#x2019;</hi>; I have very great cause to be rejoiced at it, upon my own account. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Johnston will be worth his weight of gold to me, in my present situation; I am so ill off for someone to talk to about&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Greek and Latin</hi>.</p>
<p>Were the Schawbrae affair but come to as happy an issue; I should take heart and think that the <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>wheel of my Destiny&#x201D; had made a turn. But &#x201C;when an equal poise of hope and fear does arbitrate the event, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> nature is, that I incline to <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> rather than hope.&#x201D; The Major will surely not <supplied>[kee]</supplied>p us much longer in suspense&#x2014; I mu<supplied>[st]</supplied> write a few lines to Jane in return <supplied>[for]</supplied> her postscript.</p>
<p>P S&#x2014;I will send a proper front for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> caps when I go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; but there is no such thing to be got in all this royal Borough&#x2014; A certain barber in the place is the happy possessor of three red ones; A black one, I suppose, would have been too much&#x2014; The muslin cap you will perceive has met with an accident behind, which I hope you will put up with on account of the excellence of my darning&#x2014;</p>
<p>Remember me in the kindest manner to all the rest&#x2014; Make much of Thomas now that you have got him back again. And never cease to think of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with affection<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied> It will be long before I forget you&#x2014;or the time I spent beside you&#x2014;<name>Jane Welsh</name></p>

<p>In the <date when="1826">beginning of 1826</date>, or perhaps before that year quite began, I went to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, to start the printing of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>; and staid some weeks, watching and directing till that bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> was fairly under way.

Of course I was at Haddington now &#x26; ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Translating</hi>, I conclude, was suspended till my return home;&#x2014;exact dates now lost. <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> themselves turned up unexpectedly, last summer; honour to the dear Repositress, my ever careful &#x26; pious Mother,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">preparing</hi> for her Son some beautiful &#x26; solemn hours as yet far off!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The &#x2018;James Johnston&#x2019; spoken of here was a townsfellow, and then a college acquaintance, of mine; 6 or 7 years my elder, but very fond of discoursing with me, and much my compan<hi rend="italic">n</hi> while in Annandale tog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; within reach. A poor and not a very gifted man, but a faithful, dilig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and accurate; of quietly pious, candid, pure charact<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x2014;and very much attached to me. In return I liked him honestly well; learnt something from him (the always dilig<hi rend="italic">tly exact</hi> in Book-matters); perhaps ultimately taught something; and had great satisfact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in his company (in the years <date when="1814">1814</date>&#x2013;&#x2019;<date when="1816">16</date>, and occasionally aft<hi rend="italic">ds</hi>). Poor James c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not succeed in the world: perhaps it was ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <date when="1820">1820</date> when (after much sorry schoolmastering, having renounced <hi rend="italic">Divinity</hi> pursuits), he went to Halifax, Nova-Scotia, on a <hi rend="italic">Tutorage</hi>, well-paid &#x26; hopeful enough; got almost frozen there, got fever-&#x26;-ague there, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and returned in a year or doubtless so, with health permanently injured, and outlook, more forlorn than ever. Dark times for poor Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi>,&#x2014;I mostly distant, in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, <hi rend="italic">not</hi>&#x2018;corresponding&#x2019; much.

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>You are now, I suppose, sitting in peace and quietness within your own four walls, waiting, patiently, for the promised <hi rend="italic">long broad</hi> letter that became due to you last week&#x2014; And far be it from me to disappoint you in any such most reasonable expectation; particularly since two nights of sound sleep have left me no sort of apology for a longer delay.</p>
<p>I declare I hardly know whether to laugh or to weep over this last act of our drama; it appears altogether so tragi-comic, now that one has leisure to think. Ever since our sorrowful parting upon the highway, I had looked forward to your arrival in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as the next epoch of hope; and not doubting but I should find you there any time for a month, graciously accepted an invitation from the hatefulest family of my acquaintance. All for nothing; since the prospect of meeting is vanished, like unto Adoniss gardens;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane may have in mind the Garden of Adonis in the <hi rend="italic">Faerie Queene</hi>, III, 6, 39, a delightful meeting place where, however, the scythe of time mows down &#x201C;the flowering herbs and goodly things.&#x201D; According to the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi>, an &#x201C;Adonis Garden&#x201D; also came to mean a very perishable food, because of the herb gardens planted in Adonis&#x2019; name which rapidly withered after the annual celebration in his honor.</note> and the &#x201C;wine of <pb id="pg-04-29" n="04:29"/>worm-wood&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Jer. 9:15.</note> remains to be swallowed undisguised by any morsel of sweet. To complete the business; no sooner are eighty good miles betwixt <supplied>[us]</supplied> than my Mother becomes the very best, reasonablest Mother alive&#x2014; The little present to Jane, and her great kindness to James Johnston had already led me to prognosticate fair weather; but now I am actually basking in the <date when="1826-04">April</date>-sunshine of her smiles,&#x2014;a change wonderfully refreshing after the tremendous phenomena that preceded it. Last night we were positively confidential: she was inveighing against Haddington, and asked me flatly if I should have any objection to leave it&#x2014; None, I told her; I had already been here too long&#x2014;she then questioned me about where I should like best to fix my abode; and this called forth a <hi rend="italic">speech</hi>,&#x2014;the longest, I think, I ever made in my life. All places, I told her were alike indifferent to me, so long as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had no settled habitation. Therefore she need have no sort of scruple about pleasing herself, and taking up house, as she wished, in Dumfries-shire Only in case of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> settling in the neighbourhood of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as you were, at present, half determined, and being some way enabled by the blessing of heaven to make a livelihood for two, it would not be worthwhile perhaps that we should make any intermediate change, &#x201C;I say <hi rend="italic">we</hi>,&#x201D; I added, &#x201C;because wheresoever it is appointed <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to live, you cannot, surely, intend we should ever live asunder.&#x201D; At this she burst into tears and exclaimed throwing her arms about my neck, &#x201C;why have you never said as much before?&#x201D; Our dialogue was long and interesting; the result of it, a prospectus for a &#x201C;joint stock company&#x201D; such as it hath never yet entered man&#x2019;s heart to conceive, and which I hereby submit to you for your mature deliberation, as a party concerned. <foreign>He bien!</foreign> you are to hire the said nice little house, by all manner of means, and <date when="1826-11">next November</date> we are to&#x2014;hire one within some dozen yards of it!! so that we may all live together like one family until such time as we are married, and after&#x2014; I had infinite trouble in bringing my Mother to give ear to this magnificent project. She was clear for giving up fortune, house-gear, everything to you and I, and going to live with my poor old grandfather at Templand: but my arguments, prayers, tears and kisses at length got a promise from her that she would do exactly as I pleased; and my pleasure is, to live with you in poverty all the days of my life sooner than encroach in the smallest degree on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> independence. No? God forbid! What sort of happiness could I expect <pb id="pg-04-30" n="04:30"/>ever in your arms, were I conscious of having failed in the first duty of my life! Whatever comes of it then my Mother <hi rend="italic">must</hi> keep my fortune, or else she must keep&#x2014;myself&#x2014; But how do you relish my plan? Should you not like to have such agreeable neighbours? We would walk together every day and you would come and take tea with us at nights<supplied>[.]</supplied> To <hi rend="italic">me</hi> it seems as if the kingdom of Heaven were at hand&#x2014; As for the literary newspaper, so that it does not hurt your health, it is perhaps better than <hi rend="italic">farming</hi> after all&#x2014; The part of your scheme however, I cannot possibly approve, which is, bringing in your young Sisters to keep your house. Indeed my Darling they would make but sorry housekeepers in a situation so new and strange and you, with all your kindness and wisdom would make a still sorrier <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>. Whatever you do never think of carrying off Jane. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is my child, and shall go no such road; till I am there to guard her. of this you may rest assured&#x2014; Any news of Schawbrae? Tell me presently&#x2014; I have not said a hundredth part <hi rend="italic">of what I know</hi> and yet my paper is nearly filled. Attribut<supplied>[e]</supplied> my dulness to partial intoxication&#x2014; I drink strong ale at present to make me sleep, and it operates by making me in the first place tipsy&#x2014; Write&#x2014; Write&#x2014; My kind love to your Mother and all the rest. &#x201C;Would I come?&#x201D; certainly not&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack [Alexander Carlyle writes],</salute>
<p>As an opportunity occurs of sending you a letter to day along with <hi rend="italic">the proofsheets</hi>, I am loath to let it pass unimproved, tho&#x2019; in truth I have little or nothing to communicate in return to your kind little note which I received by the Waffler.</p>
<p>You are &#x201C;well enough tho&#x2019; very busy and confused and sometimes sad&#x201D; you say. I am sorry, my dear Brother, to tell you that my own condition at present is still less enviable. Instead of &#x201C;being busy&#x201D; I am <hi rend="italic">bone</hi>-idle (which in itself is a curse) <hi rend="italic">ill-haired</hi> [surly] and <hi rend="italic">often</hi> sad. Truely Jack &#x201C;we have much to struggle with,&#x201D; as you remark, and greatly need each others consolation and brotherly support. Matters <hi rend="italic">will</hi> <pb id="pg-04-31" n="04:31"/>change (Time and hours wear out the roughest blast<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, iii.</note>) and I hope the date is not distant nor the day far away. &#x201C;His Honour&#x201D; you will be surprised to learn, and us have at last come to a final settlement about this weary farm. He has engaged [Alexander stops; Thomas begins] (Alick is off to Annan, and the Proof-sheets cannot wait; so I must write a dash or two myself. &#x201C;His Honour has engaged&#x201D;) to let the worthy tenants out of this El Dorado of a farm, on the simple payment of their rent; formally and in black and white, taking on himself all <hi rend="italic">clags</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Legal term: encumbrances.</note> and claims, which Blackadders heirs or any man woman or child on God&#x2019;s Earth may pretend to allege against them on that score. In short he has found himself induced to do just as they wished him; and so, Heaven be thanked, this poorest of all poor stories has now had a beginning, a middle, and&#x2014;an end.</p>
<p>We have lost Shawbrae: Creighton seems to be a <foreign>whippler</foreign> [trifler], is believed to have lied to us; and &#x201C;Bob of the Bank&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Irving of Supplebank.</note> gets Supplebank, Bogside and Shawbrae! Our Mother was terribly frightened with that hasty letter that I sent; thinking some one or both of us must be dead: when she found it but to indicate the loss of the farm her remark was: Plague may care! They considered it even then as lost; yet they sent away their letter, and <hi rend="italic">next day</hi> heard word that Bob was the favoured candidate. An answer came to them yesterday; saying, in a polite page and a half, rather less than&#x2014;nothing. Here then is another thing that is ended.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal in the human breast: our Father is now all agog about <hi rend="italic">Scotsbrig</hi>; to which Robert Carlyle,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle&#x2019;s cousin, of Waterbeck. (See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 229 n.)</note> acquainted with the <foreign>Laird</foreign>, has volunteered in his handsomest style to introduce him. The letter is off: and another week will likely give us farther news of it. Alick seems to care little for it: I imagine he rather wants a place of his own; and this I hope he will soon have. For the present he is without work, or has only very little. The rest seem to think Scotsbrig would do; but they put no faith in getting it, tho&#x2019; I cannot but think it seems to have some likelihood.</p>
<p>I had to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> from Beattock,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beattock, on the Glasgow-London coach road, is about two miles from Moffat and twenty miles from Ecclefechan.</note> and a nasty job it was. The Glasgow Coach I found went down exactly half an hour&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> mine arrived. <pb id="pg-04-32" n="04:32"/>I reached Mainhill about nine o&#x2019;clock; and my luggage came down next day by the Mail. I am fast getting round to my old state.</p>
<p>Ma-Corking-pin [M&#x2019;Corkindale] does not understand this work of proof-sheets: last night he sent me two&#x2014;for which I paid simply 1/1 each, the whole packet (the same if it had contained forty) being charged 2/2. I have sent him a note expounding the matter: if you see him, you can explain it farther.</p>
<p>I have written Fouqu&#xE9;&#x2019;s Life;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> (<date when="1827">1827</date>).</note> almost a sheet; and the vilest piece of scribbling you ever saw.

The hand of the diligent maketh rich.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 10:4.</note></p>
<p>They are speaking about sending you another box by and by. Next time I hope you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> catch M&#x2019;Corkindale&#x2019;s proofs, and send us a long <supplied>[letter]</supplied> explaining both what you have (either in your heart or your wall-pre<supplied>[ss)]</supplied> and also what you want. Have you changed your lodgings? Have you put pen to paper on your <hi rend="italic">Thesis</hi>?</p>
<p>If you go out, of a Saturday, you might cast an eye on &#x201C;Houses to let.&#x201D; Brewster must have failed in getting Wilson&#x2019;s consent;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To set up the proposed journal in which Carlyle was to have an important hand.</note> for which I cannot say that I am sorry. Nevertheless it is still possible, that I may come and settle in your city at Whitsuntide. A little while will try.</p>
<p>Our poor Aunt Anne is dead and buried, some ten days ago! She seemed to have had no pain or consciousness; but faded out of the world as in a sleep. Saunders&#x2019; wife (He of the <hi rend="italic">Manse</hi> at Ecclefechan) died since I went away, of a very few days illness. &#x201C;The cup goes round!&#x201D;</p>
<p>I have no more news or time to tell them. You will write with <hi rend="italic">Macork&#x2019;s sheets</hi>. All here salute you kindly. <closer><salute>I am your Aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I love you too well to put you on exercising your patience for another week; and unless I write today, that must inevitably be your fate. I am busy as ever man was at present; and have no hope of being otherwise for the next four months. The people have agreed on adding a <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> volume to their book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The people&#x201D; are William and Charles Tait, who published Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> in <date when="1827">1827</date>.</note> the printers are chacing me like greyhounds; so from dawn till dewy eve, and often till rainy midnight, I am kept in a perpetual flurry. Writing, riding, walking or smoking, there is no moment of my waking hours unoccupied. This very day I have retouched a sketch of La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;, which I expected to be dunned for tomorrow; retouched it, alas! in time stolen from divine service; and thro&#x2019; virtue of the same pious sacrilege, I am now writing to Miss Jane. In addition to all this, the present day is a <hi rend="italic">solemn fast</hi> with me; not on religious, but on dietetic principles: therefore you need look for nothing from me but haste, acerbity and <hi rend="italic">Tartareanism</hi>.</p>
<p>The business of Shawbrae is over. Alick sent off his letter as I directed, and next day, was informed&#x2014;that the farm had been appointed to another. They have since had a letter from the Major at Dabton, excusing the oversight by what appears to me extremely like&#x2014;a telling of the thing which is not. He says he thought the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> spoken of (the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> it seems <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in his mind) had been <foreign><hi rend="italic">Locherben! Credat Judaeus Apella!</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Apella the Jew may believe <supplied>[this]</supplied>!&#x201D; (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, v, 100).</note> I grieve to think that the Major should be a Variator of this sort: but no doubt of the matter is entertained by any one here, or indeed was, from the first intelligence of his communication to you. This, however, is the concern chiefly of the man himself; you and I have nothing more to do with it after ascertaining, what I think is tolerably well made out, that you stand under no obligation to him; farther than for inventing a lie to give you a civil denial with. As it now rests, you are even, and owe him no good or ill will for what he has done in the business. So let it lie!</p>
<p>And now, my own Jane, accept anew my gratitude, and that of all my kindred, for your prompt and warm kindness: you merit it and have it the more, that you have not prospered, that you have had to <pb id="pg-04-34" n="04:34"/>encounter both the trouble and the disappointment. I am sure as if I saw it, that you feel five hundred times more grief on the occasion than any other party concerned. In good truth, I know not myself whether it is a loss or not. Alick was all along of opinion that they had offered too much rent for the place; and the late fluctuations in the market had even considerably cooled the ardour of my father who is a much more imaginative character. All hands in the long run composed themselves without effort to wish joy of his prize to the Agriculturist who has got it; one of the most worthless persons extant in Annandale at present; and a man, as they thought, much better meriting to be ruined or reduced to straits than they. My Mother bids me <hi rend="italic">thank</hi> you, with a tone of double emphasis in her voice: she was dreadfully frightened at the letter I sent, with a hired messenger from the post-office, and &#x201C;haste&#x201D; on the back of it; Jack&#x2019;s approaching dissolution or yours or mine, or the general overturn of the Presbyterian establishment, seemed the least that it could forbode; and when Jane and she, the only parties at home, succeeded in deciphering the sheet, and found in it nothing but the loss of a paltry farm, they lifted up their voices in a chorus of glad derision, valuing not only all &#x201C;the Duke&#x2019;s land&#x201D; but &#x201C;all the land the <foreign><hi rend="italic">lift</hi></foreign> [sky] covers&#x201D; at a sum not exceeding the moderate charge of three farthings.</p>
<p>For the rest, &#x201C;hope springs eternal in the human breast.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi>, I, 95.</note> My Father is now bearing with crowded sails on a place called Scotsbridge;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scotsbrig, where Carlyle&#x2019;s parents were to live for the rest of their lives.</note> a finer farm, he thinks, than even Shawbrae, and to be had at a much lower rent. Another Carlyle<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Carlyle, of Waterbeck.</note> of this neighbourhood acquainted with the proprietor (or rather possessor of it; for it belongs to the mad Hogan of waterside in Nithsdale, but debt excludes him forever from any voice in the disposal of it) has volunteered to recommend him, and become his surety if any were required; and all are at present waiting for the issue. There, if they prosper, it is probable enough I may spend the summer. And at last&#x2014;enough, and more than enough of me and my acres!</p>
<p>You may believe I heartily rejoice in your reconciliation with your Mother; and pray that it may be permanent and cordial. It is so delightful a thing to live in unity with all men,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 133:1.</note> especially with those near and dear to us, that hardly any price is too high to pay for it. It will be your effort, I doubt not, to profit by this fair season, for convincing <pb id="pg-04-35" n="04:35"/>your Mother that she does you wrong in thinking that you do not love her as you ought; and me too, in thinking that I ever wished or can wish to abridge by one hairsbreadth her rights either to her own fortune or to my regard. It is pity that she does not, and never will, do me even the slight credit to which I think I can lay claim; but it is just so much the more pressingly my duty in that case to avoid the error which I regret in her, and to suffer no poor selfish feeling to alter the estimate of my mind regarding her. My deliberate opinion is that she will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> like me or find any pleasure in me; that it will be her wisdom therefore and yours also to keep me far from her; as it will be mine to endeavour at all times to act and feel towards her as to the virtuous, affectionate and honourable-minded, tho&#x2019; with me unsympathizing Mother of <supplied>[my]</supplied> Jane. You did right stoutly and peremptorily to put an end to all <supplied>[talk]</supplied> about surrendering of houses and fortunes and so forth. I hope we shall hear no more of that affair. Does your Mother think it possible that I should not agree with you to the very heart in that determination? That if I loved her I should wish to interfere with her comforts for the sake of bank-notes and mahogany furniture, neither of which I need&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allm&#xE4;chtiger Gott</hi></foreign> [Almighty God]! Or that if I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> love her, I should be a whit nearer wishing it?</p>
<p>What a bright project you have formed! Matured in a single night, like <hi rend="italic">Jock&#x2019;s Bean</hi> in the Nursery Tale, and with houses on it too! Ah Jane, Jane! I fear it will never answer half so well in practice as does on paper. It is impossible for two households to live as if they were one; doubly impossible (if there were degrees of impossibility) in the present circumstances. I shall never get any enjoyment of your company till you are all my own. How often have you seen me with pleasure in the presence of others? How often with positive dissatisfaction? For your own sake I should rejoice to learn that you were settled in Edinburgh; a scene much fitter for you than your present one: but I had rather that it were with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> than with any other. Are you sure that the number of <hi rend="italic">parties</hi> and formal visitors would be diminished in number or bettered in quality, according to the present scheme? My very heart also sickens at these things: the moment I am master of a house, the first use I turn it to will be to slam the door of it on the face of nauseous intrusions of all sorts which it can exclude; my prospective cottage would be calculated for different objects than your Mother&#x2019;s. O the hardness and inductility of earthly things! O the speed of will compared with that of power! Better to break the leg of Will that poor Power may not lose sight of it altogether. My will for <pb id="pg-04-36" n="04:36"/>the present is crushed and fractured till honest Power has even to take it by the arm and lug it along. I find myself wonderfully happier.</p>
<p>These are my first crude thoughts on the business: if you are <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> in your intention, I shall willingly resume them and may perhaps find many things to alter. After all what is my concurrence? Cannot you settle in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and I no whit the wiser? Do you doubt that I should rejoice to see you there, tho&#x2019; I had you to myself only for a minute in the week? Come, if your Mother will take charge of it; only let <hi rend="italic">her</hi> not <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, for fear of afterclaps. I wish from my soul you were out of Haddington. I wish from my soul, your hand were in mine, and we married in the eye of Heaven and Earth<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<closer><salute>Your&#x2019;s forever, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>[In margins:] James Johnston was staying with Jonathan when I left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that Friday. His youth seemed to be renewed even as the eagle&#x2019;s age<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260320-TC-JAC">TC to JAC, <date when="1826-03-20">20 March</date></ref>; and Ps. 103.5.</note> by his success in that &#x201C;election.&#x201D; You ought to rejoice in the good you have done; and I will thank you, as long as I live.</p>
<p>Jane, I suppose, purposes inditing a letter to your Mother for her kind and much respected present. I gave Jenny sixpence as she stood by, to prevent her dying of hidden chagrin: she is a kind-hearted little creature, and I could not bear the melancholy patience of her &#x201C;eagle eye.&#x201D; My Mother &#x201C;<foreign>kens</foreign> not <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to say&#x201D;: the caps are transcendental caps, worthy to be worn by queens or queenlike figures, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> has nothing to give you for them but <hi rend="italic">love</hi>, a draught on the &#x201C;Bank of Faith,&#x201D; which I am sure you will endorse. The darned cap, it appears, is much better for the <hi rend="italic">rent</hi>.</p>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>I have set you a dangerous example this time, which, I trust, you will be humane enough not to imitate. And, believe me, it is no symptom <pb id="pg-04-37" n="04:37"/>of declining grace that I have made you wait beyond the appointed term; well knowing how much anxiety the omission was likely to occasion you: for the truth of the matter (tho&#x2019; I am ashamed to be always harping on the same thing) is just that I have had another illness, and could not in consequence, write so soon as I wished&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Doctor would probably tell you of my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">weaver-shuttle</hi>&#x201D;-expedition into Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and probably, too, thro&#x2019; his Doctorial skill predict the consequences of it&#x2014; As was to be expected I have never had a day to do well in since, but have, for the most part<supplied>[,]</supplied> lain in bed, considerably more dead than alive&#x2014;yet console <foreign>toi</foreign> [yourself], my Beloved, for the worst is now, certainly, over; and I will take heed how I endanger a life that is yours another time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Well! and what, will you tell me, took you to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at all, when to your certain knowledge I had been gone two weeks&#x201D;? You may well ask what&#x2014; The inducement, then,&#x2014;that is, the ostensible inducement&#x2014;was to call for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Crichton, whom indisposition prevented from coming hither; but, besides this, I had a fancy to see our Brother John, the next best sight in the world after yourself; and to give directions about&#x2014;a gold ring&#x2014;no less! with a little heart on it of hair&#x2014;&#x201C;whose hair? Another Lancer&#x2019;s?&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Capt. James Baillie, her flashy cousin and former suitor.</note>&#x2014; <foreign>Nein! da sey Gott f&#xfc;r</foreign>!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane seems to be writing in short form: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Nein!

<p>And you really are not transported beyond measure at my project? Was ever mortal so difficult to please? He needs only to allow me the ground to build on; and I raise him up the most magnificent Castle,&#x2014;fast as thought! But, oh mercy what ground! It reminds me of the large whale, on which Crusoe&#x2019;s or Gulliver&#x2019;s or somebody&#x2019;s ship cast anchor; no sooner have I erected my superstructure on the supposed terra firma than it makes a movement, and the whole concern is a heap of ruins!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in the story of Sinbad the Sailor.</note> Seriously Dearest, you are the most tantalizing man in the world; and I the most tractable woman&#x2014; This time twelvemonth nothing would content you but to live in the Country; and tho&#x2019; a country-life, Heaven knows, never before attracted my desires, it nevertheless became <hi rend="italic">my</hi> choice, the instant it seemed to be <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>; in truth I discovered a hundred beauties and proprieties in it which had hitherto escaped my notice; and it came at last to this that every imagination of <pb id="pg-04-38" n="04:38"/>the thoughts of my heart was &#x2018;love in a cottage&#x2019; continually&#x2014; <foreign>He bien</foreign>! and what then?

Without a moments hesitation, without once looking behind, without even bidding <foreign>adieu</foreign> to my flowers, I took my way with you out of one Paradise, to raise another in the howling wilderness&#x2014;a labour which could not have been effected, under all the circumstances, by any thing less than a miracle of love&#x2014; Oh mind of Man! And &#x201C;this too must pass away&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Arabic saying, found in Anglo-Saxon poetry, which gained some currency at the trial of Warren Hastings (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795">95</date>).</note> Houses<supplied>[,]</supplied> walled gardens, conversaziones, and all the rest of it pass away like the baseless fabric of a vision!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>, IV, i.</note>&#x2014; And Lo! we are once more a solitary, homeless pair, &#x201C;the world all before us where to choose our place of rest&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 646&#x2013;47.</note>&#x2014; Be Providence our guide!&#x2014;&#x2014; Suppose we take different roads, and try how that answers.

She and Carlyle corresponded in their old age.

<p>I had learned the loss of Schawbrae before I got your letter; but not the Major&#x2019;s remarkable excuse. If <supplied>[it]</supplied> is not a lie it is certainly sufficiently like one; Yet candour requires we should believe people innocent until they are proved to be guilty, and the evidence, I think in this case does not amount to a <hi rend="italic">proof</hi>&#x2014; For the rest, the loss I fervently trust will turn out a gain; and if it does I shall not be sorry&#x2014;even tho&#x2019; the Major has lied in the matter&#x2014; When shall we know?&#x2014; What is become of Jane&#x2019;s epistle? I prepared my Mother for the honour which awaited her, and she seemed not a little flattered by it&#x2014; This is an ill-looking letter Dear as ever I wrote; but I could make no more of it in my present posture; for like our Orator in the hour and power of music&#x2014; I am laid at length on a sofa, practising what I have long learnt&#x2014;to rest!

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I received your letter on Friday, after asking for it many times in vain. The cause of your unwonted silence afflicts me doubly, as it came unexpected: John told me he had seen you in Edinburgh, and that you were &#x201C;in good health.&#x201D; Alas, my good kind Jane! it is a hard fate for thee to lie imprisoned in a sick frame, with little entertainment for thy vehement spirit but doleful meditations on the supposed folly and perverseness of the man thou hast loved above all others. I grieve that I cannot better it; for in all likelihood this letter will at first vex you still more; yet on more serious reflexion I hope it will not fail to produce some peaceable fruit.</p>
<p>I have already noticed oftener than once that in unguarded moments you let indications escape you of a judgement existing in the bottom of your mind by no means favourable to my present walk and <pb id="pg-04-40" n="04:40"/>conversation. You seem in your secret soul to think that I am but a whimsical unstable person, that I might do well if I liked, that my chief distress at present is idleness and a diseased imagination. To these criticisms of &#x201C;goodnatured friends&#x201D; I am already so much accustomed that I can estimate them in my own mind at something like their just value; but from you, I will confess it, they affect me with a sharp distress. When my heart is opening towards you in trustful husbandlike communion, they shut it with a harsh hostile violence; I thought we were <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, and I find that we are still <hi rend="italic">two</hi>; that far from sympathising with me, by helpful encouragement, in my great enterprise (and every man&#x2019;s enterprise appears great in his own little eyes) you scarcely approve of it, you do not even seem to know with any accuracy what it is. Allow me to speak in all plainness; for there are many mistakes here.</p>
<p>I can by no means engage, in the space of one short letter; to vindicate the whole course of my late history; but so much I may say in clear words: that I do in no wise accuse myself of fluctuation and change of purpose; that on the contrary ever since I became master of my own movements I seem to have walked forward in one path with more and more steadiness; and can even tell myself at some moments that I am distinctly advancing towards my highest and most desireable objects, and in spite of all impediments, and well or ill meant counter advices, shaping my own dismembered life again into a whole; by means of my own; peculiar as the case they were to meet is peculiar. A little more than a twelvemonth ago, when it had become too apparent to be longer denied that unless I could devise for myself a more self-regulated existence I must soon sink to utter destruction both of soul and body, having at last acquired calmness and seclusion for meditating the aspect of my shipwrecked fortunes, I first bethought me of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as of one to whom I was dearer than to almost any other, and with such knowledge as I had of your circumstances and intentions, I called on you for help in my extreme need. Your love of me, I knew, was great, your nobleness of mind I had also reason to know; and the sacrifice I required of you was such as to put both to the utmost proof. I asked of you no less than yourself and all that you had and were, your heart your hand and your worldly resources; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were to have the happiness of snatching the immortal Mr Carlyle from the jaws of perdition which were ready to swallow him forever; to you he was to owe a home, and the peace and kind ministrations of a home; your angel hand was to lift him from the abyss, your true bosom to be <pb id="pg-04-41" n="04:41"/>the resting place of his marred and wearied soul; and all this you were to do for him <hi rend="italic">on trust</hi>, in the hope that as he grew again to life and strength, he would more and more repay your celestial helpfulness, and, become what he might, would be yours utterly and wholly thro&#x2019; time and eternity;&#x2014;or else, such was my view of it, you were to do for yourself the kindness of forthwith ejecting him from the place he had too long unworthily occupied in your hopes and interests. These things you could not do, your fortune was called from you by a higher duty; from you I was not to receive a home. Next month I had procured one for myself. In due time I took possession of it; and here commenced, on my own poor resources, that mode of life which my own best judgement had more and more loudly declared to be essential not for my happiness but for my existence as a man deserving to exist. In this course I have continued to persevere with at least no <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> of fluctuation; I am still persevering in it; and by God&#x2019;s blessing I intend to continue so till my aim is attained; till I am strong and collected enough in body and spirit to mingle, in something like my own form, with the tumultuous flood of living business, and cut my little way in it with unshackled limbs. That circumstances are not unchangeable, that wilful squirelets and unjust stewards respect not even the cottage of a German Philosopher, is no blame of mine:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the difficulties which the Carlyle family had with the landlord of Hoddam Hill, Gen. Matthew Sharpe, which caused them to leave this farm and to rent Scotsbrig.</note> nor does it behove me when such squirelets and stewards have pulled my hut about my ears, to sit down and bewail or vituperate their injustice and wilfulness, but to go forth and seek myself another dwelling. This very thing is now in progress: I must have another house; in the country, if I can, for a while longer; in Edinburgh, if I cannot. In twelve days hence the possibility or impossibility of the first scheme will have been determined; and far from the other being abandoned, I understand my brother to have been out just yesterday, surveying the environs of Edinburgh to meet that contingency. Now in all this, my kind but overhasty love, there appears no inconsistency to me: there is one purpose, and the means of attaining it change as the accidents on which they depend. As to my ulterior views, my hopes of employing myself profitably in this interval, and gradually working my way into a more natural condition of activity and domestic accommodation, by your permission I have told you all the fancies of my head without reserve as they rose there; but these were transitory visions <pb id="pg-04-42" n="04:42"/>rather than fixed prospects. No man, I avow it proudly, had ever more reason to praise a woman for compliance in his schemes than I have towards you; and the thought of this has often been as water to my thirsty spirit: but really, since the first great project which you were forced to reject,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s proposal that they marry and live at Craigenputtoch, rejected by Jane in <date when="1825">1825</date>.</note> I do not find that I have formed any practical plan with even an approach to determination, to which your assistance was necessary or even possible. With regard to my treatment of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> purposes, the reception this last proposal met with ought not to mislead you. I regarded it only as a brief whim, one night old when despatched to me, and probably dead of a natural death before I received it. To this hour I am not sure that I understand it fully. What house were you providing for me in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? Unless indeed you meant me to live, with my wife, in your Mother&#x2019;s house; a generous proposal, which, had I so taken up your meaning, would have merited a more serious deliberation, and at the very least a more courteous refusal. But this it could not be.</p>
<p>O Jane, Jane! your half-jesting enumeration of your wooers does any thing but make me laugh. A thousand and a thousand times have I thought the same thing in deepest earnest. That you have the power of making many good matches is no secret to me; nay it would be a piece of news for me to learn that I am not the very <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> you ever thought of. And you add with the same tearful smile: &#x201C;Alas! we are married already.&#x201D; Let me now cut off the interjection, and say simply what is true that we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> married already; and do you hereb<supplied>[y]</supplied> receive farther my distinct and deliberate declaration that it depends on yourself, and shall <supplied>[al]</supplied>ways depend on yourself whether ever we be married or not. God knows I do not say this in a vulgar spirit of defiance; which in our present relation were coarse and cruel; but I say it in the spirit of disinterested affection for you, and of fear for the reproaches of my own conscience should your fair destiny be marred by me, and you wounded in the house of your friends. Can you believe it with the good nature which I declare it deserves? It would absolutely give me satisfaction to know that you thought yourself entirely free of all ties to me, but those, such as they might be, of your own still-renewed election. It is reasonable and right that you should be concerned for your future establishment: Look round with calm eyes on the persons you mention or may hereafter so mention; and if there is any one among them whose wife you had rather be&#x2014;I <pb id="pg-04-43" n="04:43"/>do not mean whom you love better than me&#x2014;but whose wife, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things considered, you had rather be than mine, then <hi rend="italic">I</hi> call upon you, I your brother and husband and friend thro&#x2019; every fortune, to accept that man and leave me to my destiny. But if on the contrary my heart and my hand with the barren and perplexed destiny which promises to attend them shall after all appear the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> that this poor world can offer you, then take me and be content with me, and do not vex yourself with struggling to alter what is unalterable; to make a man who is poor and sick suddenly become rich and healthy. You tell me that you often weep when you think what is to become of us. It is unwise in you to weep: if you are reconciled to be <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wife (not the wife of an ideal <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, but the simple actual prosaic <hi rend="italic">me</hi>), there is nothing frightful in the future. I look into it with more and more confidence and composure. Alas! Jane you do not know me: it is not the poor, unknown, rejected Thomas Carlyle that you know, but the prospective rich known and admired. I am reconciled to my fate as it stands or promises to stand ere long: I have pronounced the word <hi rend="italic">unpraised</hi> in all its cases and numbers; and find nothing terrific in it, even when it means <hi rend="italic">unmonied</hi>, and by the mass of his Majesty&#x2019;s subjects <hi rend="italic">neglected</hi> or even partially <hi rend="italic">contemned</hi>. I thank Heaven I have other objects in my eye than either <hi rend="italic">their</hi> pudding or their breath. This comes of the circumstance that my Apprenticeship is ending, and yours still going on. O Jane! Jane! I could weep too; for I love you in my deepest heart.</p>
<p>These are hard sayings, my beloved child; but I cannot spare them; and I hope, tho&#x2019; bitter at first, they may not remain without wholesome influence. Do not get angry with me! Do not! I swear I deserve it not! Consider this as a true glimpse into my heart, which it is good that you contemplate with the gentleness and tolerance you have often shown me. I do not love you? If you judge it fit, I will clasp you to my bosom and my heart, as my wedded wife, this very week: if you judge it fit, I will this very week forswear you forever. More I cannot do; but all this, when I compare myself with you, it is my duty to do.&#x2014;&#x2014; Now think if I long for your answer! Yet not in my time, but in yours. I have lived as a <hi rend="italic">widower</hi> from you these two days, I must live so till I hear from you again. <hi rend="italic">Till</hi> I hear from you? Good God! Perhaps, first rightly, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I hear from you!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my heart&#x2019;s Darling! God bless you and have you always in his keeping! I am yours, at your own disposal, forever and ever,</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Hoddam Hill</place>, Monday-Night. [<date when="1826-02-27">27? February 1826</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am sorry at having nothing more comprehensive than this very poor package to send you. MacCorkindale&#x2019;s late perplexities had put us all off our guard; and after calling <hi rend="italic">every</hi> day except Tuesday last week, the parcel came upon us this afternoon half by surprise. So that there is none forthcoming to write, except myself (a wearied enough mortal at present), and my Mother who is busy writing you a note with a true heart, but with the pen of no ready writer. Our Father, who is here tonight, has engaged to take the parcel with him tomorrow morning early to the coach-office; so that you must be content for this time; one of these days, I will over to Mainhill, and rate the people for their negligence, and try by next opportunity to get more particular intelligence.</p>
<p>On the whole, as usual, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no news. We are all well, our Mother I think better than she has been for several winters; and beyond this, there is nothing but <hi rend="italic">empty clatter</hi> to be related of the aspect of things in general. Today was Rent-day at the Castle of Hoddam; our Father has been there, &#x201C;fronting his Landlord&#x201D; with his <hi rend="italic">two</hi> purses, and returned home for this time to <hi rend="italic">dine</hi> by his own fireside; for the Squire has utterly withdrawn the light of his countenance from this his once-favoured Agriculturist! Well-a-day! Well-a-day!</p>
<p>Of Scotsbrig farm there is nothing certain known yet; save a letter from the Manager of the concern to Carlyle of Waterbeck, expressing very favourable regard to his recommendation, and hopes that his Friend may get the place, if so be they can remove the present Tenant in time. He, the hapless Legatee Geordie Irving, once of Water-O&#x2019;-Milk Bridge, it appears since, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> hypoth<hi rend="italic">acatted</hi>, and actually to be put <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub hasteam</hi></foreign> [at auction] this week, most probably on Thursday; soon after which it will be finally settled <hi rend="italic">when</hi> he leaves the premises (for leave them he must, being &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">duin</hi></foreign>&#x201D;), and also whether our clan is to replace him. By next parcel, I hope to send you stricter intelligence.</p>
<p>As to the house in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, till this farm business is settled, it will be impossible to take any decisive step. I should like better to stay in the country till after harvest; especially as Brewster&#x2019;s silence indicates that there is nothing particular to be effected in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (except it be the <pb id="pg-04-45" n="04:45"/><hi rend="italic">loss</hi> of health) till that season. Yet if Scotsbrig be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got, I see not well what else I am to do than come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, if I can get a good house, and things convenient. It might be worth while for you and Murray to go out some vacant day, even as matters stand, and explore the ground. You might then be able to tell me what is to be looked for, next time you wrote. There is one cottage, seemingly very like the thing, advertised in last week&#x2019;s Newspaper; but I forget its name, and have not time to look for the paper. &#x201C;Between two stools the <hi rend="italic">seat</hi> of a man falls to the ground&#x201D;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;While betwene two stoles my taile goe to ground,&#x201D; John Heywood, <hi rend="italic">Proverbes</hi> (<date when="1546">1546</date>), I, iii.</note> between two houses, I wish <hi rend="italic">this</hi> man may not find himself exposed to the inclement air, with nothing for his solace but two eaves-drops!</p>
<p>This package of manuscript completes the first volume, and begins the second; the latter with Tieck&#x2019;s Life, after which you will supply them with the manuscript I left with you. In the <hi rend="italic">Trusty Eckart</hi>, at the very beginning of it, is a sheet of rhymes which will puzzle Ma Kork,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nickname for M&#x2019;Corkindale, the foreman at Ballantyne&#x2019;s, printers of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> I doubt. Would you try if you can read them; and bid the <foreign><hi rend="italic">velocilingue</hi></foreign> [fast talker] apply to you with a <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> of that leaf, should he be at a stand. I think the <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi> are arranged in the order they are to be printed in.&#x2014; I am now busy in the <hi rend="italic">Trampship</hi>:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>.</note> but must very soon, I suppose, take to writing Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>.</p>
<p>You are kind to inquire about my health: it is growing better, I think, from month to month <supplied>[; and]</supplied> at least in the country, this progressive im<supplied>[prove]</supplied>ment seems by no means impeded by a moderate portion of intellectual work. Larry is not sold: his behaviour of late has been so exemplary that we could not think of parting with him. It is true he stands on end every time he meets a four-wheeled carriage: but M. Rollin says, Socrates himself had faults. The beast <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> throw me with this bridle, and he runs like Mohomet&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Alborak</hi>, the ass that rode from Bagdad to Heaven in a night.&#x2014; I pared my thumb into the quick the other <supplied>[day]</supplied> and it is galling me like a hot ember fastened to <supplied>[a part]</supplied> of this hard pen. I must rest, and take the [one word covered by seal] leaf or rather scrap: they are all to-bed.</p>
<p>[In margins:] I was terribly frightened that the last parcel had been lost: it was sent by Carlisle.</p>
<p>Wrap the Newspaper tightly, or Postie will read it. Give my kind <pb id="pg-04-46" n="04:46"/>respects to Cron; and endeavour to get &#x201C;command of your sentences&#x201D;again as fast as possible. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sat, jam sat est</hi></foreign> [Enough, it is now enough]!</p>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>You were right in supposing that your letter would give me pain; but as for the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">peaceable fruit</hi>,&#x201D; if any, it is yet to come. It was an unfortunate affair for both of us, that the only fit of jesting I have had, during the last three weeks should have overtaken me just when I was in your grave presence; for if my <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;tearful smiles&#x201D;</hi> have given so deep an wound to the heart of my Friend, the tearful frown which they have called forth has as deeply wounded mine. But, as poor Napoleon used to say, &#x201C;complaint is beneath my dignity,<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> and besides, being the first aggressor I have no right to make any&#x2014;</p>
<p>Let me rather, then, in as far as concerns myself, if possible, put your mind at rest, and, if possible relieve it of misapprehension&#x2014; In the first place, I have not,&#x2014;can never have the semblance of a wish to part my fortunes from yours;&#x2014;at least, till I know for certain the separation would promote your happiness. It was not without many hesitations that I took you for my acknowledged Partner,&#x2014;not without consulting my reason as well as my affection,&#x2014; not without viewing both the dark and the bright side of the cloud: but when I <hi rend="italic">did</hi>; it was was [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for better for worse, for poorer for richer, in sickness and in health, for ever <hi rend="italic">here</hi> and (please God) for ever and ever in the world to come. You might never, perhaps, take me home as your Bride; you might even cease to love me, or you might follow my Father to the grave: all these things I knew were too possible; but none of them was to alter the case; you were still to be the Partner,&#x2014;the chosen, only Partner of my heart and soul; if not in wedded, in unwedded love, or, at worst, in remembrance which would still be love&#x2014; This, once for all, was my determination, when I accepted your heart and hand; and do me the justice to believe, it knows no shadow of change.</p>
<p>But surely, surely M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, you must know me better, than to have supposed it possible I should ever make a new choice! To say <pb id="pg-04-47" n="04:47"/>nothing of the sentiments I entertain towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, which would make a marriage with another worse than death; is there no spark of honour, think you, in this heart, that I should not blush at the bare idea of such shame? Give myself to another, after having given myself with such unreservedness to you! Take another to my arms, with your image on my heart, your kisses on my lips! Oh be honest, and say you knew this would never be,&#x2014;knew I could never sink so low! Let me not have room to suppose, that possessing your love, I am unfortunate enough to be without your respect! For how light must my open fondness have seemed; if you doubted of its being sanctified by a marriage-vow&#x2014;a vow spoken, indeed, before no Minister, but before a presence, surely as awful, God and my Conscience&#x2014; And yet, it is so unlike <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, the sworn enemy of cant, to make high-sounding offers, in the firm confidence of their being rejected! and unless I lay this to your charge in the present instance how can I help concluding that there is some virtue in me, which you have yet to learn?&#x2014; For it is in no jesting, or yet &#x201C;half-jesting&#x201D; manner that you tell me my hand is free&#x2014; &#x201C;If there be any other&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you do not mean whom I love more</hi>&#x2014;but whose wife all things considered I would rather be; you call upon me as my Husband&#x2014;(as my Husband!) to accept that man.&#x201D; Were these words really Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s, and addressed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>? Ah! <foreign>ich kenne dich nicht mehr!</foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, l. 2720, meaning &#x201C;I know you no more!&#x201D;</note> Dearest! Dearest! it will take many caresses to atone for these words!</p>
<p>I am not surprised that you feel hurt by my raillery on the subject of your plans; since you view it as an indication of an unfair theory of your character. But, in truth, it is nothing of the sort&#x2014;I think you neither whimsical nor unstable,&#x2014;think you nothing but what is noble and wise; I know full well you have more serious distresses than idleness and a diseased imagination; and, at the bottom of my heart, far from censuring, I approve of your whole procedure: but I cannot help, sometimes, getting provoked at the Fortune which keeps us asunder; and when this happens, I am too apt to vent the spleen of the moment upon you; tho&#x2019; the next moment I am ready to fall at your feet and wash them with my tears. Such a behaviour, I grant you is very wrong,&#x2014;unworthy a woman of sense and feeling: yet, surely, it is not the sin against the Holy Gohst that it should be punished with such a heartbreaking lecture&#x2014;</p>
<p>You say you are &#x201C;the very worst <hi rend="italic">match</hi> I ever thought of<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied>; that &#x201C;it <pb id="pg-04-48" n="04:48"/>is reasonable and right I should be concerned for my future <hi rend="italic">establishment</hi>&#x201D; and that I do not know you as &#x201C;the poor, unknown, rejected Thomas Carlyle; but as &#x201C;the prospe<supplied>[c]</supplied>tive rich, known, and admired&#x201D;&#x2014; Alas! my brother, you were wont to call me &#x2018;generous,&#x2019; &#x2018;devoted,&#x2019; &#x2018;nobleminded&#x2019;: how comes it you address me now as a vulgar creature whose first object is <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;a good settlement&#x201D;</hi>? Such sayings from another would have found with me no gentle hearing; and probably called forth an indignant exposition of my mind: but when the man I have loved with a love so pure from all worldliness,&#x2014;for whom I am ready to sacrifice every thing on earth but my sense of right,&#x2014;when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> talks to me of matches, and establishments, and riches and honours, it is the thrust of a Brother which it would be ignominy to resist&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is another expression in your letter which I cannot pass without noticing. &#x201C;If (you say) your hand and heart appear after all the best in my offer (<hi rend="italic">if</hi> they appear the best!) to take you, and be content with you (<foreign>quel homme brusque</foreign> [what an abrupt man]!) and not vex myself with struggling to alter what is unattainable.&#x201D; Now, with all due gratitude for this <hi rend="italic">absolute leave</hi>, I must be bold to observe that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> taken you, for already some time; and was never otherwise than content with you since you came into my possession. If I weep when I think what is to become of us, it is not because you are poor and unknown and may possibly continue so all the days of your life;&#x2014; there needs no Apprenticeship to train me to disinterestedness of heart&#x2014;it is, because in the <hi rend="italic">actual</hi> state of things (and we know not when they may alter) the duties,&#x2014;the unavoidable duties of a Daughter and a Friend keep me from your dear side,&#x2014;keep me from sharing your destiny whatever it be. It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> unwise, I own, to weep on any account; and doubly so to vex another with one weeping; but, methinks, you should have some allowance for my tears since a woman in love is the very weakest of live creatures&#x2014;</p>
<p>One thing more; and I am done<supplied>[.]</supplied> Look cross at me, reproach me, even whip me if you have the heart; your next kiss will make amends for all: But, if you love me, cease I beseech you to make me offers of freedom; for this is an outrage which I find it not easy to forgive. If made with any idea that it is in the nature of things I should take you at your word; they do a wrong to my love, my truth, my modesty, that is, to my whole character as a Woman; if not, they are a mocking better spared; since you know my answer must be still: &#x201C;permit me O Shinvarig, to wear out my days in prison, for its walls are to me <pb id="pg-04-49" n="04:49"/>more pleasing than the most splendid palace!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note>&#x2014; But <foreign>ohe jam satis</foreign>!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Martial&#x2019;s epigrams ends with a poem containing these words: &#x201C;<foreign>Ohe, jam satis est!

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have now got over my five sheets; and before packing them up, I must send you a small &#x201C;scrape of a pen&#x201D; to signify at least that I am alive and well disposed to you; however little either of these speculative facts may be available in practice at present. Macorkindale is the King of Typographers: he goes on like the diurnal Sun; and it were cruel in the extreme to extinguish his light by <hi rend="italic">my</hi> idleness. I must hurry therefore, and you as usual must be patient.</p>
<p>I have read these leaves of your thesis;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which John was writing for his degree in medicine: <hi rend="italic">De Mentis Alienatione</hi> [<hi rend="italic">On Diseases of the Mind</hi>].</note> and really I find them very far beyond my expectation, which had satisfied itself with ranking your Latin (I now discover) far too <hi rend="italic">little</hi> above the usual Grinder Latin. Some of these sentences are quite <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. The sense too so far as it extends in these few lines is clear and flowing; and I have no doubt, if the rest in any way correspond to it, your Essay will be very far above the average. Get Mitchell to look over the paper for you, if you find him so disposed: his judgement may throw light on many points. If not, the Immortal will suffice. My perusal of these sentences has been very cursory; and my re<supplied>[marks]</supplied> need give you little disturbance: I am rusted in my Latin, which was never of the clearest; notwithstanding, I think between us two we could write a very moderate <hi rend="italic">Thesis</hi>, <pb id="pg-04-50" n="04:50"/>without farther help from any one. Send me the whole whenever it is ready; and I will give it a more deliberate perusal.</p>
<p>When you take this book over to Tait, tell him that I am rising into higher favour with <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Book (or rather it with me) as I advance farther: my only terror is for the want of those German works; I shall be out of work in 4 weeks if they do not come; and M&#x2019;Cork in three weeks more. Ask Tait if there is no inkling of them. I believe I shall write this very week to Julius of Hamburg: of this also you can forewarn Tait, calming his raven [ravenous] spirit at the same time with information that for <hi rend="italic">Julius</hi>&#x2019; books <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall pay, requiring only of Tait that he be my <hi rend="italic">agent</hi> in transmitting the cash to the Hamburg Bookseller.</p>
<p>Farm-taking proceeds here with its wonted vigour. Geordie Irving has by dint of Hypothecation now fairly renounced his task: and the farm of Scotsbrig is to be relet <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>. Carlyle of Waterbeck<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle has previously said that this was Robert Carlyle. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260202-ACTC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1826-02-02">2 Feb.</date></ref></note> has recommended our husbandmen in the handsomest manner; nay has even volu<supplied>[n]</supplied>teered to become their caution for the first three years. The <hi rend="italic">Slipfit</hi> (acquainted with the Factor) has also written; Alick was at Dumfries last week; and to crown the whole, our Father &#x26; he are off this morning, wet tho&#x2019; it was, in the highest hope, to make a bold stroke for this patch of his Majesty&#x2019;s dominions. Had you seen the two when they pricked off, and turned their faces to the wide world! Alick on Larrey, with the old dreadnought, and caprioling as if in Astley&#x2019;s Circus;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Astley (<date when="1742">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814">1814</date>), English equestrian, who had belonged to a British regiment of light horse, became proprietor of a circus and hippodrome in London in <date when="1770">1770</date>, and opened Astley&#x2019;s Royal amphitheater in London in <date when="1798">1798</date>.</note> the goodman on the outside of a dirty <foreign><hi rend="italic">tawlie</hi></foreign> [tame] shelty which he had borrowed from Murray of Cowthwaite; a thing no bigger than a Bamborough ewe; and so thin that the Head of the Family declared he felt as if he were riding on a <hi rend="italic">fir deal</hi>!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fir plank on which a corpse was sometimes carried in Scotland.</note> There they went; and at this very hour, I doubt not, they are wriggling with factors and trying if they can possibly <hi rend="italic">bid and low</hi> to proper purpose, which they had good hopes of doing. On thursday-morning we shall know: I will send you word most probably straightway if they do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> prosper; for in that case, nothing will remain for me that I see but a cottage in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. I have been at Scotsbrig myself; and am by no means so highly taken with it, tho&#x2019; for a summer residence it might do, and farther than <pb id="pg-04-51" n="04:51"/>that I do not at present contemplate using it. Next time I write, you are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to know how all things stand.</p>
<p>Our Mother sends you her best love: and declares that the very next time Farries goes northward, you shall have butter and eggs and puddings not a few. Swineheads also shall not be wanting. On this you may count with some certainty. I told the Mainhill bodies of your wishes for news; and they promised, but have not performed. The way of the world! They are in truth &#x201C;top needlewomen,&#x201D; but <hi rend="italic">bottom</hi> penwomen: so you must forgive them.</p>

<p><salute>My Beloved Wife!&#x2014;</salute>You are an Angel of Light, and I am a mean man of Earthly clay, who ought not to mete you by a standard fit only for vulgar natures. I have scanned this letter with critical eyes, to see if I could discover in it any trace of vindictive yet natural selfishness, any shadow of retaliation for my harshness, any glance of splenetic pride, any look of anger or recrimination: and I have found none! Nothing but longsuffering meekness, and gentleness, and loving weeping expostulation! My Noble Jane! Thy heart has taught thee a philosophy better than all the Schools will ever teach me. I am not <pb id="pg-04-52" n="04:52"/>worthy of such a heart; or my little paltry pride would not so easily catch fire, and turn a harmless jest into matter of such stern speculation. Have you not cause to weep over the arrangements of our Fortune? And in whose bosom can you shed those tears but in mine? Have you not cause, unknowing as you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be of much that is peculiar in my lot, to feel displeasure at many things I do and neglect to do? And am not I your last and only friend: to whom can you utter that displeasure but to me?</p>
<p>But let us forget the whole misunderstanding. Positively you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> forget it. You cannot keep anger in your heart against me; can you? Against <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, poor me, who love and honour you, as I have good cause; and whose fault is not want of tenderness to you, but of confidence in myself! These perplexities come of our living eighty miles asunder, and not by each other&#x2019;s side. Forget them, my own true hearted wife! Forget them; dry up your tears, and smile in my face, and all will be as it was! Are you pacified? Are you good to me? You love me forever, Jane; and neither Heighth nor Depth, nor things present nor things to come shall ever separate you from my heart.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rom. 8:38&#x2013;39.</note> So be content, my Darling, and get well again, and write me a sunnier letter; for I have still much, much of a far finer sort than the last to tell you. And let us no more remember this unseasonable cloud; and let not the mountain ask if it came from the valley, or the valley if it came from the mountain: but let bright summer weather come back, and both rejoice in its presence. Ah! If I were beside you I would soon make up the peace. I would steal my arms about you, and lead you to my heart, and ask you if you thought it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> yours. Could you resist me? Would you turn away your face and your kisses from my prayer? No, Jane! you would not, and could not: for we are one in heart and soul; and if we had twenty thousand such misunderstandings, they must all come to one result at last. It is forgotten, then: is it not?</p>
<p>I got your letter along with <hi rend="italic">five</hi> proof-sheets: but no hurry of business would excuse me for keeping you in such a state one day longer than the shortest possible time. I write this in stolen moments as a peace-offering: I will write to you again, about a hundred other things the moment you tell me all is well; perhaps on Sunday, whether you tell me or not.</p>
<p>For you must know, Darling, I have some important subjects meditating at this time. You bade me tell you all the imaginations of the thoughts of my heart: and I have had a wild scheme for these four <pb id="pg-04-53" n="04:53"/>or five weeks in my head; a scheme in which your &#x201C;assistance&#x201D; is not only &#x201C;possible&#x201D; but essential. Can you guess it? Dare you make yourself a beggar within six months? Dare you wed a wild man of the woods, and come and live with him in his cavern, in hope of better days? I declare, it is shameful to make you such an offer: and yet what can be done? Wedded we must and shall be sometime: why not <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> as well as <foreign><hi rend="italic">syne</hi></foreign> [late]? If Fortune will not make us rich, the base shrew, why not make ourselves rich, richer in each other&#x2019;s arms than the Kings and Kaisers of the Earth! &#x201C;It is madness,&#x201D; you say? No, Dearest, it is not; but a <hi rend="italic">judicious desperation</hi>, a bold venture to escape from Purgatory fire into the verdant Groves of Heaven! Who knows but we shall prosper? I feel as if with you in my bosom, I should be a new man; as if the bitterness of life would pass away like a forgotten tempest, and I and my own loved one should walk in bright weather. Is not thy heart mine, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebchen</hi></foreign>? Thy whole soul and being, mine? Why then are our lots parted, tho&#x2019; mine is of the poorest? In sober truth, my Love, I do wish you would consider this matter: for I myself have been studying it in every mood for many days; and the longer I think of it, the more feasible the more rational it seems. If I get a house in the country, why should it not be yours also? My Mother has told me two hundred times that she expected to have you with her again in summer: would she like you worse or better as her own daughter; would you be happier as her guest or as your Chosen&#x2019;s wife? O Jane! My soft truehearted Jane! Are we not wealth and health and all blessedness to one another?</p>
<p>Perhaps I am a fool to whisper this to you as it stands at present: for as yet I have not even a cottage to offer you share of. In two days that latter question, however, will be determined: and go as it may, I declare to thee, my Child, that I see nothing for it but our union &#x201C;for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness in health,&#x201D; now and forever, and this at no distant date. Think of it; consider, study, help me to meditate! It is the highest concern of both.</p>
<p>But I must cease and determine; for my work is leaving me out of sight, and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a start, it is all that I can do to keep up with it. Read this letter with the image of my hurry in your eye; and if you find any delirium in it, think that perhaps in a sober moment the aid of reflexion would have suppressed it. Above all, consider of this cottage scheme, and tell me if it is possible.</p>
<p>Another word I must not write you tonight. Will you answer this letter directly? Perhaps I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write to you on Sunday: what more <pb id="pg-04-54" n="04:54"/>can I say, till this business be sifted, and the wheat of it (if any) picked from the chaff by your hand?</p>
<p>Jane has not forgot you or your Mother: but is busy making ready for returning thanks. At least so I suppose. The creature has caught two or three of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> looks, and sometimes recalls you to my mind as if you stood in this very room, which never had or will have such another inmate. Good night, my Beloved! Write to me that you are well, that you still love me, that you will be mine!</p>

<salute>Dearest John</salute>
<p>I have often considered in my own mind, whether a pleasure is welcomest after long expectation, or when it takes us by surprise. The experience of yester-night was a powerful argument on the <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi> side of the question.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter from John to which Jane refers appears to have been lost.</note>&#x2014; Indeed, my kind Doctor, I was in no hope you would take any further notice of me; till, like an honest woman, I had balanced our account: for you were not to be supposed in the secret of my silence; and so, moved to the tender mercy of remitting me my debt. But you are more beneficent, I am glad to find, than it had entered into my heart to conceive&#x2014; And, now, you are to have the pleasure of knowing that what you did of free grace, was really just what I deserved at your hands. Ever since my journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till within the last few days, I have been a free agent only in <hi rend="italic">will</hi>&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">deed</hi>, altogether at the mercy of the angel of sickness&#x2014;angel of the bottomless pit! an inflam<supplied>[m]</supplied>atory complaint brought on by excessive fatigue confined me for the first fortnight to bed; and, even now, I am but got the length to be up and about my business six hours out of the twelve. However, I have neither pain nor sickness&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">His</hi> name be praised&#x201D;&#x2014; no ailment in the world but weakness; and this would soon follow the rest, if the cold weather did not confine me within doors.</p>
<p>Of course it was impossible for us to make out our visit, at the appointed time; and it is now put off, I believe, till the <date when="1826-04">end of April</date>&#x2014;so much the better!&#x2014; There is nothing to take me to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; unless it be <pb id="pg-04-55" n="04:55"/>to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi>: the rest is all vanity and vexation of spirit, mud, smoke and bustle&#x2014;</p>
<p>You could not, I think, have chosen a better subject for your Thesis&#x2014; Madness is not only the most prevalent malady of the present time; but, of all maladies seems to be the least understood. In nineteen cases out of twenty it does not even get its right name, and the poor wretches are left at large a pest of society. Just in my own acquaintance, to go no further, I could find you upwards of a hundred Lunaticks, whom their Physicians suffer to go about like roaring lions seeking whom they may devour; when it were better for their own safety and the community&#x2019;s that they should be com<supplied>[m]</supplied>itted to some Asylum, in straight waistcoats. But your essay, I doubt not, will dispel this ignorance of the medical world, as the sun dispells the shadows of night; and we shall forthwith see madhouses large enough to contain two thirds of the inhabitants erected in every city and village thro&#x2019;out the kingdom&#x2014;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The thesis <hi rend="italic">De Mentis Alienatione</hi> was printed and dedicated to &#x201C;<foreign>Fratri suo carissimo</foreign> / <foreign>amicoque optimo</foreign>, Thomas Carlyle, / <foreign>Armigero</foreign>; / <foreign>Hoc Parvulum</foreign> / <foreign>sed</foreign> / <foreign>Grati Animi</foreign> / <foreign>Verum Testimonium</foreign>, / <foreign>Acceptum / vult</foreign> / <foreign>Auctor</foreign>.&#x201D; There are two copies in the Edinburgh University Library.</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your welcome and long-expected letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> reached me safely in the end of <date when="1825-11">last November</date>. I could not but feel much obliged by your kind<pb id="pg-04-56" n="04:56"/>recollection of me; and I had besides to thank you for a greater quantity of distinct information on the subject of my inquiries than I had supposed it easy to comprise in so small a space. By dint of reading and investigation, in which I have been materially assisted by <hi rend="italic">Franz Horn</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Franz Horn (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>), <hi rend="italic">Die Poesie und Beredsamkeit der Deutschen, von Luthers Zeit bis zur Gegenwart</hi>, 4 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1822">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">29</date>).</note> whom you recommended, I can now flatter myself with having obtained some tolerable view of this department of your Literature; and am proceeding in the fulfillment of my small enterprise with much steadier steps than formerly. Your goodness encourages me again to trespass on your time, for a piece of assistance, which I fear you will find it more difficult, tho&#x2019; I trust not impossible, to give me.</p>
<p>This Book of &#x201C;German Novellists&#x201D; is already in the Press; and above a third part of it printed. I design it to include the following names: Mus&#xE4;us, Fouqu&#xE9;, Tieck, Hoffmann, Maler M&#xfc;ller, Jean Paul, and the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> volume to be occupied exclusively with Goethe and his <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>. Of these the first three names are nearly finished; and in a few days, for want of materials, we shall be forced to commence with Goethe, and print the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> volume while the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> is still uncompleted. My Bookseller Tait wrote off, some three months ago, to Fleischer of Leipzig for the necessary books; but no tidings of them have yet reached us; and as they have to travel round by Buxhaven and London, I begin to be very much afraid that our whole progress will be stopped by this misarrangement. It has struck me that perhaps it might be in your power to remove this difficulty for I learn from the Newspapers that the Elbe is now open; and there is a constant intercourse between your city and Leith. If it were not that I have already experienced your kindness, and have at present no other resource, I should scarcely have the face to make this proposal.</p>
<p>The books sent for from Leipzig form a long list; but if I had one or two of them in my possession I could contrive to get on. The first and most indispensable is <hi rend="italic">Maler M&#xfc;llers</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich M&#xfc;ller (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi>, a performance which I owe my Knowledge of to you; which I now look forward to with high expectations; and of which I do not think there is a single copy in Britain. The next are Jean Paul&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben Quintius Fixlein</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reise des Feldprediger Schmelzle nach Fl&#xE4;tz</hi>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Paul Friedrich Richter (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825">1825</date>). The first work mentioned here was published in <date when="1796">1796</date>; the second under the title <hi rend="italic">Des Feldpredigers Schmelzle Reise nach Fl&#xE4;tz</hi> in <date when="1809">1809</date>.</note> neither of which works is to <pb id="pg-04-57" n="04:57"/>be found either in London or Edinburgh; yet without one or both of them I see not how I am to manage. I have learned with real sorrow that this illustrious man is dead some months ago; Maler Muller, you tell me, has also left us: &#x201C;one by one the stars go out!&#x201D; Of Hoffmann I have sent for the <hi rend="italic">Serapionsbr&#xfc;der</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Leben und Nachlass</hi>: but if I had any sketch of his <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, there is one of the <hi rend="italic">Fantasiest&#xfc;cke in Callots Manier</hi> now lying beside me, which might serve my purpose in other respects.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">1822</date>). His collection of stories, <hi rend="italic">Die Serapionsbr&#xfc;der</hi>, was published in four volumes in <date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1821">21</date>; his <hi rend="italic">Phantasiest&#xfc;cke in Callots Manier</hi>, in four volumes in <date when="1814">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1815">15</date>. <hi rend="italic">Aus Hoffmanns Leben und Nachlass</hi>, by Julius Edward Hitzig (<date when="1780">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">1849</date>), was published in <date when="1823">1823</date>. Jacques Callot (<date when="1592">1592</date>&#x2013;<date when="1635">1635</date>) was a French painter and engraver.</note></p>
<p>Now am I not asking too much of you, when I request as an especial favour that you would have the goodness to call on any of your Hamburg Booksellers, Perthes, or Nestler, or any other proper person; and direct him to send over these works by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Leith Smack; addressed to &#x201C;Messrs Tait, Booksellers, Princes-street, Edinburgh,&#x201D; who will pay the price punctually to any specified individual either in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or London. Of this, you may assure the Bookseller, there is not the smallest risk: nor indeed do I suppose any hesitation will occur on this point; I have a catalogue of Nestler&#x2019;s beside me, belonging to a Mr Buchanan in Leith, with whom he is frequently in the habit of dealing, and who is an intimate acquaintance of these very Taits. The great point to be attended to is <hi rend="italic">speed</hi>: for, by almost the quickest conveyance, the packet is like to be fully late enough. I shall enumerate the books I want, in more distinct order:</p>
<p>1. Maler M&#xfc;llers <hi rend="italic">S&#xE4;mmtliche Werke</hi>, in (I believe) 3 volumes, <date when="1811">1811</date>.</p>
<p>2. J. P. F. Richters <hi rend="italic">Leben Q. Fixlein</hi>&#x2014;1 or 2 volumes <date when="1801">1801</date></p>
<p>3. &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Schmelzles Reise nach Fl&#xE4;tz</hi>&#x2014;1 volume <date when="1809">1809</date></p>
<p>4. Besides this, I must request of you to exercise your discrimination in procuring for me some Biographical account of these two authors, if any such have yet appeared. It seems natural that in many of your Reviews and Magazines and <hi rend="italic">Almanacks</hi> some sketches of these distinguished persons must have been published; from which sufficient information might be derived. I hope also that it may not be difficult for you to send me the pamphlet which you reckon the best of these: my present information is of the most defective sort; derived <pb id="pg-04-58" n="04:58"/>almost wholly from the <hi rend="italic">Conversationslexicon</hi>!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Konversations-Lexikon, oder Real-Enzyklop&#xE4;die f&#xfc;r die gebildeten St&#xE4;nde</hi>, 5th ed., 10 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1819">1819</date>).</note> I know not even the date of their deaths; and the column of a Newspaper itself would be useful to me.</p>
<p>5. If there is any similar short sketch of Hoffmann&#x2019;s Life; any review, for instance, of his <hi rend="italic">Leben und Nachlass</hi> that could be easily procured, it would be very acceptable. The date and place of his decease you could perhaps, failing all this, send me in writing.</p>
<p>These biographical commissions will, I fear, occasion you the most trouble; but to me they are also of the greatest importance. If my project succeed, and these books be consigned, without loss of time, to the &#x201C;Hamburg and Leith Shipping Company,&#x201D; or any other earlier conveyance, I should hope that they might be here in four or five weeks; and you would have the gratification of relieving me from a very awkward perplexity.</p>
<p>And now, My Dear Sir, allow me in conclusion, not to apologize for the burden I am laying on you, but to express my hope that some time or other it may be i<supplied>[n my]</supplied> power to undertake some equivalent service for you. I am by no means wi<supplied>[thout]</supplied> purpose or expectation of ever seeing you again: for it shall go hard with me, if I <supplied>[do]</supplied> not tread the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutschen Boden</hi></foreign> [German soil] yet, before all my travels be concluded; and then I trust it will be in my power to renew an acquaintance which promised to be so agreeable, and was so soon interrupted.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With sincere esteem, I am always, / My Dear Sir, / Truly Your&#x2019;s, /</salute></closer></p>
<name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>P.S. I have been in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> since your letter came: I did not fail to satisfy Dr Irving&#x2019;s inquiries after you by delivering him your compliments.</p>
<p>Can you inform me if there is a Merchant in Hamburg, named Thornton, an Englishman by birth; one of whose sons, Richard, attended the Edinburgh University? The question is of no importance: only I knew the young man while there, and could like to know that he is alive and happy.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Thornton&#x2019;s name appears in the class lists in <date when="1811">1811</date> as &#x201C;1 Lit,&#x201D; when Carlyle would be &#x201C;3 Lit.&#x201D; His address then was given as Hamburg.</note></p></ps>

<p><salute>Oh my Beloved!</salute> what a tantalizing letter is this, which was meant to drive away all trouble from my mind! what a Paradise it sets before my eyes, from which I am shut out as with a flaming sword! Would I dare to make myself a beggar within six months&#x2014;to wed my wild man of the woods and and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] go and live in his cavern? Yes! Dearest, that I would without fear or misgiving, and deem myself the richest, best lodged Lady in the Land. Indeed I can figure to myself no happier lot on this side Heaven than that which is so touchingly imaged in your own &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Wish</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to Carlyle&#x2019;s poem with this title, dated <date when="1822">1822</date> by Alexander Carlyle, written perhaps to match a poem by Jane Welsh which begins: &#x201C;Oh for a valley far away! / Where human foot hath never been, / Where sunbeams ever brightly play, / And all is young and fresh and green.&#x201D; Both poems are in <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 343&#x2013;44, 346&#x2013;48.</note> and <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, it seems to me, might be realized to the letter in a cottage in Annandale as well as in any other &#x201C;calm home&#x201D; on the surface of the Earth&#x2014;and as well moreover in our present circumstances as in more affluent ones; for it is not with a great equipage we should best &#x201C;go hand in hand the heart&#x2019;s joy with the minds light interweaving to wisdoms haunts, to Fancy&#x2019;s fairy land<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied>&#x2014;while &#x201C;the undying minds of every age around us&#x201D; are a society that may be frequented at little cost, in the pla<supplied>[i]</supplied>nest apparel, and without return of entertainment; and &#x201C;the world&#x2019;s&#x2014;our being&#x2019;s mystery,&#x201D; tho the most sublime, and interesting of all possible spectacles is free to every one who hath eyes to see whether he be rich or poor.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Most of the quotations are from Carlyle&#x2019;s poem.</note>&#x2014; Were happiness, then, the thing chiefly to be cared for, in this world; I would even put my hand in yours <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, as you say, and so cut the gordian knot of our destiny at once. But, oh my Husband, have you not told me a thousand times and my conscience tells me also that happiness is only a secondary consideration&#x2014;it must not must not [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] be sought out of the path of duty. And does the happiness that now invites me lie in that path? Should I do well to go into Paradise myself, and leave the Mother who bore me to break her heart? She is looking forward to my marriage with a more tranquil mind, in the hope that our separation is to be in a great measure nominal,&#x2014; that by living wheresoever my Husband lives she may at least have every moment of <pb id="pg-04-60" n="04:60"/>my society which he can spare. And how would it be possible not to disappoint her in this hope, if I went to reside with your people in Annandale? <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> presence <hi rend="italic">there</hi> would be a perpetual cloud over our little world of love and peace. For the sake of all concerned it would be necessary to keep her quite apart from us&#x2014;and apart from us&#x2014;yet so near she would be the most wretched of Mothers, the most desolate woman in the world. Oh is it for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to make her so&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">me</hi> who am so unspeakably dear to her in spite of all her caprice, who am her only, only child&#x2014; and her a widow&#x2014; I love you M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, tenderly, devotedly as ever Woman loved; but I may not put my Mother away from me even for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sake&#x2014; I cannot do it! I have lain awake whole nights since I received your letter, trying to reconcile this act with my conscience; but my conscience will have nothing to say to it&#x2014;rejects it with indignation&#x2014;</p>
<p>What is to be done then? Indeed, I see only one way of escape out of all these perplexities. Be patient with me while I tell you what it is.&#x2014; My Mother, like myself, has ceased to find any contentment in this pitiful Haddington, and is bent on disposing of our house here as soon as may be and hiring one elsewhere. The <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I perceive rests with me to determine. now, why should it not be the vicinity of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after all? and why should not you live with your wife in her Mothers house? Because (you say) my Mother would never have the grace to like you or let you live with her in peace; because you could never have any right enjoyment of my society so long as you had me not all to yourself; and finally, because you, positively, must and will have a door of your own to slam on the face of nauseous intruders. These are objections, it must be allowed, which <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> almost fatal to my scheme; but&#x2014;I am greatly mistaken if they are not more sound than substance&#x2014; My Mother <hi rend="italic">would</hi> like you&#x2014;Oh assuredly she would, if you came to live with her as her son. For what is it Dearest that has so prejudiced her against you? Is it not terror lest thro&#x2019; your means she should be made childless, and a weak imagination that you regard her with disrespect; both which rocks of offence would be removed by this one concession&#x2014; Besides, as my wedded Husband, you would appear to her in quite a new light; her maternal affection, of which there is abundance at the bottom of her heart, would, of necessity, extend itself to him with whom I was become so inseperably connected; and mere common sense would prescribe a kind motherly behaviour to you as the only expedient to make the best of what could no longer be helped. As to your second objection it seems to me still <pb id="pg-04-61" n="04:61"/>lighter than the first; for would it not be ridiculous to continue alltogeth<supplied>[er]</supplied> beggars in happiness because the possession of it is encumbered with a trifling tax? to live on joyless and solitary, thus far asunder, rather than give to Duty a few hours each day from our full enjoyment of each other&#x2019;s society? Surely it were better to make the sacrifice required of us without murmuring and verily it would secure its own reward. The hours that remained to us which we might devote exclusively <supplied>[to]</supplied> one another would be the dearer for being interrupted&#x2014;</p>
<p>The intrusions of a mob of idle visitors would <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> be a nuisance greater than we could bear&#x2014;but really I do not see that we should be called upon to bear it&#x2014;might it not be made a <foreign>sine qua non</foreign> in the treaty with my Mother, that we should <supplied>[be]</supplied> exempted from having any concern with her company?&#x2014;and that the door of our study should be made sufficiently strong to keep every living soul of them outside.&#x2014; Think then Darling, and answer me&#x2014; Would you live with me in my Mother&#x2019;s house? Say &#x2018;No&#x2019; if you judge that best without fear that I shall take it amiss. Indeed indeed I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> not sway you tho&#x2019; I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> for I know well enough the infinite superiority of your Judgement&#x2014; Say yes,&#x2014;and I propose the thing to my Mother&#x2014; I have no manner of doubt but she will give it a willing, a joyful hearing&#x2014; Should it however contrary to all human expectation turn out otherwise&#x2014;why then&#x2014;let it be as you will! In that case our separation would be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> doing not mine&#x2014; I should have mistaken in thinking myself indispensable to her happiness. Oh me! I am much to be pitied&#x2014;my heart is divided against itself&#x2014; Would to heaven we saw each others face&#x2014;for I find it impossible to set these things down on paper as I feel them in my heart&#x2014; Let me use as many words as I like my meaning is still but imperfectly expressed&#x2014; But I must conclude for the present, or miss another post&#x2014; I waited till yesterday that I might answer both your letters at once, in case you had written as you half promised on Sunday&#x2014;and Yesterday I was distracted with headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>&#x2014; Write&#x2014;the first hour you have leisure.</p>

<p><salute>My good Love&#x2014;</salute> I guessed what was detaining your letter: but I scarcely dared to expect it on Saturday. It came in company with a quarter of a volume of <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi>, or I should have answered it yesterday. But the villainous sheets kept me working till midnight; and now I am to be busy beyond all measure for a week or more. You must just wait, <foreign>Liebchen</foreign>, till <hi rend="italic">next</hi> opportunity; and in the meantime, I will keep that royal project resting in my thoughts; and who knows but it may be lighter when I come to write of it.</p>
<p>You are a true-hearted woman, after all, my little girl; and I love you in my inmost heart, I believe; notwithstanding my perversities&#x2014; I also vote that, at all haps and hazards, we be married <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>: but I love you better for your love of your Mother; and depend on it, my Dearest, your conscience is no more precious in your own eyes than in mine. These things must be reconciled. Your plan is bright as the <date when="--05">May</date> Morn on one side: but (alas, for the conjunction!) there are many <hi rend="italic">buts</hi>. Think of it, and leave me to think of it; and I will send you my best <hi rend="italic">deliverance</hi> in due time. And so keep thy heart at peace, my <foreign>bonny</foreign> bride; and I too will live in full hope: for in some few months, it shall go hard if thou be not lying in my bosom, never to be parted from me any more, but <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> for ever and ever. <foreign><hi rend="italic">O Himmel und Erde</hi></foreign> [O heaven and earth]!</p>
<p>This small scrap of a note I owe the opportunity of writing to an arrangement of Jane&#x2019;s. She has manufactured two pairs of <hi rend="italic">wristikins</hi>, one for your mother and one for you; which I am to send by this parcel. She also essayed to write; but with her whole skill, it would not do; and so her <hi rend="italic">Love</hi> must be content, like Neighbour Franz&#x2019;s, to continue <hi rend="italic">Dumb</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to the &#x201C;Dumb Love&#x201D; of Mus&#xE4;us which Carlyle had translated.</note> It is not the less true on that account.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Possibly enough you are looking for the parcel this very night; and alas, it is still lying quiet in &#x201C;the Village&#x201D;! I had no expectation of a packet on Saturday; and did not call at the Post-office till far in the afternoon&#x2014;for the newspaper, in which of course I failed, tho&#x2019; my success in another way made good amends for this disappointment. Then the sheets were deplorably incorrect; and kept me busy yesterday from morning to night. At last after great labour, I have got them brought <foreign><hi rend="italic">ziemlich ins Reine</hi></foreign> [fairly well corrected].</p>
<p>You are quite correct in your inference about Scotsbrig. Our Father returned, Thursday week,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The father returned then with the good news about Scotsbrig on <date when="1826-03-09">9 March</date>.</note> &#x201C;on his fir deal,&#x201D; at the hind foot of Larry and Alick; after doing great business in the mighty waters. By dint of unbounded higgling, and the most consummate diplomacy, the point was achieved to complete satisfaction of the two husbandmen; and Scotsbrig, free of various &#x201C;clags and claims,&#x201D; which they had argued away, obtained for a rent of &#xa3;190 (Cheap, as they reckon it), in the face of many competitors. A solemn ploughing-day was held last week; and by the aid of ale and <foreign>stingo</foreign> [strong liquor], much work was effected. I rode over and saw them, a truly spirit-stirring sight. The people also are to repair the house effectually; to floor it anew, put <hi rend="italic">bun</hi>-doors<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paneled doors.</note> on it, new windows and so forth; and it seems, &#x201C;it is an excellent <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> of a house already.&#x201D; Alick is ploughing at Mainhill, with two new horses; our Father is looking out for a sedate-minded galloway to carry him &#x201C;between <foreign>toon</foreign> and <foreign>toon</foreign> [between farm and farm],&#x201D; <pb id="pg-04-64" n="04:64"/>and so all is running on cartwheels with us here. Our Mother declares that there is &#x201C;plenty of both <hi rend="italic">peats</hi> and <hi rend="italic">water</hi>&#x201D;; others think &#x201C;the farm is the best in Middlebie parish-<hi rend="italic">in</hi>&#x201D;; our Father seems to have renewed his youth even as the Eagle&#x2019;s age.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 103.5.</note></p>
<p>So, my good Jack, there will still be a home for thee here; with as true a welcome, and I hope better accommodation than ever. Therefore get thy Thesis printed, and thy Graduation effected; and come home to us, with the speed of light, in the Dumfries Diligence; and look about thee, and take breath a little, till we see what more is to be done. Tell me in the meantime when thy money is wearing scant; and we will get some more.</p>
<p>Mrs Irving of Bogside removes to Annan Hill, to the house on the very top if it, at Whitsuntide; along with Gavin, the trusty man. Waugh&#x2019;s property is not sold, that I hear of: indeed I have neither seen the man, nor got any accurate tidings of him, for many months. Alick said he noticed him at Dumfries the day they were bargaining for the farm.</p>
<p>Grahame of Burnswark I have seen: he was at Scotsbrig on the solemn ploughing-day; and looked as fat and full of sap, as any man in the five parishes. He is to call at [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] get tea here, about Wednesday night. What he purposes to do next I know not: but he seems in excellent heart; and I hope, has got ways and means again in his hand.</p>
<p>We cannot hear of any Carrier going northward: otherwise an abundant supply of creature comfort would depart hence along with him. Geordie Farries has quarrelled with Marshall the Distiller, they say; and seems quite land-locked at present.</p>
<p>I have sent M&#x2019;Cork part of the Fourth volume; but the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is not done or begun and I shall have a heavy week of it; freeing the renowned M&#x2019;Cork from the bondage of printing on <hi rend="italic">stripes</hi>, into the freedom of printing on pages. I still dread these Leipzig books: I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> off the other day to Julius.</p>
<p>My Mother wishes much for a letter; and she tells me here standing that you <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get a box by Andrew Smith, who purposes setting forth some day about the middle of this week. Ask on saturday.</p>
<p>Ask M&#x2019;Cork, if he can send me down, any of his sheets <hi rend="italic">before</hi> he gets the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>; that is, if he thinks it worth while: and say <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nein</hi></foreign> or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ja</hi></foreign> on the newspaper. After all it i<supplied>[s ver]</supplied>y little matter whether you ask or not; for I myself <supplied>[thin]</supplied>k <foreign><hi rend="italic">nein</hi></foreign> will be better. <closer><salute>Ever your&#x2019;s&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am just setting off for Annan with this <hi rend="italic">Life of Goethe</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The biographical sketch of Goethe written as an introduction to <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi> and first published in Vol. IV of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> (<date when="1827">1827</date>), later as a part of the introduction to <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Appr&#xE9;nticeship and Travels</hi>.</note> which has held me busy for the last week and more, having swelled under my hand, which hand also was at first grievously <hi rend="italic">out</hi>. I will not go, without casting you a word, to say at least that we are all well.</p>
<p>Andrew Smith, the useless <hi rend="italic">weepie mousie</hi>, stole a march on us, and went off on Tuesday, after appointing &#x201C;the middle of the week.&#x201D; That same day a boy of Geordie Farries&#x2019;, as I was riding past on the <foreign>brae</foreign> here, called to me that his father was going off next morning at 1 of the clock. I rode on to Mainhill; and they slew a cock there, and boiled three swine-tongues, and washed three dozen of eggs, and bagged a stone of meal, and wrote a letter, and packed them all into a fir box, and sent off Ned the king of hashes whom they have for herd, with the whole on his back. Alas! the boy had been wilfully and maliciously lying; the Waffler stirred not, and the box was brought home again, and opened <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. &#x201C;There is nothing but a <hi rend="italic">mixture</hi>&#x201D; in this world, mother!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A mixture of good and evil&#x201D;: an observation which John Carlyle made to his mother on earlier occasions.

<p>Tell me accurately how much money you will need to graduate you, next time you write. They are on the borrowing order from me, and I want to put your share beyond the reach of contingency.</p>
<p>Jane and Jenny and Alick and Wightman are gone to Scotsbrig two days ago. They have got three new horses; and all hands are <pb id="pg-04-66" n="04:66"/>sowing and harrowing, and flitting and tearing; there never was such work seen since&#x2014;the last farm was taken.

<p><salute><hi rend="italic">Dearest <foreign>Weibchen</foreign></hi>&#x2014;</salute> I have kept thee long waiting; but I could not come a moment sooner, much as I wished to come. Till last night my hands were full of that magnanimous Life of Goethe, as the echo of it is still sounding in my head. What kept me so long with it? You partly, you little wretch! For the first three or four days all that I could do, you would not go about your business; and whenever I sat down to my canvas to draw this majestic countenance, the kind roguish face of Jane Welsh came peeping over the easel, and I was forced to look into <pb id="pg-04-67" n="04:67"/>her black bright eyes, and they put me out. It was very wrong of you, you shameful creature. But I will remember all these sins by and by.</p>
<p>Even yet I am in the extremest haste; and must now write of the most important concern of both your life and my own without either due deliberation or due detail. My present sentiments on the matter I will endeavour to express to you, lying still open to farther light. In the first place let me tell you what my plan <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, before your counterplan came athwart it.</p>
<p>I have got a cottage here, as I anticipated; that is my Father and Alick have rented the farm of Scotsbrig (a place they like much better than Shawbrae at the rent of &#xa3;190); and I am to be master of the house there, till the Mainhill lease expire (Whitsunday <date when="1827">1827</date>); the Hill colony moving thither in the interim, at the approaching term.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1826-05-26">26 May</date>.</note> This is an event which gives me more satisfaction than you would readily conceive: not on my own account only, but on that of my kindred, who can now regard the ill-nature of our rural Ali Pacha<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle quotes Byron&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi>, II, the 9th stanza of the song following stanza 72, here: &#x201C;Since the days of our prophet the Crescent ne&#x2019;er saw A chief ever glorious like Ali Pashaw.&#x201D;</note> with a degree of equanimity much easier to attain than formerly. Ali, I mean &#x201C;his Honour,&#x201D; Major General Sharpe, and I had such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">schene</hi></foreign> the other day at this door! I made Grahame of Burnswark (<hi rend="italic">Brunswick</hi>) laugh at it yesterday all the way from Annan to Hoddam Bridge. In short, Ali sank in the space of little more than a minute from 212&#xB0; of Fahrenheit&#x2019;s thermometer to 32&#xB0;, and retired even <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the freezing point.</p>
<p>Now this house of Scotsbrig which is to be mine for a year, and in which I have a moderately good right to a domicile as long afterwards as I like, is one of the most monstrously ugly and uncultivated looking houses you ever set your eyes on. Nevertheless it is tight and dry: it is to be floored, windowed, doored anew; and by this means the upper story will be made habitable enough for me, and there is <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of room below for all the rest. And now, <foreign>Liebchen</foreign>, this was my plan: Having finished my Translation, and got my cash for it, I was to kneel down before you, and ask your hand: this little soft hand you could not refuse me; but I was to press it forever in my own; and fairly carry you off into the <foreign>wolds</foreign> of Annandale, into this Kamtchatka<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kamchatka, a cold Russian peninsula on the western side of the Bering Sea near Alaska.</note> establishment, which I knew and believed the presence of your Husband <pb id="pg-04-68" n="04:68"/>would render as beautiful as many far grander and costlier mansions. Here then was an asylum for us; a shelter at least against the <hi rend="italic">meanest</hi> distresses of existence; a humble but secure roadstead to which we could run whenever poverty or other bad weather made the high seas too rude for our vessel.</p>
<p>How you were to employ yourself here in the meanwhile, I had not calculated very accurately. You would have Jane and our Mother to love you and impart to you the simple scenery of their obscure but still human existence; you might study the first elements of housewifery; you would have books and pens; and gay rides with me on bright sunshiny days. For myself I was resolved on writing a Book, no compilation or biography but a <hi rend="italic">book</hi> (which, thro&#x2019; the strength of Heaven, I will yet write); and so to be busier thro&#x2019; the day than when you staid with us at the Hill. But then all evening there was to be tea put on the table, and a circle of glad faces was to gather round it, and there we should sit and talk, or I should read, and play with your black locks; for you were then my own to all Eternity, and no other man or woman had any part or lot in your true bosom but myself. And so in this way I reckoned that, with diligence and rest, with wisdom and desipience, with quarrelling and fighting and kissing and caressing, we might contrive to weather till the winter season tolerably enough. Then if I were stronger, or if we found the country getting too disagreeable, with the strength I have, I was to set out for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and try if I could get a cottage there (I am told they are to be had furnished there); at all events, next Whitsunday, unless Fortune was <hi rend="italic">too</hi> cruel to us, we were to go northward and commence housekeeping there, on our own foundation. I should have &#xa3;200 at any rate to begin with; and many an honest couple has begun with less. Jane might have gone with us, and helped you; some ancient thrifty serving-maid would have completed our establishment. In truth we should be poor, as poor need be: but what then, we should learn, we would and could learn to suit our outlay to our income; we should stand steadfastly by one another thro&#x2019; scarcity and abundance, if ever abundance came as it might possibly do; and so thro&#x2019; honour or the absence of it, we should feel that we were true and good, and happy in each other&#x2019;s arms, and obliged for our happiness to no earthly soul, but to Heaven only.</p>
<p>As we think mostly of our own wants and wishes alone, in all this royal project, I had taken no distinct account of your Mother. I merely remembered the text of Scripture: &#x201C;Thou shalt leave father and <pb id="pg-04-69" n="04:69"/>mother, and cleave unto thy husband, and thy desire shall be towards him all the days of thy life.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eph. 5:31.</note> I imagined perhaps she might go to Dumfries-shire, and gratify her heart by increasing the accommodations of her father, which she would then have ample means to do; perhaps that she might even&#x2014;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude speculates that Carlyle was going to say &#x201C;marry again&#x201D; but happily withdrew the words in time.</note> in short, that she might arrange her destiny in many ways, to which my presence must be a hindrance rather than a furtherance. Here I was selfish and thoughtless: I might have known that the love of a Mother to her only child is indestructible and irreplaceable; that forcibly to cut asunder such ties was cruel and unjust.</p>
<p>Perhaps, as I have told you, Love, I may not yet have got to the bottom of this new plan so completely as I wished: but there is one thing that strikes me more and more, the longer I think of it. This the grand objection of all objections, the head and front of offence, the soul of all my counter-pleading; an objection which is too likely to overset the whole project. It may be stated in a word: <hi rend="italic">The Man should bear rule in the house and not the Woman</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle points out that Carlyle was translating the &#x201C;Libussa&#x201D; of Mus&#xE4;us at this time and that one sentence in it reads: &#x201C;The man should be master of the house and not the wife; this is his special right, and so it is established everywhere, among all people.&#x201D;</note> This is an eternal axiom, the Law of Nature h<supplied>[erself w]</supplied>hich no mortal departs from unpunished. I have meditated on this ma<supplied>[ny long]</supplied> years, and every day it grows plainer to me: I must not and J. cannot live in a house of which I am not head. I should be miserable myself, and make all about me miserable. Think not, Darling, that this comes of an imperious temper; that I shall be a harsh and tyrannical husband to thee. God forbid! But it is the nature of a man that if he be controuled by any thing but his own Reason, he feels himself degraded; and incited, be it justly or not, to rebellion and discord. It is the nature of a woman again (for she is essentially <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> not <hi rend="italic">active</hi>) to cling to the man for support and direction, to comply with his humours, and feel pleasure in doing so, simply because they are his; to reverence while she loves him, to conquer him not by her force but her weakness, and perhaps (the cunning gypsy!) after all to command him by obeying him. It is inexpressible what an increase of happiness, and of consciousness, wholesome consciousness of inward dignity I have gained since I came within the walls of this poor cottage. My own four walls!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <sic><date when="1825-11-30">30 Nov. 1825</date></sic><corr><date when="1825-12-01">1 Dec. 1825</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-03/lt-18261225-TC-ADBM-01">TC to ADBM, <date when="1825-12-25">25 Dec.</date></ref></note> For in my state this <pb id="pg-04-70" n="04:70"/>primeval law of Nature acts on <hi rend="italic">me</hi> with double and triple force. And how cheaply it is purchased, and how smoothly managed! They simply admit that I am <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herr im Hause</hi></foreign> [master of the house], and act on this conviction. Here is no grumbling about my habitudes and whims: if I choose to dine on fire and brimstone, they will cook it for me to their best skill; thinking only that I am an unintelligible mortal; perhaps in their secret souls, a kind of humourist, <foreign><hi rend="italic">facheuse</hi></foreign> [troublesome] to deal with, but no bad soul after all, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be dealt with in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other way. My own four walls!</p>
<p>Your mother is of all women the best calculated for being a <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi>, and the worst for being a <hi rend="italic">Husband</hi>. I know her perhaps better than she thinks; and it is not without affection and sincere esteem that I have seen the fundamental structure of her character, and the many light capricious half-graces half-follies that sport on the surface of it. I could even fancy that she might love me also, and feel happy beside me, if her own true and kindly character were come into fair and free communion with mine, which she might then find was neither false nor cruel any more than her own. But this could only be (I will speak it out at once and boldly, for it is the quiet and kind conviction of my judgement, not the conceited and selfish conviction of my vanity: this could only be) in a situation where she looked up to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, not I to her.</p>
<p>Now, think, <foreign>Liebchen</foreign>, whether your Mother will consent to forget her own riches, and my poverty, and uncertain most probably very scanty income; and consent in the spirit of Christian meekness to make <hi rend="italic">me</hi> her guardian and director, and be a second <hi rend="italic">wife</hi> to her daughter&#x2019;s husband! If she can, then I say, she is a noble woman; and in the name of Truth and Affection, <hi rend="italic">let</hi> us all live together, and be one household and one heart till Death, or her own choice part us! If she cannot, which will do any thing but surprise me, then alas! the other thing cannot be, must not be; and for her sake, no less than for yours and mine, we must think of something else. Explain all this, Jane, in your own dialect; for unless you explain it, it may be dreadfully misunderstood. Then tell me the result without the loss of a moment. <closer><salute>Love me always in the centre of your heart, and believe me your own.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>My Mother has scolded me regularly every time these three last letters, for not sending her compliments and love. She is come in this moment; and orders me to wish you &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> good things.&#x201D; She knows of the Scotsbrig plan; and says she &#x201C;would have you look up to the <pb id="pg-04-71" n="04:71"/>Almighty for counsel in this and all your goings.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014; She is longing for another letter.

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>You are thinking, I presume, that I might have done your bidding with less delay; but, the fact is I have not lost one minute that could be saved&#x2014; Judge if I have&#x2014; Your letter found me in the saddest domestic <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> imaginable; our maid-servant lay in one part of the house at death&#x2019;s door with fever and asthma; in another part of it lay my Mother about as ill with an attack of bile; and to crown all, just in this evil nick, a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fool-creature</hi>&#x201D; must needs come on a visit&#x2014; While things were in this way, as you may well conceive, I had no leisure to make the needful disclosures; besides it was no propitious season for my Mother to hear them in: and a week passed before the household was convalescent and the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fool-creature</hi>&#x201D; departed, and my hands thus left free to go about my Master&#x2019;s business. So you see I am no bad Ariel after all.</p>
<p><foreign>Eh bien!</foreign> I have informed my Mother in a long letter of all which it concerned her to know (so long a <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> being, as Jane<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s little sister, the budding poetess and lover of fine phrases.</note> says &#x201C;beyond the utmost compass of my ability&#x201D;) and the result is&#x2014;what do you think? that, provided we manage matters aright, you and I are <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> to be the happiest pair of people in all Annandale!</p>
<p>My Mother does not object to my wedding you in your actual circumstances; on the contrary, she thinks it all things considered the best I can do; and neither does she object to my living with you in your Fatherland which shows a heroism on her part that I did not dare to look for. In short my kind reasonable Mother views our romantic project with all the favour that heart could desire&#x2014;and not by the cold, bleak light of worldly prudence, but the rosy sun-light of poetry which is in this case <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane alludes to Goethe&#x2019;s autobiography <hi rend="italic">Truth and Poetry</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi>].</note></p>
<p>And we will not be purchasing our happiness at the cost of hers; for she will live (she says) at Templand and visit us as often as may be: and this arrangement I believe after all, is the very best that the <pb id="pg-04-72" n="04:72"/>case admits&#x2014; My Mother is fond of Nithsdale, and we will make her fond of Annandale also. In the one place she will have kind friends about her, whom she dearly likes, and within her the consciousness of doing good to her Father and Sister; in the other she will find you and I, <hi rend="italic">ourselves a host</hi>, and will not be <foreign><hi rend="italic">fremd</hi></foreign> [strange], she declares to me, with your kindred, but esteem them as they deserve. Moreover, the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> plan, however well it had been proved to answer, could not, I find, have had any permanency&#x2014; My Grandfather must, in the course of Nature, be taken from us at no distant day; and my Aunt would then be left alone and helpless were not my Mother to become her protector&#x2014; That must not be&#x2014;is not to be thought of&#x2014; In going to live with her now, then, my Mother is only <hi rend="italic">anticipitating</hi> what <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be, as far as human calculation reaches, her ultimate destination; and in thus anticipating it she will have the comfort of watching over her Fathers declining age, and adding to his scanty accomodations: a comfort which will atone to her Mother&#x2019;s-heart for the <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> loss of her Daughter&#x2019;s company&#x2014; On these grounds, she prefers that we should have separate households; and on these grounds I am willing that we should&#x2014;so what more remains to be <hi rend="italic">said</hi>?&#x2014; Are you happy?

<dateline>Friday-Night. [<date when="1826-04-14">14 April 1826</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have got M&#x2019;Cork&#x2019;s sheets put in readiness, and also the &#x201C;further supply of Copy&#x201D;; but my cares are still very far from being concluded. Where can those German Books be? I shall be done with <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> in two days, I might have been done tomorrow, and then absolutely idle. However, I still live in hope: and at all events, I shall be better at present for a few days of rest; being absolutely very much deranged in the biliary ducts by over close work, I suppose, and the effects of my three weeks in Edinburgh, which our Mother asserts I have never yet recovered. I have the Targer<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> too, and he is ready for all schemes of amusement.</p>
<p>From your own brief enough sketches and the Targer&#x2019;s account, I still joyfully gather that you are well. The Targer is loud in his praises, second or first hand, of your <hi rend="italic">Thesis</hi>. I shall yet be proud of you as a brother. Faithful diligence <hi rend="italic">will</hi> at last prevail: and good days are in store for all of us.</p>
<p>I was about to ask you touching <hi rend="italic">Eichthal</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron d&#x2019;Eichthal, uncle of the brothers Gustave and Adolphe d&#x2019;Eichthal. Gustave&#x2019;s son Eug&#xE8;ne published &#x201C;Carlyle et le Saint-Simonisme,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Revue Historique</hi>, LXXXII (<date when="1903">1903</date>), 292&#x2013;306.</note> when you mention that he is still great with you, and even throwing out hints about a joint expidition to M&#xfc;nchen. Has he said any thing more of it? Take a measureable piece of paper, and tell me fully. My opinion of it is not very indistinct. If he would engage to give you &#xa3;100 <foreign>per annum</foreign>, paying all your charges &#x26;c, and in other points to treat you as a companion and friend, then I should say go for a year or even two. You would see much, and learn much; and might then come home to establish yourself under favourable auspices. O my good Jack, and should I lose thee, my Brother! For after all the scolding, we have had, I do not believe I have a truer friend on the face of God&#x2019;s Earth. Yet it would be for your advantage I think clearly: and so if the body speaks of it, and your own mind affects it, I would have you front him, with some such offers <pb id="pg-04-74" n="04:74"/>as the above. If he do not speak of it, why then let him altogether hold his peace; you can still thank the Baron for his past attentions (they bespeak an amiable mind in him) and say internally: &#x201C;I can live independent <foreign><hi rend="italic">on tha</hi></foreign> [of thee]&#x201D;!</p>
<p>Have I heard of Miss Welsh? O Jack! there is the mightiest secret in that matter; a secret which I have yet whispered only to our Mother, and which, when I now commit it to thy faithful ear, must be shrouded in deepest silence. I really do believe she and I are going to be married this very summer! &#x201C;First recover that, then thou shalt know more.&#x201D; So soon as I have finished my Book, and the Scotsbrig house is swept and garnished, it is about settled that I am to bring the young damsel thither. The winter, I suppose or partly hope, we may spend at Haddington: for her mother goes to Templand to live; and I have just been persuading them<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter which now seems to be lost, as Jane&#x2019;s unfavourable reply to it seems to be. See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 208.</note> <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to let their house to Dr Fyffe, but to keep it for Dr Carlyle and Dr Carlyle&#x2019;s elder brother and fair sister-in-law. Dr Carlyle is not in truth specifically mentioned to the <hi rend="italic">alien</hi> parties, but the interested parties have him in their mind.</p>
<p>God knows, my good Jack, I look forward, as pears<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pears. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221113-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-11-13">13 Nov. 1822</date></ref>.</note> said, to this affair with very <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> feelings. I am to have a wife whom I have long loved beyond any other woman: but bless your heart Sir! Here are five thousand other things to be taken into account at the same time! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Doch frisch heran</hi></foreign> [cheerily onward indeed]! Who never ventured never won! After all, what do I venture? A precious destiny forsooth, here as I sit! In short, Jack, what must be must be: and so by this axiom, which no logic, not the very gates of Ewart&#x2019;s shop,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A gossip center: presumably James Ewart&#x2019;s draper&#x2019;s shop, High St., Annan, referred to also in later letters.</note> can prevail against, I am to be wedded.</p>
<p>Now supposing you to go or not go to Germany, I think some good may still possibly arise from this event to you also. What say you to practice in Haddington? With a Munich reputation you might do wonders. Dr. Fyffe and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the other Doctors are most entire and acknowledged&#x2014;quadrupeds.&#x2014; But alas! we are <supplied>[for]</supplied>getting Mrs Glass&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hannah Glasse (<hi rend="italic">fl</hi>. <date when="1747">1747</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy</hi> (<date when="1747">1747</date>), a popular work which went through many editions. The phrase is always attributed to Mrs. Glasse, though she did not use it.</note> celebrated maxim in hare-cookery, &#x201C;first catch your hare.&#x201D; At all events thou wilt still have a home thy Brother&#x2019;s home: for <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the contracting <pb id="pg-04-75" n="04:75"/>parties are to be equally poor; and so the hearth however faint its glimmer will be <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mine&#x2019;s</hi>. Keep this secret as death! I am done, or rather the paper is. Send the books (as many of them at least as will come without additional expense) by the very earliest chance of sheets. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my good Brother. I am ever thine,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your letter lay two days in the Postoffice, and I have kept it another day in my hands, to see whether any light would dawn out of the utter darkness with which the first perusal of it overshadowed me. The process of dawning has been ineffectual enough still: but time presses; and I must snatch an hour to communicate my views to you, such as they are.</p>
<p>I had schemed all this affair so nicely: the Haddington house came in with such aptness to meet the new difficulties which the transition from a <hi rend="italic">project</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> never fails to bring along with it: here we might live in love and wise peace on our own unassisted resources, till there seemed a fair chance of removing with prudence to a more genial sphere; here we should be secluded in harmonious and not inactive privacy, entering on the journey of our life at a rate no quicker than we might calculate on keeping up! I declare to you, that even I who live without hope in the world, walking not by faith but by vision, could not but pronounce the aspect of the future to be much meeker and more settled, and ominous of clearer weather for us both. And now comes your letter, a gay kind loving letter, souse like a cannon-ball on my little edifice, and shatters it in a moment into fragments; which how we are to rebuild I confess I yet see not.</p>
<p>To complete the matter, the unfortunate scoundrel who for the present occupies Scotsbrig has the other day procured a Sheriff&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">interdict</hi> against our husbandmen: the ploughs are there resting from their labours; and the ejection of that unhappy mortal from his quarters has <pb id="pg-04-76" n="04:76"/>become a problem for the civil authorities. For aught I can discover, it seems probable enough that I shall have to retire with my writing ware, for perhaps a good part of summer, into the dark but hospitable caves of Mainhill.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The tenant of Scotsbrig, although he had become insolvent, refused to give up his lease, and endeavoured by aid of the law to prevent James Carlyle&#x2019;s entry on the farm. The matter looked very ominous while Carlyle was writing this Letter, and indeed a final settlement of the difficulty was not reached until near the <date when="1826-05">middle of May</date>&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>You ask me if I have any objection to reside in Edinburgh. To Edinburgh none, to any quarter of the Earth none, so I be occupied in my duty and with those I love, so I can live wisely for myself and those dear to me and dependent on me. Your mother, with a generosity worthy of her, has offered to furnish us a house there. I do thank her from the inmost part of my heart; and I beg you to let her see that if I decline this most kind proposal, it is from no false prideful feeling, which would ill become me towards her, but from a perception of its inapplicability to my circumstances, from a persuasion that her bounty would be wasted.</p>
<p>Alas! I do fear this plan is impracticable. In the first place, it is too likely that by this time all but the refuse of the houses are let; an argument which like the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> reason for the witness&#x2019;s absence, his <hi rend="italic">death</hi>, precludes the necessity of stating the other nineteen. In this, however, I may be wrong, and you have better knowledge; so I pass from it. But supposing us fairly wedded, and settled in a pretty cottage in the suburbs of Edinburgh, have you well considered how the roof-tree of it is to be kept above our heads? By the best calculation I can make, the expense of living there in the same comfort as in Haddington would be rather more than doubled. Such a house as the one where you now sit, would cost if furnished somewhere about &#xa3;150 a year: one very greatly inferior which I visited at Morningside<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Southwest of Edinburgh, today a very respectable residential section.</note> was charged &#xa3;60 for the bare unpapered and unpainted walls. The humblest cottage, humble enough in sooth, costs between thirty and forty pounds. To say nothing of taxes; of <hi rend="italic">filthy <foreign>hallions</foreign></hi> [slovens]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241218-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-12-18">18 Dec. 1824</date></ref>.</note> of landlords; of the thousand and one expences and discomforts of living in large towns, which I unhappily know far better than you. Have you figured yourself planted here, in the midst of splendour and scarcity, your sick husband, whom your caresses melted into weakness but could not soothe into peace, forced to <hi rend="italic">hawk</hi> the laborious products of an aching head and <pb id="pg-04-77" n="04:77"/>heart for a piece of money, and become the drudge of gross thick-sided booksellers that he and his might be saved from ruin? By God&#x2019;s blessing, I will live in a dog-hutch, on the produce of the brook and the furrow, before this shall even threaten me. And let other men and other women say of it whatsoever shall seem good to them: the atmospheric air is wide enough to furnish breath for us all.</p>
<p>O Jane! My good true Jane, that love me in your warm faithful heart! why will you forever force me to repeat that I am poor; a word which I like not to pronounce or to hear pronounced, for it usually betokens blind as well as pusillanimous complaint or else false boastful cant; either of which I would willingly avoid. This word has many meanings, which it is most painful and ungracious in me to explain, but which it is indispensably important in your selected and allotted station that you thoroughly understand.</p>
<p>I despair of doing any thing but vex you by this letter; for let us talk as we will we are not understood. Each perseveringly abides entrenched within his own circle of distresses and enjoyments; and the most pressing invitations and intreaties will not bring him over into the circle of the other.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle omits this sentence.</note> I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> in my judgement that you have many causes of offense connected with Haddington, but I cannot <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> them as you do. To me, among the weightier evils and blessings of existence the evil of impertinent visitors and so forth seems but as the small drop of the bucket and an exceeding little thing. I have nerve enough in me to dispatch that sort of deer forever by dozens in the day. Yet think not that I would restrain (or by this time it may be undo) your projected removal from your native town. The fancied happiness of living there was founded on the thought that you too would be happier; without this Haddington was no heaven to me either.</p>
<p>Do you call me wilful and capricious? I fear much, you do. And yet believe me Jane, if I could find any wilfulness or selfish whim in this letter, I would put it into the fire, and write another. It is hard enough that you must bear the stern truths connected with our circumstances; it were too hard if you had likewise to bear my ill nature in revealing them. Conceive me, figure out my situation! But alas you cannot, let me exhibit it as I will. After all, however, this is but a secondary matter, whether good <hi rend="italic">words</hi> are spoken and appear to be spoken, if so be that good <hi rend="italic">actions</hi> be done. With this view I have written you my purposes, be the grounds of them truly seen or not.</p>
<p>The grand question still remains: what is to be done? For aught <pb id="pg-04-78" n="04:78"/>that during brief intervals from business I have yet been able to think, it seems to me that our fair <hi rend="italic">plan</hi> has again shrunk back into the rank of <hi rend="italic">project</hi>. I see and feel too that till after a full fair and free utterance of our hearts to one another, neither I nor your mother nor you will ever work to each other&#x2019;s service. I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> speak clearly and cordially to our mother, as to a kind counsellor and helper, and like a man that wishes and means heartily well to her and hers. Am I not open to light, and is not she? Am not I and all that I have and can the possession of her child, as her child is of me? We need only to understand each other thoroughly; and from our united judgements and resources a fair enough arrangement will arise.</p>
<p>Can she and you, if you have determined on quitting Haddington, go and take a house for <hi rend="italic">yourselves</hi> in Edinburgh? It will be the better for your Mother&#x2019;s occupation, if she think of giving it to us when we wed. Here I shall see you, and tell you every thing; and do every thing which a rational and well-meaning man can engage for. I am to be there at all events when this Book is published; sooner would not be impossible, but very inconvenient. I have never yet recovered, the people here say, from my last three weeks residence there: in certainty, I am considerably worse; but I believe it is overwork.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle also omits this sentence.</note></p>
<p>As to my taste in houses, it is the easiest thing on Earth to fit. One sole indispensable and paramount property is complete quietude by night, such quietude that I can sleep in it. Will you believe it, this most humble requisite is fully nine-tenths of the comfort I anticipate and have enjoyed from owning a house. In <hi rend="italic">all</hi> [underscored twice] other points, my taste is of the most catholic description, and my toleration absolutely boundless. But with nocturnal noises I would turn my back on the Tuileries itself. This seems remarkably ridiculous, but it is no less true than it is ridiculous; and laughing from others throws no light on it, any more than mourning or execration from myself. If you meditate it well you will find this slender fact a key to many peculiarities in my conduct, which are not just foolish because they are peculiar; and which perhaps it were worth your while to understand more truly. For the rest, to Morningside, or any other quarter in Edinburgh or out of it I am perfectly well disposed; there is absolutely no point whatever in which I could possibly differ with your mother or any other civilised European person.</p>
<p>But I must finish: for my time and paper are done; and if I should <hi rend="italic">write</hi> till doomsday you would never understand me, never believe me. <pb id="pg-04-79" n="04:79"/>I have given you my thoughts and purposes crude as they were. The arrangement of things now rests with yourself and your mother. I think <hi rend="italic">you</hi> should go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, since your tastes are so decided against Haddington: but for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> to attempt housekeeping there on these principles would for the present, I think, be delusion. This I must say, tho&#x2019; I feel that you will sadly misinterpret it. Be kind, be tolerant, be just to me, till you have <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> me. If we are wise and true all will yet be well, if we are foolish and false it cannot. <closer><salute>I could write volumes, and it would all mean that I wish to be true and just to you, and happy in your happiness, and forever your own,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is long since I ought to have thanked you for your friendly and prompt answer to my last inquiries: and I do so now with no very good grace, when I have a new favour to ask of you.</p>
<p>The Book of &#x201C;German Novellists,&#x201D; concerning which I took your advice last spring, is actually in the Press: after much loitering, groping, consulting, and passive and active meditating, I at last fixed upon my men; began printing <date when="1826-01">last January</date>; and am in hopes of being soon rid of the affair, if you can help me out of this strait in which I am for the present entangled.</p>
<p>I am to have four volumes; <hi rend="italic">two</hi> names in each of the first three; and Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi> is to occupy the fourth. Of these, the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> and half of the second are already printed: Mus&#xE4;us, Fouqu&#xE9;, Tieck, Goethe with lives and so forth; Hoffmann, Jean Paul, and Maler M&#xfc;ller are still desiderated. And like to be so, unless you can lend me a hand; for the original works are not to be had in any <hi rend="italic">shop</hi> of this Island; and tho&#x2019; I have sent for both to Leipzig and Hamburg, and the <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> from Fleischer in the former of these book-marts reached us about a month ago, no glimpse of the ware itself has yet come to light, not even a probability when it is to be looked for. You will conceive the whole <hi rend="italic">nodus</hi> of the case when <pb id="pg-04-80" n="04:80"/>I tell you that in ten days unless some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deus intersit</hi></foreign> [god intervenes], Ballantyne with all his Devils will be at a stand!</p>
<p>Of Hoffmann I have a piece beside me that would answer, one of his <hi rend="italic">Fantasiest&#xfc;cke in Callots Manier</hi>; but I want much to see his <hi rend="italic">Leben und Nachlass</hi>, or any even the slenderest account of his Life; being ignorant at present even of the date of its termination. With Jean Paul also I could contrive at a dead lift to &#x201C;help myself through&#x201D;: on the faith of your recommendation I sent for <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle&#x2019;s Reise</hi>, and also for the <hi rend="italic">Leben Q</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">uintius</hi>]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">Fixlein</hi>, with a Biography of the Il<supplied>[l]</supplied>ustrious Dead himself; the former works I suppose are on the road at present; but as for Biographies Fleischer declares that tho&#x2019; two <foreign><hi rend="italic">h&#xF6;chst interessante</hi></foreign> [most highly interesting] Lives of Jean Paul are in the Press, no life whatever of him has yet come out of it. Nevertheless I have got the <hi rend="italic">Picnic and Dejeuner dansant zu Kuhschnappel</hi> of Richter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle seems to be referring to Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Blumen-, Frucht- und Dornenst&#xfc;cke oder Ehestand, Tod und Hochzeit des Armenadvokaten Fr. St. Siebenk&#xE4;s im Reichsmarkt Flecken Kuhschnappel</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1796">1796</date>) (<hi rend="italic">Flower, Fruit, and Thorn Pieces, or the Matrimony, Death, and Marriage of the Advocate of the Poor, Firmian Stanislaus Siebenk&#xE4;s, in the Empire&#x2019;s Market Town of Kuhschnappel</hi>).</note> here; and if no better might be, with this I could serve my turn. The death of Richter, among many deep feelings of sadness which it excites in me, affects me likewise with this very mean inconvenience, that I should and cannot give some more precise account of his life. The date of his death<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date>.</note> even is not known to me. This, however, surely might be learned.</p>
<p>But with regard to Maler M&#xfc;ller I confess myself totally helpless. This M&#xfc;ller is a person whom I do not recollect having heard you mention: Maler (Painter) is the <foreign><hi rend="italic">agnomen</hi></foreign> by which he is commonly designated, tho&#x2019; he has two Christian names besides. Richter, Horn, and other <hi rend="italic">Aesthetic</hi> gentlemen speak in high terms of him; and an intelligent Hamburger<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Julius.</note> whom I met with last summer recommended him with panegyrics almost rapturous. In short, I have come to regard this Maler Muller as an indispensable personage; and to believe that I cannot with a safe conscience present my Seven Champions of Germany to the English unless he be among the number.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maler M&#xfc;ller was not included in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> It seems he was a contemporary of Goethe in early days, and published various choice pieces about the period of <hi rend="italic">Werter</hi>; but afterwards forsook Poetry for Painting, in the but moderately successful pursuit of which he died <pb id="pg-04-81" n="04:81"/>some months ago at Rome. His Literary works (Maler M&#xfc;llers <hi rend="italic">Sammt liche Werke</hi>, 3 Bande, 80.) are mentioned in Fleischer&#x2019;s catalogue, as published at Heidelberg in <date when="1811">1811</date>; since which time, it would appear, they have met with quite a new reception; and says my Hamburg correspondent &#x201C;it is even thought that had he continued to cultivate poetry, he might have all but equalled Goethe himself&#x201D;!</p>
<p>Now you can easily figure how gladly I would buy these three volumes; borrow them, beg them, nay almost steal them; so any one of these four modes of appropriation could bring them into my hand. As I have no late catalogue of any London German Bookseller, it seems barely possible that Bohtes widow, Boosey, Black or some of these people may have the article in their possession. Nay failing this, who knows but your Mrs Aders<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250429-TC-HCR-01">TC to HCR, <date when="1825-04-29">29 April 1825</date></ref>.</note> or some other of your German friends may have it in their library, and be prevailed upon for the sake of helping a disconsolate Author out of this Slough of Despond, to let him have it for a week or two in his extreme need? If you can possibly do any thing for me, I know you will do it: if not, why then we must summon our Christian fortitude, and await in meekness and humility the chances of wind and weather. I will tell you again <foreign><hi rend="italic">s&#xE4;mmtlich</hi></foreign> [all] what I want:</p><lb/>
<p>1. Hoffman&#x2019;s (C. <supplied>[E.]</supplied> T. A.) <hi rend="italic">Leben und Nachlass</hi>, or any account of his life, even the date of his decease.</p>
<p>2. Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quintius Fixlein</hi>, and the same thing about <hi rend="italic">his</hi> life</p>
<p>3. Maler M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi>; with if possible the like appendage.</p><lb/>
<p>The first of these works would enable me to go on for the matter of four weeks; by which time, it is likely enough, the Leipzig package may have arrived: the last would enable me in some measure to make ends meet without its arrival; the whole three would elevate me on the &#x201C;Rock of Necessity,&#x201D; from which I might snap my fingers in the face of all chances whatsoever.</p>
<p>I confess, my dear Sir, I have very little hope that it will be in your power to accomplish aught for me in this difficulty: yet when I have tried you, I am at the very end of my resources; at which point, as you know, it is much eas<supplied>[ier]</supplied> to rest in patience than at any nearer one. So I trespass once more on your <supplied>[good]</supplied> nature; still trusting tho&#x2019; feebly. If you succeed in getting any of these books, and can leave them with C. Tait, Bookseller, Sign of Horace&#x2019;s Head, 63. Fleet-street, he <pb id="pg-04-82" n="04:82"/>will send them directly to his brother in Edinburgh, who is my Bookseller in this adventure<supplied>[.]</supplied> The Fleet-street Tait will of course purchase, that is, pay the books, if purchasing or paying avail: but this I doubt much.</p>
<p>At all events I shall gain a letter from you, by this attempt I am making; and that will amply repay the trouble it cost me. I have not forgotten the still Temple, nor Alsatia, nor the kind Philosopher that dwells there. When you see this Book, I hope you will find that your advices have not been quite thrown away on me; and here and there a little trait will remind you of our dialogues over coffee and <hi rend="italic">Sally-Lunns</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Slightly sweetened teacakes served hot with butter, named after a woman who made and sold them in Bath, England, in the late eighteenth century.</note> I have a note about Nicolai and <hi rend="italic">Philisters</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christoph Friedrich Nicolai (<date when="1733">1733</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811">1811</date>). For the note, see Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Meister, Works</hi>, XXIII, 22.</note> to which I would gladly have appended an acknowledgment to the proper quarter, had I been authorized</p>
<p>Literary news, news of yourself, news of all kinds are a scarcity with me here. For ma<supplied>[ny]</supplied> months after leaving you I lay as if in the Castle of Indolence; stretched under whispering beeches, reading German, smoking Orinocco, and one of the lordliest prospects in the world spread out at my feet: Skiddaw, Saddleback, Helvellyn, and all these everlasting hills for my background, the silver water of the Solway in front, my time slipped smoothly away; divided into two portions like Lafontaine&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">l&#x2019;une se passait &#xE0; dormir, l&#x2019;autre a ne rien faire</hi></foreign> [the one was passed in sleep, the other in doing nothing]. I am grown a little healthier and much happier, but I am still as secluded as ever. If you can let me hear afar off the tumult of the Brick Universe, its sound will be welcome to me; for there is much in your Babylon that I like, and hope to revisit under kinder auspices. <closer><salute>Believe me always,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>I have a long row of Spanish books now in my eye; for which my conscience many a time reproves me. I will send them, when I go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; sooner, if you require them.</p>

<p><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Mein ewig Liebste</hi></foreign> [My dearest forever],</salute> why do you not write to me? Is it purpose? Is it necessity? Negligence it cannot be: for doubtless you duly appreciate the deep anxiety I necessarily feel about this most important event of my life and yours; and I know you too well to imagine that you could keep me one needless moment in such uncertainty. Nevertheless I have sent to the post-office every day this week, in vain; the long-looked-for messenger comes over the Hill empty-handed, without any tidings hopeful or despondent, consolatory or criminative from the quarter whence they are most eagerly expected.</p>
<p>This trial of my patience is the sharper, as for the last five days I have been totally idle; and accordingly prepared without much sacrifice to come and see you face to face, if such a step were desired, or necessary for the adjustment of this very serious negociation. The Books I talked of as having come from Germany turn out to be an <hi rend="italic">Invoice of Books</hi>, the Books themselves being still somewhere on the road between Leipzig and this: the printing therefore is just about to stop, I myself am already stopped. Meanwhile the East-wind has given me a horrid cold: I am idle and sick, and Jane will not write. Behold, all these things are against me!</p>
<p>Among the manifold hypotheses which I have formed to account for your silence, it has not failed to strike me that perhaps you were angry with me, that you felt yourself injured by my last letter, and were taking this method of reducing me to reason. I trust in Heaven it is not so. O my Darling, you must not do this! What were it, but to <pb id="pg-04-84" n="04:84"/>complicate our affairs still further which are already complicated enough? To employ our force against each other, for less than no purpose; instead of with each other, against the many difficulties that beset us? If the manner of that letter was offensive to you, I can say with a clear heart that it was a most involuntary sin: and for the matter of it, this was the true copy of my best judgement at the time; and I knew not how to serve you more honestly than by communicating it without reserve. Do you imitate me: know your own mind, and lay it calmly before me; one way or other the two shall be reconciled. To my <hi rend="italic">foolishness</hi> I seek no mercy from you, and will show none myself: but of my <hi rend="italic">good sense</hi> think that however repulsive it is to you, it may have been no less so to myself; and is now not to be cavilled at but patiently to be tried, and if found worthy, to be strengthened and completed by good sense of your own. Believe me, my Love, a wise advice from you, would be <hi rend="italic">more</hi> precious to me than as wise a plan which I had formed of myself. But to divide yourself from me, and sit apart from me as from a hostile influence! O Jane! if it is so, let me entreat you, pressingly implore you to let it be so no longer! When I look at it in my present mood, it seems as if no man could predict to what dire issues it might turn. Censure me, condemn me, say you will never love me more; but say this to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that I may feel as if we were only to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> parted, not as if we were parted already.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle omits the two sentences preceding.</note> For my sake, for your own, for the sake of true and wise conduct dear to both of us, I will ask you, I will beg you to write without one instant&#x2019;s delay from such a cause.</p>
<p>Perhaps, after all, this is only hypochondria, and some other reason restrains you: for in all the history of our affection, I can recollect no instance in which you have acted from such motives. Another theory I have formed is that you are sick, and cannot write to me. Alas! this is no whit better than the other. For God&#x2019;s sake let me know truly how it is! Write to me without delay if our common interests are still dear to you. On Thursday I expect to be <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> disengaged from employment. Nothing that you can calmly propose to me will not find a ready and wistful hearing.</p>
<closer><salute>I am forever and ever, / Your own, /</salute></closer>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>I am sick and confused in a thousand ways, and must write no more tonight, were it only that time fails me. O my Beloved you are <pb id="pg-04-85" n="04:85"/>forever dear to me, betide us what may! I could write volumes, and this as always would be the meaning of them. I beg of you again and again to send me one line, or even half a line, if you can write no more. It may be here on Wednesday: till then I will not ask for it, or look for it!</p>
<p>My maturest notion after all is that you are sick. God help us, and pity us! Send for me instantly, if my presence can possibly do you good. I still write <foreign><hi rend="italic">Esperance! Esperance!</hi></foreign> For I know in whom I have trusted. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Dearest! A thousand good-nights!</salute></closer></p></ps>

<dateline>Tuesday morning [<date when="1826-05-09">9 May 1826</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I could not possibly write yesterday as you desired, being ill of one of my very worst headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>s; even to day I am still far from well and consequently very stupid&#x2014;but no matter&#x2014;I must just come as I am for it would be unkind to keep you waiting another post. This, however, is the first bad turn I have had for several weeks, so let thy heart be comforted my best Beloved: it is not sickness that has kept me so long silent, no&#x2014;nor anger either. That your last letter vexed me I will not attempt to deny, but it was sorrow which I felt at it&#x2014;not anger&#x2014;and I could have taken you to my heart, while weeping over these hard sayings, just the same as if I had got all my own way&#x2014; The truth of the matter is simply this, in the state of hopeless uncertainty into which you and my Mother together had plunged me back from what seemed the very summit of waking bliss I felt myself utterly at a loss what I should either say or do next and so have been waiting on in a sort of desperate negligence, until you or she, or Providence perhaps, should pour some ray of light into the midnight darkness of my inward world&#x2014; This was very wrong I find&#x2014;forgive me for the uneasiness I have caused you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">ceased to love you!</hi> O thou of little faith!</p>
<p>And now most obdurate of Unbelievers will you sit down in good nature at your desk, and tell me plainly what on all this earth we are to do. Are we to be married or no; and if we are, where are we to take up house&#x2014;in Annandale or in Edin or where? <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> I have said I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not live, and said it not without reasonable grounds and slow deliberation&#x2014;but no other arrangement can you propose to me which <pb id="pg-04-86" n="04:86"/>I am not quite ready to acquiesce in&#x2014; My Mother&#x2019;s project I cheerfully give up, if you still think it so unsuitable to our circumstances; indeed I would not have so much as laid it before you had I not believed it certain to meet <hi rend="italic">your</hi> wishes and purposes&#x2014;for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or any other great city to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> has no attraction&#x2014;on the contrary I would prefer the country much before it, because <hi rend="italic">there</hi> I should have you more entirely to myself, and might live more entirely for the things I most love&#x2014; But I much doubt if the country be the fitter place for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; if the life of solitude and love which would be Heaven for me would not for you become too soon a weariness&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> do you determine</p>
<p>One thing I must entreat of you; if the thought of maintaining a wife begins to press more hard on you than you at first supposed it would hesitate not to tell me that we must live apart till a more auspicious season; but if not&#x2014;if you are still determined to make me your own at all haps and hazards&#x2014;for Heaven&#x2019;s sake Dearest speak not another word to me about your <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi>. every such word comes home to me with the force of a <hi rend="italic">reproach</hi>&#x2014;and truly this poverty is a circumstance of which I need not to be any more warned&#x2014;for I have long since looked it full in the face, and left it out in none of my calculations&#x2014; Even when I proposed our taking up house in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> it had by no means escaped my recollection that we should be very poor&#x2014; But I understood it my Mother&#x2019;s intention to <hi rend="italic">provide</hi> as well as furnish a house for us; and for the rest I imagined we might live as cheaply in the vicinity of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as in most other places&#x2014;more cheaply, for certain, than in Haddington&#x2014;where living is extraordinarily dear&#x2014; But my Mother&#x2019;s meaning is generally so light and changeful that it is not always possible to catch it and hold it fast&#x2014;and thus on the present occasion it has almost quite slipt thro&#x2019; my fingers&#x2014; One thing I am sure of&#x2014;she would rather give the furniture of this house to you and I than sell it to any other which must be done if we have no house to put it in&#x2014; Further than this we must not <hi rend="italic">lay our account</hi> with her assistance, tho it is more than probable that it will not fail us&#x2014; Why (you think) not make her speak plainly out, and say at once what it is she will do, so that we may shape our course accordingly<supplied>[?]</supplied> Alas Dearest in the delicate relation which I stand with my Mother such a proceeding natural in another would in me be an ungracious, ungenerous resumption of my rights&#x2014;would counteract in one instant all the pains I have taken for years to make her utterly forget her dependance on me&#x2014; Was ever poor girl in such <pb id="pg-04-87" n="04:87"/>an intricate situation&#x2014; Consider it my Friend and help me for I cannot help myself&#x2014;</p>
<p>We go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> the day after tomorrow to pay some tiresome visits&#x2014; Send your letter to John who will know where to find me which is more than I know at present myself&#x2014;We shall be absent a fortnight&#x2014;perhaps longer&#x2014; I should like well to see you face to face&#x2014;but I could have no right enjoyment of your society in Edin&#x2014;and I see not that your coming at present could effect any thing which may not be as well effected by writing&#x2014;</p>
<p>The bargain with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fyffe is still in the wind&#x2014;the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> like many other pitiable persons being very eager to have the merchandise but equally loth to give the price</p>
<p>You will hardly be able to make sense of what I have written&#x2014;but in Truth I am almost blind as well as stupid with headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>&#x2014;and so hurried besides&#x2014;for I have <supplied>[been]</supplied> several times interrupted&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you Darling</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest and truest of Believers,</salute>
<p>I owe you many thanks for your letter, which relieved me from a multitude of half imaginary distresses, and has again opened the way for a prosecution of this treaty of perpetual union between two of the most perverse contracting parties that the world ever saw. Let me beg of you whatever you do not to fall into any of your &#x201C;negligent desperations&#x201D; again: remember the maxim of philosophy <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi></foreign> [From nothing nothing comes]; for here it is not <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> but <hi rend="italic">something</hi>, and that a very good thing too, that will serve our turn.</p>
<p>If I was disappointed in any thing connected with your letter, it was that you did not forthwith order me into your presence; not to enjoy your society, but to take deepest counsel touching the state of our affairs, and to determine <foreign><hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi></foreign>, and once for all, about what was to be done. I had a week of perfect idleness; and my arrangements were all made for starting towards Haddington the moment <pb id="pg-04-88" n="04:88"/>your letter should arrive. Such a chance may not return for a long time: however, the present one is lost; and indeed your order at this time could not have recalled it; for I understand the German books, which I have waited for so long, to be lying for me this morning at the post-office of Ecclefechan; and a journey to the north in such a case would have been but a game at cross-purposes. It is better I am not gone. For eight weeks, I must labour like an hireling: if I have done even then I shall think it good work.</p>
<p>Yet I doubt greatly if we shall prosper by letters; there is something sadly ineffectual in epistolary correspondence for such a purpose. I come miserably ill at writing on this theme: it is a great and most frequently an abortive labour to express at once kindly and distinctly what I want. This rigorous formal statement of our own sovereign will and pleasure carries in it something so like selfishness, that we are apt to become selfish in our fear of being suspected of it. Would you believe it, I cannot <hi rend="italic">love</hi> you in a letter of that kind. No, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebchen</hi></foreign>, I do not love thee at all, when talking of houses and poverty and so forth; and I long to give the letter to the Devil, and take thee in my arms, and force thee by the very look of my eyes to say in that wicked heart of thine that thou wilt go with me to live in Greenland if I like. Alas! And I must take to this sorry work again! Well, let me trust it is the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time; for really having said this, I see not that I have any thing more to say. Attend to it, with an open and considerate mind.</p>
<p>I have not altered my calculations as to the expence of supporting a wife; nor has my wish to call my Dearest by that dear name any whit abated. I know as I before knew that wives are supported, some in peace and dignity, others in contention and disgrace, according to their wisdom or their folly, on all incomes from fourteen pounds a year to two hundred thousand: and I trusted in Jane Welsh and still trust in her for good sense enough to accommodate her wants to the means of the man she has chosen before all others, and to live with him contented on whatever it should please Providence to allot him, keeping within their revenue, not struggling to get without it, and therefore <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>, by whatever arithmetical symbol, whether tens, hundreds or thousands, that same revenue might be expressed. This is not impossible or even very difficult, provided the will be truly there. Say what we like, it is in general our stupidity that makes us straitened and contemptible. The sum of money is a very secondary matter. One of the happiest most praise-worthy and really most enviable families on the Earth at present lives within two bowshots of me, that of <pb id="pg-04-89" n="04:89"/>Wightman the Hedger, on the produce of fifteen pence <foreign><hi rend="italic">per diem</hi></foreign>, which the man earns peacefully with his mattock and his bill, not counting himself any philosopher for so doing. Their cottage on our Hill is tidy as a cabinet; they have a black-eyed boy whom few squires can parallel; their <foreign><hi rend="italic">girnel</hi></foreign> [grain bin] is always full of meal; the man is a true honest most wisely conditioned man, an elder of the Congregation, and meekly but firmly persuaded that he shall go to Heaven when his hedging here below is done. &#x201C;What want these knaves that a king should have?&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</hi>, 5th ed. (Edinburgh, <date when="1821">1821</date>), I, 127, where James V, on beholding Johnnie Armstrong of Gilnockie, a celebrated outlaw, in splendid equipage, exclaims: &#x201C;What wants that knave that a king suld have, but the sword of honour and the crown?&#x201D;</note> It is not miscalculation of expences, then, that frightens me; the perplexity arises from other misunderstandings.</p>
<p>I mentioned with due solemnity to my Father and Mother the mighty event that was hanging in the wind; and received from them, what I had anticipated, an affectionate assent to our purpose; but at the same time a foreboding from both that at Scotsbrig even in summer it would be difficult for you to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, in winter altogether impossible. This winter part of it I had myself calculated on; but the means of obviating the inconvenience, taking a furnished house in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at the beginning of the season, I saw too well was not to be depended on, with my present knowledge of the matter, resulting solely from a casual phrase of Dr Brewster&#x2019;s, and incapable in my present circumstances of being cleared up by investigation on the spot. At the same time it was too clear that you totally misconceived the condition of Scotsbrig and our only possible manner of existence there. You talked of your Mother visiting us! By Day and Night! it would astonish her to see this same household. O No, my Darling! Your mother must not visit mine. What good were it? By an utmost exertion on the part of both, they might learn perhaps to tolerate each other, more probably to pity and partially dislike each other; better than mutual tolerance I could anticipate nothing from them, and is there not the fullest tolerance existing between them already without effort? The mere idea of such a visit argued too plainly that you knew <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of the family circle in which for my sake you were ready to take a place.</p>
<p>What then was to be done? Instantly the vacant house at Haddington occured to my recollection like a sort of God-send expressly suited for our purpose. It seemed so easy, and on other accounts so indispensable, to let it stand undisposed of for another year, that I doubted not one moment but the whole matter was arranged. If it turned out, <pb id="pg-04-90" n="04:90"/>which I reckoned to be impossible if you were not distracted in mind, that you really liked better to front the plashes and puddles and thousand inclemencies of Scotsbrig thro&#x2019; winter than live another six months in the house where you had lived all your days, it was the simplest process imaginable to stay where we were: the loss was but of a few months&#x2019; rent for your mother&#x2019;s house, and the certainty it gave us made it great gain. Even yet I cannot with the whole force of my vast intellect understand how my project has failed. Have I miscalculated my importance to you, Jane? No, I swear I have not: and I will bet you ten to one that if you seriously ask your heart, it will tell you that to get possession of me your elected and predestined husband is really a far better thing than to get quit of Haddington. Is it not, now? I wish not to undervalue your objections to this place, or your opinion on any subject whatever: but I may confess my inability, with my present knowledge, to reconcile this very peremptory distaste with your usual good sense and your deep entire and most precious love of me. I cannot with my utmost imagining discover any rock of offence in Haddington, which I have not to front here, which persons intent on living wisely will and must have to front everywhere, and will everywhere also contrive with no great pains to remove out of their way. Impertinent visitors! Let us not name it again, my Love; for in the circle of difficulties and duties into which you will soon be introduced, this difficulty will vanish like thin smoke in the tempest of the elements. They are gross and low-minded, the people? Here they are fifty times grosser and lower-minded; connected with me too by bonds of kindness, some of them by bonds of relationship; yet I contrive without a struggle to manage them, and none seeks me of whom I do not wish to be sought.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence is omitted in A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>.</note></p>
<p>But after all there must be something in the matter which I do not see. Your Mother and you are no unwise or uncalculating persons: and that you should both wilfully strip yourselves of a home, and stand in a few weeks houseless in the world, merely for certain dislikes of place and so forth, which among the actual ruggednesses of life one very speedily learns the necessity of disregarding, seems to me entirely inconceivable. I say there must be something in it which I do not see.</p>
<p>Let me beg of you therefore to reconsider the business, and after weighing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Haddington for six months longer</hi>, to say whether the acquisition of the one or the freedom from the other will be more precious to you. Decide for your own happiness; and believe me, Darling, <pb id="pg-04-91" n="04:91"/>I will acquiesce quietly in the result whatever it may be. But I must repeat that without this house or some equivalent of the same sort, I have yet no plan for our marriage. Scotsbrig (of which by the way our obtaining at all was dubious when I wrote last, and only became certain two days ago) is unknown to you; but I know it and the nature of life there; and it becomes me to say in both our names that there we cannot live for any length of time with either comfort or wisdom. If the house were to be our own, tile-kiln as it is, I should let you venture on it; but even this is not the case; for I am not head there, so much as partner, first-partner but no absolute ruler.</p>
<p>When I speak of Haddington and living there, you must not suspect me of love for that obnoxious burgh. Except one fair denizen of it, I know nothing which it ever produced that I would give three cherry-stones for. God knows I <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>like the place and that very heartily; for I have never been in it but the highest feelings of my mind have been thwarted and embittered by the most paltry contradictions till my very happiness became a misery.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This sentence is also omitted by A. Carlyle.</note> But what then, the poor place is not to be blamed for this: God&#x2019;s fair sky stretches over it, his winds visit it, and his waters refresh it, like other places; and it offers an asylum to my loved one and me, for which I should be grateful to Neva Zembla or Cayenne. Propose me a substitute of the same conveniency elsewhere, and I shall cheerfully engage never to set foot in Haddington any more. A house in Edinburgh on the same principles I should like infinitely better: but not having it, and having the other, I should be a fool, it seems to me, if I determined otherwise.</p>
<p>Can you not procure for us such a house in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? Can you not revise your judgement with regard to Haddington? Can you devise no equivalent for it in any part of our resources? Then alas! we must just wait till these our resources increase, or we have learned to be contented with their indeed very scanty product. Really, my Love, this does seem so true and plain, that I cannot but feel as if in talking to you one quarter of an hour on the subject I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> bring you altogether over to my own opinion. I have never found you walk by whims and crotchets, but by your best perception, which you were always eager to have strengthened and enlightened, of what was true and adviseable. Yet believe not that I wish to controul your will: I would not plead in this matter; but rather have you to enter upon it with your own entire conviction, seeing it is still a matter of conjecture to <pb id="pg-04-92" n="04:92"/>us both, and certainly the most important we can well have to decide on.</p>
<p>You talk with doubt and hesitation about &#x201C;assistance&#x201D; from your Mother. Indeed, indeed, my Dearest, we do nowise require assistance from her. Providence (glory to his name!) has made me sufficient for myself; and if I pray to him, it is not for more money, but for more wisdom, with which even less money would be sufficient. As it is, I have little disposition to solicit or expect assistance from any mortal, and I believe just as little need as disposition. By the cunning of my own right hand, I can earn for myself and those that like to depend on me sufficient food and raiment: I ride my own serviceable courser along his Majesty&#x2019;s highways, as free a subject as wears them; owing no man any thing but love; hating no one, fearing no one; and not so stinted even that on occasion I cannot part my morsel with a &#x201C;needier fellow man,&#x201D; and cause the heart of the poor to bless me. There are many Squires and Dukes in this world that cannot say so much. Now if your Mother see good to express the generous affections of her heart towards her daughter and her daughter&#x2019;s husband by gifts of money and the like, it shall be well; and far be it from me, by any pitiful vanity, to refuse such bounties, or the payment of them by feelings correspondent to the feelings of which these beneficences are the symbol. But if she shall not see good so to express the generous affections of her heart, believe me, it shall also be well: I will think merely that she has found other more desirable investments; and without pretending to the smallest right of criticism over her conduct shall remember, as I have often endeavoured to do, that she is the Mother, and all things considered, the praiseworthy mother of my own fair philosopher, whose heart if she will but be true and wise is worth more to me than all the ingots of El Dorado. Therefore, <foreign>Liebchen</foreign>, if you would not put my &#x201C;magnanimity&#x201D; to the test, let me think that you consider me indifferent as nearly as may be, so far as I myself am concerned, to any pecuniary determination on the part of any man or woman. Oh! there are a thousand things in such a life as this, which notwithstanding all you say of <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi>, you yet understand only in word; but you will yet know them all both sweet and bitter; the bitter I cannot ward from you; and the sweet I will teach you, for you are a teachable spirit, and <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> but choose wisdom in place of folly when the two are laid down before you. But let us beware of cant, and so drop this head of method!</p>
<p>As I said, I request, desire or expect nothing from your Mother <pb id="pg-04-93" n="04:93"/>but the loan of this house for one year: if she will not give it, or you will not have it, and can find no means of supplying its place, what remains but that each content him where he is, in expectation of better times? I live in Scotsbrig among the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">selvages</hi></foreign> [savages],&#x201D; whose wild nature shall not divert me from my better purposes: you and your mother in&#x2014;simply <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in Haddington, it appears; for of all the rest I am utterly ignorant, utterly unable to form any plausible theory.</p>
<p>&#x201C;What <foreign>tig-tagging</foreign> [being busy about nothing]&#x201D; my Mother says, &#x201C;and a comes to <foreign><hi rend="italic">ae</hi> sheal</foreign> [shed]-door at last!&#x201D; Heaven grant it were safely arrived there! At this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> door!&#x2014; For the present I can do no more to help it forward, but must off for my books, and into the free air. So with a true warm kiss which I send you over the hills, and one soft pressure of your bosom to mine, I bid my own Jane goodnight for the present. I will throw you a word on monday.</p>

<p><date when="1826-05-16"><hi rend="italic">Tuesday Afternoon</hi> [16 May]</date></p>
<p><salute>Dearest&#x2014;</salute> I found not only a load of Books on Saturday, but <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> proof sheets besides; the consideration and alteration of which, attended with other sorry enough drawbacks, has kept me occupied to the present hour. Henceforth nothing but fireman haste awaits me, for week after week! My spare hours filled with critical meditations, and ever and anon the thought of this solemn treaty intervening!</p>
<p>I have read over this letter: there is nothing that I can add to it; or rather I could go on adding to it forever. The sum of the matter lies here, however: do you consider it, and determine; for with you the determination rests; you behold the extent of my present means, and if these cannot suffice us, I can do nothing m<supplied>[ore.]</supplied> Above all, let us not forget this is an engagement for Eternal Union, not a paction, as it were between foes, for an Armed Neutrality! Our hearts are one, so are our interests if we understood them. I pray fervently that the affair were over, and all settled and transacted one way or another; that so these cursed statements and restatements might be forever concluded.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last three sentences are omitted by A. Carlyle.</note> My whole mind in one word is this: I think it were better for us both if we were wedded; Haddington I dislike very cordially as a place, but would live there, happily I doubt not, along with you; Edinburgh I should greatly prefer on all accounts, but see not and know not how or whether so convenient a footing in it is to be obtained. For the rest, I am not shepherd enough to calculate on Love <pb id="pg-04-94" n="04:94"/>as the chief employment of life be where I may: if regular labour and diligent pursuit of duty do not make me happy, I shall be unhappy in Heaven itself. Do you consider all these things, Dearest; and if your own mind cannot assent to them, and you can think of nothing else in their stead, let us forget the whole negociation, and live in peace and hope together as we did before. But I hope better things, tho I thus speak.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Here again, A. Carlyle omits the last three sentences. &#x201C;But I hope better things, tho I thus speak,&#x201D; was a &#x201C;common preachers&#x2019; phrase in Scotland&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 113).</note></p>
<p>It will be necessary to submit this matter to your mother; but for the mode of doing it, I confess myself unable to give you any good advice. <hi rend="italic">Plain-dealing</hi>, except when there is <hi rend="italic">evil-meaning</hi>, seldom does harm: I recommend it in all such cases; and between a mother and a daughter, it is certainly doubly and trebly recommendable. Be you just and rational; and let your Mother see that you are so; and furthermore that it is for her love not her money that you are anxious; being, as it behoves you to be after what has come and gone, <hi rend="italic">independent</hi> of her help in a pecuniary point of view, and this not in words only but in very deed, by readiness to take up with the humbler resource, rather than solicit her for the higher. I beg of you to be calm and discreet in your consideration and your management of this concern; and I pray God to lead it to a happy end. You will write <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. <closer><salute>I am forever your own,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am going to send you as short a letter as your own; a thing perhaps less excuseable in me, seeing there are so many topics here, on which you desire information. As usual, business is the reason. When I have told you that we are all well, I have exhausted the chief substance of my commission.</p>
<p>As thou sayest, Jack, it is a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> cursed thing that one cannot get lived without Litigation. This time however, we have gained the day. Geordie has been decreted against, interlocutored, interdicted, and I know not what all, since I wrote; our men were just a week off at Scotsbrig; and three days ago, they had the gratifying tidings that a <pb id="pg-04-95" n="04:95"/>Precept of Removal had gone forth from His Majesty&#x2019;s Sheriff Depute against the said George Irving, <foreign>Hallanshaker</foreign> [ragged tramp] in Scotsbrig; decerning in substance that Geordie was to pay all and sundry damages and costs, and to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded</hi></foreign> [driven] out of doors by the kings constables (Corn Ball and <foreign>knell-kned</foreign> [knock-kneed] Davie) directly after twelve of the clock on whitsunday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1826-05-26">26 May</date>.</note> in case he had not volutarily <foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded</hi></foreign> himself out some time therebefore. So I believe this thing is terminated. For the rest, all hands are busy at Scotsbrig; and tho&#x2019; somewhat behind, not quite out of sight of their goal. They commence potato-planting tomorrow. Here then, Jack, is lodging for us yet, let hard come to hard. So be of good cheer!</p>
<p>Do you expect the Baron<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron d&#x2019;Eichthal.</note> back? He is gone I know not whither, for the name of his destination was irretrievably torn out by the wafer.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The wax seal.</note> On the whole, I think no solid good will come of him; but you can <hi rend="italic">see him out</hi>; and after all I shall not be sorry, if this prove the issue. Fear nothing, Jack! I durst <foreign><hi rend="italic">bate ta</hi></foreign> [bet you] a hundred guineas thou wilt be a man of stamp and substance yet, before all is over. This is no vain talk, but true persuasion. Let us be thankful for it.</p>
<p>Is the Examination coming on? And does no palpitation at the heart seize thee?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written in his short letter dated &#x201C;Thursday night&#x201D; [<date when="1826-05-11">11? May</date>]: &#x201C;I have given in my <hi rend="italic">thesis</hi> and expect my examination about the <date when="1826-05">end of May</date>. I thought it considerably superior to the common run, and it was something to have accomplished the task of writing it without any assistance.&#x201D;</note> Is the Botany begun? How does Broughton-street do? It will be noisy, I think but otherwise far preferable to the last quarters. I am nearly sure thy money must be verging to inanity: I have never been down at Annan yet; but thou shalt have <foreign><hi rend="italic">fi&#x2019;pun</hi></foreign> [a &#xa3;5 note] with the Targer to keep the sluices open; and write by the post, if thou want any sooner. The Targer expects to come in a week.</p>
<p>Make Murray get thee a ticket; and do thou go and hear the General Assembly. Tell Murray that I shall make farther inquiries about Stewart Lewis&#x2019; poems,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Thomas [<date when="1826-05-11">11? May</date>], John had said that Thomas Murray was eager to get a copy of Stewart Lewis&#x2019; poems in the <date when="1816">1816</date> edition, which Murray believed might be more easily procurable in Ecclefechan than in Edinburgh. Stewart Lewis (<date when="1756">1756</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1818">1818</date>) had been born in Ecclefechan and had settled in Manchester as a clothier. After a spell as a soldier, he died in poverty, having visited Carlyle in Kirkcaldy just before his death. His version of &#x201C;Fair Helen&#x201D; (Edinburgh, <date when="1796">1796</date>) ran through several editions.</note> but I doubt somewhat if they are attainable <pb id="pg-04-96" n="04:96"/>here. His son was at Mainhill, the other day; contented, ragged, talkative, didactic as ever: he had got an old &#x201C;Fair Helen&#x201D; about Bathgate; which he said money would not make him part with; seeing it was all of &#x201C;Stooart Loous&#x201D; that he had.</p>
<p>Waugh is supposed to be living at the King&#x2019;s Arms Dumfries; generally reputed by the natives of that burgh a gentlemen troubled in mind. God help him&#x2014;and us too; for we have all foolishness enough and to spare, in us.</p>
<p>These Books are sent as accurately as if I had been standing on the other side of Fleischer&#x2019;s counter, when he packed them up. I hope Julius<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Julius, of Hamburg.</note> will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> send his: it was to Tait they were directed. In two weeks or so, I shall have some copy ready. Most of the works will do very well, I think; only <hi rend="italic">Maler M&#xfc;ller</hi> I dread somewhat, and yet I cannot want him. I intend to begin with Richter. By the way, can you by any means discover for me the day when he died?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He died of dropsy, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date>.</note> It will surely be in the monthly lists of any Magazine; about <date when="1825-10">October</date> or so. Communicate with Tait. Also, will you look for me in the Conversationslexicon, what a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quintus</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260718-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1826-07-18">18 July</date></ref>.</note> (fifth?) is? It is some degree in German pedagogy I believe: but what? Find out for me if you can.</p>
<p>I am neither better nor worse in health, and I expect little change till this Book be done. Our Mother is in despair at your want of accommodation; this very day, by the road to Waterbeck, where she is at present with Mag, buying gowns, she determined to make the most rigorous inquest after carriers, and get things ready for the very first chance. She is not at Mainhill or within the reach of these things, or she would have sent you a box had it gone by the Mail.&#x2014; Those Books on Saturday were just 2/8; 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> dearer than a feather would be!&#x2014; Expect a box soon.</p>
<p>Johnston<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. G. Johnston was inducted to the Burgher Seceder parish of Ecclefechan between <date when="1825-12">Dec. 1825</date> and <date when="1826-01">Jan. 1826</date>. He may have been the son of the elderly minister Johnstone who had taught Carlyle Latin around <date when="1808">1808</date>.</note> the minister is <hi rend="italic">placed</hi>, and settled beside Saunders the ancient clock-work mercantile gentleman in the Manse. I call him clockwork, because few clocks are so regular; he rises, sleeps, eats and evacuates, it would seem, in a way that it is difficult for others to conform to. Johnston seems tired of him: Johnston however is a goodnatured ma<supplied>[n]</supplied>. He was here last night with a whole host of retainers: they drank weak tea, and talked, the Targer and I being chief speakers. <pb id="pg-04-97" n="04:97"/>The youth is a well-conditioned youth; modest and cheerful; but as yet of little culture or parts. Wull of Howcleugh says he preaches &#x201C;bom<hi rend="italic">bast</hi>&#x201D;: as to this I can bear no testimony. Taylor is growing more and more drunken.</p>
<p>But alas Jack the hour of tea is come, and I must go and set the &#x201C;<foreign>kittle a&#x2019; b<hi rend="italic">a</hi>iling mum</foreign>&#x201D;; after which I shall drink your health in Chinese essence and then conclude. <closer><salute>For the present good b&#x2019;ye!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have held myself <foreign><hi rend="italic">accincta ad scribendum</hi></foreign> [fully prepared to write] for three or four days back but there is so much ado about nothing in this idle city that till now I could find no opportunity to put my purpose in execution&#x2014; And even now I am so hurried so distracted a thousand ways!

For you must know I had no sooner succeeded in fulfilling your wishes to the utmost of my power, than a new apprehension arose in my mind. may he not think I have done too much? and that I am less worth having for thus almost pressing myself upon him? Alas Men are such capricious creatures at best; there is no calculating how this one may be affected by the officiousness of my love! But I took heart again when I could not discover in the little note any falling off in kindness, so that I now feel less anxiety about telling you, the last objection to our marriage is removed.</p>
<p>It is indeed&#x2014;my Mother has taken a house<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At 21 Comely Bank, in the southwest suburbs of Edinburgh.</note> for us&#x2014;such a one as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall be quite content to live in, and I doubt not but that you will be so also. For it is quiet and light and dry; there <supplied>[is]</supplied> a pretty tree before the door, and the windows look out on green fields; while at <pb id="pg-04-98" n="04:98"/>the same time it is as humble and plain a looking dwelling as any heart could desire&#x2014; In addition to these advantages the Landlord is a very worthy man whom my Mother and I are personally acquainted with, so that in as far as we have to do with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> all things are likely to go fair and smooth&#x2014; Whenever the said house is painted, my Mother will get it put into some sort of habitable order, and then&#x2014;it is for you to arrange the rest&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now&#x2014;now that my long cherished hopes are so near their fulfillment, one would naturally expect that I should be all thankfulness and joy&#x2014; But no such thing! I was never flatter in my life&#x2014; The truth is, sundry disgusts and crosses<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A.

In these circumstances, the only way of raising means was to sell the house at Haddington. Dr. Fyffe was ready to purchase it and to pay a cash instalment, provided he could get possession at once.

<salute>Dearest <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weibchen</hi></foreign>,</salute>
<p>I have not half an instant to myself at present; but I will send you this little scrap of paper to bless you in my name, to kiss you twenty times over, and to tell you (what you never knew till this moment) that I love you very much.</p>
<p>So it is to be, after all! God grant that it may, and well and happily for you; then I shall not fail to be happy! I view the whole matter with a sort of solemn hope, which I dare not trust myself with indulging, so different does it seem from aught that Life has ever yet done for me. O Jane! My own only Jane!&#x2014; But I will tell you all when we are <hi rend="italic">one</hi> forever and ever.</p>
<p>As to this house, if we get it, remember only that for my taste it cannot be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> humble and plain and home-looking, in itself and all its appurtenances. Your Mother surely deserves the love of her children, after all that is come and gone.</p>
<p>You will write to me from your inmost heart, and tell me simply <pb id="pg-04-101" n="04:101"/>every thing. <closer><salute>Farewell my <foreign><hi rend="italic">ewig Liebste</hi></foreign> [dearest love forever], my own little wife!</salute></closer></p>

<name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>In post-haste, hurrying to catch the mail with my <foreign><hi rend="italic">schreiberegen</hi></foreign> [scribbling].&#x2014; Write also the noble lady; I had a letter from her the other day; in which she compares you to an <hi rend="italic">Aurora Borealis</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written Carlyle on <date when="1826-05-13">13 May</date>: &#x201C;The Lady of Haddington, has been for the first time since she was born, to me, <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, tho&#x2019; I conjured her by a stronger spell than was ever compacted under the pale moon by witch or wizard:&#x2014; I trust this does not arise from sickness or sorrow or any thing that can take off the edge from that fine spirit, which charms me in her, linked as it is to much of the softness and tenderness of a woman.&#x2014; This is a working-day world full of painful realities, which one would as gladly forget, as the little school-boy, that at the rear of the joyous Holiday, stands the old tenement where &#x2018;reading is made&#x2019; any thing but &#x2018;easy,&#x2019; and where the sunny hours of his life must pass heavily, tho&#x2019; butterflies and ripe cherries are abroad for the liberty-boys that may find them!&#x2014; My fair friend, is like a pleasant dream to me, and she keeps up the illusion by being a little visionary herself.&#x2014; She is like the Northern lights I used to see when a child, like them she seems to my fancy brilliant and beautiful, and like them she sometimes makes me afraid.&#x2014;&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
She also tells Carlyle: &#x201C;I wish much to see your work&#x2014;it is advertised and promised in every sort of publication but it comes not any more than warm weather.&#x201D; She adds comments on others: &#x201C;We think Woodstock a failure&#x2014;Walter Scott&#x2019;s Muse is a Scottish Muse, and will not speak English.&#x201D; Badams, she says, instead of visiting Carlyle in Scotland has gone to Wales &#x201C;on a mercantile journey.&#x201D; Badams is too ambitious to be as wise as Carlyle, who is now establishing a home for himself. Her son Charles Montagu, always a mixed case, is still with Dr. Duncan at Ruthwell. &#x201C;I have never retracted,&#x201D; she insists, &#x201C;from my opinion, since I had the first glance at your face that he is in disposition very like yourself. &#x2026; He obeys as an Englishman always obeys, in a way of his own.&#x201D; &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving is a mere shadow, he will soon be nothing but a voice:&#x2014;he is more fervent more zealous, more mystical and more prophetical every day:&#x2014;he is always kind and excellent, and such as he is, is more to be loved than wiser and better men. &#x2026; We see less and less of him but we do not value him the less.&#x201D; She is very gloomy about her own health and condition in life.</note> What think you of that! Now kiss me, and send me away.&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebstes</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Most beloved</hi>]&#x2014;</salute> I must not let this day pass without sending you a word, else you may have to wait another week, and the next vacant day may find me as unready as the present. This parched Lybian wind blowing thro&#x2019; my crazy apartment where I sleep and <pb id="pg-04-102" n="04:102"/>write (the carpenters are all dozing) has given me a cold and sore throat; and the printers of the Ballantyne office leave me no rest night or day. To write sense is out of the question; so for this time, you must be content with a line or two of nonsense.</p>
<p>How many thousand thoughts might your last letter give rise to! We <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, it seems, to begin this wonderful married life; a scene so strange to both of us, so full of hazards, and it may be of highest happiness! May the Fates award the latter; as they will, if we deserve it. I could write and say volumes on the subject, for to me it seems great and momentous (in our little destiny) and requiring deepest thought from both of us. But why should I? We shall <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> it all over shortly, in its whole breadth and length; when I am free of this Egyptian bondage for a week or two, and able to think of something else than Novels and Novellists with their long <hi rend="italic">etcetera</hi> of stupid consequences. All I say is: Fear nothing; I will see you in a few weeks (perhaps in six) and arrange the whole matter; and then&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">das Weitere wird sich geben</hi></foreign> [the rest will follow in due course], and we shall be wedded and happy, come of it what may.</p>
<p>I have called my task an Egyptian bondage; but that was a splenetic word, and came not from the heart but from the sore throat; for I have not been so happy for many a year, as since I began this undertaking on my own strength and in my own home: and is it not to have a <hi rend="italic">termination</hi> which scarcely an Epic Poem could deserve? O my little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weibchen</hi></foreign>! The next Book I write, <hi rend="italic">another</hi> shall help me to correct and arrange! And my fairest recompense will be the glad look of two kind black eyes, thro&#x2019; which a soul is looking that belongs to my soul for ever and ever! Let us not despond in the life of honourable toil which lies before us. Do you not think, that when you on one side of our household shall have faithfully gone thro your housewife duties, and I on the other shall have written my allotted pages, we shall meet over our frugal meal with far happier and prouder hearts than thousands that are not blessed with any duties, and whose agony is the bitterest of all, &#x201C;the agony of a too easy bed&#x201D;?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle quotes Pope&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dunciad</hi>, IV, 342&#x2013;44: &#x201C;Stretched on the rack of a too easy chair, / And heard thy everlasting yawn confess / The pains and penalties of idleness.&#x201D;</note> In labour lies health, of body and of mind; in suffering and difficulty is the soil of all virtue and all wisdom. By and by, when we have put our house in order, and our hearts in order, and come to understand one another as indivisible portions of the same whole, I predict that we shall be the finest <pb id="pg-04-103" n="04:103"/>little pair imaginable! A true-hearted dainty lady-wife; a sick and sulky, but diligent, and not false-hearted or fundamentally unkind goodman: and these two fronting the hardships of life in faithful and eternal union, conquering the evils of their lot by wise effort and perseverance, and every conquest not for <hi rend="italic">self</hi> but for <hi rend="italic">another self</hi> far dearer! Let us but be true and good, and we have nothing earthly to dread.</p>
<p>As to the <hi rend="italic">wedding</hi>, I agree with you in heartily recoiling from it. Pity indeed that we could not both fall asleep, and awaken married in each others arms! It would be infinitely finer and far less trouble. Nevertheless the Fairies will not do this for us: we must be wedded with our eyes open, by some flesh-and-blood minister of the Church of Scotland, and join hands &#x201C;before many witnesses,&#x201D; and whisk away in post-chaises, and in short suffer a short [sort] of Purgatory, before we can expect to arrive in Heaven. We shall get thro&#x2019; it all, however, I doubt not: and then the Heaven is awaiting us, more sweet from the transition.</p>
<p>At the present moment I am wonderfully in the dark about arrangements and possibilities of arrangement. Here in my eremite seclusion, I know nothing, and hear nothing; and the whole world into which I am so soon to enter is lying before me, like a far off cloudy vision. Will you write to me at length and leisure, and tell me all that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know about it. <hi rend="italic">Where</hi> is this house? In Edinburgh or out of it? What is it like? Among other houses, or apart from them? When is it to be ready? When does Fyffe take possession? And a thousand other whens and hows&#x2014;which after all, I shall never learn to any purpose till I see you face to face.</p>
<p>Tell me at any rate what you are doing at present? How spending your time. Learning from your Mother the elements of housewifery? I think she should make you <hi rend="italic">mistress</hi> for a month; under such superintendance, I could become a very moderate housewife in a month myself. I could bet considerable sums that you never think of <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at present&#x2014;except by accident.</p>
<p>After all, this Edinburgh arrangement is much better than any other could have been. A <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> character is wonderfully out of place in rustic society. Here in Annandale, for instance, I have simply <hi rend="italic">no</hi> association with fellow creatures at all, except within the threshold of my own habitation. I speak to the honest rustics out of doors: I even talk to them, for half-hours when I cannot help it; and they think, I am a <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> or it may be a <hi rend="italic">very decent sensible</hi> young man; but alas! <pb id="pg-04-104" n="04:104"/>alas! the heart sits solitary in its own lone chamber, and no voice addresses it, no ear hears it. Some days I grow very dreamy, sometimes rather sad. This morning, while buckling my stock, I recollected purchasing it in the <hi rend="italic">Snarrgate</hi> of Dover: then came the cliffs of that ancient sea-haven, and Paris, and London and the forges of Brummagem,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Birmingham.</note> all mustering before me like visions of some sp<supplied>[ect]</supplied>ral country, overcast with the paleness of Separation, and lovelier than they were to the bodily eye!&#x2014; I went down, and had some warm tea, the best Christian com<hi rend="italic">fort</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech based on a association with old Mrs. Jean Carruthers of Haregills, a cousin of Carlyle&#x2019;s mother, who, according to Carlyle, &#x201C;spoke like no one else, in a wild low chaunt or <hi rend="italic">lilt</hi>&#x201D; and spoke of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">coomfoart</hi></foreign>,&#x201D; with the <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> pronounced and the accent on the last syllable. See Carlyle&#x2019;s Hogarthian portrait of her in A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>, I, 22 n.</note> within my reach.</p>
<p>I am babbling very sadly: but I must not close my letter without telling you something more precise respecting the <hi rend="italic">great event</hi>. I come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and to you, when once this Book is done. I am about fifth way gone in the last volume; the printers are nearly done with the preceding one. It is very full of small cares, the process of manufacturing it; but I go along contentedly: for I reckon it tho&#x2019; a poor enough affair, yet an innocent even a laudable one; and considerably the best sample of German genius that has yet been presented to the English. And who can blame me for a little satisfaction in the thought, that even I, poor I, here in the wolds of Annandale, am doing somewhat to instruct the thinkers of my own Country to do justice to those of another?&#x2014; Well, I calculate that this Book if I am diligent which I have cause enough to be will be over in about five or six weeks. I come to Edinburgh then, to devise some other enterprise, to see you, and settle with you once for all the preliminaries and paraphernalia of this our magnificent Enterprise! Till then I despair of thinking any reasonable thought about this or any other matter: what with &#x201C;estimates of genius,&#x201D; what with estimates of housekeeping, and dreams of a wicked little gypsy that haunts me, and solemn hopes and fears, and magnificent and unfathomable anticipations,&#x2014;I declare my head is entirely overset, and has for the time being given up the reins of management into other hands&#x2014;those of Habit, I suppose, and Imagination.</p>
<p>You however have time, and will write and think for us both. Write at any rate, whether you can think or not. Never mind your <foreign><hi rend="italic">D&#xE9;shabille</hi></foreign>. By the Blessing of Heaven, I hope to see you in many other <foreign><hi rend="italic">deshabilles</hi></foreign> yet, before all is done. Our poor stock of Letters is now <pb id="pg-04-105" n="04:105"/>drawing to a close: soon, I shall send you news by readier conveyances; in place of scolding me, you shall scratch me; in place of praising me, you shall kiss me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es werden gl&#xfc;ckliche Zeiten seyn</hi></foreign> [Happy times are coming]!&#x2014; My Mother turned back the other night on her road to Mainhill, for the purpose of charging me to send you &#x201C;her best love,&#x201D; and &#x201C;put it into words myself.&#x201D; It cannot be in better words, for it comes from a true unpretending heart. You must also write to her, as soon as possible: she has asked me twenty times, if there was no word of a letter for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>? I promised that there would be one in good time. Do all this, and love me with your whole heart, and be a good girl and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> forever.</p>
<closer><salute>I am always your own /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I should have thanked your Mother for her splendid <hi rend="italic">Cowper</hi>; a fair gift, and fairer for the meaning it carries. I have been getting <hi rend="italic">deeply</hi> in her debt of late. Say all that is grateful and affectionate to her, in my name.&#x2014; Have you written to the Noble Lady? If not I wish you would; and say in due time, she shall hear of me too.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I fear I must have seemed very ungrateful; for it is too true that your most friendly and acceptable letter has never yet been answered, tho&#x2019; if I mistake not I had even in words engaged to repay that act of kindness without delay.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton provides this helpful note: &#x201C;The following letter is in reply to a friendly and cordial letter from Murray [actually two letters, <date when="1826-03-17">17 March</date> and <date when="1826-06-16">16 June</date>] proposing to Carlyle to endeavour to secure the control and editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi>, and offering to assist him with &#x2018;a hundred pounds or so&#x2019; toward the purchase.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Constable, whose disastrous failure at the beginning of this year had brought ruin to Sir Walter Scott, had been the publisher of this venerable Magazine, which had now existed for ninety years, and his creditors had resolved to give it up, as it scarcely did more than pay for itself.&#x201D; Murray urged Carlyle to give serious thought to his proposal: &#x201C;A M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Donald, the present editor, had done all he can to prevail on them to continue it,&#x2014;and he still flatters himself that either C&#x2019;s people or some other person will have mercy on the Veteran Journal&#x2014;and enable it to complete the Century, which it would do in <date when="1836">1836</date>,&#x2014;as it commenced in <date when="1736">1736</date>. &#x2026; I feel <hi rend="italic">convinced</hi> that if you would undertake some such thing, you would succeed in an unprecedented degree, and among other good results that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> accompany it, it would contribute essentially to improve your health &#x26; consequently your happiness, by keeping your mind &#x26; hands engaged &#x26; affording you an object in existence.&#x201D; Nothing came of the proposal.</note> You may believe me, want of will was not <pb id="pg-04-106" n="04:106"/>the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> cause. I feel as well as any one how good and helpful you are; nor is it among the least pleasing of my reflections to think that I still hold a place in your regards; that the friend of my boyhood (how rarely can this be told!) is still the friend of my riper years.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is I have been unusually busy of late months; not so busy indeed that I had not vacant minutes and even hours; but still so jostled to and fro by my avocations and immersed in the cares of them, as to be peculiarly <hi rend="italic">inept</hi> for letter-writing, which accordingly (if this is any palliation) except in the most pressing cases, I have altogether forborne. I calculated on writing to you when this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> was done: but a new act of your attention forces me to take the pen sooner, if it were but to thank you for your readiness and eagerness at all times, as at this time, to do me service.</p>
<p>As to the practical part of the Speculation, I am wonderfully in the dark and the distance: the business of magazine-writing and the profits and disprofits of magazine-conducting are utterly alien to my thoughts and still more to my experience; and your project, here in my rustic solitude, stands dim vague and unseizable before me, think of it as I may. One thing I know well: some <hi rend="italic">periodical task</hi> would be peculiarly useful to me in all points of view. Another thing I am not half so sure of, but yet in a case of extremity it might be assumed as possible: That the duties of periodical Editorship, as they are discharged to various degrees of perfection, by many mere mortals in these Islands, might also be by dint of great effort, discharged by me, inexperienced in the world, unconnected with it, and in many other respects very unfit for such an undertaking as I cannot but feel myself to be. With these two propositions, however, I may say that my convictions on this individual matter are at an end; and what steps, if any, to take in it is by no means clear to me. The purchase of the copy-right,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Murray had said that eight hundred subscribers would come with this.</note> which you suggest, and with a true spirit, which I hope I shall not forget, offer to assist in, is a thing I must not think of. I have laid out nearly all my disposeable capital here in the purchase of farm and house ware; and to strip myself of daily ways and means, for an uncertain and probably distant future, were no wise policy. This therefore I must not do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if in the vicissitudes of this ancient Periodical such a thing were possible, I think that on fair terms I could actually <pb id="pg-04-107" n="04:107"/>resolve to undertake the management of it. This is saying much, if you knew all my circumstances; yet such is my present view of it. It would be particularly suitable, and I would make an effort: for be it known to you (under the rose, somewhat) I actually purpose taking up my abode in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> next winter, and starting as housekeeper by my present craft.</p>
<p>Now the question is: Can such a project as this same Editorship be in any wise feasible? I know not, but rather think nay. One faint gleam of probability I see in the midst of my utter ignorance of the whole business: you speak of Black<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Black. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210225-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1821-02-25">25 Feb. 1821</date></ref>.</note> as likely to become proprietor; now Black and Tait I believe are relations, and on a cordial footing; both honest men also, and Tait I understand in some little flow of spirits with me at present about his <hi rend="italic">German Novellists</hi>; from all which it strikes me as barely possible that the scheme might be worth asking one question about, the question: Will Tait and Black, or one or other of them purchase this Magazine, and make me the Editor thereof? If so, I shall be ready and happy to give the matter a most profound deliberation; and should their highest estimate of Editorial dues and my lowest be found capable of stretching till they meet,&#x2014;to close a bargain with them, and start full speed and very shortly, in my editorial career.</p>
<p>With you, therefore, my good Friend, I must leave the decision. If you think it worth while, all things considered to speak with Tait or Black (in case you know him) on the subject: do so, and let me know the result. If you think it not worth while, then there is nothing more that I see for us to do in the matter, but to let it drop into deepest silence&#x2014;till we meet in Ambrose&#x2019;s, whither I will venture for your sake, and drink one portion of whisky punch to the better luck of this old Scottish herring-boat, be it under the orders of Donald or the Son of Donald, or sunk in shoal water, and not sailing at all.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ambrose&#x2019;s Tavern was a famed inn, in the center of Edinburgh (1 Gabriel&#x2019;s Road), which became even more well known through references in the <hi rend="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</hi>. It was pulled down in <date when="1864">1864</date>. The &#x201C;old Scottish herring-boat&#x201D; is the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi>.</note> Except Black and Tait I recollect no bibliopolical person in Edinburgh, whom I should care for engaging with; and except on this principle, I see not that I could prudently take any hand in the concern even with them. Some hour when you have leisure, you will throw me a word on the subject; not forgetting other news of a kindred nature, of which for a great while I have been wonderfully short.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-108" n="04:108"/>I cannot regret your stay in Edinburgh, tho&#x2019; in the mean while it must be a sacrifice, for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at this moment cannot fail to be a lively type of Purgatory.

<p>This looks unkind, ungrateful but really and truly I am none of these things; nothing worse than indolent, like all the rest of the world in this most oppressive heat.

<p>I had a long letter from your Brother the other day&#x2014;the bestnatured he has written for some time back.

<salute>Dearest&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I know not what in all the world to say to you. I cannot write nowadays; I cannot think; my head and heart are in an endless whirl, which no words can express. In short, this marriage, I find, is like death: so long as it is uncertain in its approach, one can expect it with a surprising indifference; but certain, looked in the face within a definite term, it becomes a matter of most tremendous interest.&#x2014; Yet think not that I wish it but as it is&#x2014; No! &#x201C;<foreign>ce que je fait je le ferois encore</foreign>&#x201D; [What I have done I would do again]: for if I am not without fear, my hope is far greater than my fear.</p>
<p>Oh yes&#x2014;the whole arrangement will do excellently well: at least it will be our own faults if it does not. Our anticipated happiness is founded on no delusion&#x2014;is no love-dream from which we must wake in the first year of our marriage. In good sooth we were either the stupidiest or most deceitful of all living; if, at this time of day, we had <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> to know each other as we are. It is now five years since we first met&#x2014;five blessed years! During all that period my opinion of you has never <hi rend="italic">wavered</hi>, but gone on deliberately rising to a higher and higher degree of regard: and (what perhaps is still more convincing of its <pb id="pg-04-112" n="04:112"/>well-groundedness) in the seventeen months that I have held myself your affianced wife,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since <date when="1825-01">January 1825</date>.</note> I have never for a single instant wished myself free&#x2014;never for a single instant doubted the wisdom of my choice. Nor has <hi rend="italic">your</hi> attachment proved itself less steadfast than mine, tho&#x2019; far more unaccountable. For you have loved me not in blindness of my thousand faults, but in spite of them, for the sake of my one redeeming grace the faith that is in me.&#x2014; oh without doubt we shall be as happy as the day&#x2019;s long&#x2014;happier in our little house at Comely Bank,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260523-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, <date when="1826-05-23">23 May</date></ref>.</note> than Kings and Queens amid the gilding of pallaces&#x2014; Are you believing? I could easily convince you with my eyes and my kisses&#x2014;but ink-words are so ineloquent!</p>
<p>With respect to this same house; it is by no means every thing one might wish, but it is by much the most suitable that could be got:&#x2014;particularly in situation; being within a few minutes walk of the town, and at the same time well out of its smoke and bustle. Indeed it would be quite country looking, only that is one of a range. For there is a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> flowergarden in front overshaded by a fair spreading tree; while the windows look out on the greenest fields, with never a street to be seen. As for interior accommodation&#x2014;there are a diningroom and drawingroom (we must adopt the usual names, for want of more appropriate diminutives) three sleepingrooms, a kitchen and more closets than I see the least occasion for&#x2014;unless you design to be another Blue-beard. So, you see we shall have apartments enough and to spare&#x2014;on a small scale indeed&#x2014;almost laughably small&#x2014;but if this is no objection in your eyes neither is it any in mine&#x2014; The smaller the rooms, the easier to warm and light and arrange them. And then the rent is only 32&#xa3; a year,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Only &#xa3;3 less than the &#xa3;35 a year which the Carlyles were to pay for the house in Chelsea from the time that they moved there in <date when="1834">1834</date> through the rest of their lives.</note> which my Mother can easily spare, and which I therefore need not blush to take<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, Mrs. Welsh never paid any of the rent, although in <date when="1826">late 1826</date> she sent the young couple &#xa3;60, which they promptly returned to her.</note>&#x2014; Besides by and by, if all goes well we may perhaps dispense with even <hi rend="italic">this</hi> assistance&#x2014; Strange, is it not, that I should like better to be a burden on you than on my own Mother!</p>
<p>My Cousin Ph&#xe6;be Baillie came to us yesterday and on the length of her stay here depends the length of ours&#x2014;for so soon as she is fairly gone, we must set about the miserable work of removing. Possibly we <pb id="pg-04-113" n="04:113"/>shall be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> before you are; at any rate, we will meet there&#x2014;or else in Nithsdale&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in the present posture <supplied>[of]</supplied> affairs is no place for us&#x2014; I wrote to Mrs Montagu<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter has not been found. In her letter to Jane of <date when="1826-02-14">14 Feb.</date>, headed &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Valentines</hi> day,&#x201D; she wrote: &#x201C;I have been very ill, and am only (if recovering) slowly recovering,&#x2014;I have the physicians word that I am better, and I have my own observations to convince me I am thinner and more emaciated every day&#x2014;I begin to be anxious for the winding up of your novel, and cannot see why you should not make room for my friend Carlyle, at Haddington; surely his literary occupations would go on quite as well with the assistance of his Wife, and when M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh would spare you both you might find your Cottage in Annandale a pleasant retreat&#x2014;why is she to be left childless and cheerless, and why are you to wait till &#x2018;the life of life is gone&#x2019;&#x2014; Oh how soon I should settle this matter if I were once of your privy council at Haddington&#x2014; Thomas Carlyle come into Court, <supplied>[&#x2018;]</supplied>what prevents your taking up your residence here as the Husband of this most perplexing girl&#x2019; answer <hi rend="italic">Pride</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> What prevents you Jane Welsh from proposing this, <hi rend="italic">Pride</hi>, Why my dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh do you not propose this &#x2018;I am prevented by Pride.&#x2019; &#x2026; Let <hi rend="italic">Pride</hi> come into Court, &#x2018;I sentence you to be banished for ever from this House of Haddington; and the moment it has been fumigated, I desire that a long train of the Social blessings may be admitted<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>&#x2014; what says dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh <hi rend="italic">Agreed</hi>&#x2014; What says Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Agreed</hi><supplied>[.]</supplied> What says my dear Jane <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Agreed&#x2019; Agreed</hi>&#x2014; nothing remains but to fix the day, let it be as Early as possible.&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> two weeks since, in answer to a second letter from her&#x2014;the kindest, most interested letter!

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>You bid me write to you very minutely, and to do it is beyond my power, for the old reasons, haste and slowness: Alick takes this to Dumfries with him tomorrow morning, and at present it is on the verge of midnight.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-114" n="04:114"/>We are all well, and things are well enough about us. We have had a rainy fortnight, but still not nearly enough of rain. The thunderstorms passed far over our heads; and send down nothing hurtful or even extraordinary except a few hailstones. The crops are the worst ever seen within the memory of man; ours too is bad, but much better than most of our neighbours&#x2019;: so we do not complain. Mainhill is flourishing; and barley will be cut there in a day or two. Church of Mainholm was reaping a week ago: the like was never known. Here we shall have nothing to cut till you come down to us.&#x2014;&#x2014; To change the subject&#x2014;turn over</p>
<p>I am within four dayswork of the end of this <hi rend="italic">Fixlein</hi>, and so shall have done on Saturday, if I work; which however is not certain; for I have deranged myself of late with too close sitting; I have not even written to Haddington for three weeks. This <hi rend="italic">Fixlein</hi> is considerably inferior to <hi rend="italic">Schmelzle</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Paul Friedrich Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben des Quintus Fixlein</hi> (<date when="1796">1796</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Des Feldpredigers Schmelzle Reise nach Fl&#xE4;tz</hi> (<date when="1809">1809</date>), both of which Carlyle translated for his <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> which indeed I look upon as combining in a high degree the qualities of marketableness and intrinsic excellence. Nevertheless Fixlein also must do; and in a few days, I shall wash my hands of the whole affair; and turn, I hope, to something better.</p>
<p>I long somewhat to see your <hi rend="italic">Thesis</hi>: the bruit of it has come down even to Annandale; and your fellow Doctors<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had now passed his examinations and taken his M.D. degree at Edinburgh.</note> are envious or eulogistic of your attainments. This, I daresay, will not make you vain; for both you and I in the midst of all our literary triumphs, have constantly remembered, like Richard Macgub when made Deacon of Weavers at Dumfries, &#x201C;that we are men of like passions with yourselves, gentlemen.&#x201D; Nevertheless, it is all good and fair; and if a man cannot feel satisfied a little, in conquering all the obstacles between him and an object he has long been struggling towards, and attaining it triumphantly, he will scarcely take satisfaction in anything here below.&#x2014;They are all longing to see you, and asking me twenty times weekly: &#x201C;But <foreign>whan&#x2019;s Aikin comin haim</foreign>?&#x201D;</p>
<p>My late letters have been little better than Letters of Horning<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A process of execution issued under the signet directing the messenger to pay or perform in terms of the letters, under pain of being &#x2018;put to the horn,&#x2019; i.e., declared rebel&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">OED</hi>).</note> to you; so many heavy duties have they laid on your shoulders. I must still trouble you a little farther, tho&#x2019; it will soon be done now. You looked out <hi rend="italic">Gymnasium</hi> for me in some dictionary, and found that there <pb id="pg-04-115" n="04:115"/>were <hi rend="italic">six</hi> teachers. Richter hints that there are <hi rend="italic">eight</hi>. I have on this principle found out <hi rend="italic">Quintus</hi>&#x2014;to be the <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> teacher from the bottom, and <hi rend="italic">third</hi> from the top; <hi rend="italic">Quartus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tertius</hi> he also uses but <hi rend="italic">Primus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Secundus</hi> I nowhere find. <hi rend="italic">Kantor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cantor</hi> (singer) seems to be the title of one of the latter. On these principles I have manufactured a <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>, which M&#x2019;Cork will give you when it is printed, to exercise your judgement on. Will you look out <hi rend="italic">Gymnasium</hi> (tell me in what Dictionary) again; and <hi rend="italic">Kantor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rector, Conrector</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Subrector</hi>? In the cour<supplied>[s]</supplied>e of these Articles, you will surely find the secret of it; and reconcile my Richter-nose with your dictionary which is all I want. If you cannot, then copy me what it said about <hi rend="italic">Gymnasium</hi> (the ribs of it); and as to the rest do not mind them, for I know them already. Can you find me out <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pansterkette, Streck-teich, Besetz-teich</hi></foreign> (stretch-pond, store-pond)? If not never mind; for I can do without them.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Carlyle&#x2019;s note relating to these queries, see his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Life of Quintus Fixlein, Works</hi>, XXII, 197 n.</note></p>
<p>I declare it is quite shameful to plague a <foreign>Graduatus</foreign>, and so honest a youth, with these things: but what can I help it?&#x2014; I will tell you next time when I am coming, and whether you will meet me here or there. <closer><salute>I am ever your Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Had we been young lovers, just commencing the process of courtship, you might have had just cause to take exception against so long a silence in return for so kind and altogether balmy a letter as your last; nay perhaps in your wrath to pay me off and cashier me finally, as an ungrateful and ungainly subject. But, you see, we are old lovers just finishing the process of courtship, and going to be married; and so poor Jane cannot for her life get any vent for her fierce rage against <pb id="pg-04-116" n="04:116"/>me, and I stand swordproof before her, shielded in her own arms against all perils whatsoever. Blessed state for an honest man to be in! The little Bird of Paradise is <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, and her home is in my bosom (pray Heaven it may be a happy one!), and no power shall snatch her from me.</p>
<p>The truth is, my good Jane, the longer I am in writing, the sooner shall I be in coming; the fewer letters I give you, the sooner shall I give you myself. I have been writing wonderfully, with sublime effort, which as usual destroys my little fraction of health, and after a short continuance leaves me unfit for anything. By and by I shall learn wisdom in this as in other matters: to me health is more important than all imaginable philosophy; and were it not that philosophy teaches the recovery of health as her first maxim, she would not avail three straws. Even yet, make me thoroughly sick for three days, and without the prospect of improvement (which, however, I can now hardly be without) I were still as miserable a man as need be; half as miserable as ever I was. But what then? I throw my books to the ground, and myself into the fields and open breezes; and swear that no man or thing shall torment me any longer in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> flame; and so in brief space my prison doors are unbolted; and I am again as of old.</p>
<p>It is thus that the &#x201C;mind of man&#x201D; can learn to command the most complex destiny; and like an experienced steersman (to speak in a most original figure) to steer its bark thro&#x2019; all imaginable currents, undercurrents, quicksands, reefs and stormy weather. By and by, <foreign>Liebchen</foreign>, you will have to take the helm by turns yourself; for it is to be a victualled ship, no single-man canoe! What royal way we shall make&#x2014;that is, provided we do not overset! No, my own lassie, we will not overset; but act wisely, and love one another not in <hi rend="italic">words</hi> but in <hi rend="italic">deeds</hi> (one of which is worth five thousand words), and courageously make front together against all the grievances of our lot. Here are two swallows in the corner of my window that have taken a house (not at Comley-bank) this summer; and, in spite of drought and bad crops, are bringing up a family together with the highest contentment and unity of soul. Surely, surely Jane Welsh and Thomas Carlyle, here as they stand, have in them conjunctly the wisdom of many swallows! Let them exercise it then, in God&#x2019;s name, and live happy as these birds of passage are doing!&#x2014; It is not Nature that made men unhappy; but their own despicable perversities. The Deuce is in the people! Have they not food and <foreign>raiment</foreign> fit for all the wants of the body; and wives and children and brothers and parents and holiest duties for the wants <pb id="pg-04-117" n="04:117"/>of the soul? What ails them then, the ninnies? Their <hi rend="italic">vanity</hi>, their despicable very despicable <hi rend="italic">self-conceit</hi>, conjoined with or rather grounded on their <hi rend="italic">blindness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lowness</hi> of mind. They want to be happy, and by <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> they mean <hi rend="italic">pleasure</hi>, a series of <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> enjoyments: if they had a quarter of an eye they would see that there not only was not but could not be such a thing in God&#x2019;s creation.&#x2014;I often seriously thank this (otherwise very infernal) distemper for having helped to teach me these things. They are not to be learned without sore afflictions: happy he whom even affliction will teach them!&#x2014; And herewith ends my present lecture.&#x2014; Beloved pupil! art thou not afraid of the wonderful Lectures thou art fated to encounter from a husband so didactic? Or is it rather by (curtain) Lectures that thou purposest to instruct <hi rend="italic">him</hi>?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johnson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> defines a &#x201C;curtain lecture&#x201D; as &#x201C;A reproof given by a wife to her husband in bed.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>It is singular what a mockbird I am: I am writing here unconsciously in the very note of Jean Paul Friedrich Richter, on whose works I have been labouring for the last four weeks. I sent a most mad <hi rend="italic">article</hi> on the man <hi rend="italic">to press</hi> with Alick this morning by Dumfries. It is pity that it was not wiser; for he is a great genius: but how can a man write about geniuses when he has a bride waiting to be written to? The best of it is, I shall be done with Richter in four days from this date; and with the <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> in two days longer, and then the Book is off <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands! Jack tells me you are to remove about the 25th of this month: write to me from under the shadow of this <hi rend="italic">Tree</hi>, and tell me when I am to come and get fifty kisses from you. Oh what wonderful <foreign><hi rend="italic">burblements</hi></foreign> [troubles] and embroilments we have to come thro&#x2019;! I wish to Heaven we were married three calendar months, and I sitting writing another book in the little parlour, and you coming in to get ware for the dinner (from certain presses there) and I catching you round the waist and stealing two kisses by way of Promethean fire from the fairest lips in the world, <supplied>[and pres]</supplied>sing the truest heart in the world for one moment against mine. I believe in sincere truth, if the Devil be not in me, I shall like you very heartily; and learn to put faith in you as my best helper, and be your helper and husband in heart soul and spirit. O my Dearest! Our love has hitherto been a sound, a voice; it is now to become an action, and we shall have much to encounter and enjoy together. Let us not be foolish but wise, and all will be well!</p> <pb id="pg-04-118" n="04:118"/>

<p><hi rend="italic">Tolerance</hi> is the hardest for those that have it not by Nature; and we must learn to tolerate, for it is never out of place; to &#x201C;bear one another&#x2019;s burdens,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gal. 6:2.</note> to be true, patient, meek, humble, one in heart as we are to be in fate and interest.</p>

On one occasion, however, on thus descending he was pursued by the officers, who, being ignorant of the intricacies of Lob&#x2019;s retreat, not only failed to find him but lost their way out and were themselves hopelessly impounded. Hence the place was ever afterwards called &#x2018;Lob&#x2019;s Pound&#x2019; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note). See <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, iii, 909&#x2013;11.</note> no better place.

I have hundreds of compliments from you here; in various dialects of speech, all coming from the region of the heart.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I this morning send off the last eight leaves of <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. for our German Book; and as the Printers have only about ten sheets remaining to compose, I calculate that the whole matter will be off my hands in a few days.</p>
<p>I am happy to tell you that this work, which has given me some unexpected trouble, also gives me some unexpected pleasure, and that at the present moment I am <hi rend="italic">far</hi> better satisfied with the general structure of it than when you first proposed the business I could even hope to be. What its fate with the reading world may be you are better able to predict than I; but at all events, I think we may offer our Book to the Public as a thing fulfilling what it promises; giving <hi rend="italic">real German</hi> Novellists, the highest to be found in that country; and on the whole offering a considerably truer and more comprehensive glimpse into German Literature than <hi rend="italic">any</hi> other yet offered in England. I have seen, I think, <hi rend="italic">three</hi> different sets of <hi rend="italic">German Novellists</hi> advertised in the Newspapers (so that your idea at last&#x2014;for the idea was <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>&#x2014;would seem to be a favourite one); but I should not incline to suppose that any of these productions can interfere much with ours; being addressed to quite a different set of readers, and filled <hi rend="italic">exclusively</hi>, so far as I have observed, with second third and even fourth-rate men, of whom it were easy enough to collect two or three shiploads in Germany, as it would be in England.&#x2014; Really so far as I can judge I reckon the Book in its own small way likely to be useful &#x201C;for reproof, for doctrine for correction,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The phrase is similar, but not identical, to one in the service of induction of a minister into a Church of Scotland parish.</note> and what tho&#x2019; last you will not reckon least, for&#x2014;sale.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-120" n="04:120"/>Next Parcel, I send M&#x2019;Corkindale the Title-page, and a short Preface. I think the title should run thus: &#x201C;German Novellists [not <hi rend="italic">The</hi>];<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brackets.</note> Translations from their works with Introductions Critical and Biographical. Vol. I containing Mus&#xE4;us, La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;, Vol. II. &#x26;c.&#x201D; You can let me know by the next packet if you think of any alteration.</p>
<p>As this, if I remember rightly, very much resembles Roscoe&#x2019;s title,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Roscoe (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871">1871</date>), <hi rend="italic">German Novelists</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1826">1826</date>).</note> with which I should as soon not have it confounded,&#x2014;I may mention that if you judged it of any <hi rend="italic">great</hi> importance I am not <hi rend="italic">utterly</hi> averse to putting my name to the Compilation tho&#x2019; otherwise I had much rather not. It is a work which can never bring me reputation: nevertheless it is all <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I in my circumstances could make it; and if it is necessary that any fraction of the Earth understand who did it, let them, in the Devil&#x2019;s name, understand!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The title page of the first edition of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> (<date when="1827">1827</date>) reads: &#x201C;By the Translator of Wilhelm Meister, and Author of the Life of Schiller.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>My Brother writes me that you do not think it would be adviseable to <hi rend="italic">publish</hi> till <date when="1826-11">November</date>. On this point I can offer no advice, and make no objection. Arrange it with your Brother as you like. All I want is to have <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands washed of the affair; and ready to commence another. I hope only it will not be inconvenient to let me have two or three <hi rend="italic">Author&#x2019;s copies</hi> made ready without delay. I wish to send one to Goethe, and another to my Hamburg correspondent;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Julius.</note> and the sooner this were done the better. As for the <hi rend="italic">payment</hi>, which I have use for at present, it will be easy enough by lengthening the date of your Bill to manage this to the satisfaction of both parties.</p>
<p>I have farther to request that you would be so kind as take measures for the payment of <hi rend="italic">Perthes and Besser</hi> the Hamburg Booksellers who sent me that last catalogue of German works. I suppose you would get some letter or document instructing you how to manage it; and the thing was done in so friendly a way, that it were pity not to be punctual. As it turns out, the Books, all except one, were totally superfluous, being indeed, with that exception (a Life of <hi rend="italic">Richter</hi>), neither more nor less than duplicates of those already received from Leipzig. There must have been some gross mismanagement in the business; for the first cargo was shipped in <date when="1826-03"><hi rend="italic">March</hi></date> by some Scotch ship <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a Lieth Smack; and had they been conveyed with reasonable fidelity, they would have been highly useful to me. At present how they have come is a mystery to me: a letter sent by <hi rend="italic">post</hi> appears to have miscarried; <pb id="pg-04-121" n="04:121"/>for I never heard of it till on opening these parcels. Of course these last books are <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>; and if you do not feel it convenient to risk the chance of selling them along with the rest, we will settle for the amount, and you may have your choice between these and the corresponding ones of the former lot, some of which are cut here and there, tho&#x2019; otherwise uninjured; and all likely, I should think, particularly after the publication <supplied>[of]</supplied> our <hi rend="italic">Novellists</hi>, to be acceptable to German Students. Every one of them should go into the Advocates&#x2019; Library, by right.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since <date when="1709">1709</date> the Faculty of Advocates&#x2019; Library, now the NLS, has been a copyright one, receiving by law a copy of every book published in Britain.</note></p>
<p>Next time M&#x2019;Corkindale sends me down sheets, I shall look for a letter from you; and by way of answer to it, I expect to make my appearance in person to wind up all old matters, and if possible to start some new one. I know not whether you have any fresh plan of employment in store for me; nor is it material, for I have a vehement purpose (or at least desire) to write something out of my own heart and head, and so become Author in place of Editor. We shall talk of these things when we meet. What think you of a &#x201C;German Dramatists&#x201D; in the wake of these Novellists?&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>The <date when="1826-07-25">twenty fi<supplied>[f]</supplied>th</date> is long past and alas we are still in the agonies of removal. Oh the dreary tumult, the horrible, hopeless confusion of this day, and of many that are gone before! But it will all be got thro&#x2019; in process of time I suppose; and then and then my husband I laugh at Fate. Meanwhile I write with all the collected strength that the <foreign>flitting</foreign> [moving] has left in me: just for fear you should take it into your head to get impatient, and so come to investigate the state of things in person. Now that would never answer&#x2014; I would not have you in the way at present for any money: because neither should I have one minute&#x2019;s leisure to enjoy your society, nor have it in my power to make you in the least degree comfortable.&#x2014; Sleep at Comely <pb id="pg-04-122" n="04:122"/>Bank! Lord help your simplicity! You do fall upon the most remarkable plans! My dear friend this house at Comely Bank is not yet ours&#x2014;for the present it belongs to my Mother&#x2014; She and I take possession of it ourselves this very week, and really we shall have no accommodation for visitors last of all for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> whom all the world now knows I am about to marry&#x2014;</p>
<p>Do pray stay where you are till I am safe in Nithsdale; and make one journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> answer for all&#x2014; I am sure a few weeks of idleness would do you good rather than harm&#x2014; And with respect to other matters&#x2014;that is household matters <hi rend="italic">your</hi> presence in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is at present nowise needful&#x2014;on the contrary would be <hi rend="italic">a great interruption</hi>. We will be at Templand, I expect within three weeks from this date&#x2014;In short Dear I do not wish you to set your foot within this house until it is all in applepie order to receive us; and I do not wish to see you at all until I can see you in more harmonious circumstances&#x2014; Will you be guided by me for once? And I will be guided by you for ever after&#x2014;</p>
<p>I must be content to send this scrawl as it is&#x2014; I am distracted with noises and dreadfully hurried&#x2014;and sick sick at heart. Write next week to N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 Comely Bank&#x2014;or perhaps it will be surer to send the letter to John. <closer><salute>God bless you<supplied>[.]</supplied> pity me&#x2014;and love me for ever&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>An alteration has occurred in my engagements since I wrote last; and I cannot get to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at present; and know not exactly when I shall. I have in consequence concocted a new Title-page; altered the Preface to suit it; and directed M&#x2019;Corkindale to show you both before the proofs are returned. That of &#x201C;German Novellists&#x201D; &#x26;c was much more to my mind; and it belonged to <hi rend="italic">us</hi> not to Roscoe, for we were first: however, on the whole, the present title tho&#x2019; less neat and glib, may be more original, and better describe the peculiarities of the Book. After hammering over the matter for eight-and-forty hours, and trying two dozens of titles, this seemed the best I could raise:</p><pb id="pg-04-123" n="04:123"/>
<p><title>German Romance:<lb/>
Glimpses of its chief Authors and Kinds,<lb/>
in<lb/>
Translated Specimens (large)<lb/>
with Biographical &#x26; Critical<lb/>
Introductions (smaller).<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This may be compared with the title and description that appeared on the title page of the work in the first edition: <hi rend="italic">German Romance: / Specimens / of / Its Chief Authors: / with / Biographical and Critical / Notices</hi>.</note></title></p>
<p>I like &#x201C;glimpses of&#x201D; very ill; and if you like it any worse, it must come out, tho&#x2019; a just horror at puffing makes me wish to retain it or some equivalent. &#x201C;Authors and <hi rend="italic">Kinds</hi>&#x201D; is descriptive of the work, as you will see from the Preface. On the whole I must leave the thing in your hands and Mr Ballantyne&#x2019;s, much better ones than mine.</p>
<p>I cannot participate in your fears about the fourth volume. A &#x201C;German Novellists&#x201D; without Goethe, would have been for all the world like an &#x201C;English Dramatists&#x201D; without Shakespeare. Consider what unspeakable contempt would have risen in the minds of all men for the botching compiler! Moreover <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi> is by no means an uninteresting or peculiarly un-English book. On the contrary I reckon it (with Tieck) greatly the most immortal and poetical part of the whole; and notwithstanding my whimpering in the &#x201C;Life of Goethe,&#x201D; I have no doubt that there are many very many minds in the British isles that will view it so likewise; and these are the men that give the law to the mob of readers, a class of persons whom I still continue to think both Bookseller and Author will find it their interest in the long run to treat like rational men rather than like pampered children. On the whole we must not let the Edinburgh critics of German dishearten us: any of them that I have met with I have come to value, the longer I knew them, at a lower rate. They gabble words without wisdom; and really, I fear, <hi rend="italic">know</hi> very little of the whole matter. It would not in the least surprise me if <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> as it is incomparably the best were also the most popular volume of the whole book.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fourth volume of the first edition of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> contained a biographical and critical sketch of Goethe by Carlyle and his translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>. These were incorporated into the three volumes of <hi rend="italic">William Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels</hi> in the edition of <date when="1839">1839</date>.</note></p>
<p>I thought at one time of writing an Introduction such as you recommend: but really the greater part, I may say almost <hi rend="italic">all</hi> I know about German Novel writing is written down one way and another <pb id="pg-04-124" n="04:124"/>over the work; and a formal introduction to a thing so loose and fragmentary would have suited ill. The present is much more homogeneous with what follows, and I think will answer better.</p>
<p>It grieves me to hear you confirm the universal report of &#x201C;bad times,&#x201D; which all classes of men, learned and unlearned, seem destined to feel in this kingdom. Nevertheless, I believe it <hi rend="italic">can</hi> only be temporary. The world requires literary amusement, and (ignorant monster that it is!) literary instruction still more. So that Poet and Editor and Bookseller and Printer&#x2019;s Devil shall all live!</p>
<p>I send you the <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> of these German Books; and should <supplied>[be]</supplied> very much obliged, if you would see the man paid as soon as possible; <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can settle for the amount in due time.</p>
<closer><salute>Believe me always, / My Dear Sir, / Very Truly Yours&#x2019;s, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>P.S. I see I have dashed out &#x201C;Glimpses of&#x201D; in Ballantyne&#x2019;s paper: however if you can tolerate it, I should like it fully better.</p>
<p>I shall hear about it all when the proofs come.</p>
<p>On maturer thought, I have reckoned it better <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give the name. There are several things said in the course of the Book, which tho&#x2019; true enough might look almost pert, if said in the first person by a man whose name was <hi rend="italic">nameless</hi>. Especially as you do not reckon it of any great importance, which indeed it cannot be.</p></ps>

<salute>My Darling,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry for you this morning, and these last days generally: I know you were expecting with certainty a letter from my hand; and till Monday you cannot get any. Properly speaking, I should be sorry for myself, that I must appear to you so careless, and lose the enjoyment of talking with you in all sorts of foolish small talk: but the truth of the matter is this: A pack of sheets came down on Monday morning, with a long letter from the Bibliopole requiring an alteration in the Title-page and Preface; then Jonathan on Wednesday morning; the management of all which things has occupied my whole disposeable time till this morning. Thank Heaven! Title-page and Preface and all are now off my hands: next week I get the last four sheets, <pb id="pg-04-125" n="04:125"/>and then in two days bid good b&#x2019;ye to the whole matter. At any rate, what is the matter whether I write to you or not? Are you not always in my heart and my thoughts, and am not I always in yours, my little Dearest; and are we not soon to be joined in the holiest and closest bonds forevermore! O my good Jane, it is an awful and a dilicious thought this of wedlock! Need is, most pressing need that the heart you give your own heart to be well and seriously judged and found worthy. With one whose integrity of soul you even doubted, it we<supplied>[re]</supplied> better to die a thousand deaths than to wed. My own true wife! I trust in God I shall love thee well; that thou shalt find a home for thy fair soul in my bosom; that my arms may encompass thee about from the afflictions of existence, and the heart thou hast believed in so nobly may prove no refuge of lies! I swear it will break my heart if I make thee unhappy. And yet I am a perverse mortal to deal with, and the best resolutions make shipwreck in the sea of practice: but thou must be a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good wife, and I will be a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good husband; and our souls shall have no secret from each other, and we live, indivisible and <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, poor or rich as it shall please Heaven, but more blessed in each other&#x2019;s love and goodness than any other pair. O I feel as if I could live and die with thee if thou wert <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, mine as thou shalt yet be, not by priestly benedictions but by the soft pervading influences of thy own worth and wisdom, reaching deeper and deeper into my soul year after year that we live together. What more can I say? Kiss thee with a true kiss, which means: Look in thy own heart, there thou wilt read it all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle (p. 320) quotes from Goethe&#x2019;s poem <foreign>&#x201C;Ottilien von Goethe&#x201D;: &#x201C;Magst in Deinem Innern lesen, / Wie Du Dir es offenbarst.&#x201D;</foreign> This he translates: &#x201C;You may read clear in your own breast, / As you made it manifest to yourself.&#x201D; Cf. also the first sonnet of Sidney&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Astrophel and Stella</hi>.</note></p>
<p>Jonathan<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brother John, now home from Edinburgh.</note> saw you the night before he came away; sitting, as he represents it, in the midst of chaos, like Patience on a monument, smiling at Grief.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi>, II, iv.</note> Here too are Plasterers and Carpenters bringing back the reign of Ancient Night; the tumult the dust and horror too high for the English language! This is the Purgatory fire; but is there not a Heaven beyond it? Bear all these things with calmness, for they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have an end; and we shall get married in spite of all men and things, and be very good <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheleute</hi></foreign> [husband and wife] too. The good Jonathan likes you as well as it is possible without loving you: he really seems very much improved since he went away last; and I think <pb id="pg-04-126" n="04:126"/>bids fair to do well. So far as he has come, I make bold to say that <hi rend="italic">no</hi> young man of his time in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> school has studied more faithfully, or amassed more sound knowledge and worthy habitudes with similar opportunities. His <hi rend="italic">Thesis</hi> is very considerably the best I ever saw produced there, on such principles. Poor Jack! I really begin to feel some little sympathy for him.</p>
<p>Never man was so plagued with bad paper and pens as I have been for the last week! Do but see how this base sheet turns up its nose at the good ink; and with much exertion, takes no black but a grey colour for my lines! I must be very brief.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle omits this paragraph and the words beginning with &#x201C;Poor Jack!&#x201D; in the paragraph preceding it.</note></p>
<p>To your arrangement of my journeyings and our meeting, I cheerfully subscribe; judging it the best among several bad ones. Edinburgh, however, I believe I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> visit before a certain event; but I will let you be gone from it, and most probably have seen you first. The business is, I must fall upon some new enterprize if possible before the <hi rend="italic">great day</hi>: I would not have that season poisoned by base bargainings and chafferings with tradesmen; I should like rather to have a task begun, which beside my little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weibchen</hi></foreign> I might then fall to prosecuting with double alacrity. Nay more, these novels are not to be <hi rend="italic">published</hi> till <date when="1826-11">November</date>; and I must go and raise the cash for them forthwith&#x2014;for obvious reasons. The Bookseller tell<supplied>[s]</supplied> me &#x201C;times are exceedingly bad&#x201D;; but he does not frighten me with that talk: thro&#x2019; the strength of Heaven, I shall earn food and raiment for us both, in all manner of times; and have something left for higher purposes too. The gift, small as it is, which God has given me shall not lie unimproved, let the contradictions of sinners be what they may. I am happy to say that I feel more and more consciousness of the <hi rend="italic">rights of man</hi> within me; and less and less dependance on any patronage either from men or things. It all depends on our own humour, and manner of conceiving it. I hope yet to be, not a great man for that is unessential, but a good man, for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sake, if it were for nothing else. Cant and <foreign>palabra</foreign> will not do: I cannot tell you with what sympathy I have come to regard some of our Edinburgh critics, just of late, in regard to the matter of this very Book. I will learn much, and teach you much, much, when we are wedded.</p>
<p>Do you ever write to Mrs Montagu? Make my most kind compliments (she really <hi rend="italic">has</hi> many excellences and much nobleness of mind), and also the best apology you can devise for me. I feel as if I could <pb id="pg-04-127" n="04:127"/>not write to her, till <hi rend="italic">after</hi>. I have done her injustice many times: she is not without (unconscious) affectations and the like: but am I, is any one? And how many women have I seen, who had one tithe of the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> greatness of mind which she has? Alas! scarcely one or two in this wide world. Tell her that we will both love her&#x2014;as well as we can.</p>
<p>Can you find <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wetterbaum</hi></foreign> (weather-tree) in your German Dictionary? If so send it down (the English of it) without delay. But I much doubt you: Jack had left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> too soon; the letter I sent to him must come back with no <foreign><hi rend="italic">wetterbaum</hi></foreign> in it: but any way I can do.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Wetterbaum</hi></foreign> is &#x2018;a thick cloud that spreads upwards like the branches of a tree.&#x2019; Carlyle&#x2019;s German Dictionary at this time was Nathan Bailey&#x2019;s (Leipzig and Jena, <date when="1810">1810</date>), given to him by Edward Irving. It does not contain the word <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wetterbaum</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>From this place, I have nothing but all manner of kind compliments and wishes to send you; from My Mother, from Jack and Jane in words; from all the rest, I know it well, in thought. When the house is done they expect to see <hi rend="italic">us</hi> here. Did you <hi rend="italic">cry</hi> when you turned your back on Haddington? I believe you did now; ill as you liked the place. Comley-bank will be far better; especially with so illustrious a gentleman, philosopher and husband beside you&#x2014;<closer><salute>your own forever!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>I am idle at present, or at least occupied as I like. I will come to Nithsdale when you see good. I confess I could like to have arranged the matter under less restraint to both parties: but after all, what difference how it is arranged, so it be arranged at all! And arranged it shall be, if Heaven spare us. Tell me seriously: Are you happy? Give me twenty kisses, and love me forever in your good heart, as I love you. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dieu</hi>!</foreign></p></ps>

<p><salute>Well, dearest Love,</salute> here am I,&#x2014;escaped alive from horrors as of the bottomless pit. But just alive and nothing more; for my spirit is gone, my intellect gone, my good humour gone, and in short I would hang myself&#x2014;if certain considerations did not prevent me.</p>
<p>I wonder that among all the evils deprecated in the Liturgy no one thought of inserting <hi rend="italic">flitting</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Removing from one residence to another.</note> Is there any worse thing? Oh no no, from flitting, then, good Lord deliver us!&#x2014;and from some other ills, too, best unfolded in all their length and breadth when we meet.&#x2014; And when will that be? Mercy! to think we have not seen each other for a whole year;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They had seen one another last at Templand in <date when="1825-09">September 1825</date>.</note> and once, no more than sixteen British miles betwixt us! Oh glorious instance of patience and long suffering! And the annals of our courtship afford many such. But in the other and better world we are about to enter, these Job-inflictions will be all forgotten, or remembered merely as a troubled dream.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-129" n="04:129"/>Write instantly what day I may look for you. Perhaps it were best you should take Templand on your road to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;but as you like&#x2014;</p>
<p>The house at Comely Bank is at length completed, and looks pretty and convenient enough&#x2014;certainly nothing like so commodious and elegant as the one I have left&#x2014;but, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things considered, likely to answer much better. So here are two steps in the business happily taken. The last is the worst of all&#x2014;would to God it were over also!</p>
<p>Your letter came in company with one from Mrs Montagu&#x2014; She is ill&#x2014; Mr Montagu has been very ill and Mrs Procter all but dead. And still she writes to me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">me</hi> who am nothing to her but a name&#x2014;and sends the kindest message to you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;If M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is near you, tell him that a Lady, and a handsome one too, declared to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Montagu and myself &#x2018;her firm belief that the author of the Life of Schiller might have chosen a Wife, without the smallest chance of refusal, from any unengaged Lady in England.&#x2019;&#x2014; Is not this true fame<supplied>[?]</supplied>&#x201D; Mrs. Montagu had written on <date when="1826-08-07">7 Aug.</date></note> She is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good, and I rejoice we are <hi rend="italic">both</hi> to love her; for otherwise I must have loved her alone.</p>
<p>She says something in a desponding manner about Edward Irving. His little girl is in a bad way; and he himself far from well&#x2014; Poor Edward.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the same letter Mrs. Montagu wrote to Jane: &#x201C;I saw M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving yesterday, and either I have lost the habit of looking at the sunshine rather than the shade, or he gave me the impression that his own little girl was very unwell, and in that same terrible complaint of which the Boy died&#x2014;something is wrong in the lungs of the Children, and their Father looks as if he was consumptive<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D;</note> The summer day of his exultation has been quickly overcast! But do you know I cannot feel for him at present, I cannot feel for any mortal but myself&#x2014;</p>
<p>Give my kindest regards to dear John, whom I like as well as he can possibly like me&#x2014;remember me also in an affectionate manner to all the rest&#x2014;and to James Johnston if he happens to be near you&#x2014; You will write on Sunday?&#x2014; I am almost ashamed to send you such a scrawl but I am got into a way of doing every thing in a hurry&#x2014;since the <foreign>flitting</foreign>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Eliza</salute>
<p>You must think me <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> graceless, perhaps downright uncivil; and, in truth it is shameful that so fair a gift should be still to acknowledge. But this much I have to say, with all humility, in my own defence; that, here, the source of offending lies in weakness of the flesh, not willingness of spirit, and the thanks, which I have been so overbackward to express, I have been anything but backward to feel.</p>
<p>Still I was sorry as much as glad about these ear<supplied>[r]</supplied>ings;&#x2014;for, while they pleased me as an emblem of friendly feelings on your part, of which, for reasons long and broad, I have of late been doubtful; I nevertheless wished them back again in Marshall&#x2019;s shop, when they glittered before my eyes under the form of a <hi rend="italic">marriage-present</hi>. Not that I would keep the idea of my marriage out of mind. No truly! it is fully more attractive for me now than ever,&#x2014;the greenest, sunniest spot in all my being&#x2014; But marriage-presents, I do think, are the most unreasonable species of <hi rend="italic">taxation</hi> that could be devised. You remember Uncle Adam Ramsay&#x2019;s exposition of the matter to Miss Bell Black. &#x201C;There <foreign>canna</foreign> be a <foreign>mair</foreign> needless, daft-like thing, than to <foreign>gie</foreign> presents to a woman at the very hight of mortal happiness; It is <hi rend="italic">she</hi> rather should <foreign>gie</foreign>, to <foreign>puir</foreign> single folk, that <foreign>ha na</foreign> Major Waddely to set them up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We got here last monday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1826-08-28">28 Aug.</date></note>&#x2014;escaped alive from the thousand and one miseries of these last four weeks.

<salute>My Love,</salute>
<p>I had sent daily to the Post-office for news of you, during the last fortnight; and on Saturday, as usual, I was answered with a negative<supplied>[.]</supplied> The blind Postmaster&#x2019;s boy had failed to decipher your address; and so kept me another eight and forty hours in suspense. I did not get your letter till this morning.</p>
<p>Would to Heaven, as you say, the whole matter were over, and no more letters in this world to pass to and fro between us! Well, over it will be ere long one way or another, and so let us be patient and content. My good little girl has suffered much for me already; but I trust in God it shall all be made good to her in future.</p>
<p>I might set out immediately, but I am rather sicker than usual for the last three or four days; and besides I do not wish to take you by surprise. Till Wednesday evening you cannot get this letter; so I must be content to announce myself for Thursday first; about evening I suppose, for the way is long, and Larry cannot gallop it all. On Thursday evening then will you&#x2014;give me a kiss, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Brautkuss</hi></foreign> [nuptial kiss]? I should not say; but I know in heart you will.</p>
<p>I may stay with you all Friday, and take counsel about everything, and return on Saturday, to expedite what has been consulted.</p>
<p>I could wish considerably that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r might</hi> do for all; yet I fear it; for money is an indispensible, and without my presence I doubt it will be unattainable. This also we shall talk of.</p>
<p><foreign><hi rend="italic">Quid multa?</hi></foreign> [Why so many words?] I will see you in twelve hours <pb id="pg-04-132" n="04:132"/>after you read this, and tell you a thousand things, and hear as many, and discuss the whole mystery of our Fortune, now one and indivisible, and steal many a kind look, and some hundreds of kisses from you, and hopes that might make a less steadfast philosophy waver on its basis. Good night Darling! And may the Giver of all good be with you!</p>
<p>Forget not my kindest regards to your Mother, to your Aunt and your Grandfather whom I hope soon to greet in person. All here from the oldest to the youngest wish you heartily well.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am ever your own, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>James Johnstone I shall see this night; being invited to drink tea along with Jack at his&#x2014;wedding! By Heaven, the man is to be wedded! Tomorrow morning about four of the clock he is joined in the indissoluble tie with Miss Janet Carlyle of Grahamshall,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260125-JBW-MAC-01">Carlyle&#x2019;s note on <sic>Jane&#x2019;s letter to his mother, <date when="1826-01-25">25 Jan.</date></sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1826-01-25">25 Jan.</date></corr></ref></note> and rolls off to Haddington that same night. There is for you. And to crown the whole he celebrates his nuptial feast the night <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the nuptials! If the Bride should rue in the interim! But I swear she will not.&#x2014; Good night! I am far too late for the marriage tea.</p></ps>

<salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Bestes Liebchen</hi></foreign>&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I have been a very wicked man of late weeks, and not less so since I saw you; so splenetic, so sick, so sleepless, so void of hope, faith, charity, in short so altogether bad and worthless. I trust in Heaven I shall be better soon; a certain incident otherwise will wear a quite original aspect. I declare you might put me to shame when I think of your manner of being; in years and Understanding you are younger; but in the wisdom of the heart, in much that best deserves the name of Reason I should do well to become your scholar.</p>
<p>I have not been neglectful of our common interest since we parted, however I may have seemed; my evil as well as my good dispositions both incite to wish this matter were over. The evening after my return hither I wrote to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in quest or rather in demand of <hi rend="italic">funds</hi> (for without filthy lucre nothing can be done); and on Friday, I received <pb id="pg-04-133" n="04:133"/>for answer not a draught of &#xa3;200, but intelligence that my Bibliopolist was gone to London, and not to return for a month.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had lent nearly all of his savings, amounting to several hundred pounds, to his father and his brother Alexander to make repairs and begin operations at Scotsbrig; hence he had very little ready cash as his marriage date approached.</note> Here then was one department of research exhausted. A remnant of vanity (which it would appear I have not entirely conquered still), or perhaps it might be of something better, rendered me unwilling to <hi rend="italic">borrow</hi> money from a stranger for such a purpose: so I took Alick to counsel on the matter; and after considering it a moment, I accepted his offer to withdraw from his husbandry so much capital for a month or two as will suffice us; a measure which I adopt with the less reluctance, as I can fairly calculate on being able to repay him before it will be specially wanted. About this day week, then, I shall be master of &#xa3;50.</p>
<p>Next comes the great catastrophe of the whole drama! Tomorrow I go to Dumfries to set certain fractions of men a-cutting clothes for me; carriers must be spoken with, friends bid farewell to, and <hi rend="italic">then!</hi> I think we should be <hi rend="italic">proclaimed</hi> (Lord help us!) on the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sunday from this date; and wedded about the following Thursday (it answers best for carriers, unless you considerably prefer the beginning of the week); that is on Thursday fortnight, a fortnight and a day from the time when you read this scrawl. Have you the heart, good Love? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Glaubst Du noch jetzt?</hi></foreign> [Do you have faith even now?] I have not found such faith, neither here nor elsewhere.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 7:9.</note></p>
<p>All these dates and arrangements are still liable to alteration, of course; and but propounded here for your sanction, in case they meet your tastes, or for change if they do not. Write hither without stop, to tell me. If all goes well, my next letter to you will inclose a note to Mr Anderson<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Anderson (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>) was minister of Closeburn, <date when="1815">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">29</date>. He wrote <hi rend="italic">A Statement of the experience of Scotland with regard to the education of the people</hi> (Dumfries, <date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> the Minister to get us proclaimed and to come and wed us on Thursday morning. John and I will come up to Glendinning&#x2019;s Inn the night before; he may ride with us the first stage if you like; then come back with the chaise, and return home on the back of Larry, richer by one <hi rend="italic">sister</hi> (in relations) than he ever was. Poor Jack!</p>
<p>One other most humble care is whether we can calculate on getting post horses and chaises all the way to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> without danger of let, <pb id="pg-04-134" n="04:134"/>or it would not be better to take seats in the Coach for some part of it? In this matter I suppose you can give me no light: perhaps your Mother might. At all events tell me your <hi rend="italic">taste</hi> in the business; for the Coach <hi rend="italic">is</hi> sure if the other is not.&#x2014; Will you ask your Mother if she knows whether we should be proclaimed in this parish <hi rend="italic">also</hi>? I believe it depends on the practice of the marrying clergyman: I would give two-pence that the Closeburn Parson were not rigid in this point. Here, the whole matter is next to an utter secret, or at least a most dim surmise. Write me all that you can; and do take some hand in the projection of the affair; I can have no taste in it whatever except to comply with yours.</p>
<p>Before ending I should say something consolatory and encouraging to my much-loved Bride, whose heart is doubtless as loaded with cares as my own, and far less fit to bear them. But what can I say in this Tartarean mood? Simply that there will be neither peace nor rest till we are <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, till I have my own true Jane far away from a thousand grating circumstances, that have long oppressed her heart and that embitter mine the instant I come within their sphere. O for God&#x2019;s sake, be good my Darling! Good and wise; and thou w<supplied>[ilt]</supplied> have the happiest husband, and be the happiest wife in the world. I do not mean compliant and affectionate: that you are already; but <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, clear-sighted towards <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and towards the new sphere of life (new in rank and object and all its properties); my true guardian spirit, my soul&#x2019;s friend, my own forever and ever! After all, why do I doubt? Because I doubt every thing; because Faith is not among my virtues, but only Sight.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle omits this sentence.</note> I swear we shall be happy: for I love thee; and with all my faults can never cease to love thee in heart, and in heart to long for thy good. Believe this, for it is true; and let it be an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast, as thy love is to me:</p>

<salute>My Dearest</salute>
<p>You desired me to answer your letter on Thursday; but I have waited another post, that I might do it better;&#x2014;if indeed any good thing is to be said under such horrid circumstances. Oh my own darling, do for heavens sake get into a more benignant humour; or <hi rend="italic">the</hi> incident will not only wear a very original aspect, but likewise a very heart breaking one. I see not how I am to go thro&#x2019; with it&#x2014;I turn quite sick at the thought&#x2014; But it were Job&#x2019;s comfort to vex you with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> anxieties and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">severe</hi> affection&#x201D;&#x2014; I would rather set before you, by way of encouragement, that the purgatory will soon be past; and &#x201C;speak peace where there is no peace&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an echo of &#x201C;Saying, Peace, peace; when <hi rend="italic">there is no peace</hi>&#x201D; (Jer. 6:14).</note> only that you would easily see thro&#x2019; such affected philosophy. There is nothing for us then, but, like the Annan congregation to pray to the Lord<supplied>[.]</supplied> I have said I delayed writing, that I might do it more satisfactorily&#x2014; For this reason, I expected to know last night when my Mother is to come from&#x2014;Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! in which case, I should have been able to name <hi rend="italic">some</hi> day, tho&#x2019; not so early a one as that proposed. But alas alas! my Mother is dilatory and uncertain this <pb id="pg-04-136" n="04:136"/>time as ever and the only satisfaction I can give you at this writing, is to promise I will soon write again&#x2014;</p>
<p>What has taken her to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> so inopportunely? to set some fractions of women a-cutting white gowns&#x2014;a thing which might have be<supplied>[en]</supplied> done with all convenience while we were there last month&#x2014; But some people are wise and some are otherwise: and I shall be mighty glad to get the gowns in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> way&#x2014;for I should like ill to put you to charge in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> article for a very great while&#x2014; Besides you know it would be a bad omen to marry in mourning. When I put it on six years ago I thought to wear it for ever&#x2014; But I have found a second Father; and it were ungrateful not to show even externally how much I rejoice in him&#x2014;</p>
<p>I fear you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be proclaimed to your own parish (pity! since you are so ashamed of me) but I will enlighten you on that head also in my next&#x2014; With respect to the journey part of the business&#x2014;I loudly declare for running the risk of being stuck up by the way (which at this season of the year is next to none) rather <supplied>[than]</supplied> undergoing the unheard of horror of being thrown into the company of strangers, in such <hi rend="italic">severe</hi> circumstances, or possibly (which would be still worse) of some acquaintance, in the stage coach&#x2014; Indeed indeed Dearest I promise you to make no demonst<supplied>[rations]</supplied> that I can possibly help; but I am sure from the faintness and cold shudder that comes over me at the thought of that odious ceremony that I shall be in no state for at least a week after to endure any eye but yours&#x2014; For this same reason I also prohibit John from going with us an inch of the road&#x2014;and he must not think there is any unkindness in it&#x2014; My Aunt thinks you and he would be greatly better here the night before than at Glendinnings&#x2014; But <supplied>[be]</supplied> that as you like&#x2014; If you come I shall take care that you get a room which is not over the kitchen (in case you tell me next morning you do not care whether we are married or no)&#x2014;and for the rest I need not see you unless I feel &#x201C;disposed&#x201D;&#x2014; But it will be time enough to settle <hi rend="italic">how</hi> when we have settled <hi rend="italic">when</hi>&#x2014; In the mean time you had better write me a few lines if it is not too much trouble&#x2014; But whether you write or not I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> so soon as I hear again from my Mother. Did you ever see such paper? It comes from Thornhill&#x2014;and I can find no knife to mend my pen&#x2014; I hope your Mother is praying for me very hard. Give her my affectionate regards a kiss to Jane</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Surely I am bound by all laws human and divine to &#x201C;write you a few lines,&#x201D; however enormous the &#x201C;trouble&#x201D; may be; and this the rather as except thinking about you and this general Finale that lies before us, I have next to nothing to do. You will never in the world guess what sort of a pastime I have had recourse to in this windbound portion of my voyage. Nothing less than the reading of Kant&#x2019;s Transcendental Philosophy! So it is: I am at the hundred and fiftieth page of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik der reinen vernunft</hi>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason</hi> of Immanuel Kant (<date when="1724">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804">1804</date>) was first published in <date when="1781">1781</date> and revised in <date when="1787">1787</date>.</note> not only reading but partially understanding, and full of projects for instructing my benighted countrymen on the true merits of this sublime system at some more propitious season. To speak truth, however, one of Scott&#x2019;s novels would suit me much better: last night, I found Kant was getting rather abstruse; and in one or two points he puzzled me so, that today I have not once opened him. On the whole, this present &#x201C;middle state&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on Man</hi>, II, 3.</note> might, so far as the Almanack and the Clock are concerned, seem peculiarly favourable for literary projection: but alas the heart is not there; I am fallen, fallen from the pure regions of Art into the boggy Syrtis<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 939: a quicksand off the north coast of Africa.</note> of session-clerks and Tailors and Postkeepers; and I feel too clearly that till the great Day is over, I can neither think of one thing nor another to any purpose. Would it were over, and [one line has been scratched out here] neither Kant nor any of his commentators can teach me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle omits the whole sentence and writes on the MS that he does not know who scratched out part of it.</note> The Philosophy of living well is the end of all Philosophies, transcendental and common; and if affection be the soul of life, shall we not teach one another to live?</p>
<p>After all I believe we take this impending ceremony far too much to heart. Bless me, have not many people been married before now? And were they not all carried thro&#x2019; with some measure of Christian com<hi rend="italic">fort</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251114-JBW-MAC-01">JBW to MAC, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date></ref>.</note> and taught to see that marriage was simply nothing but&#x2014;marriage? Take courage, then, my Darling; and let no cold shudder <pb id="pg-04-138" n="04:138"/>come over you, and call not this an &#x201C;odious ceremony,&#x201D; but rather a blessed ordinance, sanctioning by earthly laws what is already sanctioned in Heaven, uniting two souls for wor<supplied>[l]</supplied>dly joy and woe, which in God&#x2019;s sight have chosen one another from amongst all men! Can any road be dark which is leading thither? You will see it will all be &#x201C;smooth as oil,&#x201D; notwithstanding our forebodings. Consider Goethe&#x2019;s saying: &#x201C;we look upon our scholars as so many swimmers, each of whom, in the element that threatened to devour him, unexpectedly feels himself borne up and able to make progress; and so is it with <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that man undertakes.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 321, Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi>, X, 199.</note> With <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, marriage as well as other things. By all reasons, therefore, German and English, I call upon you to be composed in spirit; and to fear no evil in this really blessed matter.&#x2014; Now tell me at this moment, when your apprehensions are the darkest, how much would you take to <hi rend="italic">rue</hi>? Five guineas? Fifty thousand? I do not think you would take&#x2014;five.</p>
<p>To your arrangements about the journey and the other items of the How and When I can only answer as becomes me: Be it as thou hast said. Let me know your will, and it shall be my pleasure; and so by the blessing of Heaven we shall roll along side by side with the speed of post horses, till we arrive at Comley Bank; and then, as Richter says, the door we open is no longer <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thine</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>; and we two are one and indivisible forever and ever! I shall only stipulate farther that you let me by the road, as occasion serves, <hi rend="italic">smoke three cigars</hi>, without criticism or reluctance, as things essential to my perfect contentment! Yet if you object to this article, think not that I will break off the match on that account; but rather like a dutiful husband, submit to the everlasting ordinances of Providence, and let my wife have her way.</p>
<p>You are very kind, and more just than I had reason to expect, in imputing my ill-natured speeches (for which Heaven forgive me!) to their true cause, a disordered nervous system. Believe me, Jane, it is not I but the Devil speaking out of me which could utter one harsh word to a heart that so little deserves it. O, I were blind and wretched, if I could make thee unhappy! But it will not and shall not be; for I am not naturally a villain, and at bottom I do love you well; and so when we have learned to know each other as we are, and got all our arrangements accomplished, and our hous<supplied>[e]</supplied>hold set in order, I dare promise you th<supplied>[at]</supplied> it will all be well, and we shall live far happier <pb id="pg-04-139" n="04:139"/>than we have ever hop<supplied>[ed.]</supplied> Sickness is the origin, but no good cause of indiscriminating spleen: if we are wise, we must learn if not to resist at least to evade its influences; a science, in which even I (in the midst of my own establishment) fancy I have made some progress, and despair not of making more.</p>
<p>As to the Proclamation, on which I expect your advice, deeply as I feel ashamed of you, I protest I had rather be proclaimed in all the parish churches of the Empire than miss the little bride I have in my eye; a wicked gypsey truly, but one whom I see not how I am to do without. So get the gowns made ready, and loiter not, and tell me, and in a twinkling <foreign><hi rend="italic">me voil&#xE0;</hi></foreign> [there I am].&#x2014; Thank your Aunt for her kind invitation, which I do not refuse, or accept till next letter; waiting to see how matters turn. I was surely born to be a Bedouin: without Freedom I should soon <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;die and do <foreign>nocht ava&#x2019;</foreign></hi>.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Die and do nothing at all.&#x201D; Coterie speech, quoting a saying of Sandy Blackadder, factor at Hoddam Hill, uttered at the end of a long comment at a funeral. See Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 315.</note> My chosen abode is in my own house, in preference to the Palace of Windsor; and next to this, shall I not (with the man in the play) take my ease at mine Inn?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, III, iii.</note>&#x2014; I wish my kind compliments to Grandfather, if he will accept them; in his monosyllabic manner of existence, I discern the features of a genuine heart, and feel that I could like him much.</p>
<p>My Mother&#x2019;s prayers (to speak with all seriousness) are, I do believe, not wanting either to you or me; and if the sincere wishes of a true soul can have any virtue, we shall not want a blessing. She bids me send you the kindest message I can contrive; which I send by itself without contrivance. She says she will have one good <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [cry] when we set off, and then be at peace.&#x2014; Now then, Dearest, what remains but that you appoint <hi rend="italic">the date</hi>; that you look forward to it with trust in me and trust in yourself, and come with trust to your husbands arms and heart, there to abide thro&#x2019; all chances forever? O we are two ungrateful wretches, or we should be happy! [line crossed out]; write soon, and love me forever. <closer><salute>And so good Night <foreign><hi rend="italic">mein Herzenskind</hi></foreign> [my darling]! Thine <foreign><hi rend="italic">auf ewig</hi></foreign> [to eternity],</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Welsh</salute><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of Dr. John Welsh&#x2019;s youngest brother.</note></p>
<p>You must think me just about the most faithless character in the nation; but I know, myself, that I am far from being so bad as I seem. The truth is, the many strange things I have had to do, and think of, in late months, left me no leisure of mind for writing mere complimentary letters: but still, you, as well as others of my friends, have not been remembered by me with the less kindness, that you have seen no <hi rend="italic">expression</hi> of my remembrance on paper. So, pray do not go to entertain any hard thoughts of me, my good little Aunt; seeing that, at bottom, I deserve nothing but loving kindness at your hands. Rather add a spice of long-suffering to your loving-kindness which will make us the very best friends in the world.&#x2014;</p>
<p>It were no news to tell you what a momentous matter I have been busied with; &#x201C;not to know <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would argue yourself unknown&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Not to know me argues yourselves unknown&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, IV, 830).</note>&#x2014; For a marriage is a topic suited to the capacities of all living; and in this, as in every other known instance has been made the most of. But for as much breath as has been wasted on <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;my Situation&#x201D;</hi>; I have my own doubts whether they have given you any <hi rend="italic">right</hi> idea of it. They would tell you, I should suppose, first and foremost, that my intended is <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> [for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> it requires no great depth of sagacity to discover]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are Jane Welsh&#x2019;s.</note> and, in the <pb id="pg-04-141" n="04:141"/>next place, most likely, indulge in some criticisms scarce flattering, on his birth<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor Gracie of Dumfries, kind of &#x2018;Genealogist by Trade,&#x2019; had marked long since (of his own accord, &#x26; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> knowing <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) my Grandfather to be lineally descended from the First Lord Carlyle, &#x26; brings us down from the Brother of the murdered Duncan (see &#x2018;Pedigree&#x2019; upstairs).

<p>Such then is this future husband of min<supplied>[e;]</supplied> not a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> man according to the most common sense of the word, but truly great in its natural, proper sense&#x2014;a scholar, a poet, a philosopher, a wise and noble man, one who holds his patent of nobility from Almighty God, and who&#x2019;s high stature of manhood is not to be measured by the inchrule of Lilliputs!&#x2014; Will you like him? no matter whether you do or not&#x2014;since <hi rend="italic">I</hi> like him<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;God bless thee, Dear One!&#x2014;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> in <supplied>[the]</supplied> deepest part of my soul.</p>
<p>I would invite you to my wedding if I meant to invite any one; but, to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> taste, such ceremonies cannot be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> private: besides by making <hi rend="italic">distinction</hi>, among my relatives on the occasion, I should be sure to give offence; and, by God&#x2019;s blessing, I will have no one there who does not feel kindly both towards <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wished and purposed to have paid you a visit at Boreland before hand&#x2014; But when it was convenient for me to go Robert<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC inserts &#x201C;Uncle&#x201D; above the name.</note> and his Wife were stumbling-blocks in my path&#x2014;and now the thing is impossible&#x2014;the days that remain to me are so few, and so fully employed&#x2014; My affectionate regards to my Uncle&#x2014; A kiss to <foreign>wee</foreign> John<supplied>[.]</supplied> <closer><salute>And believe me always your sincere friend and d<supplied>[utif]</supplied>ul niece</salute></closer> <name>Jane Welsh</name></p><ps>

<p>My <hi rend="italic">Translation</hi> work went steadily on;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">pleasantest</hi> kind of labour I ever had; c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be done by <hi rend="italic">task</hi>, in what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hum<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> one was in: and was, day by day (ten pages a-day, I think) punctually and comfortably so performed. <hi rend="italic">Internally</hi>, too, there were far higher things going on; a grand and <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>-joyful victory getting itself achieved at last! The final chaining down, and trampling home, &#x201C;for good,&#x201D; home into their caves forever, of all my <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Dragons</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had wrought me such woe and, for a decade past, had made my life black and bitter: this year <date when="1826">1826</date> saw the end of all that. With such a feeling on my part as may be fancied.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The end of the struggle described in &#x201C;The Everlasting No&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. See Carlisle Moore, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> and the Problem of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2018;Conversion,&#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">PMLA</hi>, LXX (<date when="1955">1955</date>), 662&#x2013;81; and &#x201C;The Persistence of Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2018;Everlasting Yea,&#x2019;&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Modern Philology</hi>, LIV (<date when="1957">1957</date>), 187&#x2013;96.</note> I found it to be, essentially, what Methodist people call their &#x201C;Conversion,&#x201D; the deliverance of their soul from the Devil and the Pit; precisely enough that, in my new form;&#x2014;and there burnt, accordingly, a sacred flame of joy in me, silent in my inmost being, as of one henceforth superior to Fate, able to look down on <hi rend="italic">its</hi> stupid injuries with pardon and contempt, almost with a kind of thanks and pity. This &#x201C;holy joy,&#x201D; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I kept silence, lasted sensibly in me for several years, in blessed counterpoise to sufferings and discourage<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> enough; nor has it proved what I can call fallacious at any time since: my &#x201C;spirit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> dragons&#x201D; (thank Heaven) do still remain strictly in their caves, forgotten and dead;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is indeed a conquest, and the beginning of conquests.&#x2014; I rode ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, a great deal, in all kinds of weather, that winter &#x26; summer; generally quite alone; &#x26; did not want for meditat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, no longer of defiantly hopeless, or quite <hi rend="italic">un</hi>pious nature&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if on the spirit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> side, all went well, one poor item on the temporal side went ill; a paltry but essential item: our Lease-arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of Hoddam Hill. The Lease had been hurriedly settled, on word of mouth merely, by my Father, who stood well with his Landlord otherwise, and had perfect trust in him. But when it came to practical settle<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of its &#x201C;demands of out-going Tenant&#x201D; (i.e. of the poor old superannuated &#x201C;Factor,&#x201D; who was we at length saw completely <hi rend="italic">right</hi> as ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his Landlord, and from the first saw was completely wrong as ag<hi rend="italic">t us</hi>), there arose difficulties; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the farther they were gone into, spread the wider. &#x201C;Arbitra<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x201D; was tried; much was tried; nothing w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do. &#x201C;Arbitrators, little Farmers on the neigh<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Estates,&#x201D; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not <pb id="pg-04-143" n="04:143"/>give a verdict, but only talk, talk,&#x2014;deciding &#x201C;Hon<hi rend="italic">ble</hi> Landlord owes aright his Father&#x2019;s old Factor, say, &#xa3;150&#x201D;; and other just decis<hi rend="italic">n</hi> there was none. Factor was foolish, superannuated, impoverished, pressingly in want of the money; Landlord was not wise or liberal, arbitrary and imperious he tried to be, wrote Letters &#x26;c, but got stiff ans<hi rend="italic">s</hi>,&#x2014;over the belly of justice, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be permitted to ride. The end was, after much babbling (in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I meddled little, and only from the background). Complete <hi rend="italic">break</hi> ensued: Hoddam Hill to be given up, laid at his Honour&#x2019;s feet, <date when="1826-05-26">26 May 1826</date>, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> Mainhill where the lease also expired then: my Father got on another Estate nearby, the Farm of Scotsbrig; a far better Farm (where our people still are); Farm well to<supplied>[o]</supplied> capable both of his stock and of ours; with roomy House &#x26;c,&#x2014;where, if anywhere in the country, I, from and after <date when="1826-05-26">May 26</date>, must make up my mind to live</p>
<p>To stay there till <hi rend="italic">Germ</hi>n <hi rend="italic">Romance</hi> were done; clear as to that. Went accordingly; and after a week of joinering &#x26;c, resumed my stint of &#x201C;10 daily pages,&#x201D;&#x2014;steady, as the Town Clock, no interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> dreaded, or occurring. Had a pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, diligent, &#x26; interesting summer; all my loved kindred ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me for the last time, hottest and droughtiest summer I have ever seen; <hi rend="italic">dryer</hi> even than <hi rend="italic">last</hi> (of <date when="1868">1868</date>), tho&#x2019; seldom quite so intolerably hot,&#x2014;no rain from <date when="1826-03">end of March</date> till <date when="1826-08">middle of Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date>. Delightful morning rides (in the first months) are still pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> breakfasts, sometimes in the Kitchen (an antique <hi rend="italic">baronial</hi> one, roomy, airy, curious to me),&#x2014;cookery, company, and the <hi rend="italic">cow</hi> with her produce, always friendly to me. Nothing to complain of, but want of the old <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>; noise and bustle of bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> now round me, and like to increase, not diminish. And this tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> always, too, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Here</hi> cannot be thy <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> city!&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 13:14.</note> And, then withal, &#x201C;My Darling, in noble silence, getting so weary of dull Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!&#x201D;&#x2014; In brief, after much survey and consider<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the real interests and real feelings of both parties, I proposed, and it was gently acceded to, that, <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> once <hi rend="italic">done</hi> (<date when="1826-09">end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> or so), we sh<hi rend="italic">d wed</hi> [underscored twice]; settle at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, in some small suburban House (details and preparat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> there all left to her kind Mother and her);&#x2014;and thenceforth front our chances in the world, not as two lots, but as <hi rend="italic">one</hi>. For better, for worse; till Death us part!</p>
<p>In <date when="1826-08">Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date> Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> became aware of what was toward; a great enough event there, the loss of its loved and admired &#x201C;Jeannie Welsh,&#x201D; &#x2014;&#x201C;the Flower o&#x2019; Haddington&#x201D; (as poor old <hi rend="italic">Lizzie Baldy</hi>, a notable <pb id="pg-04-144" n="04:144"/>veteran serving-woman, humble heroine there, sadly said), &#x201C;the Flower o&#x2019; Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> <foreign>gaun to be here nae mair</foreign>!&#x201D; In Annandale, such my entire seclusion, nothing was yet heard of it for a couple of months. House in Comley Bank, suitable as possible, had been chosen; was being furnished from Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x2014;beautifully, perfectly and even richly, by Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s great skill in such matters, aided by her Daughter&#x2019;s wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was also great,&#x2014;and by the frank &#x26; <hi rend="italic">wordless</hi> generosity of both, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely was very great! Mrs Welsh had decided to give up house, <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> Hadding<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (and, privately, even never to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it more); to live at Templand henceforth with her Father (&#x26; Sister), where it was well-judged her help might be useful. My brave little Woman had, by deed of law, two years before, settled her little Estate (Craig<hi rend="italic">k</hi>) upon her Mother for life;&#x2014;To wit, some &#xa3;200 being clearly indispensable <hi rend="italic">there</hi>: Fee-simple of the place she had, at the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> time, by Will, bequeathed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> if I survived her! Beautiful soul; I heard of this Will, probably once only, and knew that it existed; but never saw it till <date when="1866-06">june</date> or <date when="1866-07">july 1866</date>, when (in a deceased Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Lawyer&#x2019;s Office,&#x2014;deceased Sandie Donaldson&#x2019;s to wit,&#x2014;beyond hope of my Dumfries lawyer) it was found, and I read it;&#x2014;so beautiful, so sad! Her signature was there; but that was not all: Sandie, on hint given, had left two blanks, and she herself had written my name,&#x2014;that faithful Sandie alone might know her secret!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> was got done with at the due time; finished and paid for in <date when="1826-09">September</date>, or <date when="1826-10">early in October</date>,&#x2014;through publicat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> did not ensue, till some months later (nor had much &#x201C;success,&#x201D; nor was to us much a care when it did!)&#x2014; Letter VII<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter, which is actually Letter VIII in Carlyle&#x2019;s scheme.</note> is dated little more than a fortnight before our Wedding Day.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I yesterday received your letter, the contents of which did not fail to surprise me. Far from suspecting that the Book fell short of the size you expected, I had actually used considerable exertions to contract it in bulk (that I might save printing), and I may truly say, at least of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> volumes, that I could with <hi rend="italic">less</hi> labour have made them fifty pages longer each, than of their present size. The <hi rend="italic">Italian Nove</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">ll</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">ists</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Roscoe, <hi rend="italic">The Italian Novelists: selected from the most approved authors in that language, from the earliest period down to the close of the eighteenth century: arranged in an historical and chronological series, translated from the original Italian. Accompanied with notes critical and biographical</hi>, 4 vols. (London, <date when="1825">1825</date>). For Roscoe, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261204-TC-NHJ-01">TC to NHJ, <date when="1826-12-04">4 Dec.</date></ref></note> I had not thought it necessary to consult more than very vaguely; and here in my seclusion, I recollected only that in our <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> verbal agreement, you spoke of 350 pages (of these Novellists), of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> volumes of a Waverl<supplied>[e]</supplied>y Novel, and one of Wilhelm Meister, as about the size we had to aim at,&#x2014;and generally that quality much more than quantity was to be my object. This measure of 350 pages I find accordingly that, without much attending to it, I have actually come within 24 of, or 6 pages per volume (as you will see by allowing for the additional <hi rend="italic">line</hi>); and as to Wilhelm Meister, which makes three very handsome volumes at 10/6 each, we have considerably <hi rend="italic">more</hi> pages here (only the paper is thinner), and I believe between &#x2153; and &#xBC; more matter. The <hi rend="italic">Italian Novellists</hi> I understood to be our precursor and suggester, not our pattern or ideal; and I hope our Book will be found to differ from it in many particulars besides size.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-146" n="04:146"/>Nevertheless, true it is, the <hi rend="italic">Italian Novellists</hi> stands mentioned in the minute of agreement; and if books are to be estimated, like various other manufacted products, by weight and measure, I have failed in executing the <hi rend="italic">spirit</hi> of my engagement, by twenty-four pages; and the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of it by a considerably larger quantity. True it is, also, that these volumes look excessively thin and meagre; nay that within their long lank sides, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> might very handsomely be contained in <hi rend="italic">one</hi>. For this, however, Mr Cowan<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently someone in the Tait brothers&#x2019; establishment.</note> has to answer equally with me, and I am sure not more innocently.</p>
<p>The great question next comes: What is to be done? If you insist upon it, I can very easily supply you with letter-press to the required amount (I have 100 good pages lying by me translated at this moment, and before rejected), to be appended to the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> volumes, especially the latter; a process which will cost us nothing more than the loss of the last leaf in each of the last sheets in those volumes, and some detriment to the <hi rend="italic">unity</hi> of the work; an encumbrance with which, I suspect, the Editor of the <hi rend="italic">It. Nov.</hi> has not been much fettered in his proceedings. Or I have another plan, which I reckon better, and which is certainly far cheaper:</p>
<p>The 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> volume (that containing <hi rend="italic">Richter</hi>) looks much the worst, containing only 309 pages: I will subjoin to it an <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> containing farther particulars of Richter&#x2019;s Life (learned since the first part of that volume was printed) to the extent of some sheet and a half or so; and thereby make the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> as large as any of its predecessors. This I think much the better way: for this <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> was a thing I had partly resolved upon before, and given up from fear of <hi rend="italic">wanting room</hi>; and this addition would make the whole 4 volumes look alike&#x2014;all that we can do for them; since no addition that we can possibly have any right to will ever make them look <hi rend="italic">thick</hi>.</p>
<p>Now I beg you to choose between these two: either of them I can easily accomplish; the former more easily; the latter with much more cheer&#x2014; [incomplete]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The work was published without these changes, even though the text finishes on p. 337, vol. I; on p. 317, vol. II; on p. 309, vol. III; and on p. 352, vol. IV.</note></p>

<p>Unkind that you are ever to suffer me to be cast down, when it is so easy a thing for you to lift me to the seventh heaven! My soul was darker than midnight, when your pen said &#x201C;let there be light,&#x201D; and there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> light as at the bidding of the Word. And now, I am resolved in spirit, and even joyful&#x2014;joyful in the face of the dreaded ceremony, of <hi rend="italic">Starvation</hi> and every possible fate. Oh my dearest friend be always <hi rend="italic">so</hi> good to me and I shall make the best and happiest Wife! When I read in your looks and words that you love me,&#x2014;feel it in the deepest part of my soul, then I care not one straw for the whole universe beside; but when you fly from my caresses to smoke tobacco, or speak of me as a mere <hi rend="italic">circumstance</hi> of your lot, then indeed, my heart is &#x201C;troubled about many things.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 10:41.</note></p>
<p>My Mother is not come yet, but is expected this week; the week following must be given to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to take a last look of her Child; and then, Dearest, God willing I am your own for ever and ever.</p>
<p>This day fortnight would suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> better than Thursday; for (you know) after the proclaiming one is not fit to be seen, and therefore the sooner we got away the better: But then it would not suit&#x2014;the Carriers? unless, perhaps, you could send your things the week before, or leave them to follow after you. However, the difference of two days is of no such moment in my mind, that you may not fix whichever <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find most convenient. So determine&#x2014;and let me know.</p>
<p>With respect to the proclamation, I am grieved to say I can give you no comfort. for not only must you be proclaimed, like any common man, in your own parish, but send a line from the minister certifying you <hi rend="italic">unmarried</hi>, before they will proclaim us here&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Anderson, for his own part, would require nothing of the sort; but his Elders, he says, are mighty sticklish about forms. They would not register the marriage unless it were gone about in the regular way&#x2014; It is a pity! but after all their crying <supplied>[proclaiming the banns]</supplied> is the least of it&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you and John come here the night before or not? Whichever way you like&#x2014;if you come I have a notion I will not see you; but I cannot say positively at this distance. Oh Mercy! What I would give to be sitting in our doll&#x2019;s-house married for a week!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-148" n="04:148"/>Have you spoken to Jane yet about coming to us? and will she trust herself to my sisterly care? I would not have her for a month or two,&#x2014;till I have got over the first awkwardness of such change; and my wits are recovered from the bewilderment of the new world about me sufficiently to look to her welfare&#x2014; Surely we should feel happier for having the good little creature with us; and the arrangement, I trust, would not be without benefit to herself&#x2014; For my own share in it, I engage to be a true kind Sister to her and an instructor as far as I can<supplied>[.]</supplied> Tell her this if you see good; and give her a kiss in my name&#x2014; I may well return <hi rend="italic">one</hi> out of <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi>&#x2014; But indeed Dear these kisses on paper are scarce worth keeping&#x2014; You gave me one on my neck that night you were in good humour, and one on my lips on some forgotten occasion, that I would not part with for a hundred thousand paperones. Perhaps some day or other I shall get none of any sort&#x2014;<foreign>sic transit gloria mundi</foreign> [so passes the glory of the world].</p>
<p>Have you heard of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Strachey yet? I have! with a vengeance! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu in her last letter coolly denounces her as an &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Archfiend</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s letter is dated <date when="1826-09-09">9 Sept.</date> Jane refers to the following passage in her letter which does not mention Mrs. Strachey by name: &#x201C;Poor woman [Mrs. Edward Irving]&#x2014; she has encountered much sorrow and much vexation&#x2014;she has been tried by all things&#x2014;by her own temper her own narrowness of mind, and more than all by an Arch-fiend who deceived M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle as completely as she would have deceived Edward Irving&#x2014; I saw he<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at the first glance&#x2014;both Mad and wicked&#x2014;sanctimonious, and the worst of hypocrites&#x2014;malignant beyond any sane creature I ever knew, and therefore let us hope that she was mad.&#x2014; Vanity is as dangerous to a Man, as passion, and more dangerous because it is supposed to be more innocent&#x2014; How easily a wise Man may be duped! and how grossly this person duped both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving&#x2014;&#x201D; Mrs. Montagu also gives Jane some premarital advice: &#x201C;I have but one piece of advice to give for the conduct of married life: never reply to a hasty or an apparently unkind observation at the time it is made: tho&#x2019; you are charged ever so unreasonably, tho&#x2019; the observation is alike unjust and unwise. Make no answer&#x2014;swallow your vexation, but, at the first cool and tranquil moment state truly and fairly your thoughts upon the matter and say no more.&#x2014; the thing will not occur again or will more seldom occur: it is not difficult to encounter an angry opponent, but it is very difficult indeed to encounter a reasonable woman, who has softness and sweetness to oppose to anger or spleen, and judgment and sense to condemn such failures, and steadily to examine how far the faults are involuntary how much they demand of pity, how much of blame.&#x2014; You are quick feeling and most likely quick tempered&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle would brood for a year, upon hasty words forgotten by you in a minute&#x2014; Never lose sight of this truth, that you are supposed by mere worldlings to have given more in this union than you have received. I fear you must be more dutiful and more humble than the portionless: do not resort to the common notion of a perfect equality&#x2014;there is no equality&#x2014;and she who has been highest, has only furthest to stoop.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; And you Thomas Carlyle uphold her an Angel of light! I <pb id="pg-04-149" n="04:149"/>wonder which I am to believe?&#x2014; Something whispers&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu&#x2014; Is it jealousy think you? Oh no, for I do firmly believe that had <hi rend="italic">Julia Strachey</hi> been Jane Welsh and I Julia Strachey you would still have had the grace to love <hi rend="italic">me</hi> best. Yes and I should have loved you too&#x2014;and then! Mercy what a <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> would have come of it&#x2014; Things are better ordered considerably as they are&#x2014;I&#x2019;m thinking&#x2014;</p>
<p>There came a letter from my pretty cousin Ph&#x9c;be Baillie the other night&#x2014;almost sentimental for a wonder&#x2014; The Girl has taken it into her head (and not without reason) that my grave help-mate will hardly be able to endure her; so she conjures us, in all seriousness, not to discard her utterly and thereby blast her hopes of ever becoming more wise!</p>
<p>You will surely let me teach her German, Dear? I promised, and you would not have me break my word. Besides the poor little soul has none to speak one true word to her but only me; and her follies I would fain persuade myself are more of education than of Nature&#x2014; But you shall see her in good time and judge for yourself&#x2014;and then&#x2014; not my will be done but thine&#x2014; I am going to be really a very meek-tempered wife&#x2014;indeed I am begun to be meek-tempered already&#x2014; My Aunt tells me she could live forever with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> without quarelling&#x2014;I am so reasonable and equal in my humour&#x2014; There is something to gladden your heart withal!&#x2014;and more than this&#x2014;my Grandfather observed while I was supping my <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> last night&#x2014;that &#x201C;She was really a douce peaceable body that <hi rend="italic">Pen</hi>.&#x201D; So you perceive my good Sir the fault will be wholly your own if we do not get on most harmoniously together&#x2014; My Grandfather has been particularly picturesque these two days&#x2014; On coming down stairs on Sunday evening&#x2014;I found him poring over&#x2014;Whilelm Meister!&#x2014; &#x201C;A strange choice&#x201D; I observed (by way of taking the first word with him) &#x201C;for sunday-reading&#x201D;&#x2014; But he answered me quite sharply&#x2014;&#x201C;not at all Miss&#x2014;the book is a very <hi rend="italic">good</hi> book&#x2014;is all about David and Golia<supplied>[t]</supplied>h&#x201D;!

<p>&#x201C;The last Speech and <hi rend="italic">marrying</hi> words of that unfortunate young woman Jane Baillie <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle says that there are two allusions here, first to Swift&#x2019;s short article &#x201C;The last Speech and dying Words of Ebenezer Elliston, who was executed the <date when="1722-05-02">2nd May, 1722</date>&#x201D;; and second to the old ballad &#x201C;The Unfortunate Miss Bailey.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230722-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1823-07-22">22 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> I received on Friday morning: and truly a most delightful and swan-like melody was in them; a tenderness and warm devoted trust, worthy of such a maiden bidding farewell to the (unmarried) Earth, of which she was the fairest ornament. Dear little child! How is it that I have deserved thee; deserved a purer and nobler heart than falls to the lot of millions? I swear I will love thee with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> whole heart, and think my life well spent if it can make thine happy.</p>
<p>In fine these preliminaries are in the way towards adjustment. After some vain gallopping and consultation, I have at length got that Certificate which the Closeburn Session in their sapience deem necessary; I have ordered the Proclaiming of Banns in this parish of Middlebie, and written out a note giving order for it in your parish of Closeburn. Pity, by the way, that there is no man in the Closeburn Church possessed of any little fraction of vulgar earthly logic! It might have saved me a ride to Hoddam Manse this morning (the good Yorkstoun my native parson was away), and a most absurd application to the &#x201C;glass minister&#x201D; my neighbour. One would think that after fair <hi rend="italic">crying</hi> three times thro&#x2019; the organs of Archibald Blacklock, this certificate of celibacy would be like gilding refined gold, or adding a perfume to the violet:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">King John</hi>, IV, ii.</note> for would not my existing wife, in case I had one, forthwith, at the first hum from Archibald&#x2019;s windpipe, start up in her place, and state aloud that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had &#x201C;objections&#x201D;?&#x2014; But I will not quarrel with these reverend men; <foreign><hi rend="italic">laissez les faire</hi></foreign>, they will buckle us fast enough at length, and for the <hi rend="italic">How</hi> I care not.</p>
<p>Your own day, Tuesday,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That is, <date when="1826-10-17">17 Oct.</date>, when the marriage took place.</note> as was fitting, I have made mine. Jack and I will surely call on Monday evening at Templand, most likely <hi rend="italic">after</hi> tea; but I think it will be more commodious for all parties that we sleep at the Inn. You will not see me on Monday night? I bet <pb id="pg-04-151" n="04:151"/>two to one you will! At all events I hope you will on Tuesday; so as Jack says, &#x201C;it is much the same.&#x201D;</p>
<p>All hands are sorting, packing, rummaging and rioting here. To Jane I read her part of your letter: she will accompany us in our Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sojourn with all the pleasure in the world. Jack will bring her out, when we want her: she may try the household for a while; if it suit she will have cause to love her sister for her life long.</p>
<p>Your Mother will take down this note to the Minister, and appoint the hour? I think, it should be an early one, for we have far to go. Perhaps also she might do something towards engaging post-horses at the Inn; but I suppose there is little fear of failure in that point.</p>
<p>Do you know aught of wedding-gloves? I must leave all that to you; for except a vague tradition of some such thing I am profoundly ignorant concerning the whole matter. Or will you give <hi rend="italic">any</hi>? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach du guter Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh, good Lord]! Would we were off and away, three months before all these observances of the Ceremonial Law!</p>
<p>Yet fear not, Darling; for it must and will be all accomplished, and I admitted to thy bosom and thy heart, and we two made <hi rend="italic">one life</hi> in the sight of God and Man! O my own Jane! I could say much; and what were words to the sea of thoughts that rolls thro&#x2019; my heart, when I feel that thou art mine, that I am thine, that henceforth we live not for ourselves but for each other! Let us pray to God that our holy purposes be not frustrated; let us trust in Him and in each other, and fear no evil that can befall us. My last blessing as a Lover is with you, this is my last letter to Jane Welsh: my first blessing as a Husband, my first kiss to Jane Carlyle is at hand! O my Darling! I will always love thee.</p>
<p>Good night, then, for the last time we have to part! In a week I see you. In a week you are my own! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu Meine Eigene</foreign> [my very own]!</salute></closer></p>

<p>Had it not been that I engaged to let you hear of me on Saturday, I should not have been tempted to &#x201C;put pen to paper this night&#x201D;; for <pb id="pg-04-152" n="04:152"/>I am still dreadfully confused, still far from being at home in my new situation, inviting and hopeful as in all points it appears. But I know your motherly anxieties, I felt in my heart the suppressed tears that you did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> shed before my departure, and I write at present to tell you that you are not to shed any more.</p>
<p>Jane has run up stairs for a few minutes to unpack the last remnants of our household luggage: I have but a few minutes to spare, and must give you matters in the lump.</p>
<p>Jack would tell you of our being wedded after the most doleful ride (on his and my part) thither; and then rolled off in the Coach towards Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Tuesday Morning. Poor Jack! I daresay he did <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> [weep] that morning when alone; he looked so very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>, and scarcely knew more than myself what to make of it. Our journey passed without incident, and we arrived here in safety about nine o&#x2019;clock, where a blazing fire and covered table stood ready waiting to receive us.</p>
<p>On the whole I have reason to say that I have been mercifully dealt with; and if an outward man worn with continual harrassments and spirits wasted with so many agitations would let me see it, that when once re<supplied>[c]</supplied>overed into my usual tone of health I may fairly calculate on being far happier than I have ever been. The house is a perfect model of a house, furnished with every accommodation that heart could desire; and for my wife I may say in my heart that she is far better than any other wife, and loves me with a devotedness, which it is a mystery to me how I have ever deserved. She is gay and happy as a lark, and looks with such soft cheerfulness into my gloomy countenance that new hope passes over into me every time I meet her eye. You yourself (and that is saying much) could not have nursed and watched over me with kinder affection, wrecked as I am, by my movements and counter-movements; all my despondency cannot make her despond, she seems happy enough if she can but see me, and minister to me.</p>
<p>For in truth I was very sullen yesterday, sick with sleeplessness, quite nervous, <foreign><hi rend="italic">billus</hi></foreign>, splenetic and all the rest of it. Good Jane! I feel that she will be all to me that heart could wish; for she loves me in her soul, one of the warmest and truest souls that ever animated any human being. Last night I got a good sleep; and tho&#x2019; several sleeps will be necessary to give me back my old train of acting, I am already far better today, and all that was so dark yesterday is now becoming <hi rend="italic">grey</hi>, and promising ere long to be quite sunshiny and bright.</p>
<p>I must huddle things together, for if I had a whole day I could not <pb id="pg-04-153" n="04:153"/>put them in order. You will ask about sleep: fear not for that, my good Mother; I shall sleep better than ever, Scotsbrig or the Hill were not quieter than this, and our bed is, I should think, about <hi rend="italic">seven feet wide</hi>! Besides she herself (the good soul!) has ordered another bed to be made for me in the adjoining room, to which I may retire whenever I shall see good. On this score therefore all is well. Yesterday and today we have spent in sorting and arranging our household goods, and projecting our household economy. She calculates at the moderate scale of &#xa3;2 per week: I am to give her two pound notes every saturday morning, and with this she undertakes to meet all charges. At this rate which astonishes myself far more than her, there can be no fear. She seems Thrift itself as well as Goodness.</p>
<p>Of men or women we have yet seen none except the maid, a neat tidy damsel; so of Tait or any other business I cannot speak one word.</p>
<p>The Waffler did not bring the Boxes yesterday; but <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> them this morning by two porters, who rated them at the short weight of&#x2014;eighteen stone! I paid them 2/6 for their porterage; but of the Waffler&#x2019;s 12 / for carriage I would not pay one <foreign>doit</foreign>. I wish Sandy would try to settle with him for this once, and then never more employ him while he lives. Gavin Johnstone is far better tho&#x2019; he lives at a greater distance.</p>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">may</hi> send the butter and the cheese, and a <foreign><hi rend="italic">firkin</hi></foreign> (by and by I think) of your best oatmeal. Get the things weighed and marked when he undertakes with them, and after that there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be no overcharge. We will settle it all <hi rend="italic">in summer</hi>.</p>
<p>But my time is run, and my head is still swimming with ten thousand objects of the most chaotic sort. You should not have ordered me to write in <hi rend="italic">two days</hi>, but after <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> [one or two words torn away] that, I <supplied>[one word missing: might?]</supplied> tell you another story.</p>
<p>Jane would not look at this letter, for I told her you so wished it. She sends her warmest love to you all. Is not mine still with you? I have told her all that you said and looked that morning I went away, and she loves you all along with me, and sorrows with me for your absence. My prayers and affection are with you all from little Jenny upwards to the head of the house. Remember me to my Brothers, my trusty Alick (Jack must write) and all the rest. Mag and her sisters are not forgotten either. I will write again, when <hi rend="italic">I have recovered my senses</hi>. Good night my dear Mother; I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &#x201C;told you the worst,&#x201D; which is that I am half as <hi rend="italic">billus</hi> as might have been expected; overshadowed with confusion, therefore, but with hope on all sides looking <pb id="pg-04-154" n="04:154"/>thro&#x2019; it. Jane will write to you soon, so also will I; you shall not want for letters; or for love while there is life in me. Again I say I will write when I have recovered my bewilderment. Tell Jack to write us in the mean while; and fear nothing: <closer><salute>I am forever your</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>affectionate son, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I write this tonight for two reasons. The first is: I have made Tait pay me &#xa3;50 of my stipulated money,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> which sum I forthwith delivered in to the Commercial Bank, with directions that it should there be delivered out again to &#x201C;Mr Alexander Carlyle.&#x201D; Scott will have word to that effect to-morrow morning; and Alick directly after that, will have nothing more to do but show his trusty face at the office, and be repaid his magnanimous advance to me, the nature of which I never think of without affectionate regret. Tell him not to delay in this (you yourself know from experience the way of managing it); then to write to me very largely soon, as he promised; and to believe that I am his true brother while I live in this world.</p>
<p>My second reason is: that I would give sixpence to see you here yourself at this very moment. I want to speak with you about many things, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ut cum fratre, ut cum medico</hi></foreign> [both as a brother and as a doctor]. When will you come? Jane will be delighted to see you; and for me your presence would be as a lamp in a dark place. Little <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> she does not want for some weeks yet: but there is room enough and to spare for both. You perhaps might walk for economy&#x2019;s sake, and Jane could come in the coach.</p>
<p>To this hour I dare not let myself out about my matrimonial views; for I am yet all in a maze, scarce knowing the right hand from the left in the path I have to walk. To complete the matter I am still <foreign><hi rend="italic">billus</hi></foreign>, and imperfectly supplied with sleep: no wonder therefore that my sky should be tinged with gloom. I cannot explain matters yet; but by and by I doubt not I shall see it all. Meanwhile tell my Mother that I do believe I shall get <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [adjusted] to my new situation, and <pb id="pg-04-155" n="04:155"/>then be one of the happiest men alive. Tell her also that by Jane&#x2019;s express request I am to read a sermon, and a Chapter with commentary, at least every Sabbath evening to my household! Also that we are taking seats in church, and design to live soberly and devoutly as beseems us. Our Mother also, Jane says, is to come and see us, and we are not to be divided in heart, tho&#x2019; separated in place. On the whole this wife of mine surpasses my hopes: she is so tolerant, so kind, so cheerful, so devoted to me! O that I were worthy of her!</p>
<p>Why am I not happy then? Alas Jack <hi rend="italic">I am <foreign>billus</foreign></hi>: I have to swallow salts and oil: the physic leaves me pensive yet quiet in heart and on the whole happy enough; but next day comes a burning stomach, and a heart full of bitterness and gloom; for I feel well that with health far more than ever my happiness is connected. Will you come and see me, and let us take counsel together? My little wife will do every thing and all; and surely thro&#x2019; the strength of Heaven something reasonable right and happy may be made out by proper regulation among us. Certainly at this moment I should be among the happiest of men, if I were not among the unhealthiest.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, I made a vow some days ago to give up my tobacco for three weeks, a piece of abstinence that afflicts me not a little, and of course still farther darkens my views.</p>
<p>Here are Murray &#x26; Mitchell come to drink tea with us, and Jane &#x26; they are <hi rend="italic">struggling</hi> for talk. I cannot say another word. Come if you can&#x2014;riding or walking. May the great Father bless you all every one with his own blessing! Fear not for me; for I shall soon feel otherwise. Come, or tell me at least whether you are coming. O Murray Murray!</p>
<closer><salute>Good Night Jack! / I am ever thy Brother, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Tait&#x2019;s Book and mine is to be out in a month&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without</hi> any farther addition at all. He knocked under when I saw him, and seemed to admit that in very truth he knew nothing either about Goethe or Richter or any thing connected with them. He is keen for new engagements.</p>
<p>If you cannot come pretty soon, write to me when you are coming. After all it makes little matter; only the sooner you come I think it will be as well and I shall be the gladder to see you. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> I am in better spirits already, and shall be still better tomorrow.</salute></closer></p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>For the last three days I have been firmly purposing to write to you, in conformity with my promise; but something or other has always intervened to prevent me, and continue the suspense in which I know well you are living with regard to me. Do not think me unkind or forgetful of you; your anxieties are always present to my thoughts, and I will not now any more than of old neglect to send you tidings of me, good or bad as Providence may direct them. Today I have taken Time by the forelock, and begun writing directly after breakfast; and now mindful of your oft-repeated injunction I will tell you truly how I am, and not hide from you &#x201C;the very worst.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The chief thing I have to complain of is uncertainty. As usually happens with me, in all changes, this greatest and most important I have ever made has overset all my accustomed habitudes, and so driven me a good deal to leeward in my whole procedure: and tho&#x2019; this is now the fourth week of my marriage, I am by no means &#x201C;come to&#x201D; [found myself], as you would say, or yet &#x201C;<foreign>hefted</foreign>&#x201D; [adjusted] to my new <foreign><hi rend="italic">gang</hi></foreign> [way of life]. The consequence is considerable irregularity in regard to health, and of course to spirits and life generally. I have not yet learned to exist here without drugs; and this to you will express the whole essence of my situation. Now if I were quite certain that this was to be my fate henceforth, I think I might in some measure reconcile myself to it, and begin to live like a wise man, on the remaining portion of my resources however small: but such is by no means the case; for I still keep hoping and meeting with disappointment: I adopt resolutions of living which are beyond my power of executing, and am forced to abandon them in mortification and chagrin. Give me time, I say still, give me time! Surely, surely there is nothing so untoward and unmanageable in my circumstances as to excite despair of regulating them into happiness and order! Except this one consideration of drug-taking, I have positively nothing in the world to complain of. My good little wife is the best of all wives: I declare I am astonished at the affection she bears me, and the patience <pb id="pg-04-157" n="04:157"/>with which she listens to my doleful forebodings and turns them all into gay hopes. In <hi rend="italic">every</hi> thing great and little she gives me entirely my own way; asking, as it seems, nothing more whatever of her destiny, but that in any way she could make me happy. Good little girl! Sometimes too we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> very happy; in our trim quiet house, sitting by our own tea, with a good book in my hand, and a clear fire on the hearth, I feel as if all would be well, and far better than my best expectations. From her I can anticipate no hindrance in any arrangement of my life I may see good to adopt: I firmly believe, in the poorest cottage of Scotland, with me happy beside her, she would be the blithest wife in Scotland too. Courage, therefore, I say to myself: one way or other, it must and shall be ordered for good! Give me a little time to sift it and settle it all, and then to fasten on it with rigid perseverance, and the evils of my lot will at length be beneath my feet! On the whole I ought to be ashamed of complaint: a hundred times in my life I have been far worse in health than I am, and never half so well in all other particulars. In spite of my drugs, I sleep quite passably in our giant bed; and were it not that I am so overanxious to be <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, I should not let my <hi rend="italic">illness</hi> discompose me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton comments as follows on Carlyle&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;These minute details as to his health were naturally and kindly given by Carlyle to still his Mother&#x2019;s anxieties. She was extravagantly apprehensive and pitying, and always full of needless solicitude concerning her absent children. On a wet night, she would give a sigh and say &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Sirs</hi>, what a night! What will become of poor <hi rend="italic">so and so</hi>?&#x2019; and if her children were all safe within doors, and she knew of no person likely to get wet, she would begin to compassionate the cattle and worry her heart about them.&#x2014; This disposition of his Mother&#x2019;s had undoubtedly an ill-effect on Carlyle in comfirming his tendency to dwell on the conditions of his health.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Now this, my dear Mother, is the worst and the very worst; and so having told it you, my conscience is at rest, and I beg very earnestly that your <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> would be kind enough to exaggerate no whit of it, for in very truth if you saw me you would think far <hi rend="italic">less</hi> evil of me than this letter will give rise to. Fear nothing, my dear Mother! We are all living and life-like, and honest and true, having injured no man, fearing or hating no man, and owing no man anything but love. By and by it will all be right and well, one way or other; for I feel within me strength to regulate a destiny twenty times as complex and perverse, when once I have seen clearly <hi rend="italic">what it is</hi>.</p>
<p>Of my employments I can tell you little: sometimes I read, sometimes I write a little (generally burning it in disgust soon after), often I walk; for they are on the starving system with me, and in truth I <pb id="pg-04-158" n="04:158"/>find it better than any other. We were sadly at a loss for eggs here, and I tried to give them up; but Jane went out into the country, and found a supply of the newest; and I eat one (at the easy charge of 1&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi>) every morning. We have also sour milk and sweet to our porridge, as of old. The cheese and the butter came on Monday; the butter, except the <foreign><hi rend="italic">top-spale</hi></foreign> [top of the box], is as good as any in Britain; and for the cheese by the votes of all eaters, no better was ever made in Dunlop itself. I for my share think it very considerably the best I ever tasted of Dumfriesshire manufacture. They have also sent us a good pot of Butter yesterday from Templand; so that we are now well supplied.</p>
<p>The Book is not yet published, tho&#x2019; I have nothing more to do with it. Tait does not seem to have made up his mind completely as to the time, tho&#x2019; I suppose it will be shortly. You shall have a copy by the earliest conveyance. When it is published I purpose sending copies of it to some of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">literati</hi></foreign> here, and perhaps procuring their acquaintance. I have more than one scheme <supplied>[of]</supplied> employment; but I suppose none can take effect till after the &#x201C;German <supplied>[Ro]</supplied>mance&#x201D; is out. Tait is very fond of a Literary Newspaper but I have given him small encouragement. Brewster is not yet come to Town. Of other visitors we have not wanted plenty; but except news from James Johnston (who seems to be doing very well), they have told us nothing of any moment.</p>
<p>I despair of getting from my Mother any as satisfactory account of her affairs, as this I have now sent of mine. Will you make Alick write, and tell me all that can be told in a letter? How do you manage? Does Mary make you a cup of good tea every morning? Tell her I will never forgive her, if I learn on coming down that she has neglected it. For coming down we certainly are, early in summer to make a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> visit, perhaps far longer than you are expecting. Unless we can get you rolled up hither this winter (which I do not altogether despair of), we shall get no full and satisfactory news of each other till then. But <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, indeed, there will be a talking and a telling!&#x2014; Jack came some day last week; tired and half-sleeping, but otherwise quite well. He strolls about reading and rambling; sometimes giving me counsel, sometimes mixing me up <hi rend="italic">bitters</hi>. He is a favourite with Jane, and I think makes us happier here. He purposed taking share of this sheet to write to you: but he is gone out, and at any rate I have no room.&#x2014; Alick will write the first hour he can spare, and give us <pb id="pg-04-159" n="04:159"/>news of all and <supplied>[sun]</supplied>dry. My trusty Alick! tell him we are not parted yet, nor ever shall be. Is Father still with you busied with the millshed? Present my kindest love to him; and to all the rest from Jenny upwards. Why should I name them, their figures, their kind faces and kind hearts are all present to me; may every blessing be with them here and hereafter!&#x2014; But I must end: I promised Jane a postscript, and you see how little room is left. <closer><salute>Good b&#x2019;ye, then, my Dear Mother; consider this as a <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> letter, and you will find the purport of it not <hi rend="italic">black</hi> but <hi rend="italic">whitish</hi>. I am forever&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear new Mother</salute></p>
<p>Every day since we came here I have purposed writing to you, and every day have put off till a better morrow. I wished to send you glad tidings of great joy;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The acknowledgement of your kind attention in regard to those Books you forwarded me into Dumfriesshire is a debt which for several months has lain heavy on my conscience. The more so, as Messrs Perthes &#x26; Besser are still unpaid, and a pecuniary obligation is superadded to your other claims on me. Unable to discover any method of paying my little debt to your Booksellers, I had determined to postpone interfering with it at all, till the publication of my &#x201C;German Romance&#x201D; should enable me at the same time to transmit you a copy of that work, to which you had so kindly contributed your assistance. Happily Mr Aiken,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken.</note> whom I met with lately, affords me an earlier opportunity of transacting this necessary business; an opportunity the more gratifying, as the coming out of that same &#x201C;German Romance&#x201D; which has already lain printed almost three months, is still put off to an uncertain distance, the Publisher being seized with alarm at our late commercial distresses, and doubly and trebly anxious to catch &#x201C;the right season&#x201D; (when London is at the fullest) for sending it forth to the world. Mr Aiken has also been obliging enough to undertake settling with Messrs Perthes and Besser for me; so that now I hope the whole matter may be satisfactorily adjusted.</p>
<p>I will not weary you with thanks for your kindness in this affair; but only wish from my heart that your own concerns may some time or other put it in my power to repay the service, and to shew you not in word but in deed what sense I entertain of it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Also nichts mehr davon</hi></foreign> [But nothing more of this]!</p>
<p>Some singular fatality must have attended those book-packets: they came, <hi rend="italic">both together</hi>, in the month of <date when="1826-08"><hi rend="italic">August</hi></date>; and the post-letter which you referred to has never come yet! I suspect it must have been the fault of the Custom House officers in Leith, that the Books were detained so long; a fault which I shall study to obviate in future negociations; and the mail-letter must either have sunk at sea, or dropped thro&#x2019; the fingers of our Hamburg or London Postmasters, a contingency not indeed to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> obviated, but which is happily of rare occurrence. As it was, <hi rend="italic">Hoffmann</hi> and the rest arrived about six weeks <pb id="pg-04-161" n="04:161"/>after copies of them had come from Leipzig; and what was doubly provoking the <hi rend="italic">Life of Richter</hi> was just <hi rend="italic">two days</hi> later in coming to hand than the <hi rend="italic">Introductory Chapter on Jean Paul</hi> in going to press! It is thus that the most cunning contrivances of mortals are dissipated into vanity, and gross officers of Customs can frustrate the most kind exertions of Friends! Yet I must beg you to pardon those B<supplied>[o]</supplied>eotian<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among the Greeks, the Boeotians had the reputation of being extremely dull and stupid.</note> persons, as I have long since done: they knew not the mischief they were occasioning, or the good they were preventing; and this proof of your obliging and really friendly attention to my wants was so valuable to me, that I could not but heartily thank the Leith <foreign><hi rend="italic">Douaniers</hi></foreign> [customs officers] for transmitting it to me on any terms.</p>
<p>Of my Translations and Criticisms, which we have now agreed to distinguish by the title of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">German Romance: Specimens of its Chief Authors,&#x201D;</hi> &#x26;c I shall not at present trouble you with any farther description; hoping in a few weeks to shew you the article itself; and with all my imperfections, to gain from you the credit of at least having <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> to do your countrymen justice. I have ventured also to prophecy that this merit will ere long be much more common than it is at present, or lately; for one of the most striking features of our present literary spirit, and as I think by no means the most unpromising one, is our decidedly increasing attention to German: I should suppose that within the last ten years (since the publication of Madame de St&#xE4;el&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Allemagne</hi>)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1813">1813</date>.</note> the number of German scholars among us has increased fully tenfold; and to judge from actual appearances the increase is going on at present in a still more rapid ratio. In a few years, we shall know you, as you know us; and England will no longer disgrace itself by talking of Germany as unwisely as of Japan.</p>
<p>A proof of this fast increasing attention to German is the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> Selections of German Tales, which last year were all in the press at one time. Except mine, these works are all published; and if in general they meet with but a sorry reception, one can hardly deny that it is little worse than they merit; and even the absurdest of them must contribute to awaken curiosity, and promote a wider and juster survey of your Literature. You ask me the names of these my brethren Translators: <hi rend="italic">Ros</hi>coe<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Roscoe (<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871">1871</date>), editor of <hi rend="italic">German Novelists</hi>, 4 vols.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have not had the smallest particle of intelligence from Scotsbrig since I wrote to you, and long before, yet I know well it is not your blame; but that you are day after day insisting upon Alick to inquire after me, and day after day sending many an anxious wish after me. What ails the recreant that he will not write? Is his time so filled that he cannot spare me an hour? By and by I shall begin to get positively uneasy; half angry at his dilatoriness, and half anxious about your welfare. Meanwhile, I give place to no such thought; but continue to persuade myself that nothing has changed for the worse since I heard; and study to do what little I can for making things better with you, that is to say removing some part of the cares which too much occupy you about myself. I write as usual, the truth and the whole truth.</p>
<p>In fact, my dear Mother, since last letter, I reckon myself to be considerably improved. I am getting more and more habituated to my new condition of life, and discovering more and more how much <pb id="pg-04-165" n="04:165"/>reason I have to be thankful that my lines have fallen to me in such happy places. My health, which for the first few weeks had suffered considerably by the agitations and disquietudes of such a change, seems now to be restored to something like its former state; at least to a state quite as good, for certainly a considerable alteration has taken place in my digestive habitudes, yet such as I do not by any means reckon for the worse; on the contrary I often feel as if I were much better, nay as if in process of time I should grow quite well. I have <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> to sleep as perfectly as ever; I have nearly discontinued the use of drugs again, and really estimating by the scale which I have long been used to, on this point I have no reason to complain. Doubt not, my dear Mother that all will yet be for the best, and that the good purposes of Providence shall not fail to be fulfilled in me. I feel as if I had much to do in this world; not in the vain pursuit of wealth and worldly honours, which are fleeting as the breath that can bestow them; but in the search and declaration of Truth, in such measure as the All-wise shall see meet to impart it to me, and give me means of showing it to others. With such views of my vocation, I have good reason to rejoice in it, and often instead of envying the blind slothful comfort of the men of the world I bless Heaven that I have had strength to see and make choice of the better part. Why should we be troubled about many things, when there is but one thing needful? This <hi rend="italic">one thing</hi> you and I call by different names perhaps; but the meaning of both, I have always asserted, is the same.</p>
<p>Jane continues generally well, and we live in peace and unity, so that it were a pleasure for you to behold us. She is the most compliant and best-hearted of wives; and even in the matter of housekeeping she is gathering science and perfection far faster than any one could have anticipated. Nay already I see not that she is much behind the most expert of those that have all along made those matters their chief study. We are not wealthy, far from it; but then you know as King David sings: &#x201C;the little that a just man hath&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 37:16.</note> &#x26;c. We go to church pretty regularly, tho&#x2019; we failed in getting a seat of our own; and every Sabbath-night (last night, for example) we fail not to read some sermon or other piece of that kind to the assembled household. These are little matters, but to you they will not be indifferent. &#x201C;By the bye,&#x201D; have you got any religious Magazine yet? I have some notion that I could get you a <hi rend="italic">Christian Instructor</hi> on moderate terms: but indeed I do not think it would interest you very much; for it is nearly quite <pb id="pg-04-166" n="04:166"/>full of what Andrew Thomson calls the &#x201C;Apocrypha Controversy&#x201D;; a controversy in which the Reverend Doctor,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Dr. Andrew M. Thomson, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-03-09">9 March 1821</date></ref>. The controversy went on for several years. The Edinburgh committee of the British and Foreign Bible Society refused to countenance the circulation of &#x201C;the adulterated word&#x201D; (i.e., the inclusion of the Apocrypha with the Bible) by any branch of the society.</note> bullying scolding and treading under foot the members of the London Bible Society, shews talents and a spirit much more suitable for a cocker or a horse-couper than a minister of the Gospel. Tell me if there is aught I can do in regard to getting you a Book of this or any other sort.</p>
<p>We have had immense quantities of visitors here, all calling down upon us with one accord the most unexampled blessings of Heaven: some of them are agreeable persons, and with these we purpose keeping up some little quiet intercourse; the rest are of the butterfly tribe, and these we dismiss with fair speeches to flutter forth into some more genial climate. Dr Brewster I have seen more than once; he and his wife were even civil enough to call for us here. The Doctor is in the blackest humour about the &#x201C;badness of the times&#x201D;; as in truth he has some reason to be, being involved in lawsuits with his booksellers, perplexed with delays in his Encyclopedia, and finding publishers so shy of embarking in any of his schemes. These things do not distress me very much: when I hear people mourning over the gloom and misery of the times, I think: Poor fellows, there is a far more pitiable stock of material within ourselves than in the <hi rend="italic">times</hi>; of which so long as we get food and raiment, we have no right to complain. Is there not &#x201C;aye life for a living body&#x201D;?</p>
<p>In fact however I am rather ill off for something to do at present, and I feel convinced clearly enough that this is the great evil I have at present to complain of. I read and study, and keep myself from being idle; but this is not the kind of thing I want; and to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what I want, or even to commence it, I find to be no easy enterprise. Tait<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who was not to publish Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> until <date when="1827">early 1827</date>.</note> also encumbers me a little: the body lingers and hangs off in publishing this Book, which is now quite ready, and waiting only for those everlasting &#x201C;better times&#x201D;; and till it come out there are several of my projected enterprises that cannot take effect. However I suppose he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> move in a little while; and then I shall move too. Perhaps it is better as it is: for if I could heartily commence some <hi rend="italic">book of my own</hi>, of the sort I wished, it would do far more for me than any mere publishing or editorial engagement, how promising soever. Brewster <pb id="pg-04-167" n="04:167"/>still talks of his Literary Newspaper; but I somehow feel as if it would never take effect. I have two or three other things in my eye: of these you may hear more as they assume a clearer shape to myself.</p>
<p>But I have told you enough about Edinburgh: I surely deserve to hear something about you and Scotsbrig. I would ask if you are well, tho&#x2019; I can scarcely hope to hear any better tidings than that you are still in the old state, which I too clearly know is far from well. God grant it be no worse! Does Mary still tend you carefully, and mind the <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> night and morning? Tell her I will never forgive her if she neglect. Tell her this, and she will observe it. How are the rest? What has my Father done with His Honour&#x2019;s moderate demand of &#xa3;100 for damages at Mainhill? What is Alick doing? About to &#x201C;change his state,&#x201D; or to continue as he is? Who stays at Mainhill: Jenny and Mag? There is a purse for Jamie here, if we had any conveyance for it. To Jane I know not what to say: we are still bent on having her here: but my unsettled habits and our whole precarious condition here seem to require our waiting a little till the hurlyburly have completely subsided. Jane, I believe, will write to her when the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> comes down. Can Jenny work <hi rend="italic">muffatees</hi>?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wristlets of knitted wool worn in cold weather.</note> I wear Jean&#x2019;s every frosty day.&#x2014; I hope you get the newspaper on Saturday: henceforth it will come regularly on <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> morning; it is to go round by Templand, and they will send it over to you; it will still be better than none; and my <foreign><hi rend="italic">ganz wohl</hi></foreign> [all&#x2019;s well] (if it please Providence) shall not be wanting. Jack is gone out; but I suppose will add a line or two before the sheet departs. Again and again I desire a letter. <closer><salute>May blessings be with you all! I am ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>I must not let this letter go without adding <hi rend="italic">my</hi> &#x201C;be of good cheer.&#x201D; You would rejoice to see how much better my Husband is, than when we came hither. And we are really very happy; when he falls upon some work we shall be still happier.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Further light is thrown on the situation by Jane&#x2019;s correspondence with Mrs. Montagu. In a letter of <date when="1826-10-20">20 Oct.</date> (postmark <date when="1826-10-23">23 Oct.</date>) Mrs. Montagu had sent her felicitations to Jane: &#x201C;All joy be with you, now and ever, may your confiding love be rewarded by the constant and tender affection of your Husband and may God bless and prosper an Union formed in the spirit of the purest feelings that can redeem fallen human nature&#x2014; You are still unseen and a Shadow, but I have met your Husband face to face, you are indeed one to me, for you are the Soul and gentle spirit, of that most wise and metaphysical body, and it is of less moment to me that his good-looking eyes ever more scowled at me with a doubting glance, since she who is mistress and arbitress of his destiny &#x2018;believes tho&#x2019; she hath not seen&#x2019; with a Faith, that springing from generous and trusting kindness carries with it its own great reward&#x2014; We lead the Blind <hi rend="italic">most</hi> gently, and many times, when I saw this excellent man in a mist, wholly bewildered, and wandering with the utmost determination away, from the two persons in London who best loved him (Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> excepted) I could have folded my arms round him, and said &#x2018;Wilful Man this is your real home.&#x2019;&#x2014; The next step was to substitute some person whom he did not hate, and that was John Badams, to whom I wrote, and who soon satisfied himself, that my opinion of the sterling worth of Thomas Carlyle was not ill-founded. I shall write to tell Badams of your marriage, he is well acquainted with you, and will one day rejoice to see you&#x2014;&#x201D; But in her letter written in reply, Jane seems to have expressed some concern about Carlyle, for Mrs. Montagu says in her letter of <date when="1826-12-08">8 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I grieve that my fears proved true, and that your long silence has been caused by your anxiety for your Husband:&#x2014; You are new to the sad face of sorrow, and long may it be before you make a nearer acquaintance with her hard features.&#x201D; Jane&#x2019;s letter and most of her other letters to Mrs. Montagu have not come to light.

<salute>My Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I must not let the day pass without congratulating you on your great purpose, and expressing my truest wishes that all its hopefulness may be realized. You and I have often spoken of marriage, and agreed on its necessity for the well-being of literary as well as other men. From what I know of your circumstances, and the character of your fair Betrothed,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Murray, daughter of Alexander Murray of Wigton.</note> I can augur no otherwise than <hi rend="italic">well</hi> of this event; and certainly I shall welcome you with the right hand of old Friendship into this Land of Matrimony, whither it was your duty to have shown <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the road, not learned it of me.</p>
<p>Doubt not that my Jane will be among the first to pay her respects to your Lady; and that the two wives will learn to like each other as the husbands have long done. For the present, she bids me offer you her best wishes, and &#x201C;she hopes&#x201D; (do not think!) &#x201C;that you will be <hi rend="italic">as</hi> fortunate in the choice of a wife as I have been&#x201D;!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me ever,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Certain documents, technically called &#x201C;Compliments of the season,&#x201D; induce me to wish very much that you would have the kindness to settle with me for that <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> of ours as soon as possible. <pb id="pg-04-170" n="04:170"/>True it is, till the work actually see the light I can make no <hi rend="italic">demand</hi> on you: but at the same time, as I naturally enough calculated on having this sum in my possession several months ago, I hope you will not object to the arrangement now proposed; more especially as, the time for publication being at length fixed and near, a <hi rend="italic">present</hi> settlement on equitable principles of allowance will not be difficult to manage.</p>

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>At length my most nervous bookseller has determined, even in these &#x201C;worst of times,&#x201D; as he calls them, on sending forth his literary cargo; a heroic resolution which he has not adopted till after the most painful consultation, and after calculating as if by astrological science the propitious day and minute indicated by the horoscope of the work. I know not whether it is right to laugh at this poor profit-and-loss philosopher in his pitiable quandary; for his one true God being Mammon, he does worship him with an edifying devoutness; but, at all events, I may rejoice that this favourable conjunction of the stars has at length actually occurred, which after four months&#x2019; imprisonment in Ballantyne&#x2019;s warehouses now takes this feeble concern finally off my hands, and enables me among many other important duties to discharge not the least important one, that of paying my debt to you.</p>
<p>I have really owed you long, but you are a patient creditor, and know too, I am persuaded, that though letters are the symbol of attention and regard, the thing signified may often exist in full strength without the sign. Indeed, indeed, my dear Madam, I am not mad enough to forget you, the more I see of the world and myself the less tendency have I that way, the more do I feel that in this my wilderness journeys I have found but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Mrs. Montagu, and that except in virtue of peculiar good fortune I had no right to calculate on even finding one. A hundred times do I regret that you are not here, or I <pb id="pg-04-171" n="04:171"/>there: but I say to myself, we shall surely meet again on this side the wall of Night, and you will find me wiser and I shall know you better, and love and reverence you more. Meantime, as conscience whispers, what are protestations? Nothing, or worse than nothing: therefore let us leave them.</p>
<p>Of my late history I need not speak, for you already know it: I am wedded to the best of wives, and with all the elements of enjoyment richly ministered to me, and health&#x2014;rather worse than even it was wont to be. Sad contradiction! But I were no apt scholar if I had not learned long ago with my friend Tieck that &#x201C;in the fairest sunshine a shadow chases us, that in the softest music there is a tone which chides.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I wish to escape the shadow which, amid the sunshine, threatens us; the wild tones which, amid the softest music, chide us&#x201D; (Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of Tieck&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Trusty Eckart&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">German Romance, Works</hi>, XXI, 315).</note></p>
<p>I sometimes hope that I shall be well: at other times I determine to be wise in spite of sickness, and feel that wisdom is better even than health, and I dismiss the lying cozener Hope entirely, and fancy I perceive that even the rocky land of Sorrow is not without a heavenly radiance overspreading it, lovelier than aught that this earth with all its joys can give us. At all events, what right have we to murmur? It is the common lot: the Persian King<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not indentified.</note> could not find three happy men in the wide world to write the names of on his queen&#x2019;s tomb, or the Philosopher would have recalled her from death. Every son of Adam has his task to toil at, and his stripes to bear for doing it wrong. There is one deadly error we commit on our entrance on life, and sooner or later we must lay it aside, for till then there is neither peace nor rest for us in this world: we all start, I have observed, with the tacit persuasion that whatever become of others, we (the illustrious all-important <hi rend="italic">we</hi>) are entitled of <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">entirely fortunate</hi>, to accumulate all knowledge, beauty, health, and earthly felicity in <hi rend="italic">our</hi> sacred person, and so pass <hi rend="italic">our</hi> most sovereign days in rosy bowers, with Distress never seen by us, except as an interesting shade in the distance of our landscape. Alas! what comes of it? Providence will not treat us thus, nay, with reverence be it spoken, cannot treat us thus, and so we fight and fret against His laws, and cease not from our mad, romancing delusion, till Experience have beaten it out of us with many chastisements.</p>
<p>Most indeed never fully unlearn it all their days, but continue to the last to believe that, in their lot in life thay are <hi rend="italic">unjustly</hi> treated, <pb id="pg-04-172" n="04:172"/>and cease not from foolish hopes, and still stand in new amazement that they should be disappointed&#x2014;so very strangely, so <hi rend="italic">unfairly</hi>! This class is certainly the most pitiable of all, for an Action of Damages against Providence is surely no promising lawsuit.</p>
<p>But I must descend from Life in general to Life in Edinburgh. In spite of ill-health, I reckon myself moderately happy here, much happier than men usually are, or than such a fool as I deserves to be. My good wife exceeds all my hopes and is in truth I believe among the best women that the world contains. The philosophy of the heart is far better than that of the understanding. She loves me with her whole soul, and this one sentiment has taught her much that I have long been vainly at the Schools to learn. Good Jane! She is sitting by me knitting you a purse: you must not cease to love her, for she deserves it, and few love you better. Of society in this modern Athens we have no want, but rather a superabundance, which however we are fast and successfully reducing down to the fit measure. True it is, one meets with many a Turk in grain among these people: but it is some comfort to know beforehand that Turks are, have been, and for ever will be; and to understand that from a Turk no Christian word or deed can rationally be expected. Let the people speak in the Turkish dialect, in Heaven&#x2019;s name! It is their own, and they have no other. A better class of persons, too, are to be found here and there; a sober, discreet, logic-loving, moderately well-informed class: with these I talk and enjoy myself; but only talk as from an upper window to people on the street; into the house (of my spirit) I cannot admit them; and the unwise wonderment they exhibit when I do but show them the lobby, warns me to lose no time in again slamming-to the door. But what of society? Round our own hearth is society enough, with a blessing. I read books, or like the Roman Poet and so many British ones &#x201C;disport on paper&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gaius Valerius Catullus (<date>84?&#x2013;54 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi>, L, 2 (<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Multum lusimus in meis tabellis&#x201D;</hi>).</note> and many a still evening when I stand in our little flowergarden (it is fully larger than two bed-quilts), and smoke my pipe in peace, and look at the reflection of the distant city lamps, and hear the faint murmur of its tumult, I feel no little pleasure in the thought of &#x201C;my own four walls,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;My Own Four Walls,&#x201D; which seems to have been written in the autumn of <date when="1829">1829</date> and to relate to Craigenputtoch, where the &#x201C;whinstone house&#x201D; is his &#x201C;castle&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 355&#x2013;56).</note> and what they hold.</p>
<p>On the whole, what I chiefly want is occupation; which when &#x201C;the times grow better,&#x201D; or my own &#x201C;genius&#x201D; gets more alert and thorough-going <pb id="pg-04-173" n="04:173"/>will not fail, I suppose, to present itself. Idle I am not altogether, yet not occupied as I should be; for to dig in the mines of Plutus, and sell the gift of God (and such is every man&#x2019;s small fraction of intellectual talent) for a piece of money is a measure I am not inclined to; and for <hi rend="italic">invention</hi>, for Art of any sort I feel myself too helpless and undetermined. Some day&#x2014;O that the day were here!&#x2014;I shall surely speak out these things that are lying in me, and giving me no sleep till they are spoken! Or else if the Fates would be so kind as show me&#x2014;that I had nothing to say! This perhaps is the real secret of it after all; a hard result, yet not intolerable, were it once clear and certain. Literature, it seems, is to be my trade: but the present aspects of it among us seem to me peculiarly perplexed and uninviting. I love it not: in fact I have almost quitted modern reading; lower down than the Restoration I rarely venture in English. These men, these Hookers, Bacons, Brownes were <hi rend="italic">men</hi>; but for our present &#x201C;men of letters,&#x201D; our dandy wits, our utilitarian philosophers, our novel, play, sonnet and song manufacturers, I shall only say: May the Lord pity us and them! But enough of this! For what am I that I should censure? Less than the least in Israel.</p>
<p>It is time that I devote a word or two to others, having spent the whole sheet on myself. You say nothing of your health: am I to consider you as recovered? I dare scarcely believe it: yet perhaps you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> recovering. Alas! sorrow has long been familiar to you; and ill-health is but one of the many forms under which it too frequently pursues such beings from the cradle to the grave. But the heart too, according to the old similitude, is sometimes like a spicy flower, which yields not its sweetest perfume till it be <hi rend="italic">crushed</hi>. Of Charles&#x2019; history at Cambridge I am sorry to hear, tho&#x2019; it does not surprise me much, or in any way diminish my faith in his character and capabilities.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter to Jane of <date when="1826-12-08">8 Dec.</date> Mrs. Montagu had written: &#x201C;Mr Carlyle knows that my fears for my boy Charles, were at least as strong as my hopes, and that when he was sent to Cambridge, three years younger than the men he had to compete with, I was almost certain the issue would be very unsatisfactory&#x2014;he has defied all College rules, and upon being reprimanded for inattention, has written to the Tutors to say &#x2018;the Lectures were so paltry he did not think them worth hearing&#x2019; for this he would have been expelled, only from love of his Father the Head of his College interposed to prevent it.&#x201D;</note> It shows only that venerating Science and this alone, he has formed too lofty an estimate of its Expositors and Institutions: he looked for sages, such as are not to be found on this clay Planet; he meets with Drivellers, and his heart is too proud to yield their gowns and maces what it denies their minds. He is far too proud, poor fellow; and that <pb id="pg-04-174" n="04:174"/>is a failing which he must and will lay aside. But what is to be done with him for the present? At Cambridge in his present mood, he must not continue; in Edinburgh I durst not predict his fate, he might find the right road, or deviate further from it than ever. Again and again I say, if I can be of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> service command me. And in the meanwhile fear not for your stormful, headstrong, highminded boy. There is metal in him which no fire can utterly consume, and one way or other (with more or less suffering to himself, but with certainty as I believe), it will be fused and purified and the wayward youth will be a wise and virtuous man.</p>
<p>I have finished my sheet, and more I must deny myself at present. Will you get these tomes conveyed to Badams,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1826-10-20">20 Oct.</date> Mrs. Montagu had written to Jane that Badams had discovered a method of making glass which had earned him &#xa3;25,000 during the last year and which would in time make him very wealthy. At the same time she reported that Macbeth, the preacher, was &#x201C;a miserable wanderer in the streets of London, after defeating all that benevolence could essay for him.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241214-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-12-14">14 Dec. 1824</date></ref>.</note> my own good Badams, whom I swear I had rather see than any ten men in England? I have begged of him to write, but I know he will not: my good wishes are always with him. From you I expect better things, being minded to become a better correspondent myself. <closer><salute>Will you make my kindest compliments to Mr. Montagu, and all your household, and believe me ever, my dear Madam,</salute></closer></p>

I would give twenty pounds to see you <pb id="pg-04-175" n="04:175"/>for half a day. Why will you not write to me? I feel as if I could promulgate more of my secret mind to you than to any other living man almost: and yet of all my friends you are the one that have <hi rend="italic">said</hi> fewest kind things to me. How is it? It is those clear blue friendly eyes of yours, and that ever-helpful hand; the spirit always ready with act and counsel in the hour of need! May God bless you, my dear Badams! Tho&#x2019; I never see you more, I would not part with you for money or money&#x2019;s worth.</p>
<p>But will you never come to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, never come and see my wife, who loves you almost as much as I do? At least you might write; tho&#x2019; it were but: &#x201C;Dear Sir, I am still alive, and remain &#x26;c&#x201D;; even this were worth something. Good sooty Brummagem [Birmingham]! Honest old Warwickshire! I shall love them all the days of my life.</p>
<p>Is Taffy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A horse on which Carlyle had ridden when he had visited Badams in Birmingham.</note> still above ground, and stationed beside the Colour-mill? I wish you could pack him up, stable and all, and send him hither by Mail or van: I would prize him next to Hyppogriff and Pegasus; higher than all earthly steeds. And Tom, the pigeon? Alas there is no continuance here for any of us, winged or wingless; and Tom is perhaps ere now gathered to his fathers!</p>
<p>I feel a strange pleasure in thinking of all these things, and a mad hope that even yet they are not utterly lost to me. I will write again ere long, tho&#x2019; you will not. Meanwhile a truce to this babbling, for the hour is come! My kind regards to your Brother, and the good Mrs Barnet.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I stand indebted to you for two letters, to say nothing of the ample supply of kitchen ware which attended the last, and of which we have all this very day been enjoying portion. The tardy resolution of Mr Tait at length enables me to acknowledge your claims: our wavering Bookseller has determined on publishing on the <date when="1827-01-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of January</date>; the Books are all shipped for London, and I have brought over one today to send down for the amusement of your winter evenings at Scotsbrig. My sincere wish is that you may find in it twenty times the satisfaction its intrinsic worth can give you: of the writer, I know, you will not fail to think with all the favour he can desire.</p>
<p>I have to give you many thanks for your letters, and to beg that you would not let me want for the like in future. Consider that I have now no news from home at all except thro&#x2019; you, and that go whither I may the most interesting spot the sun shines on must be the one where you are all gathered. We have been united, more closely than is usual even with brothers; nor is it impossible (for who can tell what changes the flight of future days<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 221&#x2013;22.</note> may bring?) that we may be so again; and however separated in place, I will always believe that while existing in the world together we can never be divided in interest and affection. Therefore mind your writing, my good fellow; and let me have no farther remonstrances to make on the score of remissness in that particular.</p>
<p>You promised to tell me at large of your purposes and projects for an arrangement of your future life. As I anticipated, you have yet <pb id="pg-04-177" n="04:177"/>come to no final resolution; and herein I think you are wise; for truly this is a time, when it is not easy to resolve on any arrangement, and in your case, so far as I can understand, <hi rend="italic">there is nothing spoiling by delay</hi>. This is an important consideration; especially as you seem yet free to select and reject. The state of your views, I believe, I had partly guessed already: your neighbour&#x2019;s &#x201C;dark-haired daughter&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rachel Ritchie, whom Carlyle speaks of in a letter to John dated <date when="1826-10-25">25 Oct.</date> as living on the neighboring farm of Purdhamston. Although Alick became serious, perhaps engaged, by <date when="1827-04-16">16 April</date> of the next year he had lost interest in her. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280825-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-08-25">25 Aug. 1828</date></ref>.</note> has all along been an <hi rend="italic">especial</hi> favourite with me, and had I to choose between two such rivals, I should not long hesitate. Yet there are many, many other things to be considered, and allowed to have their full weight in the scale: and on the whole, I am inclined to think, true affection on the part of the <hi rend="italic">wife</hi> is perhaps even more essential than on that of the husband; certainly far more important than any shewy allurements and external qualification, which (unlike Mrs Primrose&#x2019;s gown)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Vicar of Wakefield</hi>, first paragraph.</note> cast a fine dash at first, but after two or three on-puttings are forgotten or fade away. One thing I will advise: Do nothing unjustly, do nothing rashly! Decide not till your path is clear, that too-late repentance may not visit you. God send us all well and honestly settled, in due season! Meanwhile remember you have determined to do nothing without hearing my advice.</p>
<p>Of my own proceedings here I have little that can be considered definite to tell you. I am not unwell, not worse than I used to be in health; and my good helpmate is all to me that I could wish. But as yet I have no occupation! There lies the rub: and truly if you heard the Bookselling tribe talk about the &#x201C;badness of the times,&#x201D; you would think there was never more to be any occupation for literary men in this world. Poor Dr Brewster, when I saw him, was absolutely distraugh<supplied>[t]</supplied>; so balefully were &#x201C;black inquietudes&#x201D; hunting him to and fro. The man committed an error at first, which I have avoided: he commenced on too liberal a scale; and has all along too faithfully observed Will Brand&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Will Brand of Craighouse, about a mile east of Scotsbrig. William and the other Brands&#x2014;James and Peggy&#x2014;were related to the Carlyles through Robert Brand.</note> maxim, To expect his comfort rather in living <hi rend="italic">above</hi> his income than below it. An unwise arrangement, from whence flow many tears! Nevertheless, I am not a whit downcast in spirit: employment I firmly believe will come sometime; in the meanwhile I study <hi rend="italic">not to be idle</hi>, and determine like a wise Christian man, <pb id="pg-04-178" n="04:178"/>to cut my coat according to the cloth; and hard it will go with us, if even from this scanty well sufficient covering for all <hi rend="italic">real</hi> uses cannot be found. In a general way I am comparatively very much at my ease here; when <hi rend="italic">billusness</hi> allows me a respite I am even happy. For I have long learned to cease expecting what I once thought <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> on this earthly ball; long known that there is a root of bitterness in the bottom of our cup, which all the honey in the Earth cannot hide from the experienced palate. Happy he who learns to drink it without wincing! Happier and wiser who can see that in this very bitterness there is a medicine for his soul, far better than the bitterness of gentian or bark or any of Jacks many bitters for his body! There is much true philosophy in Dermot&#x2019;s remark to his unruly neighbour: &#x201C;I say Paddy Blane, <hi rend="italic">will</hi> ye compose yourself to your <foreign><hi rend="italic">pratees</hi></foreign> [potatoes] there!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Such is a sketch of my philosophy of life! But could you not come up hither some frosty week, and learn it all far better by word of mouth? I assure you, we could accommodate you very prettily; and depend on it, your new sister would give you the heartiest welcome. Positively there is a spare bed here! And you would see Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and Macwhirter and all of us, and might stay at Hawick the first night, and walk hither so neatly before the next. Really if you are doing nothing for a week, what might hinder you? And I and all of us would find it so pleasant. Think of it, before the spring, and the busy seed time when you cannot come.</p>
<p>Two days ago we had a visit from the <hi rend="italic">Targer</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Johnston.</note> He is an exemplary character, the Targer, and bears the matrimonial yoke, as he has borne many other yokes in his time, with an edifying composure. From all hands we learn that he is doing well. Poor fellow! it is no hi<supplied>[gh]</supplied> happiness that he covets; and foul befall the man <supplied>[who]</supplied> would grudge him his innocent and humble one! His &#x201C;Jenny&#x201D; is doing extremely well: he was buying chairs and gowns and mustard, and reminded me much, as I looked upon him, of Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Quintus Fixlein</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">German Romance, Works</hi>, XXII, 281&#x2013;83.</note> All hands are for marriage this season, let the &#x201C;times&#x201D; be as bad as they will. Little Murray was married last week; and today Jane and I were up calling on the new couple in their hired house, where they propose keeping boarders if such are to be had, and if not, like the rest of us&#x2014;trusting to Providence. The new wife is from Wigtonshire; was a Miss Murray, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the old one he was engaged to, <pb id="pg-04-179" n="04:179"/>but a younger <hi rend="italic">sister</hi>. Fair exchange&#x2014;no robbery. They speak of Mitchell next: but as Jack says, it may be strongly <hi rend="italic">doubted</hi>.</p>
<p>About four weeks ago, I had a call from our two unprosperous and not very deserving Cousins &#x201C;Wullie and John.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably paternal, with the surname Brown, descendants of TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Aunt Fanny,&#x201D; who had married William Brown.</note> I know not whether I acted right in never inviting them in; for this was one of those <hi rend="italic">new</hi> scenes, in which one is not certain of the part he has to play. I regretted it afterwards. And yet what could I do? There was no harm whatever in the men being poor: but there was harm in their being <foreign><hi rend="italic">skites</hi></foreign> [unpleasant people]; and dogbreakers are a class of creatures whom no accident of relationship can render me tolerant of. Since that day I have not seen them again: I did not speak unkindly to them, but I did not encourage them to return.</p>
<p>I am in doubt whether to send this packet by the Mail, or along with the boxes by the Carrier. I shall have to inquire tomorrow about his probable arrival, and then decide. However it may be, you will not fail to write whenever this reaches you. I have many things to ask, far too many for the <hi rend="italic">salvage</hi> of a sheet. Have you sold Larry yet? There is a horse I meet often here which recalls the wild beast to memory. And is Keevil<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Keevil was &#x201C;a wandering, innocent creature from the Gloucester cloth countries latterly, who came to my father&#x2019;s in a starving state, and managed gently to stay five or six months&#x2014;a favourite, and study, with us younger ones&#x201D; (Carlyle, as quoted in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 97).</note> still with you? I positively intended buying him some snuff, but feared lest it might interfere with the other wares in the parcel. Will you give him this half-crown, instead, secretly, as a new-years gift from me to the trusty marine; to buy him awls and darning-needles, and otherwise keep his pocket? His heart would rejoice in the prospect of war; but there is to be none. Do you get the newspaper regularly? It is meant to come to you on Monday morning.&#x2014; Up to this night, I purposed to give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> this Book, my Dear Alick; but recollecting that our Father had never got aught of the sort from me, I seemed to feel it my duty to give it to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. He will not read it, I know, but others of you will, and he will like better to see it. For a new-year&#x2019;s gift <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, therefore, have nothing my dear Brother but a new assurance of my Love. But this, I know you will not reject. <closer><salute>Be content with it; come and see us if you can; and believe me always,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your true Brother. /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>At length Tait has given me an opportunity of sending off the weary Book, and along with it, of writing you a word or two to inquire after your welfare and assure you of my own. The <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> I have inscribed to my Father, tho&#x2019; I know that he will not read a line of it: from you, however, I hope better things; and at any rate, I have sent you a Book, which I am sure you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> read; because it relates to a really good man, and one engaged in a cause which all men must reckon good. You must accept this <hi rend="italic">Life of Henry Martyn</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sargent, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Rev. Henry Martyn</hi> (<date when="1819">1819</date>). Henry Martyn (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812">1812</date>) was a celebrated missionary to India and Persia who translated portions of the Bible into Persian and some other Oriental languages.</note> as a New-year&#x2019;s gift from me; and while reading it, believe that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> son also is a kind of missionary in his way; not to the Heathen of India, but to the British Heathen, an innumerable class, whom he would gladly do something to convert, if so were his perplexities and manifold infirmities would give him leave! We must wait patiently, and study to do what service we can, not despising the day of small things,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zech. 4:10.</note> but meekly trusting that hereafter it may become the day of greater.</p>
<p>I need not tell you how glad I was to learn that you are still in moderately good health, and living in such peace and quiet as this bustling, fluctuating life of ours can be expected to afford. Give my best thanks to Mary for her punctuality, and assure her that I will one day endeavour to repay her. She is a good lassie, and a quickhanded; and has as true a heart as any that lives. She was once my nurse and faithful waiting-maid; and her punctuality in that station I have not yet forgotten.</p>
<p>We are all well enough here, except perhaps the Doctor, who (shame on his medicine!) is scarcely so well as he used to be at Scotsbrig, and for the last two or three days at least has been complaining of unsound bowels. By opium, however, I believe he has cured himself.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote to Alexander on the same day: &#x201C;I am in the most deplorable state of stupidity from the influence of drugs &#x26;c.&#x201D;</note> I have been lecturing him about his remissness in writing, this morning and last night; and now I suppose he will take pen in hand, <pb id="pg-04-181" n="04:181"/>and answer in his own person for his own concerns. At present he is reclining in state, in his grey gown, reading a German book, with Jane sitting sewing caps at his side.</p>
<p>I am beginning to be very instant for some sort of occupation, which indeed forms my chief want at present. When the Book is fairly out, I must stir the waters, and see what is to be done. Many, many plans I have: but few of them, I doubt, are likely to prove acceptable at present, the &#x201C;times&#x201D; are so bad, and bookselling trade so dull. Something however I will fix upon; for work is as essential to me as meat and drink. Of money we are not in want: the other morning Mrs Welsh sent us a letter with sixty pounds inclosed, fearing lest cleanness of teeth might be ready to overtake us! I thought it extremely kind and handsome; but we returned the cash, with many thanks, wishing to &#x201C;fight our own battle,&#x201D; at least till the season of need arrived.</p>
<p>I have not said a word yet about your kind Scotsbrig package: it was all right and in order; only that a few of the eggs (the box not being completely stuffed and firm) had suffered by the carriage: most part of these Jane has already converted into <hi rend="italic">custards, pancakes</hi> and other the like ware; the others I am eating and find excellent. A woman comes here weekly with fresh stock to us, and I eat just one daily, the price being 15<hi rend="italic">d</hi> per dozen.&#x2014; Now, my Dear Mother, you must make Alick write to me, without any undue delay; and tell me all and every thing that is going on with himself or any of you. Wish all hands (from Mag down to Jenny) a happy new-year in my name; and assure them all, one by one, that I will love them truly all my days. <closer><salute>I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>My conscience had begun to reproach me for my long silence, and I was about to write this day, without regard to the commercial principle of Debtor and Creditor, well knowing your bustle about this season, when to quicken my resolve your gratifying letter came to <pb id="pg-04-182" n="04:182"/>hand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1827-01-30">30 Jan.</date> Alexander wrote: &#x201C;Our Father will be enabled to meet <hi rend="italic">him</hi> his &#x2018;Honour&#x2019; on the rent day which occures in about a fortnight. &#x2026; I wished greatly to have it in my power, before writting, to tell you of our final settlement with his Honour; but our Arbitors have not been able to meet, tho&#x2019; last saturday was appointed, owing to the boisterous state of the weather. &#x2026; It now appears from the articles of roup (which till lately we never once could get our eyes on) that we have erred in taking two successive white [wheat?] cropes from about ten acres of land last season, about forty acres his Honour calls it &#x2018;silla man&#x2019; and on this alone he founds his claim of 100 guineas of damages more or less<supplied>[.]</supplied> If we have real<supplied>[l]</supplied>y committed an errour, which in justice &#x2018;may be <hi rend="italic">strongly</hi> doubted<supplied>[,]</supplied>&#x2019; It was Blackadder who caused us. He is now far removed from the tricks and villiany of this life having received judgement and justice in Heaven<supplied>[&#x2019;s]</supplied> high court where his Honour&#x2019;s interest a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> influence is unfelt and where no sneaking, pettyfogging, sone of mischief dares to uplift his voice. We agreed to have the thing settled by Arbitration merely to keep us out of the law. Haining is our man and Carruthers of Limekils theirs. The damage will probably amount to &#xa3;15 or 16 and three times that sum at least will be gained from the farm this year bad as it is. We have not yet determined whither or not we will keep it another year. My Father is heartily tired of it. They speak of me going to live there in the event of keeping it and what might hinder Rachel to accompany me tush! tush!!! You judge but too correctly my my [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] dear Brother of the state of my feelings. Would to Heaven that I may be enabled to make proper use of your more than brotherly advice.&#x201D;</note> What a blessing that we are all still in the land of the living, to hope for good, when so many of our fellow mortals are pining in sickness, or struggling with the miseries of famine! It has been an unhealthy winter this in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: there is an epidemic <supplied>[of]</supplied> typhus fever in the city; the Hospital has been found to<supplied>[o]</supplied> narrow to accommodate the poor people, and a temporary receptacle fitted up for them is also almost full. Poor Cron has caught the infection (I suppose, at the Infirmary, for he is studying medicine); and yesterday when Jack called to see him, he was told that the poor fellow had been sent out to lodgings, and was lying among strangers, the shoulder-knotted lackey could not tell exactly where! O let us never murmur so long as we have bread to eat and raiment to put on, and can enjoy the blessed light of Heaven without any to make us afraid! The wealth of Rothschild the Jew can give him nothing more; and without contentment of mind, it cannot give so much.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rothschilds were a wealthy family of German Jews stemming from Meyer Amschel Rothschild (<date when="1743">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812">1812</date>), later members of which spread out over Europe. <hi rend="italic">George Cron</hi> (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">1827</date>) was a student friend and contemporary of Carlyle at Edinburgh. He graduated M.A. on <date when="1816-01-04">4 Jan. 1816</date>, and though Carlyle describes him as a &#x201C;preacher&#x201D; he was not a minister of the Church of Scotland. In <date when="1825">1825</date> he enrolled as a medical student in Edinburgh, but in <date when="1827">1827</date> he caught typhus fever, presumably from his patients, and died in Edinburgh on <date when="1827-02-16">16 Feb. 1827</date>. Carlyle&#x2019;s notice of him appears in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> for <date when="1827-02-27">27 Feb.</date></note></p>
<p>Jane said: &#x201C;How cleverly that Alick writes; but I suppose he must have learned from you.&#x201D; Thus I get the credit to myself, which <pb id="pg-04-183" n="04:183"/>belongs to Nature. But do you never mind whether you write &#x201C;cleverly&#x201D; or not; but continue to tell me of all and sundry in the old style; remembering that it is not the cleverness but the copiousness of your intelligence that chiefly concerns me. Word that all is well in Annandale, tho&#x2019; written with the end of a burnt stick, is better to me than all the wit of poets.</p>
<p>I wish from my heart you were rid of that slender man His Honour of Hoddam, so that one might never have to mention his name, or bring the pitiful enough image of him before one&#x2019;s mind any more! Peace is better than kingdoms; but yet as Schiller says: &#x201C;The peacefullest dwells not in peace if wicked neighbours hinder.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Tell</hi>, IV, iii: &#x201C;<foreign>Es kann der Fr&#xF6;mmste nicht im Frieden bleiben, / Wenn es dem b&#xF6;sen Nachbar nicht gef&#xE4;llt</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> I hope the Arbiters will settle this matter finally, and you will wash your hands of it, and bid His Honour and all His Honour&#x2019;s Whippersin good b&#x2019;ye forever and a day. One thing at least is comfortable: it does not seem that he can do you any great injury, however he may talk; so his snarling is of less moment, when biting is not to be dreaded. The very small individual! But surely the Devil is waiting for him, by and by to &#x201C;show him another road to the well&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably proverbial.</note> and to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> tuition we may safely leave him.</p>
<p>Next letter you must tell me what you are ploughing and sowing, building and pulling down, what you have bought and sold; in short give me a full-length picture of Scotsbrig as it is. My Mother cannot write currently, or I am sure she has a hundred things to say. But tell her, there is a good time coming, and summer will give us all full tidings of each other. Are you sure she is as well and comfortable as of old? Does Mary still mind her with the same steadfast fidelity? Tell that kindest, <foreign><hi rend="italic">glegest</hi></foreign>, and shortest-tempered of Nurses that I shall owe her a <foreign><hi rend="italic">buckling-kame</hi></foreign> [back-comb] of the best quality, if she proves true till I come down. Poor thing! I know she needs no bribe to be so; for a truer-hearted soul never breathed in this Earth; and to me her short temper was many times converted into singular patience and long-suffering.&#x2014; I heard some talk of Jane&#x2019;s coming up hither, as was long since arranged: but the &#x201C;sister&#x201D; will write a postscript herself.</p>
<p>Our situation here at Comley Bank continues to be unexceptionable, nay in many points truly enviable. Ill health is not harder on us than usual, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> other things are almost as one could wish them. It is strange too how one gets habituated to sickness: I bear my pain <pb id="pg-04-184" n="04:184"/>as Christian did his pack in the Pilgrims Progress strapped on too tightly for throwing off; but the straps do not gall me as they once did, and I wander on, enjoying in my walk the beauties of the road, like any other green-wallet. In fact I believe I am rather better, and certainly I have not been happier for many a year. Last week, too, I fairly began&#x2014;a Book!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The unfinished <hi rend="italic">Wotton Reinfred</hi>, that &#x201C;wretched &#x2018;Didactic Novel&#x2019;; which, in spite of all my obstinacy, declared itself desperate soon after this; and was shoved aside for other tasks,&#x2014;and at last bodily into the fire&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>, I, 17&#x2013;18). It was not burned. Carlyle later transferred many of its passages, word for word, into <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, then apparently simply locked it away. In <date when="1856">1856</date> Frederick Martin, an exiled Berliner whom Carlyle befriended and hired as a copyist, stole it (along with other MSS) and presumably sold it. It turned up after Carlyle&#x2019;s death, was first published in the <hi rend="italic">New Review</hi>, VI (<date when="1892-01">Jan</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-03">March 1892</date>), 1&#x2013;30, 141&#x2013;65, 285&#x2013;313, and then republished as a part of <hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi>. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, V, 249&#x2013;51. The manuscript today is in the Pierpont Morgan Library.</note> Heaven only knows what it will turn to; but I have sworn to finish it; and I hope it will be something praiseworthy at last, and tho&#x2019; only a <hi rend="italic">novel</hi> may be one of those that are read by &#x201C;some in Middlebie Paris<hi rend="italic">hon</hi>.&#x201D; You shall hear about it, as it proceeds; but as yet we are only got thro&#x2019; the first chapter. You would wonder how much happier steady occupation makes us, and how smoothly we all get along. Directly after breakfast, the &#x201C;Goodwife&#x201D; and the Doctor evacuate this apartment, and retire up stairs to the drawing-room, a little place all fitted up like a lady&#x2019;s work-box; where a &#x201C;spunk of fire&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Guy Mannering</hi>, chap. xi.</note> is lit for the forenoon; and I meanwhile sit scribbling and meditating, and wrestling with the powers of Dulness, till one or two o&#x2019;clock; when I sally forth into city, or towards the sea-shore, taking care only to be home for the important purpose of consuming my mutton-chop at four. After dinner, we all read learned languages till coffee (which we now often take at night instead of tea), and so on till bed-time, only that Jane often sews; and the Doctor goes up to the celestial globe studying the fixed stars, thro&#x2019; an upshoved window, and generally comes down to his porridge about ten, with a nose dropping at the extremity, and red as a bloody pudding. Thus pass our days, in our trim little cottage, far from all the uproar, and putrescence (material and spiritual) of the <foreign>reeky</foreign> town, the sound of which we hear not, and only see over the knowe the reflection of its gas-lights against the dusky sky, and bless ourselves that we have neither part nor lot in the matter. I assure you, many a time on a soft mild night, I smoke my pipe in our little flowergarden, and look upon all this, and think of all absent and present friends, and feel <pb id="pg-04-185" n="04:185"/>that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> good reason to &#x201C;be thankful that I am not in Purgatory.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle says that this was an expression used against a complaining man by Sandy Macleod, &#x201C;a wandering pensioner invalided out of some Highland Regiment <supplied>[who]</supplied> &#x2026; had strayed to Brownknowe with his old wife, and taken a Cottage of my Grandfather&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 28). Norton, however, gives a note from Mary Aitken Carlyle attributing the expression to Richard Keevil, advising persons complaining of trivial vexations.</note></p>
<p>Of society we might have abundance. People come on foot, on horseback, and even in wheeled carriages to see us; most of whom Jane receives up stairs, and gladly despatches with assurances that the weather is good, bad or indifferent, and hints that their friendship passes the love of women.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 1:26.</note> We receive invitations to dinner also; but Jane has a <hi rend="italic">circular</hi>, or rather two circulars, one for those she values, and one for those she does not value; and one or other of these she sends in excuse. Thus we give no dinners and take none; and by the blessing of Heaven design to persist in this course so long as we shall see it to be best. Only to some three or four chosen people we give notice that on Wednesday nights, we shall <hi rend="italic">always</hi> be at home, and glad if they will call and talk for two hours with no other entertainment but a cordial welcome and a cup of innocent tea. Few Wednesday-evenings, accordingly, when some decent soul or other does not step in, and take his place among us; and here we converse, and really I think enjoy ourselves far more than I have witnessed at any beefeating and wine-bibing convention which I have been <hi rend="italic">trysted</hi> with attending [engaged to attend].</p>
<p>But I must restrict this gossip, tho&#x2019; I know it will not be uninteresting to you, since it describes your Brother&#x2019;s way of life. Jack is in good health here, and no bad heart, keeping himself busy with various studies. He has assaulted both the Spanish and Italian languages since last Autumn, and made good progress in both.&#x2014; I had almost forgot to tell you that I have in my pocket a letter of introduction to Jeffrey of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review: it was sent to me from Procter<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See table of letters to the Carlyles. Procter wrote: &#x201C;I have <hi rend="italic">sealed</hi> my letter to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey, more from a feeling of delicacy than any thing else. It is a mistake I think to send such introductions unsealed. For my own part, I could only in such a case say &#x2018;This is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle the author of The Essay on things in general &#x26;c&#x2014;Pray know him.&#x2019; Were I to say more &#x26; lay it before the said M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;it would be fulsome.&#x201D;</note> of London; one of these days I design presenting it, and you shall hear the result.&#x2014; Our <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> is travelling thro&#x2019; the Cuddy-lane of Newspaper criticism, and most of these long-eared quadrupeds seem rather to smell at it with affection, tho&#x2019; what manner of thing it is, they seem somewhat to wonder. If I see any criticism <pb id="pg-04-186" n="04:186"/>worthy of your notice, I will send it.&#x2014; Doctor Waugh<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick wrote that Dr. Waugh had been there for more than a month and that he talked of commencing practice at Dumfries on Whitsunday.

<p>[JWC&#x2019;s postscript:] <salute>My dear Jane</salute></p>
<p>Within the last week or two our situation here has been assuming a more composed appearance; so that it seems as tho&#x2019; your coming might now be happy both for yourself and us. You must beg of your good Mother, then, to make up her mind to send you away to us, which it will be hard for her to do doubtless, but which she will do nevertheless in the hope of promoting your good. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> mind I know is already made up, for you trust in our affection for you, and in that assuredly you will not be disappointed&#x2014; For the manner of your coming, perhaps the easiest and safest way were that your Mother or some other of the family should carry you to Dumfries, and see you fairly established in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> coach, under the charge of the Guard or driver. You would arrive at your journey&#x2019;s end about eight oclock and find some of us in waiting to bring you home. With respect to clothes which your Brother was talking about if your Mother provides you with shifts and flannel petticoats night gowns, night caps, a black stuff petticoat and some pairs of black-worsted stockings; the other articles of apparel that you will require will be better got here. Your Brother is sitting in great impatience to take this to the post office so I must add no more&#x2014;only that some of you will be sure to write immediately what day we may expect you&#x2014; <closer><salute>And in the mean time believe me your affectionate Sister</salute></closer></p>

<p><pb id="pg-04-187" n="04:187"/>[TC&#x2019;s postscript:] We still owe you the boxes, but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> send them certainly very soon. If not before, they will surely come when our good Mother&#x2019;s butter pot arrives. At present we are not out, having a stock from Templand.</p>
<p>[John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s postscript:] My dear Alick, There is barely room for me to tell you of my welfare and thank you for your kindness. Make my love to all. I shall probably see you this or next week if nothing come in the way, though one quack seems enough about any one house at a time.</p>
<p>[TC&#x2019;s second postscript:] If Jean thinks of coming before I write again, I wish you would advance this <hi rend="italic">three pounds</hi> or so which she will need for her equipment; and I will honestly <hi rend="italic">pay thee</hi>. I have no small notes at hand, or I would have sent them today. (Jack will see none of you this week, or the next either.)</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>My Husband is busy below stairs with his book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wotton Reinfred</hi>.</note> and I, it seems, am this time to be the writer:&#x2014;with greater willingness than ability indeed; for I have been very stupid these some days with cold. But you must not be left in the idea that we are so neglectful as we have seemed; a little packet was actually written to go by the Carrier on Wednesday (my modesty will not permit me to call him by his popular name)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harlot. Jane refers to George Farries.</note> when the rain fell and the wind blew so that no living <supplied>[creature]</supplied> durst venture to his quarters. The Doctor proceeded thither, as early as was good for his health, the following morning, in case Fortune in the shape of bad weather or whisky had interposed delay; by that time however Carrier, boxes and <hi rend="italic">Bobby</hi> were all far on the road. So you see there was nothing for it but to write by post, which I lose no time in doing.</p>
<p>And now let me thank you for the nice eggs and butter which arrived in the best preservation;&#x2014;and so opportunely! just when I was <pb id="pg-04-188" n="04:188"/>lamenting over the emptied cans, as one who had no hope. Really it is most kind in you to be so mindful and helpful of our town-wants: and most gratifying to us to see ourselves so cared for. Good ham and cheese and even good eggs are to be had here in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, good butter too, perhaps, if one knew where to seek: but the Annandale cheese and butter &#x26;c have a certain relish of their own which makes us all set a surprising value on them.</p>
<p>The new book is going on at a regular rate; and I would fain persuade myself that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> health and spirits are at the same regular rate improving: more contented he certainly is since he applied himself to this task; for he was not born to be any thing but miserable in idleness. Oh that he <hi rend="italic">were</hi> indeed well&#x2014;well beside <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and occupied as he ought! How plain and clear would life then be before us! I verily believe there would not be such a happy pair of people on the face of the whole earth! Yet we must not wish this <hi rend="italic">too</hi> earnestly. How many precious things do we not already possess which others have not&#x2014;have hardly an idea of? Let us enjoy these then, and bless God that we are permitted to enjoy them; rather than importune his goodness with vain longings for more.</p>
<p>Indeed we lead a most quiet and even happy life here: within doors all is warm, is swept and garnished, and without the country is no longer winterlike, but beginning to be gay and green. Many pleasant people come to see us; and such of our visitors as are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> pleasant people, have at least the good effect of enhancing to us the pleasure of being alone. <hi rend="italic">Alone</hi> we never weary; if I have not Jane&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s little sister, who had literary ambitions and was highly articulate.</note> enviable gift of <hi rend="italic">talking</hi>, I am at least among the best listeners in the kingdom. And my Husband has always something interesting and instructive to say; then we have books to read: all sorts of them, from Scot&#x2019;s bible down to <hi rend="italic">novells</hi>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Anglice</hi>, Novels,&#x2014;ridiculously held in horror by a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> <hi rend="italic">hawk-faced</hi> &#x2018;ruling-elder&#x2019; I had heard discoursing once&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> and I have sewing-needles, and purse needles, and all conceivable implements for lady&#x2019;s work. There is a Piano too, for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">soothing the savage breast</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Congreve, <hi rend="italic">The Mourning Bride</hi>, I, i.</note> when one cares for its charms, but I am sorry to observe neither my playing nor singing seem to give M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C much delight. I console myself however with imputing the blame to his want of taste rather than my want of skill.</p>
<p>So Jane is not coming too us yet. Well, I am sorry for it but I hope the time is coming. In the mean time she must be a good girl, and read as much as she has time for, and above all things cultivate <pb id="pg-04-189" n="04:189"/>this talent of speech; for I am purposing to learn from her when she comes. It is my Husbands worst fault to me that I will not, or rather <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> speak; often when he has talked for an hour without answer, he will beg for some sign of life on my part; and the only sign I can give is a little kiss. Well! that is better than nothing&#x2014;dont you think?</p>
<p>[JWC ends, and TC begins:]&#x2014;So far, My Dear Mother, had the Goodwife proceeded, when visitors arrived, and the sheet was left unfinished. It is now, in the evening, with due composure, laid before me to conclude; an employment which I need not say I am happy to undertake, my task of writing being over, and nothing to prevent me (save want of room) from chatting with you about all and sundry that pertains to me. Would that you could write as easily, and tell me all <hi rend="italic">your</hi> cares! My dear Mother cannot speak to me at this distance; but I know her good heart, and find words for it myself; and no day passes but I remember with gratitude to the great Giver of all Good that she is still spared for a blessing to me. Jack, I think, is coming down by and by; he will tell you much; but there will be no <hi rend="italic">right</hi> sense of it, till <hi rend="italic">we</hi> come ourselves and talk with you (who knows but we may <foreign><hi rend="italic">craik</hi></foreign> [gossip] also?) for the space of ten days and nights. Then we shall begin to see how matters stand; but not till then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile assure yourself, my good Mother, that no evil has befallen me, nay that I have the prospect of being <hi rend="italic">far better</hi>, both in body and mind than I could ever have hoped. Many a time of late, it has seemed to me, as if these sore afflictions with which I have been tried, were truly the richest blessing that could have been conferred on me; as undoubtedly they are, if I can learn from them the wise Lesson whi<supplied>[ch]</supplied> Providence kindly tho&#x2019; with many stripes has been teaching me by means of them. After all, what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the light afflictions of this life which are but for a moment, if they teach us heavenly wisdom! These are not words, my <supplied>[dear]</supplied> Mother; I should bless God that they are becoming <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi> in my heart, and that healing and hope come into my benighted spirit along with them. When I look upon the empty struggles of the world, the cruelty and blind selfishness of worldly men, I feel that even ill health, if it teach one other and more precious and truer things, may be a merciful allottment. But I must check my speculation, however gratifying to myself and you; for my space is very limited.&#x2014; You will tell my good Alick that I had written him a letter too, which the mischance above described has detained with us. It contained nothing of any consequence; <pb id="pg-04-190" n="04:190"/>save only a request that he would not call the <hi rend="italic">stock</hi>, which he talks of selling at Whitsunday, any longer <hi rend="italic">ours</hi> but <hi rend="italic">his own</hi>; and in consequence dispose of it, in all points, entirely at his own discretion. I rejoice heartily that, on any terms, you are at length done with the Laird of Hoddam; of whom, &#x201C;since we can say no good, we shall say no evil,&#x201D; but leave him to oppress and legally plunder his inferiors, while time is, remembering that every dog has his day,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> and no dog any more. Heaven mend him, and us too, for we all need it!</p>
<p>I told Sandy that I had a letter to Jeffrey the Advocate. Last week I went up one evening and delivered it. The little man received me in his kindest style; talked with me for an hour, tho&#x2019; very busy, on all possible things; and really proved himself by much the most agreeable citizen of Edinburgh that I had ever met with. I am sorry the man is so immersed in Law; otherwise it is possible enough we might even become <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>. He invited me repeatedly to come to the &#x201C;Court&#x201D; any morning, and he would introduce me to various people, among others to Sir Walter Scott. I have not gone yet, being little careful of such introductions. He also spoke about writing in his Review; but I told him he must first read the <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> to see what manner of man I was, and then we might determine if I could suit him. We parted in the friendliest style, mutually tolerant of each other. In a week or two, we may perhaps meet again.&#x2014; The German Book is getting praise rather than censure: I was about sending Alick a copy of the last Examiner Newspaper, where it was rather sensibly criticised.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review, signed &#x201C;Q.,&#x201D; is in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1827-02-04">4 Feb.</date> The reviewer calls the volumes of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> &#x201C;pleasant,&#x201D; but thinks that most English readers will be impressed more by the translator&#x2019;s enthusiasm than by the matter translated: &#x201C;We even scarcely deem ourselves entitled to demur to the extreme of panegyric upon great performances that are unknown to us; but, in every honest truth, we are not prepared to mix up the name of every German dabbler in legendary lore and wild phantasmagoria, with those of Shakespeare, Spenser, Cervantes, and mental giants of that calibre, or to accept the testimony of a few eccentric sallies of humour or imagination in establishment of so much pretension.&#x201D; He protests against the &#x201C;extreme attachment [of the Germans] to the traditional and legendary&#x201D; and against Carlyle&#x2019;s exalting Goethe and other modern Germans at the expense of Lucian, Voltaire, and Swift: &#x201C;Let Voltaire, Lucian, Swift, and other such men, sink to their proper level, if they are at present too exalted; but, for heaven&#x2019;s sake, let not the flaming-sword, which drives them out of Paradise, be tempered out of the flimsy elements of a German tale.&#x201D; He has some praise for the translator&#x2019;s critical notices but objects to his &#x201C;misty and indefinite faith.&#x201D; He adds, however: &#x201C;No doubt a tender and devotional turn of mind is more plastic and creative than its sceptical reverse.&#x201D;</note> The man praises me for this and that: but then, it seems, I am terribly to blame for condemning Voltaire and the Sceptics! This <pb id="pg-04-191" n="04:191"/>is exactly as it should be. But what care I for their reviews? I have begun another Book, which if I had rightly finished I would not give a fig for them all! It is to be a curious book this; but I hope a good and even moral one! It proceeds slowly, yet constantly day after day.&#x2014; Now, my Dear Mother, I really <hi rend="italic">must</hi> stop: I have not room to write one half of the questions I would put to you about your health and habits and welfare. Is there <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing that I could do for you? I know you will answer Nothing; and yet it is not so; but till Summer I shall hardly see.&#x2014; My kindest affection to all, from my Father down to Jenny, name by name for even now I recollect them <hi rend="italic">all</hi>. If Alick do not write soon, I will write again. The selvage as usual belongs to Jack.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John adds a few lines in the margins.</note> Good night my Dear Mother; <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate and grateful son&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>Of Mr. Aitken&#x2019;s talents in the pulpit I can speak only by Report; the good testimony of which, however, every other indication tends to confirm. In private society, Mr A. appears as a courteous, sincere, and highly intelligent man; of mild constant temper; of manners at once frank, cheerful and gentlemanly: his conversation bespeaks a mind naturally clear, elegant, ingenious; now cultivated by sound temperate habits of thought, and in no ordinary degree, by manifold study and observation. In knowledge of Art, of Literature Ancient and Modern he has made distinguished acquirements: in German Literature especially, for which his long and varied residence in that country gave him peculiar opportunities, his knowledge, I believe, could be rivalled by few in Scotland, perhaps in Britain. His tastes also are still intellectual, and his habits regular and studious.</p>
<p>I have known Mr A. only three months: of his Moral Disposition, therefore, which only a long series of doings and forbearings can bring to the test, I have perhaps little right to speak; but I am <hi rend="italic">much</hi> mistaken if Time do not prove it to be sterling, do not show him in all duties he may undertake acting with that mild judicious fidelity, <pb id="pg-04-193" n="04:193"/>and deep tho&#x2019; unobtrusive regard to principle, which seems so accordant with his whole form of character. As a Clergyman, especially in an intellectual neighbourhood, he promises to be peculiarly suitable: for his religious persuasions seem to be at once earnest, unostentatious and tolerant; and in point of culture, and polish of mind, I can say without reserve that I have found few men in any profession, and certainly in his no one, that deserved to be compared with him.</p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>I cannot but thank you for your favourable estimation of my services;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt and Clarke had written to Carlyle on <date when="1827-03-15">15 March</date>: &#x201C;On <hi rend="italic">all</hi> accounts we would give you the preference, for conducting the new translation of Goethe&#x2019;s memoirs [<hi rend="italic">Aus Meinem Leben, Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi> (<date when="1811">1811</date>, <date when="1812">1812</date>, <date when="1814">1814</date>, <date when="1833">1833</date>)], we are anxious to accommodate the progress of our publication, and at the same time secure your assistance.&#x201D; They acknowledge Carlyle&#x2019;s letter of the 12th, which appears to be lost.</note> and express my satisfaction at the hope thus held out to me of contributing still farther to spread among my countrymen, the name and doctrines of a man to whom I myself am under so many and so kind obligations.</p>
<p>The projected Literary Engagement I referred to was not limited to time; being indeed the joint Editorship of a new Periodical; which enterprize, however, I am very willing to postpone in favour of the easier and more pleasant one of editing this Work of Goethe&#x2019;s. For myself the fittest of all times to commence the undertaking would be the present: in about three months I should propose that we began printing, and this with vigour and despatch; by which means we might have the whole work off our hands about this time twelvemonth. If such an arrangement could be made to suit you, I have on this head no father stipulation.</p>
<p>I know not whether it would be inconsistent with your arrangements to have the Book printed here beside me. I am sure it could be done as well and as cheaply here as any where else; and the advantages of such an arrangement both for correctness and expedition are obvious enough. Ballantyne, Balfour &#x26; Clerk, Stark, Oliver &#x26; Boyd <pb id="pg-04-194" n="04:194"/>&#x26;c &#x26;c are all unexceptionable trademen; more especially the first, whose name indeed needs not my recommendation, tho from experience I could recommend him as not only the most tasteful and accurate in regard to his art, but also the most punctual and faithful considered as merely a man of business of all printers known to me either in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or London. In this matter I should be very happy to lend you my best assistance in forming an arrangement; a thing which might perhaps be advantageously done even now; for our printers, I hear, are still complaining of deficiency in their employment. This however is a matter in which (convenient as it would be for me) my convenience might bend to yours.</p>
<p>One other thing I have to mention: I could wish that with regard to the Introductory Essay and other original matter added to the translations I should have liberty to <hi rend="italic">reprint</hi> any part of it for my own behoof at some future time in case I so saw good. Of this reprinting I have no purpose at present; but I should like to reserve such a right for myself; by which also I believe your Book would be no loser but a gainer.</p>
<p>I have a packet for Goethe waiting here till the Elbe is open: perhaps our bargain may be finally <supplied>[concluded]</supplied> before this goes away; and so I might mention the affair to the Author himself, and request his advice or at least good wishes. ho ho! ho<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It is difficult to determine whether Carlyle wrote these words or &#x201C;no no! no.&#x201D;</note> I am be</p>
<p>Will you have the goodness to consider these matters, especially this of the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> proposed; and let me know your determination with as little delay as possible.</p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>It were very unreasonable in me to disapprove your hesitation in regard to an enterprize of such magnitude, much as I could have <pb id="pg-04-195" n="04:195"/>wished to be myself concerned in the fulfilment of it. I am only sorry that the state of my own engagements renders a <hi rend="italic">present decision</hi> necessary; and that tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> when your publication took place might be of comparatively little moment, the <hi rend="italic">uncertainty</hi> of its ever taking place is not so.</p>
<p>If at the period you mention, or at any future one, you still think of publishing this work, I shall be very happy to hear from you, to assist you with all the counsel in my power; and if possible, to undertake the Translation myself, tho&#x2019; this latter possibility might in that case, I fear, be very uncertain. Meanwhile I shall still wait ten days;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt and Clarke wrote again on <date when="1827-04-03">3 April</date>.</note> and if within that time we can come to no <hi rend="italic">definite</hi> arrangement (determining, I mean, that the Book at least <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be published), I shall consider myself as free from any engagement with you, and at liberty to form what other I please.</p>

<salute>My Dear Father,</salute>
<p>I need not say how gratified I was to see your handwriting, after so long an interval, and communicating such pleasing intelligence as your little letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> brought us. Let us all be thankful that we are still spared in the land of the living,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Job 28:13.</note> to be a comfort to one another, in our pilgrimage, where so many, perhaps more deserving than we, are left desolate and friendless! While we are preserved in health and peace, and food and raiment convenient for us is provided, with kind friends to love us and be loved, what more have we to ask?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-196" n="04:196"/>I should have a long string of news to send you, for it is a great while (too great, had I not been so busy and uncertain) since I wrote: but by this time, as I calculate, Jack must be in the midst of you, explaining every thing by word of mouth much more satisfactorily than it could be done by pen and paper. To his tidings I have only to add, bringing them down some thirty hours later that we are still all well, and going on exactly in the same style. He will have told you of a notable project we have formed of coming down to live in Dumfriesshire by and by; not frightened by the wildness of the Dunscore moors, but preferring the free life of the country, on any terms, to the cage-like existence of the city, even here on its outskirts. Both Jane and I are very fond of the project; and if Alick dare venture going with us, I think the whole affair may be most <hi rend="italic">beautifully</hi> adjusted. Jack we would set up as a Doctor in Dumfries; the rest of us would farm, and write, and labour each in his sphere; peaceable and well, and living almost in sight of one another, at least (allowing fleet horses) within half a day&#x2019;s riding of each other. If all this take effect, I shall have cause to bless this application of the London Booksellers to me as one of the most providential occurrences in my life. For tho&#x2019; not positively <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> in this place, I can rationally entertain very little hope of ever getting completely <hi rend="italic">well</hi>; and Pain, however one may learn to bear it quietly, is no such desirable companion that one should not long in any honest way to be rid of it. I am waiting, with considerable hope, to hear more definitely from these London men,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt and Clarke wrote on <date when="1827-04-03">3 April</date>: &#x201C;We have discussed the matter regarding Goethe&#x2019;s memoirs, and have decided that it will be advisable for us to postpone the undertaking for a few months. As we were induced from your reputation to make our offer first to you, to translate the work for us, so there is no doubt that we shall renew the application when we resolve to commence publishing: and, in the true spirit of selfishness, we hope you may still be sufficiently at liberty to renew your engagement with us.&#x201D;</note> to consult the Landlady of Craigenputtoc<supplied>[h]</supplied>, and settle a great many other <hi rend="italic">et-cetereas</hi>, in preparation for this enterprise. The whole, I think, looks <hi rend="italic">pretty fairish</hi>, as Keevil<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Keevil. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan.</date></ref></note> says: but so soon as anything definite is done, you shall hear from me again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile it is comfortable to think that we are all going on so tolerably, even without any change. Happy that you are now free of General Sharpe, and independent of all men! The gallant General has poured out the whole vials of his wrath, and this same whole amounts to very little. For my own share, I have only to pray that Heaven would be kind to both him and me, and give us both some <pb id="pg-04-197" n="04:197"/>increase to our little fraction of wisdom, which, in the one case as in the other, does really seem too small.</p>
<p>I expect from Jack a long narrative of all that is going on at Scotsbrig; of your ploughing and your sowing; the sheds you are to build, and the whole import of your proceedings there. The CornBill,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Canning&#x2019;s bill of <date when="1827">1827</date> in which duties on imported grain were in inverse ratio to the price of domestically produced grain.</note> it would seem, is to do you no ill; and certainly taking one thing with another, there is every reason to hope, that henceforth you will get along as comfortably in that concern, as you have done in any other. With myself too, I am confident the worst is past, let things turn as they may. My little wife truly loves me, and will be happy sharing <hi rend="italic">any</hi> fortune at my side; a blessing, when I consider it, which may pass almost for the half of the whole matter of life; and certainly without which no comfortable life would be possible. She thanks you for your blessing, and returns it with hearty sincerity. By and by I hope we shall all be acquainted, and united, and far happier than we could ever have expected.&#x2014; My paper is done: my truest Love to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> from Alick to Jenny!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>It is long that I have partly been owing you a letter; and last time when Farries was here with his eggs and hen, we had so short an allowance of time, that except two short little notes to my more immediate creditors (which with one from Jane to Mag, and a small cubical junk of some less intellectual substance, I hope you properly received), I could not afford my valued husbandman a single word. It was the less necessary, as Jack was proceeding homewards, or rather had arrived at home, and so could communicate to you all our ordinary news, as well as some other schemes of ours, which required your more special deliberation. I am now to write to you farther on the same subject.</p>
<p>We have had a letter from the Hunts<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt and Clarke. Their address was &#x201C;4 York Street, Covent Garden.&#x201D;</note> in London since Jack left <pb id="pg-04-198" n="04:198"/>us; and this of a much less promising texture than its predecessor; for the people now talk of risks, and great sales that will be necessary to &#x201C;cover their outlay,&#x201D; and seem to indicate that for six months at least they would not only not wish to &#x201C;undertake,&#x201D; as they call it, but also not even to make a formal bargain of any sort. This, I have written to them, will by no means answer me, who desire to put pen to paper forthwith; and accordingly, I have stated that I would wait <hi rend="italic">other ten</hi> days before coming to any conclusion; but that, if within this period, it was not settled at least that there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> to be a bargain betwixt us, I should hold myself no longer bound to them, but at liberty to accept or reject any future offer of theirs, as they were at liberty to make or withhold it. Next week, about Friday or Saturday, I expect to hear from them again, or to infer by their silence that nothing, for the present at least, is to come of their speculation; which latter result I cannot but reckon as probable as any other.</p>
<p>Thus then so far as aid could come from Covent-Garden, our notable project of deliverance from city imprisonment, into mountain freedom, were at a stand-still, or perhaps as good as overset; and the hope of cultivating the <hi rend="italic">Craig O&#x2019; Putto</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craigenputtoch. For Carlyle on the name, see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 87&#x2013;88.</note> must be left to other hands. But there has come help from another quarter; and we are now at liberty to deliberate that scheme <supplied>[on]</supplied> more certain grounds. Jane&#x2019;s Mother whom Jack must have met journeying towards us at Noblehouse, not only warmly approves of our project, but has also offered to procure for us (which she can do without much difficulty) the funds necessary for starting it under fair auspices. The present Tenant, it appears, has paid <hi rend="italic">no</hi> rent, and is like to pay little for some time; neither has there any <hi rend="italic">Tack</hi> [lease] been signed in regard to the place; so that his hold on it is extremely slender. Let us now consider, therefore, what is to be done.</p>
<p>For my own part and &#x201C;the goodwife&#x2019;s,&#x201D; we are very strongly bent indeed upon the scheme. Town-life, tho&#x2019; it is without many of its annoyances here, is still extremely little to my mind; and many a time do I regret the liberty and safe seclusion which the country affords one, and many attainable forms of it; nay which I had attained not so long ago on the top of Repentance Hill, tyrannical Squirelets, and unjust stewards to the contrary notwithstanding. Indeed it seems plain enough that I have very little chance of ever getting completely well here; and tho&#x2019; I bear a hand, and try to stave off the Devil as I best may, and sometimes not without considerable success, my whole <pb id="pg-04-199" n="04:199"/>hopes and wishes point to a life in the country as the only scene where I might by and by get delivered from disease, and so have room for my strength, any little fraction of strength that I have. Craigenputtock is wild enough; but the house could be brushed up and rendered water-tight, and elegantly furnished (with the ware we have here), and for the land itself much might be done. At all events, it is the country, and <hi rend="italic">our own</hi>, which latter point in itself might overbalance twenty others. As for Jane, I think there is little fear that her tolerance would be less than mine: in good sooth, she is a <hi rend="italic">true</hi> wife, and would murmur at <hi rend="italic">no</hi> scene or fortune which she shared along with me.</p>
<p>Now the next thing is for you, Alick, to ask yourself, whether you could think of pitching your tent there, and durst undertake the tenanting of that stern moor beside us? If you answered Yes, there were nothing to hinder us from beginning to calculate the details of our enterprize forthwith; nay, for aught I know, it might not be impossible for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to take possession of the place the very <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Whitsunday, and so have it all ready for us the <hi rend="italic">next</hi>! Of the terms we could live together on, I shall say nothing: you recollect the Hill, and how quietly and amicably all was managed there, without ever a jarring word; a result in which many times since, I have had reason to admire your prudence and tolerant conduct, often much wiser than we fully gave it credit for being. All the farm-produce that we would need, horse-keep and hen-keep &#x26;c &#x26;c would be easy to manage. If you continued <hi rend="italic">single</hi>, you might live with us, and the kitchen and back-parlour would be your own sphere and domain; or if you thought of wedding (in which, however, I need not tell you, it is good to look before you leap), you might have a house of your own, either the one at the road, or some other that we might contrive for you nearer the offices. Jane and R&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rachel Ritchie.</note> could live near each other, I do believe, on a very comfortable footing. And then we should so improve those bogs, and clear out those plantations, and form hedgerows and cabbage-gardens, and live under the shadow of our own beech-trees, and none to put us in fear!</p>
<p>I desire you to consider all this matter with your calmest judgement, and if you are inclined to engage with it, say: Done! Yet let not my eagerness sway you, for I can only estimate for myself; and on you would lie a responsibility, which I cannot pretend to direct you in. I confess, however, I am very fond of it; and not the smallest of my reasons is that in this manner the whole of us might still be <pb id="pg-04-200" n="04:200"/><hi rend="italic">kept together</hi>. From all that I have learned there seems to be a fair opening for our Body-curer in Dumfries; nay I think he has a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> chance to succeed, if he tried it rightly; and then do but think how pleasant to be all planted down within sight of each other; our Father and Mother and all that we cared for in the world, within a half-day&#x2019;s journey!</p>
<p>As I am only scheming this business after off, I cannot propose to you any definite arrangements; not till I have first heard your general feeling, and whether you think it feasible or not. You might cast up in your mind what sum it would take to put <hi rend="italic">you</hi> down there, in addition to the stock you have already (for repairing of the house, and settling our <hi rend="italic">plenishing</hi> in it, I have reckoned about &#xa3;100); what rent, deducting pony-grass &#x26;c &#x26;c; and above all, whether you would care to let the Lady-wells stand for this season, and take as a grass-farm, to &#x201C;keep your stock together,&#x201D; those &#x201C;excellent pasturages&#x201D; at the Craig O&#x2019; Putto. In the latter case, as perhaps in any case, it would be better for me to come down, and settle all by word of mouth. You will write to me frankly and at large, as soon as you possibly can.</p>
<p>I think I must buy a <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> for our good Doctor tomorrow, and send it <supplied>[to]</supplied> him, fo<supplied>[r I]</supplied> am told there is a sort of criticism of the <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> in it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> of <date when="1827-03-28">28 March</date>, p. 1, refers to Carlyle as &#x201C;substantially Scottish, penetrating, ardent, self-willed, adventurous, even to conceit, but, when sobered a little by time and reflection, capable, we should think, from the pith and sagacity of his remarks, of taking respectable rank in original composition. His notices are all worth reading; sometimes startling, sometimes instructive, always rousing.&#x201D;</note> Thank the honest soul for his handsome letter, which I received on demand on Sunday-night, and read with no little satisfaction. We often speak of him here; and his <foreign>gawsy</foreign> [plump] face is missed about the hearth, I really think, by both of us. Tell the Doctor not to despond; but to mind his books, and see above all that no <hi rend="italic">stoppage in his mill</hi> take place, till things are once settled, and himself put upon his legs. Bid him also write to me: if you are too busy, he may also convey your sentiments.</p>
<p>Of my Mother, I must not begin to talk: I am sure she will rejoice in this prospect of having me near her, and drinking tea and consuming tobacco-smoke beside me, as in times gone. Tell her that I am not ill at present, and shall certainly one way or other get completely well. I have not abandoned the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, which has long ago been christened &#x201C;Wotton Reinfred&#x201D;; only these Hunt people have knocked me sadly ajar, ever since they started their scheme, and poor Reinfred has been living not growing for the last three weeks. Nevertheless, I <pb id="pg-04-201" n="04:201"/>spend my forenoon&#x2019;s, till two o&#x2019;clock over him; and Jane reads my writing, when I have gone out to walk; and you will be happy to learn, <hi rend="italic">always</hi> &#x201C;approves of the Essay.&#x201D; If these Hunts do not give me their Translation, I expect to have Wotton in print before quitting Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and that will be as well or better.</p>
<p>Of news here I can tell you no word or whisper: indeed, it is very rarely that I see any news-gathering creature; many days I speak with no living thing, except those within my own four walls. The <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi> Newspaper, tell Jack, is not come yet; but I hope to have it to send you ere long. I suspect John Gordon&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gordon was born at Kirkcudbright and took an M.A. degree at Edinburgh University. Records show that he was enrolled in courses in Edinburgh University in <date when="1821">1821</date> and <date when="1823">1823</date>; and he must have taken his degree shortly before he came to know Carlyle. In <date when="1825">1825</date> he became secretary of the Education Scheme of the Church of Scotland and in <date when="1843">1843</date> inspector of schools. In <date when="1833">1833</date> he became the first general secretary to Edinburgh University. The Senatus, however, snubbed him and appointed Sir William Hamilton as its secretary. He was offered the first inspectorship in <date when="1839">1839</date>, but did not take it until <date when="1843">1843</date>, and held it until <date when="1874">1874</date>. In that year Edinburgh gave him an honorary LL.D. degree. He published, in collaboration with Sir John Sinclair, the <hi rend="italic">Third Statistical Account of Scotland</hi> (<date when="1845">1845</date>). He died in <date when="1882">1882</date>, and his obituary appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> on <date when="1882-06-20">20 June</date>. Carlyle speaks of him as &#x201C;one Gordon, from Kirkcudbright, a visitor at our little Domicile of Comley Bank, and an estimable old acquaintance of mine.&#x201D; It was through Gordon that Carlyle got to know John Wilson (&#x201C;Christopher North&#x201D;). See A. Carlyle, ed., &#x201C;Christopher North,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century and After</hi>, LXXXVII (<date when="1920-01">Jan. 1920</date>), 103&#x2013;17; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 397&#x2013;98; David Masson, <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches and Memories</hi> (London and Edinburgh, <date when="1892">1892</date>), pp. 330&#x2013;31, 338.

<dateline><place>Scotsbrig</place>, Saturday-Night [<date when="1827-04-14">14 April 1827</date>].</dateline>
<p><salute>Dearest Wife&#x2014;</salute>What strange magic is in that word, now that for the first time I write it to you! I promised that I would think of you <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi>; which truly I have done many times, or rather all times, with a singular feeling of astonishment, as if a new light<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lifelong association of Jane with light.</note> had risen upon me since we parted, as if till now I had never known how precious my own dearest little Goody was to me, and what a real angel of a creature she was! I could bet a sovereign that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> love me twice as well as ever you did; for experience in this matter has given me insight. Would I were back to you! I would have ten thousand kisses, and my own Jane&#x2019;s heart would beat against her Husbands!</p>
<p>But I have no leisure for investigating these <foreign><hi rend="italic">egaremens du coeur</hi></foreign> [wanderings of the heart], which may be discussed much better by word of mouth. The house is smoking, and I am tired to death; having slept only four hours since Alick and I returned from Craigenputtock, <pb id="pg-04-203" n="04:203"/>this morning between three and four o&#x2019;clock; our cattle and ourselves uninjured indeed by a ride of 70 miles, but all heartily saddle-sick.&#x2014; &#x201C;Well Sir and what did you see at Craigenputtock?&#x201D;&#x2014; I saw green fields far greener than I had anticipated; Nature doing her part to maintain her children; and such a scene of human sloth and squalor, as I scarcely think could be paralleled within the county. Mr Blacklock we did not see: he was down on a pleasure excursion to Glen-Esley Distillery, with certain of his womankind mounted on two shelties! Better, I thought, if he had taken a rake and scraped away a little of the filth and <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [muck] with which all parts of his premises from the cow-stall to the parlour (literally) were inundated; better if he had been thatching his stript mill-shed, or mending one of the many holes and gaps in his stone dikes! In fact, Jeanie, I must rejoice particularly that I have taken this journey; for I came upon the people unawares, and all the nakedness of the land<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 42:9.</note> was revealed to me. It is my decided opinion that this Blacklock will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> pay any proper rent; and if the Craig o&#x2019; Putto were mine, I really think I would almost rather build a ring-fence round it, and leave it gratis to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">tee wheets</hi></foreign> [lapwings], than allow such an unprincipled (I fear this is the word, unprincipled) sloven to farm it for money. I spoke of thinning the plantations! By Jove they have rather need of thickening: at every gap in the dikes you find somewhere between a dozen and a score of young trees cut down as if they were so many broom twigs, and carelessly dashed in to stop the gap, in place of building in the stones! Nay Alick and I computed some two hundred yards of wattlework (vulgarly called stake and rice)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Or &#x201C;rise,&#x201D; usually brushwood woven together against upright stakes.</note> absolutely formed entirely of young firs, some of which were as thick as my leg at the butt: the whole number of them we reckoned between two and three thousand. I should add, however, that <hi rend="italic">most</hi> of this must have been the work of Tom Macqueen;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A brother of John Macqueen, natives of Craigenputtoch. John became a large and respectable grazier. See Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 4.</note> only some twenty or thirty yards seemed to have been repaired (with rather thicker trees I thought) by Blacklock. But what totally took away from me all pity for the man, and made me use the harsh word <hi rend="italic">unprincipled</hi>, was this fact, palpable beyond discussion, that the scoundrel had actually wintered his cattle (I mean had them lying over night thro&#x2019; winter) in the heart of that long stripe of planting that runs transversely from the height down towards the water! The fence had been broken down; and there <pb id="pg-04-204" n="04:204"/>had the <foreign>kyloes</foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Small black cattle brought from the Isle of Skye. Often applied indiscriminately to Highland cattle.</note> been ranging and rubbing, and eating and breaking! Had he taken a furnished house in Herriot-row and driven in his cow to eat her draff and dreg on the Brussels carpet of the drawing-room, I could sooner have forgiven him. It was altogether damnable. We tried to ascertain by inspection whether the gaps by which his bullocks had found access to this comfortable shelter had been accidental or intentional: one of the places was half and the other three fourths filled up; so that we could judge but vaguely; and all the charity we had corroborated the evidence for the milder hypothesis. The damage done extended indeed only to a score or two of yards; for the cattle had been of christian spirit: but the spirit of their owner was too well marked by it.&#x2014; But why dilate on these things? The man is an utter and arrant sloven; and had simply gone upon the principle that most probably no mortal concerned in the farm would ever see it during the lease.</p>
<p>We inquired into his stock; and to our amazement found that he had next to <hi rend="italic">no</hi> stock; having employed the ground chiefly in what is called <hi rend="italic">taking on</hi> other people&#x2019;s cattle; that is feeding transitory droves or flocks at so much per week or month. In place of six score of beeves he has at present great and small, some seventeen head; a few sheep, two goats and four Highland ponies. Alick and I computed that his whole goods and chattels might amount to little more than &#xa3;100 in value. He is ploughing however (with two very care-worn horses), and if let alone without any claim for rent, may still live a year or two; tho&#x2019; I reckon he would by and by find even this a hard process. Now this plan of farming by borrowed stock is one not acknowledged by any landlord; or at least it entitles him to demand security for his rent; since without some cautioner he has none, the law not allowing stock of this kind to be seized for the landlord&#x2019;s behoof. In fact, I am inclined to believe that the Blacklocks have no money, and this Blacklock has evidently no talent for farming any such place as Craigenputtock.</p>
<p>Old Nannie<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macqueen.</note> came and pressingly entreated us to have some tea; nay&#x2014;attempted to allure us with the offer of <hi rend="italic">clean blankets</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Aitken Carlyle informed Norton that sheets were an almost unthought-of luxury among the Scottish peasants even in the late nineteenth century.</note> and excellent horse-prov<supplied>[en]</supplied>der to tarry with her all night. She sent you and your Mother about a hun<supplied>[dred]</supplied> sets of compliments, and inquired <pb id="pg-04-205" n="04:205"/>again and again if she was not to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> before Whitsunday? Poor Nannie has been ordered to flit, it seems; and &#x201C;<foreign>&#x2019;tweel</foreign>&#x201D; indeed], says she, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll be very <foreign>wae</foreign>.&#x201D; She walked with us to the gate; insisting much on the propriety of seeing everything with one&#x2019;s own eyes, and of the greater and <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> propriety one would find in it the longer one looked; and hinting at last with much circumspection that all was not as it should be with Blacklock; &#x201C;and wiser folks than me will be cheated,&#x201D; said she, &#x201C;if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can do any good in it.&#x201D; We cut short poor Nannies innuendoes; and with great cordiality wished her a thousand good nights, the voice of her &#x201C;compliments&#x201D; still sounding &#x201C;over the health&#x201D; when herself was out of sight.</p>
<p>Now <foreign><hi rend="italic">qu&#xe6;retur</hi></foreign> [question]: What is to be done? I think, on all accounts, even if it were not on our own, these men are to be got out; nay if they will not go peaceably, packed out. I left a note for Blacklock, requiring his presence along with his Brother&#x2019;s at Dumfries on Wednesday, with his &#x201C;rent of course&#x201D;; which rent, however, I have very little hope of seeing any six pence of. In case he do pay me, then I call upon him to sign his lease; and what he will find it more difficult to do, to procure us a proper <hi rend="italic">cautioner</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A person who stands security for another.</note> since he chooses to keep no stock of his own on the grounds. By degrees, I shall open to him our project of taking the place from him; and if he will consent to carry himself off at Whitsunday first, he ought to have some allowance (I was thinking of some seventy pounds&#x2014;that is his paying another &#xa3; 100): if he will not yield to reason, then I should certainly counsel to let the law have its course; to hypothecate instantly for the &#xa3;60 due at Martinmas, and directly after whitsunday for the next &#xa3;110 (tho&#x2019; then there will be little to hypothecate upon), following it up with a process of ejectment. For my own share, I have no sort of idea that he would let matters come to such extremity, for it would both &#x201C;destroy his happiness and ruin his business&#x201D; (as a drover); and certainly without our Mother&#x2019;s direction, I shall not dream of taking the smallest legal measure, which in any case I should deprecate as an evil of great magnitude.</p>
<p>At all events, if the man <hi rend="italic">will</hi> pay up his rent, and keep his farm, which in this case he can do (till <date when="1829">1829</date> at least, for we are now 10 days too late for <hi rend="italic">warning</hi> him out even for next year), then before he and his cautioner sign the lease, it would surely be well that some most vigorous clauses were inserted regarding the woods &#x26;c &#x26;c and all other loopholes by which this unfortunate sluggard may do us an <pb id="pg-04-206" n="04:206"/>ill turn. I neglected to take a letter from your Mother to Mr Adamson,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The banker at Dumfries.</note> empowering me to demand a sight of this instrument: but she will send it down to me along with your letter to the Dumfries post office on Wednesday; and I shall get it about four o&#x2019;clock. Also would she send me the present <hi rend="italic">missive</hi>, if she have it, or whatever document it is that records this bargain with the Blacklocks. In that case it were better to make a parcel of the papers and send them by the (Mail) Coach. I shall inquire at both places, if I do not find them at one. Perhaps this is of no great consequence; for I have a considerable persuasion that the people will be inclined to deal peaceably: but it is good to have the whole matter before one; and if they said this and that was fixed upon, I should feel rather helpless. Perhaps if the paper is not at Comley Bank, she can have it sent me from Templand: this however, only in case I need it. At all events you will write on Tuesday-night &#x201C;to lie till called for&#x201D;; and tell me all you think and feel and know. On Wednesday you send the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> hither, where it is too likely it may still find me. Indeed it is scarcely possible that I should get away before Saturday; so I think I must write to you again. But I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> hopes that the thing will be <hi rend="italic">well</hi> settled at last. I scarcely know what I have written; for my eyes are half-blind; and I am wearied and fond and <foreign>wae</foreign> and bewitched and bedivelled, and &#x201C;feel a kind of inclination to bark.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240927-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-09-27">27 Sept. 1824</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Good night, good night, my darling wife, my dear <foreign>wee</foreign> wife!

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>At length after long delays I send you this copy of my German compilation,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> which I beg of you to accept as a small acknowledgment of my obligations, and testimony of my regard. I hope it may still <pb id="pg-04-207" n="04:207"/>find you, tho&#x2019; I hear that you are at present not in Hamburg but in Berlin.</p>
<p>Mr Aitken informed me some time ago that you had thoughts of applying for the Professorship of Northern Literature in the projected London University; and afterwards that you had withdrawn in favour of Mr Repp,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thorlief Gudm. Repp was an assistant in the Advocates&#x2019; Library (now the National Library of Scotland) from <date when="1825-11-16">16 Nov. 1825</date> until <date when="1834-11-12">12 Nov. 1834</date>. He was brought over from Copenhagen, where he had been well recommended by the University. His appointment is doubtless to be associated with the acquisition of the Thorkelin Collection of <date when="1819">1819</date>; but he seems to have been engaged in general duties, including the cataloguing of the Spanish Collection. The dates of his birth and death are not available, but it is probable that he returned to Denmark in <date when="1834">1834</date>. (Mr. William Park, Keeper of Manuscripts at the National Library of Scotland, has provided this information.) Andrew Wawn points out in a comment to the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> Feedback Page submitted on <date when="2009-06-12">12 June 2009</date> that the dates for Thorlief Repp are <date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857">1857</date>; that he returned to Copenhagen in 1837; and that his &#x201C;scholarly activities and impact in Edinburgh&#x201D; during his decade there &#x201C;extended far beyond the catalogue work in the Advocate&#x2019; Library.&#x201D;</note> one of our Librarians. I can scarcely feel sorry that you are not to become a member of that Institution; which, hanging as it does at the mercy of accidents, and connected with none of the permanent establishments of the country, can scarcely for a long while come to any solid good, nay may very easily, for all that has been done in it, dissolve into smoke, and pass away from the world. The managers of it are only a party; and this, however meritorious in other respects, by no means the most pleasant to act with; being mostly what we call <hi rend="italic">Radicals</hi>, a class of men not unlike your German <hi rend="italic">Philistines</hi>, only that with us they are more political than literary. They have long been engaged in pulling down; and this is their first attempt at building up. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Durum et durum non faciunt murum</hi></foreign> [Two hard objects do not make a wall]. I have my own fears for their whole speculation, much as I could wish to see some such thing prospering, and settled on right principles.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The University of London, the idea of which originated with Thomas Campbell, was founded by Lord Brougham and other Dissenters in <date when="1825">1825</date>. It soon led the Anglicans to found King&#x2019;s College. Together they were given a charter as London University in <date when="1830">1830</date> and the institution has flourished increasingly down to the present day.</note></p>
<p>In the event of Mr Repp&#x2019;s going to London, who knows but we might hope to see you established here in his stead! For your own sake also I should like it better, if you could accept of such a place. Edinburgh is a much more intellectual town than London; far cheaper too, and on the whole much more suited for a man of philosophic habitudes.</p>
<p>If you thought of such a thing, or of continuing your application for the London place, I might perhaps be able to give you some little furtherance in either case; and tho&#x2019; little, it might be cheerfully accepted, for it would be cheerfully given. One way or other, I hope <pb id="pg-04-208" n="04:208"/>to see you settled in our Island: we are never without need of men like you; and to Germans especially we seem at all times disposed, when there is merit in the case, to hold out the right hand of brotherhood. If in any matter I can serve you, I shall entreat you as a favour to apply frankly.</p>
<p>We have no news here that can interest you. The political world is friendly and united to a degree that I have never witnessed before; the commercial world seems again gathering vigour; in the Literary world there is nothing doing.

<salute>Respected Sir,</salute>
<p>It is now above two years since Lord Bentinck&#x2019;s Servant delivered me at London the packet from Weimar, containing your kind letter and present;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241220-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-12-20">20 Dec. 1824</date></ref>.</note> of both which, to say that they were heartily gratifying to me would be saying little; for I received them and keep them with a regard which can belong to nothing else. To me they are memorials of one whom I never saw, yet whose voice came to me from afar, with counsel and help, in my utmost need. For if I have been delivered from Darkness into any measure of Light, if I know aught of myself and my duties and destination, it is to the study of your writings more than to any other circumstances that I owe this; it is you more than any other man that I should always thank and reverence with the feeling of a Disciple to his Master, nay of a Son to his spiritual Father. This is no idle Compliment, but a heartfelt truth; and humble as it is, I feel that the knowledge of such truths must be more pleasing to you than all other glory.</p>
<p>The Books,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton lists the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> (London, <date when="1825">1825</date>) and <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, 4 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1827">1827</date>), of which Vol. IV contained <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>. Both books are inscribed &#x201C;To Goethe / From his warmest Admirer / Thomas Carlyle.&#x201D;</note> which I here take the liberty to offer you, are the poor product of endeavours obstructed by sickness and many other causes; and in themselves little worthy of your acceptance: but perhaps they may find some favour for my sake, and interest you likewise as evidences of the progress of German Literature in England. Hitherto it has not been injustice but ignorance that has blinded us in this matter: at all events a different state of things seems approaching; with respect to yourself, it is at hand, or rather has already come. This <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi>, which I reckon somewhat better translated than its forerunner, I in many quarters hear deeply if not loudly praised; and even the character with which I have prefaced it, appears to excite not objection but partial compliance, or at worst hesitation and inquiry.</p>
<p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Lehrjahre</hi> also I am happy to give a much more flattering account than I could have anticipated at first. Above a thousand copies of the Book are already in the hands of the public; loved also, <pb id="pg-04-210" n="04:210"/>with more or less insight, by all persons of any culture; and, what it has many times interested me to observe, with a degree of estimation determined not less by the intellectual force than by the moral earnestness of the reader. One of its warmest admirers known to me is a lady of rank, and intensely religious.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Edward Strachey. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240811-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-08-11">11 Aug. 1824</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I may mention farther that some weeks ago, a stranger London Bookseller<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt and Clarke.</note> applied to me to translate your <hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi>; a proposal which I have perhaps only postponed not rejected.</p>
<p>All this warrants me to believe that your name and doctrines will ere long be English as well as German; and certainly there are few things which I have more satisfaction in contemplating than the fact that to this result my own efforts have contributed; that I have assisted in conquering for you a new province of mental empire; and for my countrymen a new treasure of Wisdom which I myself have found so precious. One day, it may be, if there is any gift in me, I shall send you some work of my own; and along with it, you will deserve far deeper thanks than those of Hilaria to her friendly Artist.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, chaps. xii&#x2013;xiii; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 278 ff., 315.</note></p>
<p>About six months ago I was married: my young Wife who sympathizes with me in most things, agrees also in my admiration of you; and would have me in her name beg of you to accept this purse, the work, as I can testify, of dainty fingers and true love; that so something, which she had handled and which had been hers, might be in your hands and be yours. In this little point I have engaged that you would gratify her. She knows you in your own language; and her first criticism was the following, expressed with some surprise: &#x201C;This Goethe is a greater genius than Schiller, tho&#x2019; he does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> make me cry!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18230401-JBW-TC-01">JBW to TC, [<date when="1823-04-01">1 April 1823</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230406-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1823-04-06">6 April 1823</date></ref>.</note> A better judgement than many which have been pronounced with more formality.</p>
<p>May I hope to hear, by Post, that this packet has arrived safely; and that health and blessings are still continued to you? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Frey ist das Herz, doch ist der Fuss gebunden</hi></foreign> [The heart is free, but the foot is still bound].<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton compares this with Goethe&#x2019;s own &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Nicht ist der Geist, doch ist der</hi> <hi rend="italic">Fuss gebunden</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;The spirit is not bound, yet the foot is&#x201D;]. Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi> (<date when="1827">1827</date>), IV, 103.</note> My wishes are joined with those of the world that you may be long spared to see good and do good.</p>
<closer><salute>I am ever, / Respected Sir, / Your humble servant / and thankful Scholar, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p><pb id="pg-04-211" n="04:211"/>If you stand in any relation with Mr Tieck it would give me pleasure to assure him of my esteem. Except him and Richter, who has left us, there is no other of these Novelists, whom I ought not to beg your pardon for placing you beside, even as their King.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a brief note dated at Weimar, <date when="1827-05-17">17 May</date>, Goethe acknowledged Carlyle&#x2019;s letter and packet and informed Carlyle that he was sending a packet to him and Jane. In a long letter dated at Weimar, <date when="1827-07-20">20 July</date>, Goethe announced that the packet had been sent. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270811-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1827-08-11">11 Aug.</date></ref>, for an enthusiastic description of its contents. In his letter Goethe praises Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> highly and commends the lives of Mus&#xE4;us, Hoffmann, and Richter in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>. He also makes some important observations concerning cultural internationalism: <p>&#x201C;It is obvious that the efforts of the best poets and aesthetic writers of all nations have now for some time been directed toward what is universal in humanity. In each special field, whether in history, mythology, or fiction, more or less arbitrarily conceived, one sees the traits which are universal always more clearly revealed and illumining what is merely national and personal.</p><p>&#x201C;Though something of the same sort prevails now also in practical life, pervading all that is earthy, crude, wild, cruel, false, selfish, and treacherous, and striving to diffuse everywhere some gentleness, we cannot indeed hope that universal peace is being ushered in thereby, but only that inevitable strife will be gradually more restrained, war will become less cruel, and victory less insolent.</p><p>&#x201C;Whatever in the poetry of any nation tends to this and contributes to it, the others should endeavour to appropriate. The peculiarities of each nation must be learned, and allowance made for them, in order by these very means to hold intercourse with it; for the special characteristics of a nation are like its language and its currency: they facilitate intercourse, nay they first make it completely possible. &#x2026;</p><p>&#x201C;A genuine, universal tolerance is most surely attained, if we do not quarrel with the peculiar characteristics of individual men and races, but only hold fast the conviction, that what is truly excellent is distinguished by its belonging to all mankind. To such intercourse and mutual recognition, the German people have long contributed.</p><p>&#x201C;Whoever understands and studies German finds himself in the market, where all nations offer their wares; he plays the interpreter, while he enriches himself.</p><p>&#x201C;And thus every translator is to be regarded as a middle-man in this universal spiritual commerce, and as making it his business to promote this exchange: for say what we may of the insufficiency of translation, yet the work is and will always be one of the weightiest and worthiest affairs in the general concerns of the world.&#x201D; (For the German text of the note and letter, with translations, see Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 11&#x2013;30.)</p> <p>The letter was accompanied by some German verses and a German translation of the Scottish ballad &#x201C;Get up and Bar the Door.&#x201D; (See <hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 20&#x2013;21.) In the packet there were also three cards. On the one inside the pocketbook for Carlyle, Goethe had written: &#x201C;Herr Carlyle <foreign>w&#xfc;rde mir ein besonders Vergn&#xfc;gen machen wenn er mir von seinem bisherigen Lebensgange einige Nachrichten geben wollte</foreign>&#x201D; (&#x201C;Mr. Carlyle would do me a special favor if he would give me some particulars of his previous history&#x201D;). On the second card were some verses: &#x201C;<foreign>Augenblicklich aufzuwarten / Schicken Freunde solche Karten; / Diesmal aber heisst&#x2019;s nicht gern: / Euer Freund is weit und fern</foreign>.&#x201D; (&#x201C;A friend sends up a card like this / When instant visit he will pay; / But this time things are much amiss: / Your friend, alas, is far away.&#x201D;) On the third card, which was inside a box containing a necklace for Jane Carlyle, Goethe had written these verses: &#x201C;<foreign>Wirst du in den Spiegel blicken / Und vor deinen heitern Blicken / Dich die ernste Zierde schm&#xfc;cken, / Denke dass nichts besser schm&#xfc;ckt, / Als wenn man den Freund begl&#xfc;ckt</foreign>.&#x201D; (&#x201C;Wilt thou, at thy mirror, smiling place / On a neck so light, so grave a toy, / Think that nought so well the Wife can grace, / As when wedded Wife brings Husband joy.&#x201D;) The last translation is Carlyle&#x2019;s; those for the other two cards are Norton&#x2019;s. Norton also gives this description of the necklace: &#x201C;It is a black necklace of delicate wrought iron (such as German ladies, having given up their jewels, were in the habit of wearing after the battle of Jena); a pendant is attached to it, with a head of Goethe cut in coloured glass, and with a gold setting&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, pp. 28&#x2013;30).</p></note></p></ps>

Carlyle says that &#x201C;Cheap&#x201D; is used here playfully as the opposite of Carlyle&#x2019;s usual &#x201C;Dear.&#x201D;</note> I met the Postman in Stockbridge<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The part of the city between Comely Bank and the center.</note> yesterday morning, and something bid me ask if there were any letters. Imagine my agitation when he gave me yours,&#x2014;four and twenty hours before the appointed time! I was so glad and so frightened! So eager to know the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> contents that I could hardly make out any <hi rend="italic">part</hi>. In the little Tobacconist&#x2019;s, where I was fain to seek a quiet place, I did at length however with much heart-beating get thro the precious paper; and find that my Darling still loved me pretty well, and that the Craig o&#x2019; Putta was still a hope; as also, that if you come not back to poor Goody on Saturday it will not be for want of will. Ah nor yet will it be for want of the most fervent prayers to Heaven that a longing Goody can put up; for I am sick, sick to the heart of this absence, which indeed I can only <hi rend="italic">bear</hi> in the faith of its being brief. Oh Dearest I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love you in my very in<supplied>[n]</supplied>ermost being,&#x2014; far better than word can tell, or even kisses; tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">these</hi> (when not the <hi rend="italic">experimental</hi> sort) <hi rend="italic">are</hi> rather eloquent in their way; to me, at least, have often told such things! and they shall tell the same story over again&#x2014;shall they not, yet a thousand and a thousand times? &#x201C;I expect but I doubt not&#x2014;&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This appears to be coterie speech.</note></p>

Even suppose <pb id="pg-04-213" n="04:213"/>we did not wish the place for ourselves, it would be miserable to consign it to such hands; you will use all fair means,&#x2014;then, to recover it from them&#x2014;that is all honest means,&#x2014; for, as to the tenderness and delicacy which would have been becoming towards a worthy tenant, it were here out of place. I shall be very anxious until I hear from you again&#x2014; Would to Heaven the business were settled and in the way we wish! These perplexities and suspenses are not good for bilious people; Indeed they are making <hi rend="italic">me</hi> positively ill.

<p>[Mrs. Welsh to TC:] My dear Sir, The account you give of Craigenputtock makes my heart full sore&#x2014;that a place that should have been redeemed at such a price should again fall into nothingness by the worthlessness of its Tenant. To think of his remaining must not be&#x2014;he deserves no mercy&#x2014;far less delicacy from us&#x2014; Therefore I trust you will put forth your whole strength to save poor puttock before it is too late&#x2014; for my own part I would sooner live on potato<supplied>[e]</supplied>s and point from Whitsuntide till Martinmas than that such an unprincipled dirty wretch should find footing upon it. From all accounts I dont see how they can expect to retain it but should they become obstreperous, you must just act according to your better judgement and make them what offer of money or law you think they best deserve&#x2014;but out of Craigenputtock they must be got. The Missive I have from them is Im sorry to say at Templand nor can I get it unless I have a large box sent in wherein it is&#x2014;so until I hear from you again I will let it stand&#x2014;it mearly specifies the length of the lease and the Rent&#x2014;and signed by John and William Blacklock&#x2014;so that you have two strings to tug at for the payment of the Rent. without which from the appearance of poverty and sloth upon the Farm there would have been small hopes of procuring it from the latter but I would fain hope that for their own <hi rend="italic">credit</hi> they will pay up the Rent &#x26; rather than be driven to seek what they might not easily find (proper security for time coming<supplied>[)]</supplied> together with a few stiff necked clauses they will be glad at the first opportunity to take up their bed and walk&#x2014; <pb id="pg-04-215" n="04:215"/>but at all events do your utmost to rout them out of their lair &#x26; drive them into the sea if you can was it only for their merciless conduct to the young trees&#x2014;oh the Villains my heartsblood boils to think of it&#x2014; After having seen them on Wednesday do write a few lines to say how matters are likely to go&#x2014; Jane will speak for herself and me also wherein I am deficient but as your will &#x26; hers is my first wish I would wish to be regulated &#x26; not to regulate in what concerneth your better interests</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Had there been a moment of time left me last night, I would have written to you from Dumfries, and informed you four and twenty hours sooner of the happy issue of our tedious negotiation: but it was towards eleven at night before the higgling ceased and the papers were fairly signed; and then Alick and I had nineteen rough miles to ride, and moreover were afraid of being robbed by rascally Irishmen in the Trench of Lochar Moss,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trench was a village on a road crossing Lochar Moss (a stream) in south Dumfriesshire.</note> for we were carrying money in our pockets.</p>
<p>The two Blacklocks were at their post waiting for us; and after between eight and nine hours of incessant discussion, varying thro&#x2019; all stages from &#x201C;an&#x2019; please your Honour&#x201D; to &#x201C;Damn it, Sir!&#x201D; we settled with them, and they are to travel at Whitsunday <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, on what I conceive to be pretty equitable principles for all parties. In the first place, Ready Money Jack (so I named the Enock one, a perfect contrast on all points to his Brother) tabled his 12 five-pound notes, paying up <pb id="pg-04-216" n="04:216"/>his rent in full till Martinmas last. Next, they are one and all to clear the ground of them at Whitsunday; they being allowed sixty pounds of deduction from the last half year&#x2019;s rent; we also accepting of the Ewes in William&#x2019;s stock (some hundred or so not marketable at this season) on the valuation of Arbitrators. The next point cost us an immensity of debate, and was at last left to the decision of these same Arbitrators also. It was this: whether or not these Blacklocks in case they had staid till the end of their lease, had right to the following crop (that is, to the crop sown by them before Whitsunday, and left to ripen under the inspection of the <hi rend="italic">succeeding</hi> tenant; or right only to the seed-corn and labour and grass lost to them by putting it in? We stoutly maintained the latter side, they as stoutly the former; the scrolled Lease (a pitiful enough paper, which <hi rend="italic">neither</hi> of us would have signed) threw no light on this point; which accordingly we left to the determination of neutral men, to be guided by the light of nature on the matter, for the Blacklocks had no shred of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> good or bad to show for themselves, in regard to this or any other particular. The proposed Arbitrators were named; William Grahame of Burnswark I expect to be ours, theirs (unless on inquiry we object to him) is one Mr Kennedy of <hi rend="italic">Cowhee</hi> or some such place in Penpont; and the Third Person, to be appointed if need be, is James Stewart of Gillamby Rig, in this neighbourhood; a friend of Major Creighton&#x2019;s; slightly known to me also, and in all respects a most unexceptionable Judge. So that, calculating by all appearances both of the people and the cause, I see little room to doubt that the whole will be peaceably and fairly adjusted.</p>
<p>On the whole, I feel much mollified to these Blacklocks: the William one in particular (him of the <hi rend="italic">trees</hi>) I absolutely pardoned, nay at one period felt a real pity for. A poor innocent, timid, underfoot body, that could not hurt a fly! He winded and twisted under my accusations; and at last all that could be brought home upon him was that he had little money, little wit, less malice, and was nowise fit for farming Craigenputtock. I declare, my heart warms yet to the poor soul when I think of his long nose and cowering attitude and meek submissive aspect. Nay towards Ready Money Jack himself, tho he shifted first from <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to a <hi rend="italic">hundred guineas</hi>, and then to <hi rend="italic">sixty pounds</hi>, I bear no sort of spleen: on the contrary I think him a most stout sufficient fellow (who would have farmed your land well had he resided there himself), and for a Cattle-dealer, honest and direct. We all parted in fair spirits, and fine fellowship, with cordial shaking of hands: your health was drunk in fiery punch, and I upbraided <pb id="pg-04-217" n="04:217"/>for my <hi rend="italic">Whiggism</hi> because I joined not beyond tea-spoonfuls in that noxious beverage. We left them drinking lustily with another man from Closeburn, heedless of the &#x201C;lang Scots miles&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;Tam o&#x2019;Shanter,&#x201D; l. 47.</note> &#x201C;I was fu&#x2019; when I got it,&#x201D; said Jack; &#x201C;and by&#x2014;&#x2014;I&#x2019;se be as fu&#x2019; when I qu<hi rend="italic">u</hi>t it!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I was drunk when I got it, and by&#x2014;&#x2014; I&#x2019;ll be as drunk when I leave it!&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; The crop business (the only knotty point of the Arbitration) can hardly be more than a matter of &#xa3;30 or so; and really I think if the judges do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> give it against us, we ought almost to give it (or the value of it) <hi rend="italic">against ourselves</hi>, that is, in case the Drovers behave themselves; for really they have had a poor year.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Mother, let me congratulate the whole household on this auspicious result, which I hope in God will be good for us all. To me it gives the fairest chance of recovering health, the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> thing I want for being the happiest man this sun shines on: my dear wifie&#x2019;s happiness is bound up in mine, and yours in that of us both. To thank you for your care of us would be but useless: the temper of mind it displays was not unexpected but is still infinitely precious to me; and for the present I shall only say that it shall go <hi rend="italic">very</hi> hard with me, if you have ever reason to repent of what you did. May God bless us all, and keep us all united in affection and true conduct to the end!&#x2014; But I must not grow too serious here: besides I am encroaching on poor Goody&#x2019;s sheet, which is but <foreign><hi rend="italic">tirling the Kirk to theek the Choir</hi></foreign>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Stripping the church to roof the choir.&#x201D;</note> I will not tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> but <hi rend="italic">her</hi> when I am coming; but I daresay you will work the secret out of her by and by. <closer><salute>I am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Not unlike what the drop of water from Lazarus&#x2019; finger might have been to Dives in the flame,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 16:24.</note> was my dearest Goody&#x2019;s letter to her Husband yesterday afternoon. Blacklock had retired to the Bank for fifteen minutes; the whirlwind was sleeping for that brief season, and I smoking my pipe in grim repose, when Alick came back with your messenger. No, I do not love you in the least; only a little <hi rend="italic">sympathy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">admiration</hi>, and a certain <hi rend="italic">esteem</hi>; nothing more!&#x2014; O my dear best <foreign>wee</foreign> woman!&#x2014; But I will not say a word of all this, till I whisper it in your ear with my arms round you.</p>
<p>Such a day I never had in my life; but it is all over and well; and now &#x201C;Home Brothers! Home!&#x201D;&#x2014; I have meditated all this morning <pb id="pg-04-218" n="04:218"/>whether I could get back on Saturday by gallopping up to Beattock to catch the Mail; but at last I have decided that it will not do. So many things are to settle with all parties; even William Grahame I cannot see till tomorrow evening, and Alick and I have yet agreed, indeed I may say talked, on nothing specific. So I have settled that Jack and I are to ride off to Templand on Monday morning (Jack talks of proceeding farther on a visit to Kirkchrist), and on Tuesday evening I will bring you news! This night I am sending off a letter for that purpose to little Auntie. Grandfather too I may front, now that the whole business is adjusted.</p>
<p>O Jeanie! How happy we shall be in this Craig o&#x2019; Putto! Not that I look for an Arcadia or a Lubberland there: but we shall sit under our bramble and our <foreign>saugh</foreign>-tree [shrubby willow tree] and none to make us afraid; and my little wife will be there forever beside me, and I shall be well and blessed, and the latter end of that man will be better than the beginning. Surely I shall learn at length to prize the pearl of great price which God has given to me unworthy; surely I already know that to me the richest treasure of this sublunary life has been awarded, the heart of my own noble Jane! Shame on me for complaining, sick and wretched tho&#x2019; I be! Bourbon and Braganza,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dynasties of France, Spain, Portugal, and Brazil.</note> when I think of it, are but poor men to me. O Jeanie, O my Wife, we will never part; never thro&#x2019; Eternity itself! But I will love thee and keep thee in my heart of hearts!&#x2014; That is, unless, I grow a very great fool&#x2014;which indeed this talk doth somewhat betoken.</p>
<p>For thou seest, Goody, I am at the bottom of my paper, and there is no room for any sentiment whatever. Well, I come on Tuesday night and tell you all. The Kettle will be sighing wistfully on the brazen <hi rend="italic">winter</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Implement which hangs on the grate to keep the kettle warm.</note> and tea of choicest flavour, and kisses sweeter than ambrosia will greet my arrival! Unless&#x2014;the coach be full! But do not let this disturb you! I will come next night; and that is &#x201C;all the same&#x201D;:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See John&#x2019;s comment, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261009-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1826-10-09">9 Oct. 1826</date></ref>.</note> is it not?

<dateline>[<date when="1827-05-07">7 May 1827</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu</salute>
<p>I was just proceeding to finish a letter to you which had lain in my desk some days, full of apologies about long silence and so forth which you could hardly have had patience to read at the present time, when your unexpected communication<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter to Jane of <date when="1827-04-30">30 April</date> Mrs. Montagu had written in great distress to say that her son Charles after failing at Cambridge and having a disagreement with his father had left home, determined to earn his own bread and achieve independence. She also said that he had left some papers behind him indicating that he might seek work in Scotland. &#x201C;I must entreat the aid of your friendly enquiry, after any strange wanderer from England in your neighbourhood&#x2014;he has a fancy for you, and a great respect for the talents of your Husband, and it is not unlike his romantic spirit, to throw himself upon your notice under another name for he is so changed in countenance and stature, that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Badams could not recognize him, and I suspect he will not be called Montagu, as he speaks much of disgracing his name.&#x201D;</note> put all such impertinences out of my head and has afforded me unhappily a far more interesting topic for writing. Would that this strange Boy <hi rend="italic">were</hi> come to us; that I might send you better comfort than mere vain condolence! I should be so happy to write: your Charles is here. It would be all well then; or I greatly overrate both Charles&#x2019;s capacities of good and my Husband&#x2019;s powers of persuasion. In the meanwhile we do most sincerely sympathize in your anxieties about him, and most earnestly wish, that finding life not just so manageable as it looked he may speedily relieve them by his return. And yet, who knows but this wild step shall be productive of the happiest consequences, compressing for your wayward Son the experience of years within a few bitter days; and so the deep concern thereby occasioned to his friends only a price to be paid for the greatest satisfaction in him? Heaven grant it may thus turn out! Will you write immediately some further particulars of the matter. How long is it since he left home? Did Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> seem to be the place of his destination? In what way was he likely to try the project of earning bread; and what quantity of money had he to begin with. In short leave nothing untold which can throw any light on his present course, and make inquiry after him less hopeless. Had <pb id="pg-04-220" n="04:220"/>we but once the slenderest clew to lay hold of, you should not, my dear Friend be kept long in suspense: for neither M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle nor I would rest from tracing it out until the lost one was found. Surely if he <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> we shall discover him or, in case of his coming to difficulty, he will discover us. Did he but know the feeling with which I regard his Mother and the feeling which his romantic procedure has given me towards himself; he would come to me in any case without hesitation, as to a Sister whose arms were open to receive him. Poor Boy! there must be many a desolate moment in his self-imposed exile; but all such will work together for his good. I feel more and more confident of this the longer I think about it.</p>
<p>Of myself I have much to tell you when you have leisure of mind to hear. For life has not been stagnating with me all this while; but rather, flowing in a fuller tide than usual&#x2014;now vainly beating against grim obdurate rocks of necessity, now overflowing delightful shores of hope: where happily, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> treasure at least, of great price is come safe to harbour, while on the cruel rocks not a few gay pleasure-barks have suffered wreck. My Husband&#x2019;s health is not improved since we married; sometimes I am almost certain it will never improve. And then again I bethink myself: surely God has not put such gifts in him for no end; he cannot mean that they should be <hi rend="italic">always</hi> thus overclouded,&#x2014;that the eagle-spirit straining upwards in passionate longing should be always held back by this crushing nightmare of disease! And so good a Man, so kind and sympathizing towards all living, worthy of the most perfect happiness earth affords, is it possible that pain should be the lot appointed <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for his life long&#x2014;continual corroding pain, eating away all the sweetness and beauty of existence? No! surely No! and I shall yet see him well, contented, blessed. Do you not think I shall? Ah! whether or not there is here no room for complaint. In what terrestrial paradise since the Garden of Eden has not some one fair tree been set apart; from pining after which in ungrateful regardlessness of all the rest more than the first Woman have fallen? Let <hi rend="italic">me</hi> take heed that I do not add another to the number.</p>
<p>I hope much from a new plan of life we are just arranging, which offers him at least a fair <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> of recovery. What say you to our quitting Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in Spring next, to settle down in the wildest place of all Dumfriesshire, leaving the world to run its own race and bear away its prizes; content might we but <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> thro&#x2019; life with unfettered limbs? A tract of the worst land in this country belongs to us, which one of my Ancestors (apparently no lover of sweet sounds) has named <pb id="pg-04-221" n="04:221"/>Craigenputtock! There is a sort of house upon it which, I am told, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in the power of man to make habitable, and trees,&#x2014;starred belts of scotch fir, and dark melancholy lakes&#x2014;of moss water. In short it is a place where Thomas Carlyle and I may live in great content,&#x2014;where most people would die of <foreign>ennui</foreign> in a month. A Brother of my Husband&#x2019;s is going thither with us to farm the land; he himself is to study and ride and garden and write books; while I am to ride and study also, work, paint, play, and pet great quantities of live-creatures&#x2014; There will be nothing of what is generally called pleasure in all this; but there will be <hi rend="italic">peace</hi> which it is harder to do without, and which, under existing circumstances seems unat<supplied>[t]</supplied>ainable in any other way. Oh will you and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Badams come to us there?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written: &#x201C;Badams and I agreed that when I was at peace and he at leisure a pilgrimage to see you would be delightful&#x2014;and when shall this be&#x2014;on this side <supplied>[of]</supplied> the Grave?&#x2014; Never&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> Such a party we should make in the wild waste! the old grey craig would lift up its head and sing for joy! But I must stop for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle wishes to write a postscript and you are already weary. <closer><salute>All happiness be with you my honoured friend, and if not all happiness, patience and fortitude such as you have hitherto displayed, and which make me your true admirer and affectionate friend</salute></closer></p>
<name>Jane BW Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>[TC&#x2019;s postscript:] Doubt not, my Dear Madam, but I truly feel with you in your just anxieties, which the imagination of a mother so naturally aggravates. Yet fear not over much; for there is far less danger than you think. Many a boy I have known wander far and wide with far greater risks than your Charles, and return unhurt, and perhaps amended of his folly. The spirit of youth, especially of such a youth, strives towards immensity on all sides; and not till it has felt its limits, and felt that they are impassable and everlasting, can there be any peace or pure activity. Poor boy! he has early put himself to school with Experience, a wise schoolmaster, but a harsh one. Doubt not it is for the best: I feel that Charles has sense and honesty to learn his lesson, and where a lesson <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be learned, it cannot be learned too soon. I wish, I saw him; I am persuaded it might do him good. Write to us if you have reason to think him in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>: send me out on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> quest, and surely if he is here I shall find him, and restore him to himself and to you. God bless you, my dear Lady, and help you to bear this as you have borne much! <closer><salute>I am ever yours,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<p><pb id="pg-04-222" n="04:222"/>Thank Mr Procter for his kind letter, the enclosure of which I failed not to employ. I saw Mr Jeffrey, and talked with him boldly for an hour; a man of the kindliest and richest nature, which the perverse utilitarianism of the time has all his life been striving vainly to spoil. Me he seemed to look upon as an enthusiast, distracted nearly, but amiable in my distraction. We shall meet again, I believe and hope.</p></ps>

<p><salute>My Dear Alick&#x2014;</salute> &#x2026; The most important part of my present commission is to direct you to call at Annan on Thursday for Fifty Pounds which I this day paid into the Commercial Bank for your use, the further supplies not being ready yet for a few days. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I know not whether you immediately require a larger sum; but if you do you have only to speak; for after Monday &#xa3;100 will be lying at our disposal here: Tait having paid me the residue of my debt, by a Bill convertible (at his expense) into Cash in the course of four days. I was not bound to take a Bill at all, but hard money, the sum being due on the <date when="1827-04-15">15th of April</date>; but the poor man put on such a rueful countenance, that I could not in common charity refuse him. My assent to this harmless measure seemed to roll a millstone off his heart; and in the excess of his gratitude he even made me a present of another Copy of the <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, which I am about sending off to Mr. Robinson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Crabb Robinson.</note> of London, who had right to expect one of me. I hope, with this, therefore, that for the present I have done with Tait, and that my next Bookseller may be not worse but better than he. &#x2026;</p>
<p>My pen is very bad; I am in a hurry too, and can write to no purpose, except as Dr. Ritchie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Ritchie. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221229-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1822-12-29">29 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> said, &#x201C;on the point&#x2014;and the bare point.&#x201D; I have not told you of my journey, which was tedious but safe, and brought me to this &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">bit hadding o&#x2019; my ain, fra that</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [small dwelling of my own, for all that] before late night. Since then my days have flowed along as quietly as heretofore; after rather too large an allowance of idleness, I again betook me to my Book;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The unfinished novel <hi rend="italic">Wotton Reinfred</hi>.</note> in which though making but sorry progress, I am <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to persevere to a conclusion <pb id="pg-04-223" n="04:223"/>in spite (to use the words of Landalls)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></ref>.</note> &#x201C;in spite of the Devil and all his Angels&#x201D; (Bile included), who I cannot but suppose must naturally be rather anxious, for their own sake, to stop my progress. Of adventures with men or things I have had none worth mentioning: indeed often enough I visit not the town all day; but turn my steps in the opposite direction towards the Frith, where I have already bathed four times, with great brevity; and I hope more profit than pleasure.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>May I beg of you to accept this copy of my late Compilation,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>.</note> in the furtherance of which you more than once showed yourself so <pb id="pg-04-224" n="04:224"/>ready to assist with <foreign><hi rend="italic">Rath und That</hi></foreign> [advice and deeds]; a service which I would willingly convince you that I have not forgotten, however unable to do more than remember it. The Book has been out for some time, and your copy should have been sent sooner; but Late is better than Never; and I still hope you will accept the little gift in good part, and sometimes think of me with favour when you see it in your shelves.</p>
<p>I have got some Spanish Books of yours, a <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> and a
<hi rend="italic">Quevedo</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The works of Quevedo y Villegas (<date when="1580">1580</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645">1645</date>), Spanish writer known chiefly as a prose satirist with a leaning toward the picaresque. Carlyle mentions him in his &#x201C;Faustus,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">New Edinburgh Review</hi>, <date when="1822-04">April 1822</date>.</note> which I still keep in spite of the reproaches of my conscience, now really getting rather loud on the subject. The truth is, the volumes are not by me at this moment, but in Dumfriesshire; and my only consolation is that they are safe, and that your need of them is not pressing. I am ashamed to say that I have yet read far too little of them; or indeed of any spanish work, tho&#x2019; some late German Translations from that language (particularly one of Calderon)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Calderon de la Barca (<date when="1600">1600</date>&#x2013;<date when="1681">81</date>), Spanish dramatist and poet. The &#x201C;German Translations&#x201D; were by A. W. Schlegel.</note> have not a little strengthened my wish to become immediately acquainted with it. One is so busy, so laboriously idle! It will be long before I write aught worth reading, and yet I must not let my pen grow altogether rusty, and so my reading is too much curtailed.</p>
<p>I have got wedded since I wrote last: my wife also is a reader and a lover of German; and we have a pleasant Cottage here with China roses and the like, and the towers of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> peering thro&#x2019; the branches of our <hi rend="italic">tree</hi>, at a safe distance. Would not the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> way to get your Books be to come hither in vacation time and seek them? I am sure it would be the surest; and we could form as pretty a <foreign><hi rend="italic">bureau d&#x2019;intelligence</hi></foreign> for the discussion of <hi rend="italic">aesthetic</hi> matters here, as you would wish to see. There is a spare bed too, and coffee worthy of King&#x2019;s Bench Walk<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Robinson lived.</note> itself.&#x2014; Oh I would give a shilling to see one other <hi rend="italic">Sally Lunn</hi>!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260425-TC-HCR-01">TC to HCR, <date when="1826-04-25">25 April 1826</date></ref>.</note> But the Temple with its reverend alleys, and good inmates, is become a reminiscence; and London, huge monstrous London itself, looks beautiful by distance. Surely I shall once more see it, and the chosen men that make it worth seeing.</p>
<p>A letter from you, full of news of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sorts, would be a treat to be remembered. Some sultry noon, when your streets approach the first <pb id="pg-04-225" n="04:225"/>degree of Wedgewood,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A scale of temperatures to be used in kilns devised by the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood (<date when="1730">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795">95</date>) in which zero was 580 degrees centigrade.</note> and you cannot stir abroad for being broiled, who knows but you may favour me? I really should receive it as a most kind service. At all events if I can assist you in aught here, or in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> way manifest my sense of obligation to you, I shall <hi rend="italic">expect</hi> to be applied to.</p>

<ps><p>I have more than once meditated inquiring of you about that &#x201C;London University&#x201D; of yours.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edith J. Morley&#x2019;s note: &#x201C;H. C. R. was one of the founders of University College, London, and an original member of its Council, from which he retired only in <date when="1866">1866</date>, when he was ninety-one. When the University of London was granted a charter for conferring degrees on external students, he wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>: &#x2018;The admission of any man to be a member who can stand an examination, utterly destroys the social quality and value of the degree&#x2019;; and to Lord Monteagle: &#x2018;Examinations cannot usefully be carried on irrespective of the time employed and of the means used in obtaining the knowledge. It should be known that the student has had the benefit of a certain course of instruction. Knowledge is not everything. Habits and the power of applying it are also of great importance.&#x2019; All those who have enjoyed and benefited by University training will applaud the wisdom and foresight shown in these remarks.&#x201D;</note> I learn from the Newspapers that the people have advertised for Professors; but never having seen the advertisement itself, the offers they have made, the persons to be applied to, in short the whole aspect of the matter is unknown to me. If you know or can learn aught throwing light on it, I should be thankful to hear you; for certain of my friends are clear that I should make application for a post in that new Seminary; and indeed to myself it seems that some Moral Philosophy or Rhetoric Professorship there would be no such unhandsome appointment. I can teach Mathematics also, and Physics (<hi rend="italic">Physic</hi>, alas I know <hi rend="italic">practically</hi>!), and touches of Metaphysics, the oddest mixture of Scotch and German, Dugald Stewart and Immanuel Kant! But the <hi rend="italic">fittest</hi> place for me would be that of &#x201C;Jack of all Trades,&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Moral and Political Philosophy.&#x201D;</note> in case they wanted such a hand.&#x2014; Seriously, I should like to know.</p></ps>

<p>It gave us real pleasure to find that you had in very deed made a settlement in your new abode, and were actually boiling your pot at the Craig o&#x2019; Putto under circumstances however unpropitious. Your tears for parting (from Scotsbrig) will scarcely be dried yet, but in a little while you will look upon this movement in its real light, not as a parting, but as a truly blessed reunion for us all, where, I hope and believe, many good days are in store for every one of us. It will not be long till you have scrubbed up the old Craig, put in the broken slates, and burnt or buried the rotten rags of the late housewife, who, I am told, is indeed a slattern, and not only so, but a drunkard, which is far worse. Mary&#x2019;s nimble fingers and an orderly head will have introduced new arrangements into the mansion; things will begin to go their usual course, and the mavis and tomtit will no longer sing to sad hearts. Poor Mary! Be good to her in this her first removal from home, and remember that you are not only a brother to her, but, as it were, a husband and father.</p>
<p>As to the house, I think with you it were better if we all saw it before the plans were settled. Jane and I are both for coming down shortly. We shall not be long in seeing you. The only thing that absolutely detains me is a little article<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Jean Paul Richter,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, <date when="1827-06">June</date>. Froude (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> I, 396&#x2013;97) quotes Carlyle from an unknown source: &#x201C;Perhaps it was little De Quincey&#x2019;s reported admiration of Jean Paul&#x2014;Goethe a mere corrupted pigmy to him&#x2014;that first put me upon trying to be orthodox and admire. I dimly felt poor De Quincey, who passed for a mighty seen in such things, to have exaggerated, and to know, perhaps, but little of either Jean Paul or Goethe. However, I held on reading and considerably admiring Jean Paul on my own score, though always with something of secret disappointment. I could now wish, perhaps, that I hadn&#x2019;t. My first favourite books had been Hudibras and Tristram Shandy. Everybody was proclaiming it such a feat for a man to have wit, to have humour above all. There was always a small secret something of affectation, which is not now secret to me, in that part of my affairs. As to my poor style, Edward Irving and his admiration of the old Puritans and Elizabethans&#x2014;whom at heart I never could entirely adore, though trying hard&#x2014;his and everybody&#x2019;s doctrine on that head played a much more important part than Jean Paul upon it. And the most important by far was that of nature, you would perhaps say, if you had ever heard my father speak, or my mother, and her inward melodies of heart and voice.&#x201D; De Quincey&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;John Paul Frederick Richter&#x201D; was published in the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine</hi>, IV (<date when="1821-12">Dec. 1821</date>), 606&#x2013;12.</note> which I have to write before the end of this month for the &#x2018;Edinburgh Review&#x2019;&#x2014;a very brief one&#x2014;which I begin to-morrow.</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I am this day sending off a letter with a Hundred Pounds Bank bill in it for Alick at Craigenputtock; and had it been as of old, one sheet at a time would have sufficed. But by another of the many whims of Fortune, my Friends at <hi rend="italic">home</hi> are now separated (I trust for the glad reunion of us all); so that if I would pay my too long standing debt to you, I must write again. Not that I yet know how to proceed; for your whereabout at this date is exceedingly dubious to me. However this letter will certainly find you in the long run; and its contents will not cool in the interim; the chief purport of it being indeed to assure you of what you know well enough already, the unabated continuance of my brotherly love; and incite you, according to established wish and usage, to write more and more largely.</p>
<p>Of my own history here since I wrote last I need mention only one or two particulars. Every thing goes its course; I fight with dulness and bile in the forenoons as of old; I still walk forth diligently; talk <foreign><hi rend="italic">de omni scibili</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pico Della Mirandola, Count Giovanni (<date when="1463">1463</date>&#x2013;<date when="1494">94</date>), the Italian philosopher and writer, published in <date when="1486">1486</date> a list of nine hundred philosophical and theological theses he called <foreign><hi rend="italic">De omni re scibili</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">On Everything That Can Be Known</hi>]. Voltaire later wittily added <foreign><hi rend="italic">Et de quibusdam aliis</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">And on Some Other Points Besides</hi>].</note> when I can find fit or unfit audience; and so live on in the old light-and-shadow fashion, much as you knew me before, only rather with more comfort and hope than with less. Jane too is well and good as ever; and within these few days has set to studying German <hi rend="italic">in earnest</hi>. Mrs Welsh is still with us; but about to depart, the pleasures of Edinburgh being indeed evidently exhausted for her at present. Our evening parties still continue their modest existence, tho&#x2019; John Gordon<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270329-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1827-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> (who often asks for you) is for the time overwhelmed with &#x201C;Reports&#x201D;: last wednesday we had Malcolm<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Malcolm. &#x201C;Ex-Lieutenant of the <hi rend="italic">Forty-second</hi>&#x2019;; native of the Orkney Islands, only son of a Clergyman there; who, as a young ardent lad, had joined Wellington&#x2019;s Army at the <hi rend="italic">Siege of St. Sebastian</hi>, and got badly wounded, lame for life, at the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Thoulouse</hi> that same season. Peace coming, he was invalided on half-pay; and now lived with his widowed mother, in some clean upper-floor in Edinburgh, on frugal, kind and pretty terms, hanging loosely by Literature, for which he had some talent&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 159&#x2013;60). Carlyle met Malcolm on his trip to Paris.</note> &#x26;c, and <pb id="pg-04-228" n="04:228"/>one <hi rend="italic">Paterson</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Brown Patterson (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">35</date>), born at Alnwick, brought up in Haddington, educated at Edinburgh High School and University, at both of which he showed great promise. An arts student, <date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1824">24</date>, and then a student for the ministry; M.A., <date when="1827">1827</date>; licensed to preach by the Kirkcudbright presbytery in <date when="1828">1828</date>; presented to the parish of Falkirk in <date when="1829">1829</date>; ordained in <date when="1830">1830</date>; and died of overwork five years later. In <date when="1827">1827</date>, after the date of this letter, he was to win a University prize for a work published as <hi rend="italic">On the National Character of the Athenians</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1828">1828</date>).</note> said to be the &#x201C;hope of the Scottish Church&#x201D;; a very feckless young man so far as externals go, for his voice is the shrillest treble, he wears spectacles, and would scarcely weigh six stone avoirdupois; but evidently shrewd, vehement, modest, and on the whole well gifted and conditioned. Murray is beating up for boarders, Mitchell compiling <supplied>[a]</supplied> school-book: I see very little of either. So much for this.</p>
<p>Poor Wotton has prospered but indifferently since I saw you; tho&#x2019; daily on the anvil; the metal is too unmalleable, often indeed quite cold, and the arm and the hammer have so little pith! At present his farther history is altogether stopped by a new enterprize. One day I resolutely buckled myself up, and set forth to the Parliament House, for the purpose of seeing our Reviewer.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Jeffrey.</note> The little jewel of Advocates was at his post: I accosted him, and with a little explanation, was cheerfully recognised. &#x201C;The Article? Where is the Article?&#x201D; seemed to be the gist of his talk to me; for he was to all appearance anxious that I would undertake the task of Germanizing the public, and ready even to let me do it &#x201C;<foreign>con amore</foreign>&#x201D; [with love], so I did not treat the whole Earth not yet Germanized as a &#x201C;parcel of blockheads&#x201D;; which surely seemed a fair enough request. We walked on to his lodging together; discussing these matters. Two days after, having revolved the thing, I met him again, with notice that I would &#x201C;undertake.&#x201D; The next No. of the Review, it appeared, was actually in the press, and to be printed off before the <date when="1827-06">end of June</date>; so that no large Article could find place there, till the succeeding quarter. However I engaged as it were for paving the way, to give him in this present publication some little short paper; I think, on the subject of Jean Paul, tho&#x2019; that is not quite settled with myself yet: and thus, O Jack, thou seest me busily occupied with a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> trade! On the whole, I am rather glad of this adventure; for I think it promises to be the means of a pleasant connexion: certainly Jeffrey is by much the most loveable of all the literary men I have seen; and he seemed ready nay desirous, if time would but permit, to cultivate a farther intimacy. We were to discourse <pb id="pg-04-229" n="04:229"/>together at large some day, he projected, at Craigcrook;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey&#x2019;s summer home about three miles west of Edinburgh, where the Carlyles were often entertained.</note> and I was to call on <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, as (depend upon it) I had more time than he. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Es ist ein gutiges Wesen</hi></foreign> [He is a good-natured soul]. But enough of him for once.</p>
<p>Today I had such a packet of letters all in a rush! A letter from Mrs Montagu (her son Charles had run away, been found again,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She says at &#x201C;Sherburn.&#x201D;</note> and was still sulky); and inclosed in the same frank, a sublime note from Edward Irving, full of praise and thanks expressed in the most wondrous dialect; and last or rather first, for that was the paper we pounced on most eagerly, a dainty little letter from&#x2014;Weimar! The good man has Knighted me too! Did you ever see so polite, truehearted, altogether graceful a note? At the same time there is a naive brevity in it which in admiring almost makes me laugh. Read and wonder:</p>
<p><salute>&#x201C;To Sir / Thomas Carlyle.</salute></p>

<p>And now we are all impatient to know what this <hi rend="italic">pacquet</hi> that is coming &#x201C;over Hamburg&#x201D; will bring us. You shall know so soon as the new-made Knight or Baronet receives it. &#x201C;With the truest wishes <hi rend="italic">recommending</hi> myself&#x201D;!</p>
<p>This day I was in the Advocates&#x2019; Library seeking German Books, <pb id="pg-04-230" n="04:230"/>and I found (directed by Dr Irving) the first Article in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Review</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >New &#x26; Improved Series, V (<date when="1827-06">June 1827</date>), 157&#x2013;66.</note> devoted to our &#x201C;German Romance.&#x201D; The man is little better than an ass; but a well-disposed one; and never dreams that his ears are long. He calls me point-blank by the name of the city <hi rend="italic">Carlisle</hi>, without apology or introduction; says my lives are much the best thing in the Book, indeed sticks fast by them; and advises me to cultivate the field of Biography as my great concern. Goethe is very pretty, indeed they are all &#x201C;goody-good.&#x201D; Only the words <hi rend="italic">Herr, Rittmeister</hi> &#x26;c have been used here and there; and I write, tho&#x2019; with <hi rend="italic">spunk</hi> and ornately, yet in a devilish&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">careless</hi> style.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The reviewer took great exception to Carlyle&#x2019;s flair for &#x201C;the fracturing of our old language, and the propelling together of all sorts of odd compounds and novel phrases.&#x201D; His style is, he continues, &#x201C;at once preposterously ornamented, and unpardonably careless. His periods sparkle with lively illustrations, and are bedecked with every variety of tropes and figures; but these appear often as ill-assorted and mixed metaphors, and may be likened to parti-coloured ribbands, strewed over an under dress of incongruous hues and unseemly negligence. The whole appearance, therefore, is one of tawdry finery, not of chastened simplicity or appropriate and consistent elegance.&#x201D; But, he concludes, his remarks are not to be taken as &#x201C;ill-natured censure,&#x201D; for they have been given only in &#x201C;friendly admonition.&#x201D;</note> In short, the man is an <hi rend="italic">en</hi>tire blockhead: seems to have read some few pages of German, perhaps only of a German Grammar; but other<supplied>[wise]</supplied> rests in the pro<supplied>[fo]</supplied>undest ignorance of what he talks about. However I am <supplied>[not vexed at]</supplied> him (Heaven mend all our stupidities!); for he means well to me: but I will not cu<supplied>[ltivate]</supplied> Biography for all that.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Doctor, it is surely time that we said a word or two about your concerns after so fully discussing mine. Well can I sympathize with you in your present unrest, the like of which I myself have often experienced, and as I believe, it is necessary more or less for all men to experience. One thing only comforts me, tho&#x2019; to you it is well nigh incredible at present: That all this will pass away, and you find yourself a man of sufficient substance to be confident of your success in <hi rend="italic">almost any</hi> circumstances. O Jack! I know that you have great pride combined with great bashfulness; a vehement, resolute heart, under shew of the greatest irresolution; and the truest love under an atmosphere of incessant contradictions. Fear not: these outer weeds will pass away; and the true sufficient soil of your character will yet bear noble fruit. Jane and I were discussing you this very morning; when it was agreed on all hands, that you had stuff in you for a most substantial man and doctor, and could not fail in the long run to prosper for yourself and others. Fear nothing; &#x201C;lie <pb id="pg-04-231" n="04:231"/>open to light&#x201D;; seek light, search for it diligently, as for your chief treasure. I am still clear for Dumfries, as the best of all fields for you (and me): do you also turn it over, not as a theoretical but a practical question, in your mind; and prepare in due time for putting it in execution. It will be hard if it beat us all! Meanwhile study, learn all and sundry as you were wont, that so your time be not lost but turned to best advantage, as by this means it will.&#x2014; You see my space is full. O that I had whole sheets to write to one and all at Scotsbrig. Tell my Mother that she is still dear to me, forever dear. Mag will take the charge now that Mary is gone: tell her to stand to it faithfully, and have the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Kittle boailing</hi></foreign>&#x201D; evening and morning. I will write my Mother a long letter when the box comes. But if it do not come soon, I will write by post; for we ourselves Jane and I are coming down to Craigenputtock about the <date when="1827-06">end of June</date> (when I have done my article), and surely we shall see Scotsbrig too! Tell our Mother this and bid her &#x201C;stand to her arms.&#x201D; But whither am I running? <closer><salute>Heaven bless you all!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dear Alick&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>Not without some difficulty I have contrived to raise the wind; and here you have a receipt for another Hundred Pounds, which as I understand it, you have only to present at the office of the British Linen Company Bank, and indorse (I suppose with your own name, but they will direct you at the Bank, for perhaps there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> indorsation needed), in order to get the cash paid down to you. &#x2026; On the whole the place must before all things be <hi rend="italic">stocked</hi>; so I think you ought to proceed forthwith to the outlay (in <pb id="pg-04-233" n="04:233"/>cattle, etc.) of this sum; at least so soon as you see any right opportunity at Bucklivie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A village in Stirlingshire, eighteen miles north of Glasgow, where fairs were held on <date when="1827-06-26">26 June</date> and <date when="1827-11-18">18 Nov.</date></note> or elsewhere. &#x2026;</p>
<p>If you want a little more money for that purpose, I think I can still command it even on the spur of the instant: but unless these hills be a better bargain than I wot of, you will not need <hi rend="italic">much</hi> more, I think, immediately.</p>
<p>I grieve to think that the House must be standing untouched, and the season so rapidly hastening away. I am making what speed I can; and I think by the end of next week I shall be about ready for meeting you, perhaps shall have already met you. &#x2026;</p>
<p>I reckon myself about half done with this <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul Friedrich Richter</hi>; which I regret to say, pleases me only indifferently the length it is gone. So soon as it is done I shall have nothing more to detain me; unless perhaps the correcting of the <hi rend="italic">proofs</hi>, which however can be sent after me. This is not to be the <hi rend="italic">great</hi> &#x201C;Article&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was to be the &#x201C;State of German Literature,&#x201D; published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> in <date when="1827-10">October</date>.</note> which does not follow till next Number of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>. We had a call from Jeffrey the other day, in person; one of the daintiest little fellows in this country. I will describe him at large when we meet. &#x2026;</p>
<p>Will you write to me as soon as possible, and at full length: we shall want much to hear from you before setting out for the South; and much is to be considered which I have no time for considering. Employ your own head and hand, my good Alick, and get us nicely through these entanglements. I think there is no danger of our speculation <supplied>[not]</supplied> prospering. I often wish I were at the Craig even now; for living here, I do not think I shall ever be healthy. Perhaps I shall never be healthy anywhere; but at all events I will <hi rend="italic">try all things</hi>; never cease &#x201C;though I should go to Jerusalem seeking health, and die by the road!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is modifying a saying of his father&#x2019;s when he was seeking a farm to rent and live on.

<p><salute>My Dear Alick&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>You must not quarrel with this shortest of letters, for I am in the heat of a hurry; and this writing is to let you know that, for some time at least, no more writing will be needed.</p>
<p>I have got done with my Article, which is to be printed, I believe, this week; Jane and I are going out to Haddington, to arrange with Donaldson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Donaldson. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250719-JBW-GW-01">JBW to GW, <date when="1825-07-19">19 July 1825</date></ref>.</note> about <hi rend="italic">moneys</hi> (at least that is my errand); and on Monday morning first (we come from Haddington in a day) we set out for Templand, and the Craig o&#x2019; Putto.</p>
<p>I know not what sort of a shop you keep there; but Jane as well as I must come and see. Did they send you a <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> up from Templand? If not, never mind; our stay (or rather <hi rend="italic">her</hi> stay) must only be the shorter. Do not discompose yourselves about this invasion: who cannot take such as you have, should apply elsewhere. But, indeed, I doubt not, as in most other cases, everything will be far better than it seemed through the medium of timorous imagination. Where you are with those that <hi rend="italic">love you</hi>, if you cannot put up with all mere <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> of comfort, you must be a very odd fellow. &#x2026;</p>
<p>But the cream of the matter is this. Can you send two horses (of almost any kind) over to Templand on Tuesday first (this day week)? If not send me <hi rend="italic">one</hi> on Monday night, and I will come over with it myself next day. I know not whether Larry is with you, or how to do in the arrangement of the thing. But you will see how it stands, and to your direction I will leave it. <hi rend="italic">One</hi> horse to Templand on Monday night to bring me; or <hi rend="italic">two</hi> on Tuesday night to bring us both.&#x2014; Templand is within three bowshots of the Cample bridge (farther <hi rend="italic">down</hi> it is) on the road between Thornhill and Dumfries,&#x2014;some furlong or two from it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1827-06-25">25 June</date> Alexander had anticipated and answered most of TC&#x2019;s questions, but TC had not received the letter.</note></p>
<p>Dear Alick, excuse this incoherence, for you have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> idea how I am beaten about at present by haste. My kindest love to Mary; who, I know, <hi rend="italic">arie</hi>joices<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A Scotch preacher, in a sermon which Carlyle had heard, so pronounced <hi rend="italic">rejoices</hi>&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note quoted by Norton).</note> at the thought of seeing me again. Tell the good <pb id="pg-04-235" n="04:235"/>soul that her Sister is no Lioness, and will not eat her, but likes her very well.</p>
<p>Appoint our Uncle John<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken of Dumfries, who would help with repairs at Craigenputtoch. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240811-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-08-11">11 Aug. 1824</date></ref>.</note> to come up when you please, according to these &#x201C;regulations.&#x201D; We go to Scotsbrig after leaving you; perhaps we may <hi rend="italic">come</hi> and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> for a time. My soul is longing for the Country and Larry. I have written to Jack that I am coming. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Brother!&#x2014; Ever yours,</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry that I missed you yesterday, and cannot now expect to meet with you till after our return from Dumfriesshire, some weeks hence.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Dr Julius,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter seems to have been lost. Ritchie says that Aitken knew Dr. Julius.</note> which I will show you; and a very brief Note from Goethe, intimating that he had sent (or rather on the <date when="1827-05-17"><hi rend="italic">17th</hi> of May</date> was about &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">n&#xE4;chstens</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [speedily] to send) a parcel hither, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">gleichfalls &#xfc;ber</hi></foreign> [also by way of] <hi rend="italic">Hamburg</hi>.&#x201D; Now I know by experience how very negligent these Lieth and Hamburg people are; nay I am not without an opinion that the packet has already arrived, tho&#x2019; on inquiring the other day at their Office I could get no information, the parcels being still all in the ship. Yet would it not be a proper vexation if a message of friendly tendency from &#x201C;The Poet&#x201D; were to be lost in such a despicable spot as the Lieth Customhouse? Knowing your experience in these matters, and your constant readiness to oblige, might I request that after your return you would some day make the necessary investigations, and if unsuccessful in this instance, be afterwards on the outlook for this same precious <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sendung</hi></foreign> [consignment]? It would give us real pleasure to receive it in Dumfriesshire, and not the less that we owed it in part to your goodness. The Servant remains here, and knows our address.</p>

<p>Last night I supped with John Wilson, Professor of Moral Philosophy here, author of the &#x2018;Isle of Palms,&#x2019; &#x26;c., a man of the most fervid temperament, fond of all stimulating things, from tragic poetry down to whisky punch. He snuffed and smoked cigars and drank liquors, and talked in the most indescribable style. It was at the lodging of one John Gordon, a young very good man from Kirkcudbright, who sometimes comes here. Daylight came on us before we parted; indeed, it was towards three o&#x2019;clock as the Professor and I walked home, smoking as we went. I had scarcely either eaten or drunk, being a privileged person, but merely enjoyed the strange volcanic eruptions of our poet&#x2019;s convivial genius. He is a broad sincere man of six feet, with long dishevelled flax-coloured hair, and two blue eyes keen as an eagle&#x2019;s. Now and then he sank into a brown study, and seemed dead in the eye of law. About two o&#x2019;clock he was sitting in this state smoking languidly, his nose begrimed with snuff, his face hazy and inert; when all at once flashing into existence, he inquired of John Gordon, with an irresistible air, &#x2018;I hope, Mr. Gordon, you don&#x2019;t believe in universal damnation?&#x2019; It was wicked, but all hands burst into inextinguishable laughter. But I expect to see Wilson in a more philosophic key ere long; he has promised to call on me, and is, on the whole, a man I should like to know better. Geniuses of any sort, especially of so kindly a sort, are so very rare in this world.</p>

Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">The Nineteenth Century and After</hi>, LXXXVII (<date when="1920-01">Jan. 1920</date>), 103&#x2013;17. A.

<p>With Professor Wilson, the famous John Wilson, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Christopher North of Ambrose&#x2019;s Tavern, Edinburgh, and <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, I never had much acquaintance, never at bottom a superlative esteem for him, tho&#x2019; I recognised with admiration his great and singular gifts, liked him really well, and in the then state of my affairs, notions and outlooks, could have well desired more talk and intercourse with him than I ever had. &#x2026;</p>
<p>It must have been on an <date when="1814-04">April Saturday of 1814</date>, probably enough the last time I ever found myself in this fine Princes Street tide of <pb id="pg-04-237" n="04:237"/>human life, that an elder comrade and I, passing thro&#x2019; for some larger stretch of walking, had sight, I for the first time, of a Figure that has rendered it ever since memorable to me. My comrade was by no means an intimate, but he was six or seven years my elder, a polished ingenious enough kind of man, who knew, at least by outside, the lions and the rumours and topics of society, as I by no means did; and with whom, meeting him by accident, I had willingly consented to join company, on this occasion, and who accordingly proved really entertaining to me. His name was Campbell;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> from Galloway somewhere; went before long to be Minister of Peebles, I think; and perhaps this was the first and the last walk we ever had together. Our course lay along Princes Street from the west, the promenade all in its beauty, in its sunny gaiety; well worth looking at, and growing ever denser as we proceeded; fairly a kind of press in the last division eastward. Not far from the very finis, or Register Office itself, Campbell nudged me, and in an under-tone, murmured, glancing to a figure near meeting us, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Isle of Palms</hi>; Wilson!&#x201D; I looked duly; and sure enough, tho&#x2019; Poem and Poet were as yet only a rumour to me, here was something one could not at once forget. A very tall strong-built and impetuous-looking young man, age perhaps about 28, with a profusion of blond hair, with large flashing countenance of the statuesque sort, flashing pair of blue eyes, which were fixed as if on something far off, was impetuously striding along, regarding nobody to right or left, but gently yet rapidly cleaving the press, and with large strides stepping along, as if too late for some appointment far ahead. His clothing was rough (I think some loose, whitish jacket of <foreign>kerseystuff</foreign>), hat of broadish brim, on the big massive head, flanked with such overplus of strong unclipt flaxen hair, seemed to have known many showers in its time; but what struck one most was the glance of those big blue eyes, stern yet loving, pointing so authentically to something far away. We followed this figure, at least I did, so far as looking over one&#x2019;s shoulder would do; saw it, or the head of it eminent above the general level victoriously speeding on its course, for some considerable distance farther. Whether the general promenade took any notice of this big transit thro&#x2019; it I do not remember, rather think not; but from that day, &#x201C;John Wilson (<hi rend="italic">Isle of Palms</hi>)&#x201D; was an additional item in the little Private Gallery of Portraits my memory had taken in.</p>
<p>It was about a dozen years more, before I knew anything personally of Wilson, or almost even had seen the face of him again. &#x2026;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-238" n="04:238"/>It must have been in the <date when="1826">end of 1826</date> that I first had any personal acquaintance with Wilson; familiar as his name and wild lucubrations now were to me and everybody, I as yet knew nothing farther of him but his figure and his voice. One Gordon, from Kirkcudbright, a visitor at our little Domicile of Comley Bank, and an estimable old acquaintance of mine, often spoke with us about Wilson, and took a certain shine of new dignity from his known familiarity with the famous man and his circle. I suppose it was by him that I was somewhere incidentally on the streets (I quite forget when or where) brought to the enviable honour of a mouthful of speech with the great Professor, and the privilege of speaking two or three words again with him, if it suited both parties, when we chanced to meet. &#x2026; His conversation, never so casual, in such brief meetings, had generally something piquant in it unlike that of other men; a spicing of wild satire, caricature, or off-hand quiz, wild not cruel, almost always an ingredient traceable. And he loved to <hi rend="italic">dramatise</hi> any fact or doctrine to you by an example that might come to hand. It was always evident to me there lay sound sense and discernment in what he said; and I always rather liked to fall in with him, even for a minute or two, and could have liked much more, would he have consented to be really serious and sincere with me, now and then, which he never quite was. On serious speculative points he glided almost immediately into the sentimental; on practical or personal points, into the realm of quiz.</p>
<p>As this was all I could get of my Wilson I had to be content with it, and quietly despair of more. Even so he was better to me than nobody or than a common dull acquaintance claiming speech. A fine fresh stalwart human brother, something <hi rend="italic">massive</hi>, not in the figure and gait of him only, but in the form of his address, in the very sound of his voice. He spoke low rather than otherwise, with a melodious potency and breadth of tone, accent essentially Scotch, or even Glasgow-Scotch, tho&#x2019; with a certain refining tincture of Old-Oxford, too, as if <hi rend="italic">chemically</hi> joined there; voice spreading itself out as if in trustful exposition of the current something or nothing, in neighbourlike cordiality, and the determination to be gracious and agreeable,&#x2014;often a curious overdone self-conscious and self-mocking style of politeness observable, which tickled you into the due posture, and was abundantly piquant and peculiar. In fact Wilson was full of genuine sensibility to human fun; had a great deal of real humour in him; and no man, or hardly any man, was less of a hypocrite. But laughter, virtual, or actual, was his panoply and general cloak-of-darkness; <pb id="pg-04-239" n="04:239"/>of virtual he had, as it were, no end; and the very tones of his voice testified of it: actual he could abundantly awaken in others, tho&#x2019; himself, to my recollection, never laughed at all. &#x2026;</p>
<p>For a long time Gordon had been meditating for me a Supper or Night with Wilson, and deeply pondering how it could be brought about. After various failures the night at length was got fixed, and came. At Gordon&#x2019;s rooms, a party of Four; Wilson <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Gordon himself, and a harmless unimportant Lawyer person (whom I never saw again, name, I think Roy)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Roy is unidentified. There is a problem about the date. Lockhart&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> was not published until the <date when="1828">spring of 1828</date>.</note> opposite to whom, with Wilson on my right hand, I remember sitting. It was probably soon after nine when we assembled; dusk of a fine summer day;&#x2014;must have been of the year <date when="1827">1827</date>. Wilson, semi-visible, till lights and supper came, sat interesting us, and flowingly in talk, about a call he had just been making on Lockhart who had arrived on visit to his old friends that afternoon from London: I remember also, his <hi rend="italic">Life of Burns</hi> (which Wilson spoke of by and by) was just come out; and that Lockhart had said to him, in regard to London and his element there, &#x2018;Oh, don&#x2019;t ask me; don&#x2019;t bid me speak a word of that,&#x2014;I have run away to forget all that delirious stuff, for a week or two, among you!&#x2019; Bedlam or little better, Lockhart seemed to have thought, and Wilson to think. To all which we grinned or hummed assent with the recognition due from us.</p>
<p>Supper was announced straightway, on these good terms; supper and lights awakened new vivacity, especially the long sequel of whisky-punch did; and there arose such a flood or blaze of talk, Wilson the tongue of it, by nine-tenths or more, we the ear mainly, as I never witnessed or listened to before. The night might well be reckoned amusing; and truly so it was,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; one felt it was not very <hi rend="italic">fine</hi> amusement, but only very new and very <hi rend="italic">strange</hi>. Far more of wisdom, grace, and even of real ingenuity, cleverness and sprightly entertainment I have had in a night, from some gifted man; but never from any man such a boundless, quietly volcanic pouring of himself out in spiritual lava,&#x2014;all a kind of &#x2018;lava,&#x2019;&#x2014;which glowed luminous in the night, and never, for a moment, was mere ashes and soot, tho&#x2019; perhaps at no moment quite free of those ingredients. For he went along without study or distrust, extempore in all senses; and gave you, with careless abundance, whatever lay in him on the topic going. Nor was he in the least one of those <hi rend="italic">soliloquy</hi> talkers (Coleridge, Humboldt, &#x26;c., so unendurable, were they eloquent as seraphs), who <hi rend="italic">pump</hi> their talk <pb id="pg-04-240" n="04:240"/>into you as if you were a bucket: on the contrary he rather seemed to wait for your inquiry, for your suggestion of a subject; and never failed to pause at once, when his quick glance told him you nearly had enough. He was ready to talk of anything, even of any person,&#x2014;and would launch out into blazy high-coloured delineations of distinguished men; <hi rend="italic">dramatising</hi> his ideas, often enough (mimicking the great man&#x2019;s words and ways, in dialogues and incidents, which you felt were imaginary and poetised for the nonce); giving you a singularly vivid likeness in caricature. Caricature essentially good-natured almost always, with brushfuls of flattering varnish exuberantly laid on,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; you felt, nearly always too, that there lurked something of satirical <hi rend="italic">per-contra</hi> at the bottom, and a clear view of the seamy side withal. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and the minor Lakers, he gave us at great length, in this serio-comic or comico-serious, vein; of De Quincey (who, I think, was then, or had lately been, his guest for a good while) he had much to say, in farce-tragedy style, wildly coruscating and caricaturing; Brougham, too, Dugald Stewart, at last even Jeffrey and his own Edinburgh rivals, all done with swift broad strokes, not insincere, and with abundance of flattering varnish and formal <foreign><hi rend="italic">kowtow</hi></foreign>ing:&#x2014;I find our talk, thro&#x2019; those five hours, was principally of Distinguished Persons whom Wilson knew; Wilson nothing loth of that unsafe theme, the intrinsically guileless, childlike man. There rose, by intervals, plenty of other speculative neutral topics; but this had proved to be the fruitfullest, and we always gravitated back to it. I think it was for most part I that started the game; and probably it was for me mainly that he shaped his volcanic discoursings,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; by no means formally for me, all the rest sharing and cooperating throughout, Gordon by some <foreign><hi rend="italic">hotch</hi></foreign> of smothered laughter now and then (uncommonly genial of its kind), and Roy by his constant air of intelligence and interested attention. And so the volcano went, five hours of it; and the spiritual lava, never failing or flagging. Till the actual sun came beaming through the window-shutters, and everybody had to think of moving.</p>
<p>Spiritual lava I called it, but indeed it was <hi rend="italic">spirituous</hi> as well, or fully more! Wilson drank a great deal of whisky-punch; steadily, not in haste, but without rest, and as a business, all night: solid part of supper, to him especially, was nothing; the essence of it <hi rend="italic">drink</hi>, by way of keeping <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> on flame. This too was essentially our case (what we ate, or whether we ate anything, I totally forget); but our aim was, to hear Wilson talk, and we cheerfully (for there was no pressing, or speech about drink) conformed to his law. Gordon and Roy, <pb id="pg-04-241" n="04:241"/>perhaps, did a little to follow suit afar off; I went upon sipping warmwater, reinforced at long intervals by a spoonful of port-wine negus. Wilson, I think, must have had in all about fourteen tumblers,&#x2014;considerably above a bottle of &#x2018;pure <foreign><hi rend="italic">aquavitae</hi></foreign>,&#x2019; diluted with sugar and hot water. He also incidentally consumed quantities of snuff,&#x2014;a box of hendy-fort laid duly beside him for accompaniment; tho&#x2019; usually, I think, he did not wear a snuff-box at all. By degrees his upperlip (a scornful kind of lip, and <hi rend="italic">short</hi> for a man of genius)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle always insisted that a long upper lip, like that of his wife, was an indication of superior intellect.</note> got considerably browned or yellowed by the snuff, which gave him a still more off-hand, defiant kind of air. For the rest, the stout whisky-punch, 14 tumblers of it, seemed to produce no effect on him whatever; no more than if you had poured them into an iron pump, which only kept volcanically talking all the same. Towards morning you could perhaps notice that his complexion seemed as if getting halfperceptibly something of a grey-blue tinge intermingled; that the snuffy lip had a still more off-hand defiant look;&#x2014;and, on the whole, that internally the temper was getting visibly a shade fiercer. Once, I remarked, and once only among the whole of us, poor Roy got a slight brief pat: in some interval, Roy, not a little delighted with his position and entertainment, was venturing to illustrate something by a bit of eulogy on really good business talents; Wilson with a dangerous smile, broke in: &#x2018;Do you know, Mr. Roy, there&#x2019;s nothing I so much detest as an excellent man of business!&#x2019;&#x2014;which completely finished that. I remarked too that in speaking of distinguished persons (Dugald Stewart and the like sublimities), tho&#x2019; his formal flattery and <hi rend="italic">kowtow</hi>ing of them was more exuberant than ever, there was now first clearly discernible across it a substratum of authentic <hi rend="italic">per-contra</hi>; and it seemed to me as if here were a lion, wild monarch of the woods, licking all manner of pretended favourites, but with every stroke of the tongue bringing away <hi rend="italic">blood</hi>. In fine, things having got to this pass, and the ruddy sun-rays shining visibly in on us, we all rose to go,&#x2014;loth, all of us, in a sort,&#x2014;and went our ways. Wilson&#x2019;s way and mine were the same, for half my distance; and he listened or talked humanely to me, till in Glo&#x2019;ster Place, perhaps to the relief of both, we could shake ourselves loose. At Comley Bank I was surprised, and at first almost shocked, to find a pure white Spirit, lovely and loving, &#x2018;sitting up for me,&#x2019;&#x2014;quietly reading and waiting, hour after hour, till I should come. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; In this way had ended <pb id="pg-04-242" n="04:242"/>my Night with Wilson, the only one I ever had with him, or again attempted to have.</p>
<p>For another year we continued to fall in with one another transiently up and down, and to have a little off-hand discourse; offence there never was on either side, always the contrary indeed: but our intimacy grew no farther, merely continued grown at the small height it had reached, and to me privately declared itself incapable of much growing. Once, perhaps twice, on some trifling occasion I have been in his house for half an hour; once only do I recollect his having been in ours. One of my little errands to him was concerning a <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> and certain medals of Goethe&#x2019;s, which I was to deliver to Sir Walter Scott: Sir Walter (to my then great sorrow) had gone out of Town; I too was just going. He said at parting, &#x2018;Yes, I will come and see you, Craigenputtock and you, for certain I will: but you must write specially to ask me!&#x2019; I wrote; but knew beforehand, there would nothing come, not even an answer. Forty years afterwards my poor bit of <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>, Wilson now gone, came back to me in a Newspaper,&#x2014;some Biographer of his had found it and thought it printable. &#x2026;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to his letter to Wilson of <date when="1829-12-19">19 Dec. 1829</date>, published in <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Christopher North.&#x2019; A Memoir of John Wilson</hi>, compiled by his daughter Mrs. Gordon (New York, <date when="1863">1863</date>), pp. 322&#x2013;23.</note> I always felt there was in Wilson, more approximately than in any body I had (or yet have) ever seen, the <hi rend="italic">making</hi> of a great man; very nearly all the grandest qualities and opulencies that go to that result;&#x2014;but not quite <hi rend="italic">all</hi>; and that, in fine, the great man never could be <hi rend="italic">made</hi>. Which did prove, more sadly than I then expected, the result of his blazing course. &#x2026;</p>
<p>After <date when="1828">Spring 1828</date>, we saw no more of Wilson, heard little of him, and from himself nothing. His <hi rend="italic">Noctes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> we did not see. From <date when="1834">1834</date> and our removal to London, he had as it were altogether vanished and gone out of memory. He said something bad about the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, a little word, which somebody, or some chance, brought me sight of. &#x2018;Malice as of a child!&#x2019; said I; which indeed it was,&#x2014;and had something <hi rend="italic">flattering</hi>, when I reflected. Once after that he wrote a stiff embarrassed kind of Note, recommending some Edinburgh lad of his acquaintance; to whom I duly attended here, immediately assuring Wilson that I would. Not very long after, we read in the Newspapers that an apoplectic stroke had come upon him; then that he had retired into the Country, to his children and quietude; and in a year or two more that he had gone on the Long <pb id="pg-04-243" n="04:243"/>Journey, and all his wild eloquence was fallen silent forever. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> to him, a kind and sad <foreign>adieu</foreign>.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I sent you down a Dumfries Newspaper two days ago for a token that we had arrived safely; but I have not forgotten my engagement to write you fully on that matter; and so before settling to any regular occupation I set about clearing off that debt. Fear not, my good mother, that I will ever neglect to write regularly for your satisfaction: it is a pleasure to me to fulfil that task for one who loves me so well; and if it were not, the thought of what I owe my Mother would make it a duty. How can I forget your dumb pleading look? Do I not feel that you would write a hundred and a hundred long letters for me, if you could? Well, if you cannot write to me, I will imagine your answers, and write for us both.</p>
<p>It was pity we were all so <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> that day we went off; but one cannot well help it. This life is but a series of meetings and partings; and many a tear one might shed while these &#x201C;few and evil days&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jacob says to Pharaoh: &#x201C;Few and evil have the days &#x2026; of my life been&#x201D; (Gen. 47:9).</note> pass over us: but we hope there is another scene, to which this is but the passage, where good and holy affections shall live as in their home, and for true friends there shall be no more partings appointed. God grant we may all have our lot made sure in that earnest and enduring country! For surely this world the more one thinks of it seems the more fluctuating, hollow and unstable: what are its proudest hopes but bubbles on the stream of Time, which the next rushing wave will scatter into air. You have heard of Canning&#x2019;s death,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1827-08-08">8 Aug.</date></note> the Prime Minister of Britain, the skilful statesman on whom all eyes in England and Europe were expectingly fixed.</p>
<lg><l>What is life? A thawing ice-board</l>
<l>on a sea with sunny shore</l>
<l>Gay we sail; it melts beneath us;</l>
<l>we are sunk, and seen no more.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle quotes from his own poem &#x201C;<foreign>Cui Bono</foreign>,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 470&#x2013;71.</note></l></lg>
<p><pb id="pg-04-244" n="04:244"/>But I must leave these moralities, in which perhaps I am too apt to indulge. Before this time, it is likely, Mary will be with you, and have reported progress up to monday last, the day when I left Craigenputtock. She will have told you how Jane and I were overtaken by rain in Dumfries, and how we spent the night with the hospitable man in Academy street, and how his <hi rend="italic">daft</hi> maid came bouncing into the room after we were in bed, to the astonishment of &#x201C;Goody&#x201D; altogether unaccustomed to such familiarity. For the rest, however, we did as well as might be; and the order of &#x201C;Mary Stewart&#x2019;s&#x201D; apartment<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Stewart was wife of Carlyle&#x2019;s uncle John Aitken.</note> was even considerably admired.&#x2014; On Monday evening after parting with the Doctor, I cantered along without adventure to Templand; was met two bowshots from the house by a young wife well known to me and glad to get me back; and next morning by ten o&#x2019;clock both she and I were safely mounted <hi rend="italic">on the roof</hi> of the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Coach, where, the day being fine, we continued comfortably enough seated till, about half past eight, the natural progress of the vehicle landed us safe and sound in our own neighbourhood. Alison<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alison Greave, the maid.</note> was in waiting for us, with tea and other solacements: the house was standing quiet and trim, almost <hi rend="italic">overgrown</hi> with flowers, and within, all clean and burnished like a new needle. Jane declared herself particularly satisfied with Alison&#x2019;s general and special demeanour; and so next day everything returned to its old routine; and we were sitting in our bright, still, little cottage, as if we had never stirred out of it.</p>
<p>I set to work to trim the garden till my mind should settle after its wanderings; but as yet I am not half thro&#x2019; with it. Indeed the second day after our arrival, I was interrupted. News came directly after breakfast that the packet from Goethe had arrived in Leith! Without delay I proceeded thither; found a little box carefully overlapped in wax-cloth, and directed to me. After infinite wranglings and perplexed misdirected higglings I succeeded in rescuing the precious packet from the fangs of the Custom-house sharks, and in the afternoon it was safely deposited in our own little parlour. The daintiest <foreign><hi rend="italic">boxie</hi></foreign> you ever saw! So carefully packed, so neatly and tastefully contrived was everything. There was a copy of Goethe&#x2019;s poems in 5 beautiful little volumes &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">for the valued marriage-pair Carlyle</hi>&#x201D;; two other little books for myself; then two medals, one of Goethe himself, and another of his father and mother; and lastly the prettiest wroughtiron necklace with a little figure of the poet&#x2019;s face set in gold &#x201C;for my dear spouse,&#x201D; and a most dashing pocket-book for me. In the box <pb id="pg-04-245" n="04:245"/>containing the necklace, and in each pocket of the pocket-book were cards, each with a verse of poetry on it in the old masters own hand; all these I will translate to you by and by, as well as the long letter which lay at the bottom of all, one of the kindest and gravest epistles I ever read. He praises me for the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> and the others; asks me to send him some account of &#x201C;my own previous history,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c; in short, it was all extremely graceful affectionate and patriarchal: you may conceive how much it pleased us. I believe a ribbon with the order of the Garter would scarcely have flattered either of us more.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Goethe&#x2019;s letter, dated <date when="1827-07-20">20 July</date>, see Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 13 ff. One of the cards, to Jane, bearing the same date, is in the NLS, 2883.44.</note></p>
<p>But I must say no more of this at present; except that you shall see it all, when you <hi rend="italic">come hither in winter</hi>: for come you shall, that is a settled point, so you must lay your account with it. My Father and you may journey together; by Hawick, or many ways; Alick was even calculating the relative costs and profits of coming out to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> himself with a cart-load of potatoes and other nece<supplied>[ssaries;]</supplied> in case of his visiting us, you might all three come together. But any <supplied>[way?]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">you must</hi> come [<hi rend="italic">must</hi> underlined twice]: it would be a greivous disappointment if I could not have the pleasure of showing you this city and its wonders; and if we missed this opportunity, there were no saying when another might occur. So settle it with yourself that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to come; and in the meantime just consider when you can do it best, and we will study to conform.</p>
<p>I am to write also to Jack, a letter which is to lie waiting for him at Dumfries on Wednesday. For the present therefore I may be briefer. If Mary is not gone when you receive this, I think you may tell her that if she have any little superfluous butter-pot <hi rend="italic">even now</hi>, we could accept of it with advantage: the shop-butter is sometimes good and sometimes otherwise, and so not to be depended on. You will tell her more minutely how to <hi rend="italic">put it</hi> up, and how to pack it. The Dumfries Carrier will be the best conveyance.</p>
<p>I went on Saturday to see Jeffrey; but found him from home for a week.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though partly critical of Carlyle, Jeffrey gave him great encouragement. In an undated letter of about this time Jeffrey wrote to him: &#x201C;I feel at once that you are a man of Genius&#x2014;and of original character and right heart&#x2014;and shall be proud and happy to know more of you&#x201D; (MS: NLS, 787.1).</note> So soon as I have got Goethe a letter written, and various other little odd things transacted, I design sitting down to my <hi rend="italic">large</hi> Article for his Review;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;State of German Literature,&#x201D; published in <date when="1827-10">Oct.</date></note> after which, I shall be ready for the poor <pb id="pg-04-246" n="04:246"/><hi rend="italic">Book</hi>, which alas! has been dreadfully overlooked of late. It is pity one had not twenty minds and hands; double pity one did not faithfully employ the mind and hands one has! But I will turn a new leaf shortly; for idle I cannot and must not be.

<salute>Dear and Honoured Sir,</salute>
<p>I have now the pleasure of signifying that your kind purpose has been accomplished. Your Note of the <date when="1827-05-17">17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> May</date> reached us in two weeks, by the Post; and the much longed-for Packet, which it had warned us to expect, has at length, duly forwarded and announced by Messrs Parish and Co. of Hamburg, arrived here in safety, on the <date when="1827-08-09">9<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of this month.</p>
<p>If the best return for such gifts is the delight they are enjoyed with, I may say that you are not unrepaid; for no Royal present could have gratified us more. These Books with their Inscriptions,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Norton, the first volume of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi> bears the inscription in his own hand: &#x201C;<foreign>Dem werthen Ehpaare Carlisle f&#xfc;r freundliche Theilnahme sch&#xF6;nstens danckbar</foreign>, Goethe. Weimar, <date when="1827-05">May, 1827</date>&#x201D;; and <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi> (Vol. VI, 1<hi rend="italic">st Heft</hi>): &#x201C;<foreign>Herren Carlisle zu freundlichem Andenken</foreign>, Goethe&#x201D; (same date).</note> these Autographs and tasteful ornaments, will be precious in other generations <pb id="pg-04-247" n="04:247"/>than ours. Of the Necklace in particular I am bound to mention that it is reposited among the most valued jewels, and set apart for &#x201C;great occasions,&#x201D; as an <foreign><hi rend="italic">ernste Zierde</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An ornament of solemn importance (translated by Carlyle as &#x201C;so grave a tag&#x201D;) and described as such in Goethe&#x2019;s verse accompanying it.</note> fit only to be worn before Poets and intellectual Men. Accept our heartiest thanks for such friendly memorials of a relation, which faint as it is, we must always regard among the most estimable of our life.</p>
<p>This little drawing-room may now be said to be full of you. My Translations from your Works already stood, in fair binding, in the Book-case, and portraits of you lay in portfolios; during our late absence in the country some good Genius, to prepare a happy surprise for us, had hung up, in the best framing and light, a larger picture of you, which we understand to be the best resemblance: and now your Medals lie on the Mantel-piece; your Books, in their silk-paper covers, have displaced even Tasso&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gerusalemme</hi>; and from more secret recesses, your handwriting can be exhibited to favoured friends. It is thus that good men may raise for themselves a little sanctuary in houses and hearts that lie far away.</p>
<p>The tolerance, the kindness, with which you treat my labours in German Literature, must not mislead me into vanity; but encourage me to new effort in appropriating what is Beautiful and True, wheresoever and howsoever it is to be found. If &#x201C;Love&#x201D; does indeed &#x201C;help to perfect knowledge,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle in the &#x201C;Death of Goethe&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 381): &#x201C;For Love is ever the beginning of Knowledge, as fire is of light; and works also more in the manner of <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>.&#x201D;</note> I may hope in time coming to gain better insight both into Schiller and his Friend; for the love of such men lies deep in the heart, and wedded to all that is worthy there.</p>
<p>For your ideas on the tendency of modern poetry to promote a freer spiritual intercourse among nations, I must also thank you: so far as I have yet seized their full import, they command my entire assent; nay perhaps express for me much which I might otherwise have wanted words for. When I try to convert these written observations &#x201C;into a dialogue,&#x201D; it is as if one of the <hi rend="italic">Three</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Three Reverences&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>.</note> were speaking and speaking not to the world, but first to me in particular. <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> also, in that beautiful new Edition of your Poems, I have not failed to read; a bright mystic vision, with its Classic earnestness and Gothic splendour; but I must read it again and again before its whole manifold significance become clear to me. Could mere human prayers avail against an aesthetic Necessity, Faust were surely made triumphant <pb id="pg-04-248" n="04:248"/>both over the Fiend and himself, and this by the readiest means; the one would go to Heaven, and the other back to his native Pit: for there is no tragic hero whom one pities more deeply than Faust.</p>
<p>You are kind enough to inquire about my bygone life. With what readiness could I speak to you of it, how often have I longed to pour out the whole history before you! As it is, your works have been a mirror to me; unasked and unhoped for, your wisdom has counselled me; and so peace and health of soul have visited me from afar. For I was once an Unbeliever, not in Religion only, but in all the Mercy and Beauty of which it is the symbol; storm-tossed in my own imaginations; a man divided from men; exasperated, wretched, driven almost to despair; so that Faust&#x2019;s wild <hi rend="italic">curse</hi> seemed the only fit greeting for human life, and his passionate <foreign><hi rend="italic">Fluch vor allen der Geduld</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Above all, let patience be cursed&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I, l. <date when="1606">1606</date>). See &#x201C;Faust&#x2019;s Curse,&#x201D; Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of ll. <date when="1589">1589</date>&#x2013;<date when="1606">1606</date> of Goethe&#x2019;s work, published in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1832-01-07">7 Jan. 1832</date>, and reprinted in A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">LL</hi>, II, 351.</note> was spoken from my very inmost heart. But now, thank Heaven, all this is altered: without change of external circumstances, solely by the new light which rose upon me, I attained to new thoughts, and a composure which I should once have considered as impossible. And now under happier omens, tho&#x2019; the bodily health which I lost in these struggles has never been and may never be restored to me, I look forward with cheerfulness to a life spent in Literature, with such fortune, and such strength, as may be granted me; hoping little and fearing little from the world; having learned that what I once called Happiness is not only not to be attained on Earth, but not even to be desired. No wonder I should love the wise and worthy men by whose instructions so blessed a result has been brought about! For these men too there can be no reward like that consciousness that in distant countries and times the hearts of their fellow men will yearn towards them with gratitude and veneration, and those that are wandering in darkness turn towards them as to <supplied>[sure?]</supplied> loadstars guiding into a secure home.</p>
<p>I shall still hope to hear from you, and again to write to you, and <supplied>[al]</supplied>ways acknowledge you as my Teacher and Benefactor. May all good be long continued to you, for your own sake and that of mankind! <closer><salute>With the truest reverence, I subscribe myself,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dear Jack&#x2014;</salute> &#x2026; Almost the only really good thing I have ever done in this world was the helping you forward to knowledge; which, believe me, you will yet find to be no worthless or sorrowful attainment; for however human nature may cavil and complain in its impatience, this culture<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written from Craigenputtoch on <date when="1827-06-25">25 June</date> that he was enjoying the solitude there and was reading <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>, Sydenham&#x2019;s medical works, and &#x201C;what other books I can procure here.&#x201D;</note> is and continues the one greatest blessing which can fall to the lot of any man. Nay, I may say, if we speak of true culture, which, however, does not always dwell in colleges nor is always excluded from poor moorland huts, it is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> blessing which an immortal mortal would strive for.</p>
<p>But I must pause. The tidings of Alick&#x2019;s intention<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To marry Rachel Ritchie. He did not marry her but instead married Janet Clow in <date when="1830">1830</date>.</note> do not surprise me much, and certainly do not grieve me in any wise. If it make himself happier, it will make the whole arrangement lighter to us all. Jane, too, is very glad at it; for the difficulty of settling Alick&#x2019;s manner of existing in the house had not a little perplexed her. I shall expect to hear from him, and soon to see him.</p>
<p>Of our own selves expect nothing strange. All is as it should be, at least as it was. Jeffrey has sent me a note requesting the <hi rend="italic">Opus Majus</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His &#x201C;great work,&#x201D; &#x201C;State of German Literature,&#x201D; to be published in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> for <date when="1827-10">Oct.</date></note> by the middle of <hi rend="italic">next</hi> month, and enclosing a draft of twenty guineas for the article on Richter. You may conceive whether I am in a hurry, for I have not yet put pen to paper! I have merely been reading Horn,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Franz Horn (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">1837</date>). Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260314-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>TC-NHJ</sic><corr>TC to NHJ</corr>, <date when="1826-03-14">14 March 1826</date></ref>.</note> somewhat of Fichte, Schelling, etc., and have not yet shaped the thing into any form. Jeffrey is to call here one of these days: I saw him at Craigcrook for a few minutes, and found the little fellow friendlier than ever. I have written the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Erwiederung</hi></foreign> [letter of response] to Weimar, and by this time I suppose it is in the middle of <pb id="pg-04-250" n="04:250"/>the German Ocean, if not already at Cuxhaven.&#x2014; You see I am over with it!

<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu</salute>
<p>By way of excusing or at least explaining this long silence, I might tell you what various scenes I have come thro&#x2019; of late weeks, and how their rapid shifting quite bewildered my brain so that no sense remained in it for any Composition whatsoever: but I fear the excuse would be worse to bear with than the failure; as no powers of description could make my travelling journal otherwise than exceedingly dull. Since our return home the illness of my favorite Aunt<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh, her mother&#x2019;s sister. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270604-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1827-06-04">4 June</date></ref>.</note> has afforded me almost constant employment, and of the most anxious sort; her malady requiring a painful and dangerous operation. Nevertheless I might still have written; for, in spite of Edward Irving&#x2019;s testimony to the contrary, I maintain none living is so busied, that he may not write occasionally to his friend: however, you will consider that I myself am the only loser by the omission; and so take my apologies, such as they are, in good part.</p>
<p>Has M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving told you, my husband half purposes offering himself for a London professorship?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1827-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, Irving expressed some misgivings concerning the new University of London, which he thought was being founded on a basis too materialistic, utilitarian, and atheistic.</note> No conceivable plan could be more opposite to the one detailed in my last; indeed you will hardly understand how they should be lying quietly together in one head. Yet, both have been admitted on the self same principle; for both are solutions (by different methods) of the problem of living. But for the want of some sure footing for our present situation to rest on, it were out of sight the most suitable and every way desirable of the three: our dear little home here grows more attractive every day; all the conveniences both of town and country lie around it; and we have as good society as the place (indeed perhaps any place) affords. But then to be at the mercy of such people as Booksellers! to be this with a sick body and a high mind! it would render the finest situation <pb id="pg-04-251" n="04:251"/>under the Sun unbearable. Now whether as a Farmer in the moors of Dunscore,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craigenputtoch is in the parish of Dunscore.</note> or a Professor in the London university, one should be equally independent as to income: in the one case being placed <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the necessity of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> for bread, in the other raised <hi rend="italic">above</hi> it. For the rest; the arguments for and against the two projects are so well balanced, that one can hardly tell which to prefer. Which would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> prefer in like circumstances? Do suggest something that may determine us at least which way to <hi rend="italic">wish</hi>.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Procter did us a great kindness by his letter of introduction to Jeffrey. He is quite a little jewel of a man, and seems to love my Husband truly, who in return as truly loves him. We shall leave Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with more regret, when along with it we leave this new friend: but regrets, even where one has leave to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">speak them out</hi>&#x201D; are of no avail. Let me rather then, look forward to London and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu or (which is my lik<supplied>[e]</supplied>lier fate) to Craigenputtock and&#x2014;the pleasures of solitude.</p>
<p>We were greatly uplifted about two weeks ago by a little box out of Germany, containing a long, friendly letter from Goethe, along with the gracefulest gifts! a new edition of his poems, inscribed with his own hand to the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Werthen Ehpaare Carlyle f&#xfc;r freundliche Theilnahme sch&#xF6;nstens dankbar</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;to the Carlyles, worthy couple, with best thanks for their friendly interest&#x201D;]&#x2014;two other volumes of his works for the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herr</hi></foreign>, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">zu freundlichem Andenken</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;in kind remembrance&#x201D;]&#x2014;and a fine pocket book also, in one of the pockets of which was the <supplied>[pre]</supplied>ttiest quatrain written on a coloured card</p>
<lg><l><foreign>Augenblicklich aufzuwarten</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Schicken Freunde solche Karten</foreign>;</l>
<l><foreign>Diesmal aber heissts nicht gern</foreign>:</l>
<l><foreign>Euer Freund ist weit und fern</foreign>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Translated by Norton: &#x201C;A friend sends up a card like this / When instant visit he will pay; / But this time things are much amiss: / Your friend, alas, is far away.&#x201D; Norton says that Goethe wrote to Zelter, <date when="1827-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;Pray ask of the English literary friends in your neighbourhood, whether anything is known to them respecting Thomas Carlyle of Edinburgh, who, in a notable way, is doing much for German Literature&#x201D;; and that Zelter replied that he had not been able to learn anything on the subject (Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 29).</note></l></lg>

<p>But what astonished me most, and indeed nearly turned my head a whole afternoon was a similar card for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, laid in a blue and gilt <pb id="pg-04-252" n="04:252"/>box with a fine wrought Dresden chain, and a locket engraved with the Poet&#x2019;s head. Tho&#x2019; my paper is nearly filled, I must copy it also; for truly it is a pearl of great price.</p>
<lg><l><foreign>Wirst Du in den Spiegel blicken</foreign></l>

<l><foreign>Als wenn man den Freund begl&#xfc;ckt</foreign>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See p. 212n. for Carlyle&#x2019;s translation. Norton thus describes the gift for Jane: &#x201C;It is a black necklace of delicate wrought iron (such as German ladies, having given up their jewels, were in the habit of wearing after the battle of Jena); a pendant is attached to it, with a head of Goethe cut in coloured glass, and with a gold setting&#x201D; (Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 30).</note></l></lg>

<p>Two medallions, one of himself, the other of his Father and Mother completed this wonderful &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Sendung</hi></foreign>.&#x201D; Our little drawingroom, with all these things, might now pass for a Sanctuary to Goethe: my Husbands translations of his works, in the tastefulest binding my fancy could invent, already ornamented the bookcase; and while we were away in Dumfriesshire a good Genius to give us a pleasant surprise hung up a finely framed portrait of him.</p>
<p>But I must positively conclude; for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wishes to write a postscript, and I am encroaching on his room. Will you answer this without delay? And tell me how Charles has been going on and anything that concerns you? I know how little right I have to expect this: but I know also you are <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good. God bless you my dear Friend</p>
<closer><salute>I am always respectfully and af<supplied>[f]</supplied>ectionately Yours /</salute></closer> <name>Jane Welsh Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>[TC&#x2019;s postscript:] My dear Madam, Jane has surely supposed a polyglott faculty in you; for here is German enough to puzzle Crabbe Robinson himself!&#x2014; I have only room to say that I still think of you with affection, and long to hear of your good. How are you? How are all the true souls I came to know thro&#x2019; your means? Sad would it be were I parted from them forever; but this I am not, and will not be!</p>
<p>Will you tell me something about this London University, and my project of professing to teach &#x201C;poetic taste&#x201D; there? Do think of it, and <pb id="pg-04-253" n="04:253"/>say something&#x2014;wise, as you are wont. I should have answered Mr Irving&#x2019;s letter instantly; but that I am hurried into half-delirium by a paper for the E. Review<supplied>[.]</supplied> All good be with you and yours!</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Jack&#x2014;</salute> &#x2026; I had a letter from Edward Irving<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1827-08-27">27 Aug.</date></note> the other day about the Aesthetical Professorship in the London University. In a strange, austere, puritanical, yet on the whole honest and friendly looking style, he advises me to proceed and make the attempt. &#x2018;The Lord,&#x2019; he says, blesses him: his Church rejoices in &#x2018;the Lord&#x2019;; in fact, the Lord and he seem to be quite hand and glove. He looks unhappy, for his tone sounds hollow, like some voice from a sepulchral aisle; yet I do honestly believe there is much worth among his failings, much precious truth among all this <hi rend="italic">cant</hi>. I must even regret that he goes into those matters with so very disunited a heart; but there where he stands, I wish I and every one of us were half as good men. As to this &#x2018;projection,&#x2019; as he calls it, I have not yet taken any steps, being indeed too busy for doing anything. I was to write to him again, but have not. I wait for counsel from Jeffrey, whom I have not since seen.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To this point the text of the letter follows Froude; the rest of the letter follows Norton.</note></p>
<p>&#x2026; Since all matters look so towardly, I think certainly you ought to go, and look at this Munich,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Carlyle had been invited to visit Munich by Baron d&#x2019;Eichthal, uncle of Gustave and Adolph d&#x2019;Eichthal.</note> and acquire this Surgical Knowledge, the want of which forms such a &#x201C;bar of obstruction&#x201D; to your contented settlement in this country. I myself am by no means blind to the advantages likely to result from such a journey; and <pb id="pg-04-254" n="04:254"/>though I doubt not you very greatly overrate them, perhaps after all they may more than repay you. For one thing, you will return home with another sort of reputation than you can look for at present: a Doctor all the way from Bavaria, <foreign><hi rend="italic">jette poudre aux yeux</hi></foreign> [throws dust in people&#x2019;s eyes]; for most people are not so convinced as I that the great school for learning both Medicine and every other thing is the brain itself of the learner. Unspeakably the greatest advantage I anticipate for you is the intercourse you are likely to have with cultivated men, and the improvement in regard to polish of manners and what the Germans call <foreign><hi rend="italic">Welt</hi></foreign> [good breeding], which you are almost sure to derive from such a society as Eichthal&#x2019;s must be. He himself seems one of the best bred persons extant. By all means, therefore, bestir yourself, and set forth <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten Muthes</hi></foreign> [with a confident spirit]. &#x2026;</p>
<p>Of course you will not come to Edinburgh till you come <hi rend="italic">for good</hi>, that is, I mean on your way Munichward. You will need a suit of clothes unless you should prefer employing a German <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schneider</hi></foreign> [tailor], with various other <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, the preparation of which will consume some time. Meanwhile would it not be highly useful to lay about you for some statistical books and histories, and other representations of the country you are going to; that so you may not visit it an entire <hi rend="italic">novice</hi>, but in some degree prepared to expect what you see? I would have some History of Germany by hook or by crook; though in your case, I confess, I know not directly how it might be come by. Perhaps even Coxe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Austria</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Coxe (<date when="1747">1747</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">1828</date>), <hi rend="italic">History of the House of Austria &#x2026; <date when="1218">1218</date>&#x2013;<date when="1792">1792</date></hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1807">1807</date>).</note> is not at Annan. Do what you can: the best can do no more.</p>
<p>There is one consideration which must not be kept so in the background, but brought forward to the front of the stage, and rigidly overhauled: I mean the consideration of what in the English language is called <hi rend="italic">Money</hi>. Sorry am I that than at this moment I was hardly ever poorer. Jeffrey&#x2019;s draft I have not yet discovered the proper bank for, that circumstance being omitted in the letter, and he himself having never showed face since. Were it not for that body of reserve, I believe about <hi rend="italic">seven pounds sterling</hi> would exhaust nearly all the house could muster! &#x2026; Nevertheless, surely, Jack, thou shalt not be <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> among us all for such a sum as this. Tell me, after due computation, how it all stands; and the sum must be raised one way or other. &#x2026;</p>
<p>In fine, my dear Jack, I take my leave, in the deepest distress of <pb id="pg-04-255" n="04:255"/>body and mind because&#x2014;tea is not yet come.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Had it not been for the Doctor&#x2019;s intimation of your imperative need to hear from me, I should surely not have written tonight; for never man was busier than I at present; worn to an entire <hi rend="italic">scraping</hi> with sleeplessness and scribbling and a thousand half-vexations, halfwelcome calls upon me. You will be satisfied with a word or two.</p>
<p>With regard to the cunceiling<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The word also appears as <hi rend="italic">cumsiling</hi> and in other forms. It denotes the way an upstairs ceiling is plastered to follow the lines of the roof.</note> of these two upper rooms, it is not to be done on all the four sides, for in that case the bedhead would not get close to the wall; nor on only one side, for that would be very ugly; but on <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sides; the front, where it is natural, and the back which must be made to correspond with it. Our uncle described it well enough as meant to &#x201C;die away into a kind of oval thing.<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> This I hope you will understand sufficiently; and herewith ends the main purport and bearing of my letter.</p>
<p>Within the last ten days I have received no fewer than three letters from the Doctor; so fierce and manifold are his resolutions at present that he is forced to fly to and fro with inconceivable rapidity. I wish I could commission you to bid him come along in Heaven&#x2019;s name, and the sooner the better; for College classes begin in Munich with the month of <date when="--10">October</date>; and I daresay the poor Doctor will be as nearly as possible deranged in mind till he get thither. But on your seeing him I must not depend; and so shall write to himself, one of these days, perhaps tomorrow. I cannot but anticipate great good to the Doctor from this journey, if the honest soul have luck: at all events, he may come back with his humour out, cured of his whim of foreign illumination, and set himself down to practice the cure of diseases like another honest Christian graduate.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-256" n="04:256"/>I suppose he has mentioned to you that I had thoughts of starting as Candidate for one of the London Professorships. This must be kept among ourselves as much as may be; for it seems nearly certain that I shall actually make a trial; tho&#x2019; the thing as yet is full of perplexity. <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric</hi>, the class I once thought of applying for, has (I now find) as yet no existence; and I hang for the present divided between <hi rend="italic">English Literature</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy</hi>, with a considerable leaning towards the latter. I wait for advice from Edward Irving and Henry Duncan of Ruthwell, to both of whom I have written (Duncan&#x2019;s letter goes with yours), and both of whom know much more of the details than I do.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Henry Duncan answered Carlyle&#x2019;s letter on <date when="1827-09-13">13 Sept.</date> He said that he was prepared to recommend Carlyle to Brougham, provided Carlyle could assure him that the moral philosophy which he would teach would be based on a sincere faith in Christianity. But on <date when="1827-09-19">19 Sept.</date> Duncan wrote in reply to a &#x201C;heart moving and most embarrassing letter of 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x201D; from Carlyle that &#x201C;your Christianity is not the Christianity of the Bible,&#x2014;nor, I trust, of the 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Century.&#x201D; After discussing the point in some detail, he concluded: &#x201C;I have been endeavouring to persuade myself that I might still conscientiously recommend you to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brougham, &#x26; a sore struggle I have had in my own mind&#x2014;but it will not do.&#x2014; You yourself see this.&#x201D;</note> For one or other of these classes, it is almost certain that I shall become a competitor. Jeffrey whom I have talked with at large of the matter seems to augur rather favourably of my success in Moral Philosophy: both Jane and I dined with him at a country place of his called Craigcrook last night, and had a really pleasant five hours of it in such fine society. Jeffrey evidently has a high opinion of me, and even seems to like me well; tho&#x2019; he thinks I am a little extravagant or so; or as he calls it &#x201C;too German.&#x201D; We shall see what comes of this; it is all to be settled in <date when="1827-11">November</date>.</p>
<p>If I go to London, the mansion of Craigenputtock and its silent moors are likely to see much less of us; only at most, some two months yearly. On this, however, it were very rash to calculate at present; for that I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go is certainly by much the likelier issue of the business: indeed the good and evil are of the two are so very nearly balanced, that I really care very little whether I go or not: on healthier days, I am clear for going, and teaching all the Earth to be wise; but again on bilious days I care not one straw what becomes of it; for I think that in the wilderness of Craigenputtock I should be stronger in body, and I feel that the thing which lies in me <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be spoken out, go whither I may. Surely, surely, it were good for a man to have some anchorage deeper than the quicksands of this world; for these drift to and fro so as to baffle all conjecture! We will leave the issue, as should ever be done, with the higher powers.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-257" n="04:257"/>Meanwhile you do well to get forward with that House of the Moor; and glad am I that the ticklish part of it has been got so softly over. It will be a home for us at least in all weathers, and a kind of grim stronghold betide what may. I long to hear how it is all going on; how your crop stands these rough winds, what hay you have collected, how your peats have proved, and all other <foreign>etceteras</foreign>. Jean,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s younger sister, also called Jane.</note> I suppose, is with you by this time, and as I suppose farther heartily satisfied with the Pleasures of Solitude, which thereabouts can be so plentifully commanded.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a playful reference to Jean&#x2019;s poetic tendencies.</note> My best love to her, and hopes of seeing her here ere long.</p>
<p>Jack among his other mighty enterprizes has been writing to me of a probable <hi rend="italic">change</hi> in your situation also. What state of forwardness the arrangements are in he does not state to me; but it would appear that things wear a promising aspect. On this point, my dear Brother, if your own views are clear, I have nothing to do but to wish you from the bottom of my heart all prosperity in your untried state, which with a woman whom I so much regard, I cannot but consider as in many points of view an encouraging and hopeful one. You cannot always live as you have done, a wayfarer, and half homeless man: there is a time, when a hearth of one&#x2019;s own becomes an indispensable necessary. Certainly it is a highly serious step, and an almost fearful thing to think that there is no return! But what can be thought is thought already, I daresay in your case. So be of steadfast resolve; mean honestly and there is no fear! Other arrangements between you and me will in some respects be easier than they were: I doubt not all will be well. God grant it may!</p>
<p>Jack speaks of your coming in <date when="1827-10">October</date> by Langholm,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In eastern Dumfriesshire eighteen miles NE of Annan.</note> and bringing Jean and our Mother with you. Do! Do! Our good Mother <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and when can she do it so well? Of course you will <hi rend="italic">warn</hi> us duly. Write if you have any leisure tho&#x2019; there should be &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; to say. <closer><salute>Good night, my dear Brother! I am Ever Yours&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>[JWC&#x2019;s postscript:] My dear Jane. You must not think me a promisebreaker because I did not write in three weeks&#x2014; You know we had arranged the matter of purposed writing about the night before I left Scotsbrig; and so that promise seemed no longer to hold good.

I should like to have an answer in the affirmative to all these questions. You are to come with Alick now, it seems, instead of with the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> who indeed in his present fever of mind is scarcely to be entrusted with the charge of any thing so precious. See that you get ready in time then and <supplied>[bring]</supplied> your Mother with you and love me always</p>

<dateline>[<date when="1827-09-13">13 September 1827</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>Sir Thomas is just <hi rend="italic">excessively</hi> busy with his review, and so has commissioned me to write in his stead; cautioning me at the same time, to go to work in a business-like style, without any attempt at cleverness whatever. So you will understand how it is come to pass if my letter prove unusually dull.</p>
<p>In the first place, then, you are to come away in Gods name; for the sooner you get to your wits end the better. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Sawers was here the other day and is still desirous you should go with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; while your Brother, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aitken whom he was consulting, think the other plan the best. You may get from Leith to Munich, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> A thinks, and see all that is worth seeing by the way for somewhere about ten pounds: and truly, from the account he gave us, there are many fine things to be seen, museums and collections of pictures &#x26;c at which your heart will leap for Joy. But all this you will hear of when you come. N. B. there is no cowpox matter to be had even at Gloucester: so the physician of the Infirmary writes in answer to your Brother&#x2019;s letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This refers to the letter of <date when="1827-09-10">10 Sept.</date> to Carlyle from J. Baron (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), medical writer, trained at St. Andrews and Edinburgh, physician of Gloucester infirmary (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">33</date>), and author among other works of <hi rend="italic">The Life of Edward Jenner</hi>, a biography of the celebrated discoverer of vaccination. Baron&#x2019;s letter is of some interest (it is in the NLS); Carlyle&#x2019;s to Baron is untraced.</note></p>
<p>Your Mother and Jane we will expect along with Alick; who is perhaps as safe an escort for them as you could be, in your present fever of anticipation. Poor Jane! she is <hi rend="italic">seeing the world</hi> all of a sudden. What will the creature make of herself at Craigenputtock? I hope the<supplied>[y]</supplied> took her garters from her and every thing in the shape of hemp or steel.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-259" n="04:259"/>Further, I am to thank you for your two letters, and inform you how it stands with the professorship. Well! he consulted Jeffrey on the project, who seemed willing to help him to all lengths; tho&#x2019; he did not hold out any great likelihood of success. For this reason, he was <hi rend="italic">a sectarian in taste</hi>, nay, might even be called a <hi rend="italic">heretic</hi>; and this, not merely affectedly, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to excite a sensation</hi>&#x201D; but with all his heart and soul: <hi rend="italic">he doubted therefore whether the patrons of the University either would or ought to appoint such a person to such a charge</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter, undated (MS: NLS, 787.7), and many other letters from Jeffrey to the Carlyles are preserved in the NLS, but only one letter from Carlyle to Jeffrey, that of <date when="1834-01-11">11 Jan. 1834</date>, has been found. No letters from Jane to Jeffrey have come to light though there must have been many. It is now known that Jeffrey&#x2019;s daughter, Mrs. Empson, was pained and angry about references to her father in Froude&#x2019;s edition of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>. To forestall misuse of her father&#x2019;s letters in Froude&#x2019;s biography, she demanded their return; and it seems likely that she destroyed the letters of the Carlyles to Jeffrey.</note> In reply, Sir Thomas used all manner of arguments to show him, that there really was no sectarianism or heresy in the case; that he was merely more open to light than others of his craft and that in short the Patrons of the University would do excellently well to make him Professor of Rhetoric. <hi rend="italic">In his heart</hi> little Jeffrey seemed much of the same opinion; he gave him a letter to Leonard Horner, master of ceremonies to the University and repeated his offer of recommendation to all lengths. Away went our Knight, then, to the said Leonard Horner, for the purpose of getting from him such information as was required. But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Horner was dining out&#x2014;the next day he dined out again&#x2014;and the next he was only come at by the most fatiguing perseverance (You will recollect that Sir Thomas was all the while head and ears in his review, and that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Leonard Horner has a fancy to live in Lauriston Place!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horner (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">1864</date>) was a geologist, educator, and first warden (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">31</date>) of London University. In <date when="1833">1833</date> he was made one of the commissioners of the inquiry into the employment of children in factories, and until <date when="1856">1856</date> was a chief inspector under the Factories Act. He lived at 8 Laurieston Lane, and Jane&#x2019;s reference here means that he was inconsiderate enough to have chosen a place to live which was on the other side of Edinburgh, a long way from where the Carlyles lived.</note> And what do you think was M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Horner&#x2019;s information after all this labour and waste of time? Why&#x2014;that there was no professorship of Rhetoric thought of. Here was an unfor<supplied>[e]</supplied>seen-impediment which there seemed little hope of overcoming! We should have been quite at a stand; if it had not happened oddily enough that he received your letter on the way, showing that D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chalmer&#x2019;s appointment to the moral philosophy chair was at least no such sure matter as Edward Irving said. And then the mention <pb id="pg-04-260" n="04:260"/>of David Welsh!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chalmers, at this time professor of moral philosophy at St. Andrews, was not appointed to any chair at London. He turned to Edinburgh, and in <date when="1827-12">December</date> of this year accepted appointment there as professor of divinity. He remained until <date when="1843">1843</date>, when he became professor of divinity and principal at the newly founded Free Church College, Edinburgh. David Welsh (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845">1845</date>), minister in Glasgow, also failed at London, also received appointment (in <date when="1831">1831</date>, as professor of church history) at Edinburgh, and also went in <date when="1843">1843</date> to Free Church College.</note> Who might not enter the lists with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>? Certainly Thomas Carlyle might and will&#x2014; Accordingly he wrote again to Edward Irving, begging him to bestir himself and investigate the business more narrowly; to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Duncan he also wrote an explanation of his views and requested his advice in the pursuance of them. And Jeffrey with whom we dined the same day, was made duly acquainted with this new aspect of the affair. He seems to augur fully better of the enterprise in this shape than in the other; so that we now only wait the answer to these two letters to set about storming the moral philosophy chair with all our forces. What will be the upshot of all this Heaven only knows. <supplied>[I am]</supplied> not very sanguine of success, indeed I am not sure that success is to be greatly wished. If he had health it would be the most desirable situation; but he has not health and would this be a way to recover it? God help us!&#x2014; I need scarcely warn you to keep the whole prospect secret.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My own dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I know not that my month is yet expired, or you expecting to hear from me: but I am well assured that you will be glad of this letter; for it brings you welcome news. Jack is arrived in Holland; has the dangers of the German ocean behind him, and his broad foot on the fog <supplied>[heath]</supplied> once more! I had a letter from him two hours ago, which has travelled with to me an almost inconceivable rapidity, having been written in Rotterdam, only last Tuesday morning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Carlyle&#x2019;s letter is dated at Rotterdam, <date when="1827-10-15">15 Oct.</date></note> The Doctor, it appears, had a roughish passage; was becalmed in the Frith here, lay four and twenty hours at anchor in Yarmouth roads, and then was blown with a vengeance right over to Holland. On Saturday <pb id="pg-04-262" n="04:262"/>morning (only this day week), he saw the Dutch coast, &#x201C;like whinbushes rising over the edge of the sea&#x201D;; then a pilot came on board, with a <hi rend="italic">petticoat</hi> on, a little squat fellow, whose &#x201C;voice was like lead-drops falling on a dry <foreign><hi rend="italic">wecht</hi></foreign>&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Aitken Carlyle informed Norton that this was &#x201C;a farm implement made of dried <hi rend="italic">pelt</hi>, used for carrying grain; not unlike a large tambourine.&#x201D;</note> and he, with his petticoat and <hi rend="italic">six</hi> pairs of trowsers beneath it, led them all safe into Rotterdam harbour on monday morning. Doubtless I was very glad myself to hear of all this: for tho&#x2019; I believe there was no special danger, I was not without my own anxiety<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>I know not whether Alick told you that on board the packet Jack had met with an old class-fellow on his way to France, one Dr Laing<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Laing, of Midlothian, at University <date when="1823">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">27</date>.</note> from this neighbourhood. They two were to set out on foot together as far as Leyden, where the Doctor expected to get <hi rend="italic">steam</hi> to convey him on to Cologne, the regular boats from Rotterdam thither, being all engaged for a week by the Queen of Wirtemberg and her train. I calculate that the Doctor is already far on his journey; and enjoying himself not a little by the way: he was well furnished with letters of Introduction to people of consideration and kind feeling; so that for the present we may dismiss him, with the hope, grounded on all sorts of probability, that he is well and doing well. He did not fail to send his most affectionate remembrances to all and every one of you. In a day or so I must write to him; that a letter of welcome may be waiting for him at Munish when he arrives. The poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">slough</hi></foreign> [lazy fellow] will surely be much improved every way, by this journey of his; and by and by, I can have no doubt, we shall all have cause to be proud of him. He has a true affectionate heart, and a good stout head, and Time will give the rest.</p>
<p>I had some expectation myself of seeing you shortly; but that is passed away now. Brougham is gone from Penrith to London; and Jeffrey writes to me that he could get no certainty out of him about this Professorship; on which indeed he did not like to press him, till Brougham should have seen more of my writings. I have accordingly sent off to him last night my last long Paper, which is to come out in the next Edinburgh Review; but what effect it may have on the result of this business, may still seem very uncertain. Jeffrey appears to think that for the present <hi rend="italic">no one</hi> will be appointed; but that the thing will be left open for months, perhaps for years, to take what turn circumstances may give it. I myself am half inclined to think so too; and certainly it seems as if I had no right to put any great faith in <pb id="pg-04-263" n="04:263"/>it as it now looks. There is one great thing in my favour, however: I positively know not yet whether I should wish it or not wish it! This is the simple truth; so that equanimity regarding it is easily enough preserved. But in two days I expect to see Jeffrey, who returns from Harrowgate tomorrow, and he will tell me more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am going to begin another <hi rend="italic">Paper</hi> for a new London Review, also on a German subject;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the &#x201C;Life and Writings of Werner,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, <date when="1828-01">Jan. 1828</date>. The editor, William Fraser, had written to Carlyle on <date when="1827-09-16">16</date> and <date when="1827-09-27">27 Sept.</date> soliciting contributions. Fraser had been recommended to Carlyle by Procter in a letter of <date when="1827-09-16">16 Sept.</date> as one who &#x201C;claims the distinction of being your Countryman &#x26; a lover of all that is valuable in Germany.&#x201D;</note> and after that, I purpose writing another on some Italian subject<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s next contribution to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> was not on an Italian subject but on Burns (<date when="1828-12">Dec. 1828</date>).</note> for Jeffrey. Money will come in, in this way, and my mind will be more and more spoken out. It is surprising to see how much stir these bits of writing cause here in Edinburgh: the people seem to think that I am a genius<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey, among others, had spoken of Carlyle as a genius.</note> perhaps, but of what sort Heaven only knows. They will learn better by and by, if I be spared among them, either at Craigenputtock or anywhere above ground. In the mean time I am content enough; certainly no worse in health since you saw me; but on the contrary sometimes of opinion that I shall in the end get <hi rend="italic">quite well</hi>; a result which I anticipate the more, the less I really care about its happening. O my dear mother! it is not a healthy body that is the best, but a healthy soul: this I hope I more and more see into. Have we not all our crosses, each his burden in this pilgrimage; and is not the best blessing his who bears it most wisely? Often the whole thing seems to me a cloud and air-image, which in the eye of our immortal spirit will melt into nothingness, like the morning shadows before the Sun!</p>
<p>I am truly concerned to learn that you are not all so well as you should be at Scotsbrig. Alick tells me that your foot is better, and that Mag is quite recovered: but how is my Father? Will you beg him or Jamie to take the pen and let me know, never so shortly, how it stands with him? This foggy weather too is doubly ill for rheumatism; and doubly vexatious for one that has still <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> out, which however I hope is not your case. I must again entreat some of you to write.</p>
<p>And now when are we to see you and Jean? My coming down has become uncertain, and at all events distant by several weeks: but why should you wait for me; why not step into the coach yourselves, and I will wait for you <hi rend="italic">any</hi> afternoon, at the Coach-office, and show <pb id="pg-04-264" n="04:264"/>you all the wonders? We have really set our hearts upon your all coming hither; and for us, the sooner the better. I wish much you could tell us something definite about it soon. On the whole, I almost fear you will be for waiting till I come down to Puttock, to see about the &#x201C;house and cow&#x2019;s grass&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A common addition to the wages of farm-servants, especially shepherds, in Scotland&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note quoted by Norton).</note> there. This cannot be for six weeks, and then it will be winter. I think I must send Alick to stir you up: I am to write to him, on Wednesday, last week being barren of news.&#x2014; I send my best affection to every one of the good souls at Scotsbrig: forget not to insist on my request to my Father. And why should not Jean write? Tell her that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> will take it very handsome if she do. Does Jenny bring home her medals <supplied>[yet]</supplied>? Does Mag keep well?&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever and always (<supplied>[my dear M]</supplied>other) your affectionate son&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>Jane gave me a <hi rend="italic">ring</hi> on the anniversary of our marriage-day; which you will see on my little finger; and truly well it looks!</p>
<p>The <foreign>slut</foreign> porter brought us in the <foreign>firkin</foreign> and cheese, on thursday, the day after Geordy went out: there was no shadow of a letter. The butter is truly eminent; I think, the best we have yet had: but the <foreign>firkin</foreign> will not keep the brine! What is to be done? I have tightened the hoops; and Alison is getting some pot or other to set the whole in. I could not have pulled out the wrong lid? It was the one the <hi rend="italic">address</hi> stood on.</p>
<p>Jane is this moment come in, and sends her best love to all of you individually: the poor lassie has been complaining a good deal for two weeks; but I hope, as she does, it is nothing. The cheese we have laid by, as yet unbroken up; with the notion that at least it <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> well. Was Alick not drowned with wet?&#x2014; I fear you will hardly make out this letter; it is written in some haste, and with an <hi rend="italic">eagle&#x2019;s</hi> feather, which has already written many weeks.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu!</foreign></p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I hope you got the Newspaper last Wednesday; and understood by it all that a long letter could have told you, namely that I had <pb id="pg-04-265" n="04:265"/>nothing to tell. This Tuesday again, according to promise I write, and with greater heart, as well as more at large; for I have now really something to say. Of myself indeed still very little; but something of our wayfaring Doctor; concerning whom in these windy times, it is in truth rather satisfactory to know that he <supplied>[is]</supplied> off the German ocean with whole lungs, and fairly footing the hard Earth once more. We got a letter from Rotterdam on Saturday morning; written only the Tuesday before, and apparently in as great a hurry, as it had travelled in, round by London; where also some generous &#x201C;Mr Bright&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This must be Henry Bright (<date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">1869</date>), M.P. for Bristol, <date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830">30</date>.</note> or other, a Senator entirely unknown to me, had been at the trouble to frank it.</p>
<p>The Doctor, it would seem, had rather a perverse passage; now windbound, now becalmed, now blown with a speed somewhat alarming: but in the end, he had reached the Dutch coast without accident, the day before he finished his letter (Monday week); and was on Tuesday purposing to set forth on foot, with his companion Laing, to Leyden and the Hague, at one of which places he expected steamboats, or trackboats, or <foreign><hi rend="italic">trowse</hi></foreign> [a flat-bottomed boat], or some rivercraft or other, to take him on to Cologne. I calculate that by this time he must be about Bonn on the Rhine, where he had a parcel of letters to deliver, and was likely to wait for a day or two. Poor Doctor! I must write to him without delay, that a letter may be lying to welcome him at Munich, when he arrives. He seems, for the mean time, in good spirits, and like to enjoy his land journey better than his sea one. He sends kindest remembrances to you and every one. I daresay I have taken a millstone from my Mother&#x2019;s neck by the letter I wrote off to her instantly; and which, as I compute, she must have got yesterday morning. Heaven send the gausie Doctor back to us, were it but to chop logic as in old days!</p>
<p>Now as to myself, I believe I may say with Attila Schmelzle that &#x201C;the Professorship is taking <hi rend="italic">another</hi> turn&#x201D;; and that Brougham is for the present little more favourable to me than Schabacker was to that courageous Army-chaplain.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Paul Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">German Romance, Works</hi>, XXII, 182. (General von Schabacker is minister of Flaetz, to whom Schmelzle applies for, and is denied, the position of professor of catechetics.)</note> Jeffrey did not write to me till the end of last week; and then in no very definite terms; complaining that he had still nothing decided to say. Brougham, it appears, was very shy on that matter; could not be brought to any open speech on it at all; and seemed determined till he had seen more of me to keep <pb id="pg-04-266" n="04:266"/>his mind to himself. He is gone to London two weeks ago; so that my notion of seeing him at Penrith is scattered to the winds. By Jeffrey&#x2019;s direction, I sent Brougham the other day a copy of the Paper I have just been writing for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review; from which if he chooses to look he may gather some more light about me: but my own private opinion of this matter is, that for the present at least nothing more will come of it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nothing did. The moral philosophy chair was offered to Thomas Campbell, who declined it, and it remained unfilled for some time.</note> Indeed Jeffrey says that Brougham&#x2019;s purpose seemed to be, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to appoint any Moral Philosophy Professor at all, at this time, but stick by other departments of a more practical description, till the Establishment should have settled into firmer union, and be able to stand metaphysical discussions. I think it likely myself that this may be the way of it; in which case, I may hear nothing more of the affair for many months. At all events, my name and character are now in some degree before these people, and if they want aught with me, they know my address; if they want nothing, then there is no harm done, for I am not so much as a candidate for any of their offices, having as yet only been talked of by private friends. On the whole I am still of my old mind: I really know not whether such a thing would do me good or the contrary. But Jeffrey I believe is now returned, and I am to go and see him the first dry day: if he have aught more to tell me, you shall hear of it forthwith; and in the mean time, you see, there is nothing more to be said. I believe the business is getting known here, and perhaps with you also: of course you need not spr<supplied>[ead]</supplied> it; but truly it could do me little ill, were it published at all t<supplied>[he]</supplied> market-crosses in Scotland, and at the Pier and Shore of Leith to boot.</p>
<p>I know not that ever weather-witch was more out than I that fatal morning,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When Alick departed for home after accompanying John to Edinburgh and seeing him off for Germany.</note> when I predicted that it &#x201C;was not going to be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> bad a day after all.&#x201D; A worse day, I think, has seldom appeared in this century. I hope it did not melt you altogether into water; but that you reached Scotsbrig and afterwards Craigenputtock not only in a solid but also in a safe state. Surely if you have not in your <foreign><hi rend="italic">stooks</hi></foreign>, this weather will try you; for I think there was never worse for such a purpose. Today we have a perfect deluge, the Leith water &#x201C;flowing like a <foreign>vera <hi rend="italic">Sey</hi></foreign> [underscored twice]&#x201D;; and the only hope, that now certainly it must have rained itself <hi rend="italic">out</hi>. I long to hear that you are all going on rightly at the Craig; your <foreign>stooks</foreign> under thatch, <pb id="pg-04-267" n="04:267"/>your Highlander<supplied>[s]</supplied> arrived in safety and liking their pasture; and all but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign> [smoke] as it was when I left you.</p>
<p>I rather think you will have to write to me soon: for I would fain know about our Father and his Rheumatism; and I hardly think there is any one at Scotsbrig that will write me a syllable, let matters go as they will. You will also have much to tell me of <hi rend="italic">your own</hi>; at least if that visit<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Alick&#x2019;s lady friend, Rachel.</note> to the Craig took place, which you were speaking of!&#x2014; As to my visit thither, it must now be postponed into a distance of several weeks. I have a Paper<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Life and Writings of Werner,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, I (<date when="1828-01">Jan. 1828</date>), 95&#x2013;141; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 87&#x2013;145.</note> (about the Germans again!) to write for that London Review; which I began only yesterday, and must as usual hurry to be done with; and then another long one,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This, the Italian one on Tasso and his <hi rend="italic">Del Poema Eroico</hi>, was never completed. &#x201C;As far as prose could go, he has gone,&#x201D; Carlyle remarks on him; &#x201C;and we have fair <hi rend="italic">outsides</hi>; but within all is rather hollow, <hi rend="italic">nicht wahr</hi>?&#x2014; Alas! I do not see into this, and must talk rather falsely of it, or &#x2018;altogether hold my peace,&#x2019; which perhaps were better&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, p. 126).</note> I expect, for the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R. which I have yet to study as well as write.&#x2014; However if you want me <hi rend="italic">particularly</hi> to come sooner, say so, and I will come. Only I think it were better to be getting on as far as possible before I come; and afterwards moreover I shall have more time. Write to me as soon as you can find a spare hour; and tell me every thing that is going on, or like to go: the plastering, the roadmaking &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>I am writing with the stump of an Eagle&#x2019;s quill, which is as hard as potmetal; so that I declare my thumb is aching as if it had the gout. Besides I am stupid as an owl.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It may be worth noting that Carlyle&#x2019;s owl is not the wise one of tradition.</note> But I would not let the post go, knowing by experience the nature of much disappointment. Are you into the new kitchen yet; and in Heaven&#x2019;s name does it <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign>? How is Mary prospering; and dare the creature from <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>: front]</supplied> the storms of winter up in these wild Dunscore Moors? Be very good to her; and assure her of my true affection; and that I will drink tea repeatedly at the Craig before the winter solstice. <closer><salute>But I have done. Write soon, and believe me always Your Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name></p>
<ps><p>We got a <foreign>Firkin</foreign> and a cheese from Scotsbrig, but no letter. I think it was <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hand on the <foreign>Firkin</foreign>? The Butter is &#x201C;highly superior.&#x201D; Tell Mary that we have not given hers up; being great eaters (at least I) of butter; but may readily enough make a run upon her (<foreign>peatreek</foreign> notwithstanding) when this is done. Our potatoes are <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>. Have <pb id="pg-04-268" n="04:268"/>you got any newspaper yet? Get one by all means for the long nights of winter, and plenty of Books.&#x2014; When do you get servants, or have you already engaged them? Jane is not well yet, tho&#x2019; not seriously ill: she is sitting reading here; and sends her best regards. I must off to the post-office now&#x2014;so once more, dear Alick, I give you goodnight!</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I begin at the very top of this long sheet, being minded to write to you at large. Your most welcome letter found us last saturday morning; sooner than was confidently expected, and the more pleasant that it came rather unexpected. Some &#x201C;Mr. Bright&#x201D; had benevolently franked it too; so that we could hardly look upon the thing otherwise than as a voice from some kind Genius, bidding us be at peace, and no longer heed the roaring of the elements, for that the good Doctor was already on shore. I sent off word instantly to Scotsbrig, and yesterday to Craigenputtock: we are all much lightened in spirit; for to have had so much honesty, love, and physic and logic, drowned on the Dogger Bank<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A shipping hazard, a shoal in the North Sea off the east coast of England.</note> would have been a thing never to be got over. Seriously let us be thankful in heart, and hope better and better; for much good have we seen in the land of the living.</p>
<p>I am trying sometimes to follow you with my imagination, up the fair <foreign><hi rend="italic">Rheingau</hi></foreign> [Rhineland], and thro&#x2019; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kr&#xF6;nungsstadt</hi></foreign> [coronation city: Cologne], on to your home in M&#xfc;nchen; but it will not do; for all that region is to me unpeopled space. Where art thou, Jack, this very night? Surrounded by what aproned <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kellners</hi></foreign> [waiters], or wellbooted <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schwagers</hi></foreign> [coachmen], or whiskered <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mautbeamters</hi></foreign> [customs officials], or other men of strange speech, art thou living and looking even now while I write? Heaven guide thee, my dear Jack; and bring thee safe to Munich and safe back to us! My duty in the meanwhile is to write a full narrative in due season, and to hope that it may be lying ready for thy arrival in that temporary home, and all that is wanting for the present to content thee there.</p>
<p>Alick did not come that Sunday, confidently as we might have looked for him. He shewed not himself till Monday evening, and then <pb id="pg-04-269" n="04:269"/>only for fifteen minutes; having come along in the Langholm coach, and taken out a farther passage to Falkirk that night, in some vehicle got up for the occasion. Tuesday was wet, and he did not return; not till Wednesday after dark; so that, as he went off next morning, again by the Carlisle coach, we had very little of his company. Nevertheless in talking with him somewhat at large (for we both smoked together before bedtime, and walked together next morning to the Coach) I could gather that he felt a good deal at his ease comparatively; satisfied with the Craig and its appurtenances as a residence and occupation; in good hope about his bargains; and by no means downcast or despairing about his great <hi rend="italic">Life-bargain</hi>, the Purdhamston one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To marry Rachel Ritchie, of the farm of Purdhamston. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan.</date></ref></note> R&#x2019;s engagement does not seem to be of an insuperable sort; indeed Alick seemed to make light of it: I should not be surprised if he wedded this winter, nor on the other hand if he waited a little longer; for the matter was left in doubt; and on my own part I considered it a delicate matter to advise him decisively either the one way or the other. I need not say that he charged me strictly on your account, for whom indeed he seemed to feel an anxiety unusual to him. Since we parted I have not heard a word; and know only that he must have got himself wetted to the bone, at least if a cataract of rain could reach so far.</p>
<p>From Scotsbrig no letters; but yet a token, worthy of all acceptance; a <foreign>firkin</foreign> of special butter, addressed apparently in Alick&#x2019;s hand, as he had passed that way; for he was to wait there overnight, and&#x2014;take Rachel and Mag up with him next day to see Craigenputtock! I could have liked well to hear how our Father was; for it seems his rheumatism, which had been almost removed, had again returned upon him; and at Alick&#x2019;s departure, he was nearly confined to the house. In his agricultural anxiety, he had ventured out among the damp stubbles too early. I hope and believe that he is better, at least no worse, or they would have written to me; for I particularly pressed it. The rest were all got well again: the shearing done, great part <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, and all things moving on, tho&#x2019; with many joltings, as they usually do. I suspect you will hear little of Scotsbrig except thro&#x2019; me; for they are lazy penmen. What I can learn I will send.</p>
<p>But I am forgetting that you want to know about the Professorship, and are yet ignorant of its having come to nothing, or at least having been removed to an uncertain and uninteresting distance. I heard nothing of the matter for two weeks, and not then till I had <pb id="pg-04-270" n="04:270"/>applied by letter to my kind little spokesman Jeffrey. He wrote to me by return of Post that Brougham was already gone to London; and that when he saw him, the &#x201C;Politician&#x201D; fought extremely shy; seemed alarmed somewhat at my exotic predilections; and withal of opinion that it might be judicious to postpone the appointment of Moral Philosophy altogether, till the Institution had taken root on the more fertile soil of medical and other practical Science. He said however that farther than &#x201C;speak of me some half dozen times to B.,&#x201D; he could not press the business; my last Paper on &#x201C;German Literature&#x201D; not being in readiness for inspection. This he advised me to procure from M&#x2019;Cork,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >M&#x2019;Corkindale, foreman-printer for Ballantyne.</note> and send off to Brougham; to whom in the meanwhile he himself would write. The <hi rend="italic">Article</hi>, which has been printed with scarcely any alteration, I accordingly sent off: but no answer can yet be expected; nor has Jeffrey anything new to say on the affair; for I saw him today, and walked from the Dukedom<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craigcrook. Carlyle frequently refers to Jeffrey as the &#x201C;Duke of Craigcrook.&#x201D;</note> to the City with him, discoursing of various matters in the most edifying way. I myself believe that no appointment whatever to that chair will take place for some time, perhaps for some considerable time; and that in the meanwhile Brougham will keep his eye on me, and if he finds that I prosper, may apply to me; if not, will leave me standing. At all events, the thing is right: I am before these people in some shape, perhaps as near my real one as I could expect; and if they want nothing with me, the &#x201C;Devil b&#x2019; in me,&#x201D; as daft Wull said, &#x201C;if I want anything with <hi rend="italic">them</hi> either.&#x201D; I am still as undetermined as ever, whether even their acceptance of me would be for my good or not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am beginning (purpose seriously beginning tomorrow) an Article on <hi rend="italic">Zacharias Werner</hi>, for the Foreign Quarterly Re<supplied>[vie]</supplied>w; concerning which I have had another application from a dirty Cockney, one of the publishing Booksellers, whom Tait sent hither. They have &#x201C;gat,&#x201D; he says &#x201C;s&#x2019;ch a <foreign><hi rend="italic">felle</hi>nx</foreign> of ta<hi rend="italic">le</hi>nt&#x201D;; and partly expect an &#x201C;Article&#x201D; even from <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Gutta&#x201D;</hi> [underscored twice]!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe.</note> Jane and I laughed outright at him.&#x2014; I design afterwards, if Jeffrey is willing, to give a Discourse on Tasso, as I proposed; after which I daresay I shall have to visit Craigenputtock for a day or two; and farther than this, my view extends not into the Future with any certainty.</p>
<p>For the present there is no change in our position, except such as the course of the Earth round the Sun produces, in the shape of horrid deluges of rain. Jane, poor <foreign>wee</foreign> thing, is not got well yet, tho&#x2019; <pb id="pg-04-271" n="04:271"/>I think she is a little better. In Science, Art, Politics and Manufactures there is nothing singular; except perhaps that &#x201C;Professor&#x201D; Macculloch has been presented with the freedom of the Burgh of Dumfries, and Dequincey has taken a <hi rend="italic">Diarrhea</hi>. Of the latter circumstance, I was apprized only last night (from Gordon), tho&#x2019; the sufferer himself had promulgated it in the Police Court, where he was bearing witness, two days before. May the Lord have mercy on him!</p>
<p>Becker<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. F. W. Becker.</note> sometimes comes hither, and seems to have far more to say than he can find words for. No bad youth, I believe; but, as Packman Saunders said of the London people, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">terribly aff for a <foreign>langitch</foreign></hi>!&#x201D; Mitchell also we see: he is just finishing his Geography, a laborious bead-roll, which I wonder that he has had patience to go thro&#x2019; so honestly. Williams,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mitchell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Outlines of Ancient and Modern Geography</hi> was published anonymously, presumably <date when="1827">late in 1827</date> or <date when="1828">early in 1828</date>. John Williams (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>), distinguished Welsh classical scholar, author of <hi rend="italic">Alexander the Great</hi> (<date when="1829">1829</date>). See <ref target="volume-04/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29524"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>.</note> he says, is writing a History of Alexander the Great! John Wilson has not been down to us; nor tho&#x2019; he volunteered a fresh promise when I saw him last, do I very confidently expect him. I suspect he feels a sort of division from me: for hitherto at least I am an honest &#x201C;striver after the <hi rend="italic">Idea</hi>,&#x201D; and he has in a great measure renounced it, and between Blackwood and the Scotch Kirk-session, has almost degenerated into Fichte&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mongrel.&#x201D; Walter Scott again is no mongrel, but a sufficient &#x201C;hodman&#x201D;; and his hod indeed is filled with good gingerbread and &#x201C;black-<hi rend="italic">man</hi>&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A coarse kind of toffy made of treacle&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note). Carlyle refers to Fichte&#x2019;s <date when="1805">1805</date> lectures <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber das Wesen des Gelehrten</hi> (according to Hill Shine, the only work by Fichte he read), which he discussed in &#x201C;State of German Literature&#x201D; published in the <date when="1827-10">October</date> <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>. &#x201C;Every man who labours,&#x201D; Carlyle wrote there, &#x201C;&#x2026; must first have possessed himself of the Divine Idea, or, at least, be with his whole heart and his whole soul striving after it. If, without possessing it or striving after it, he abide diligently by some material practical department of knowledge, he may indeed still be (says Fichte, in his rugged way) a &#x2018;useful hodman&#x2019;; but should he attempt to deal with the Whole, and to become an architect, he is, in strictness of language, &#x2018;Nothing&#x2019;;&#x2014;&#x2018;he is an ambiguous mongrel between the possessor of the Idea, and the man who feels himself solidly supported and carried on by the common Reality of things: in his fruitless endeavor after the Idea, he has neglected to acquire the craft of taking part in this Reality; and so hovers between the two worlds, without pertaining to either&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 59). Carlyle, using Fichte&#x2019;s terminology, implies that Scott is a &#x201C;useful&#x201D; if limited literary &#x201C;hodman,&#x201D; a writer untroubled by metaphysical speculation and competent within a restricted sphere. Wilson, however, not possessing and no longer striving after the &#x201C;Divine Idea,&#x201D; finds himself caught between his <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> work (his effort to base himself in &#x201C;the common Reality of things&#x201D;) and the Scotch Kirk-session (his &#x201C;fruitless endeavour after the Idea&#x201D;). Hovering between these &#x201C;two worlds,&#x201D; he becomes almost an &#x201C;ambiguous mongrel.&#x201D; Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 105.</note> to satisfy a hungry and discerning <pb id="pg-04-272" n="04:272"/>public. May Heaven be merciful to us all; for Matter presses down Mind in the most lamentable fashion; and the poor sons of Dust hardly know in these times to what hand to turn them!</p>
<p>Now, Brother Jack, it cannot be doubtful to thy mind, that if thou hadst desire for a letter to Munich, we may naturally have much more for one from it. How many hundred thousand questions could we ask already and you answer! How fared you on your journey; how found you the Baron and the <foreign>Fr&#xE4;ulein</foreign>; and did their welcome prove what you expected? Present our regards to the worthy gentleman; and say that if there be aught he would have us do, it will be a kindness to mention it.&#x2014; Have you yet found any comfort in speaking German? Did you see Schlegel, and find him a &#x201C;puppy&#x201D;? Is Schelling at Munich, and accessible? Are you like to be happy there? If not, bolt, and come home to us again! There are &#x201C;meat, clothes and fire&#x201D; to be had in old Scotland yet, for all fencible men. In short, Jack, no body of news, no largeness of paper, or smallness of type will entirely content us. Jane&#x2019;s best affection accompanies mine: she has missed her Review; and says you will bring it back to her. Alison herself shed warm tears that day you went off; she evidently has a secret respect for her Physician, tho&#x2019; she admits that in <hi rend="italic">orderliness</hi> he is inferior to &#x201C;the Master&#x201D;; which latter for instance always gives his coat &#x201C;some kind of fold&#x201D; when he lays it off, while the former often leave his &#x201C;like&#x2014;fishguts&#x201D;! This <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kraftspruch</hi></foreign> [strong, pithy language] of the fishguts must be forgiven her; it was worthy of Annandale itself.&#x2014; In conclusion, Dear Jack, think often or rather always of us, and repay our love with love. Study, like a man of true head and true heart: you have much to learn, but will learn it all. Endeavour to see Germany and German men as they are; and learn by whatever good is to be found amongst them. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Geradheit, Urtheil und Vertr&#xE4;glichkeit</hi></foreign>!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These words are from a poem in Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">West&#xF6;stlicher Divan</hi>, Book VI, which Carlyle translates and uses as prefatory verses to <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 193). The translation reads as follows: &#x201C;Enweri tells us, a most royal man, / The deepest heart and highest head to scan: / &#x2018;In every place, at every time, thy surest chance / Lies in Decision, Justice, Tolerance.&#x2019;&#x201D; Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260719-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1826-07-19">19 July 1826</date></ref>.</note> were my last direction to you, on that <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> enough day.

Carlyle also spoke of De Quincey and Southey as being shaped like a pair of tongs (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, II, 152, 281; Norton, <hi rend="italic">L26&#x2013;36</hi>, p. 505).</note> <closer><salute>Love me always, as I on my side am always&#x2014; Thy true Brother</salute></closer> <name>T.

<ps><p><pb id="pg-04-273" n="04:273"/>&#x2014;Becker says the Letters should come &#x201C;via Holland,&#x201D; which is safer in winter. I believe few or none of them, on any plan, are lost.</p>

<p>We shall expect your letter, without loss of a moment; for I am even afraid I myself have been too long. I would have written sooner; but for the London affair; on which till very lately, I may even say till today, I had no absolute certainty.&#x2014; Our Mother and Jean, will not come, I daresay till I go down and fetch them; perhaps in six weeks or so.</p>
<p>Are you keeping a regular Journal? Do not neglect it. You have left Tait&#x2019;s accounts all lying here: I am afraid they are <hi rend="italic">past entire</hi> preservation, even if they deserved it.</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Alick&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>I received your Letter this morning, and must not disappoint you of an answer, though it be a brief one. I am as usual in violent haste, being busied with that scribble for the London people,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Life and Writings of Werner,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, I (<date when="1828-01">Jan. 1828</date>), 95&#x2013;141.</note> and in some danger of being belated.</p>
<p>To proceed to business then. Jane and I are of opinion that if the floor of that little backroom, which is or was to be yours, be considered sufficient as it now stands flagged, you should let it stand so: but if, as we partly suppose, the flags of it are all broken, and it will require to be renewed at any rate, then we think, considering the small difference of price, a <hi rend="italic">wooden floor</hi> will be decidedly preferable. With regard again to the mantel-piece of the room which is now <pb id="pg-04-274" n="04:274"/>kitchen and is to be dining-room, I recollect speaking once to our Uncle on the subject; and if I mistake not, he said that a mantel-piece of black marble might, in his opinion, if cunningly bought, be procured for some five pounds. If he can get such a thing anywhere about that price, by all means take it. If it cannot be got for <hi rend="italic">six</hi> pounds, on the other hand, we think it would hardly be worth while. Tell our worthy Architect this; and do you and he exercise your best judgment on the matter. As to the width and other dimensions of the thing, our Uncle will just follow the common standard; for the grate to go there is yet to purchase (a sort of polished-bar grate, I expect, with hobs); the grates we have here being destined, the larger one for the drawing-room, and the smaller for the Library. The larger is the one you saw with fire in it; the smaller at present stands upstairs. &#x2026;</p>
<p>This is all I can think of about that House in the Moor, at present; only further, with repetition and re-repetition, will you beg the Architect to look strictly on all hands against my two old enemies, <foreign>Reek</foreign> and Damp! I hope the new kitchen does not smoke: if it do, it must be cured, can man&#x2019;s wit do it. Are they putting up the <hi rend="italic">spout</hi> this winter? I think the sooner the better. And trying, if possible, to regulate that foundation, which must somehow or other be prolonged a few inches deeper into the ground? But enough for once!</p>
<p>What a hubbub and a hurlyburly you must all be in, and poor Mary lying ill of cold! I hope the poor lassie is better, or even well. <hi rend="italic">Salts</hi> are the best recipe; and care against wet feet. She must not get sick over winter in that wilderness.&#x2014; Have you got any new light on the <hi rend="italic">road?</hi> By all means, make every effort: it is indeed an indispensable business.&#x2014; In fine, let us hope that this Craig will repay us all for the trouble we are at with it; and be a sort of covert from the rude weather, let it blow from what point it will! Were we once there and settled! For change, of any sort, totally deranges one: be the place and the state what it may, if the wise man is once there and fixed, he will fit it to him or himself to it; but of this wayfaring work comes no good.</p>
<p>I wish you could have written to me that our Father is recovered: I have my own doubts; and long for some word, which however, so stingy are the Scotsbrig penmen, I have little hope of getting except through you. Write to me the moment you can learn.&#x2014; It was a relief to me to learn that your crop was under thatch: in my ignorance, I was pitying you and Scotsbrig in that spongy weather, which is now, however, as good as gone, I hope.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-275" n="04:275"/>We are glad to hear that R<supplied>[achel]</supplied> saw the Craig, and think it a favourable circumstance. Jane thinks she must be a &#x201C;bit of a flirt (<foreign>coquette</foreign>) that R.&#x201D;; and advises you, as the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> remedy, to stand <hi rend="italic">aloof</hi> rather, and let her <hi rend="italic">be</hi> for a time. I rather believe this a wholesome advice; and worthy of attention, coming from so experienced a source.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander did not marry Rachel.</note> One way or other, I trust, all will be well. So be it!</p>
<p>I have written an immense letter to the Doctor: by this time it is on the German Ocean I suppose; an answer may be back in three weeks or so, not sooner.&#x2014; Not another syllable about London: I saw Jeffrey at large; and he thinks with me that it may stand over for a good while.&#x2014; You will write soon?&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s best regards to you and Mary.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>I will not keep you another day in suspense; being indeed well aware that you have been kept too long so already. To tell you the truth there was a letter as good as ready for you last night, chiefly from the pen of your sister; but by some malarrangement it was not sent; and now I think it may be as well for me to write myself. If <hi rend="italic">she</hi> have leisure, I suppose she will add a postscript.</p>
<p>In the first place, however, thank Sister Mag very particularly, in my name, for her share in concocting that Letter; which really might be called a labour of love between you, to relieve me from a multitude of anxieties. Alick poor fellow had made what inquiries he possibly could at Dumfries, and sent me the result; but little was to be gathered from them; and the state of our Father&#x2019;s health might still have been uncertain to me. Alick thinks, as I do, that it is a &#x201C;black burning shame&#x201D; no one of the Scotsbrig people will undertake to write regularly; but I hope that now, a beginning being made, there will be no falling off, nay indeed that <hi rend="italic">Maister Cairlil</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His brother James.</note> himself will be aroused to a sense of his duty, and join his Sister in so good and brotherly a work.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-276" n="04:276"/>As to thy own little self, we are perfectly of opinion that it is every way adviseable to put an end to <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> about this journey, and now in Heaven&#x2019;s name to get it <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. There is nothing in the world to hinder such a shifty little <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi> to travel twenty times as far; and help herself thro&#x2019; twenty times greater difficulties. Come, then; set about it, and let us see thee here in a few days! Tell my Mother, that I do think, she must not stand in your way; but if she will not come herself at present, no longer hinder you from coming. Nay tell her I have sometimes been of opinion that it might even be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> if you were here some little while before her, and so partly knew Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> when <hi rend="italic">she</hi> arrived in it. At all events there is not a particle of risk, come when you will.&#x2014; I am in considerable haste tonight, being busy with more <hi rend="italic">Reviews</hi>: so attend to me carefully for I must direct you in <hi rend="italic">few</hi> words.</p>
<p>The Carlisle Coach, I find, still comes thro&#x2019; Langholm northwards every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning at the usual hour (I believe, 8 o&#x2019;clock). Now let Jamie take you up with him; and pack you in at Langholm, in the <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> (the fare is 16/); and there with a sufficient <hi rend="italic">piece in the pocket</hi> you may sit, if you like, without ever stirring out, till you are set down in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Or if you like better, you can come out where they breakfast (at Hawick), or at any or every other stage. There will be two drivers most probably; to whom you will give what you see the rest giving (in all probability a shilling each): and farther than this, you have nothing whatever to do that I know off till you arrive in Princes Street, Edinburgh, where I (being duly forewarned) will be found standing in waiting to bring you hither, about half past 4 o&#x2019;clock, where <hi rend="italic">ready-meat</hi> and all needful things will be appointed you. Be sure, however, to let me know in time what day you are coming: if from failing in a seat, or any other cause, you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come on the appointed day, I will look for you by the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> coach. But even without me, you will have no difficulty: the Guard will find you a porter for guide and luggage-carrier, and he will lead you without fail to this very door, if you but recollect No 21. However I myself will take care not to be absent: and do you take care not to disappoint me; for it is two miles off, and I cannot <hi rend="italic">dine</hi> till I see you.</p>
<p>Jane says you already know what clothes to bring: some petticoats, shifts, night-shifts, and the like; what is wanting may be completed here; and as to articles of <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> apparel, you are not to attempt them. This is all that I think you need for your direction; being a shrewd little <hi rend="italic">Craw</hi>, of yourself, and able to pick out your way thro&#x2019; things of <pb id="pg-04-277" n="04:277"/>that kind without help. Tell us what day you are coming then; and come speedily, and safely, and be happy beside us.&#x2014; Poor soul!

<p>Tell my Mother that I am very busy, and as well as usual, or perhaps better. I will write to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> specially, the day after you arrive!

<p><salute>My Dear Johnstone&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>Alison Greave, our worthy maid-servant, is leaving us (in bad health); and so affords me a hurried opportunity of writing you a line, which otherwise were not by any means worth postage.&#x2014; I promised to send you word about that London Professorship; and truly I should have done so, had there been any word to send. There was not, there still is not; except that from the general aspect of the case I augur with considerable certainty that, for me at least, <hi rend="italic">nothing will come of it</hi>. Jeffrey supports me warmly; but Brougham, it would appear, fights shy: delays have intervened; they feel it to be &#x201C;a most important Chair,&#x201D; and are &#x201C;alarmed at my German predilections,&#x201D; and in short know not rightly what to make of me. Last time I saw Jeffrey, they were busy following out some quest of Dugald Stewart&#x2019;s; that is, inquiring after some <hi rend="italic">Frenchman</hi> or other whom Dugald had recommended, and who I suspect must be a certain M. Cousin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Victor Cousin (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">1867</date>), French philosopher.</note> that takes all opportunity of lauding Dugald. They wished to see whether he could speak any English; truly an essential point.&#x2014; But on the whole, for many weeks the thing has died out of our thoughts: and the truth of the matter is and was, if they should appoint me to-morrow, I should not know positively whether to laugh or weep. Meanwhile I am not a Candidate and yet before them; entitled also to <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi>, if I think good and have occasion: on which footing I am content enough that the business should continue to rest. I myself am of opinion that <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> will be done for a good while; and for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, most probably nothing at any time.</p>
<p>I wish we had you here at present: for I am to be idle by to-morrow afternoon, and have a day or two of relaxation; having been busy for several weeks.&#x2014; There is a paper of mine<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;State of German Literature.&#x201D; The <date when="1827-10">October 1827</date> number was not yet published.</note> in the next <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> <pb id="pg-04-279" n="04:279"/><hi rend="italic">Review</hi>, which is all printed, and will be out in a day or two. I propose now to quit the &#x201C;German line&#x201D; for a while, and try something else.</p>
<p>John wrote to you before he went away. Yesterday we had the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> letter from Munich, where the poor Doctor arrived in safety about the <date when="1827-11-01">first of November</date>; and seems wonderstruck and thunderstruck with the novelty of his situation. He had talked one hour with Schlegel, seen the steeple of Frankfort; and, in a word, scarce knew <hi rend="italic">what end of him was uppermost</hi> for very confusion. By degrees the wool-gathering wits will rally round their old flag, and the Doctor write to us in peace and composure.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Carlyle&#x2019;s letter is dated at Munich on <date when="1827-11-03">3 Nov.</date> Dr. Carlyle wrote: &#x201C;In the evening I was with Schlegel for about an hour and was received by him very kindly and politely. Of this interview I must endeavour to give you some account however imperfect. Schlegel lives in an elegant house furnished in some measure after the English mode. He is a littlish man though not very slender squints somewhat with his dark grey eyes, and when he is speaking to you throws his head a little backwards so that he is in some measure looking along his face and pointing his chin to the person hearing him. He wears a wig of brownish hair. He had no neck<supplied>[c]</supplied>loth, wore a black coat silk vest and grey trowsers. From his round and broad snuff-box he is continually taking snuff on the tip of his fore-finger, but he did not make much use of the large mirror on its lid. He speaks English almost quite perfectly, and in a mild and cultivated tone of voice. On mentioning the translation of Meister, he enquired how it had succeeded in England, and asked if its morality had not offended the English taste, praised the &#x2018;exquisite beauty&#x2019; of the style &#x26; composition as a piece of Art, said it had little in it to excite violent emotion. &#x2026;&#x201D; August Wilhelm von Schlegel (<date when="1767">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845">1845</date>).</note></p>

Will you send us word; or shall we not see you soon? O poor life, where sixteen miles divide as effectually as the Atlantic Ocean! Good-night, my old Friend!

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>It is very long since I undertook a Letter to you, on my sole strength; but in the present crisis we are glad to have recourse to <pb id="pg-04-280" n="04:280"/>any expedient; and the truth is, Jane will give me no rest till I write. She is quite melancholy, or at least fast becoming so, that she cannot hear from you; and this the more, because she feels herself to have <hi rend="italic">begun the wrong</hi>, and so must want even the poor solace of complaint. Many a theory we have formed about your silence; but none of them will altogether satisfy us. The worst of them all is that perhaps you are unwell; that something unpleasant has again happened to your good tho&#x2019; wayward Charles; that Mrs Procter may be ill; in short, that for some reason or other, you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> write. I do hope, all this is mere imagination. Another whim, tho&#x2019; but for moments, I have had to controvert in my little theorizing wife: she thinks you are offended ! I know you much better; and so on the whole does she. But the simple English of the whole matter is, that you must begin writing again, as you were wont in your good days, and so put an end to unprofitable conjecture by a certainty which we must always feel to be so pleasant. This is one of my vacation-days; for ever after a spell of writing, which is apt to <hi rend="italic">exasperate</hi> me too much, I take perhaps half a week of entire idleness, read all manner of shallow letter-press, delve in our little patch of a garden, plunge into the Babel of &#x201C;living conversation,&#x201D; or recreate myself otherwise as I please, till the bilious fit has subsided, and I am again a peaceable member of society. On the present occasion I have undertaken a more useful task: in my vanity I have promised to bring a Letter from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> full of new tidings and old feelings: you will not mortify me by denial?</p>
<p>What is become of your ill-guided wanderer? Is he still with Badams, or otherwise permanently settled?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu wrote of Charles in her letter of <date when="1827-11-27">27 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;He is still with Badams, who gives a favorable report of him. He now wishes to go into the Church. If he had determined for medicine, which was most probable, I should have strenuously advised the plan you propose&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">fear</hi>, his present choice, arises more from the prospect it holds out of a life of seclusion and <hi rend="italic">reverie</hi>, than of any strong religious bias.&#x201D;</note> Pity that singing-birds were not as easy to nurse and train as common chicken! They are so infinitely finer when they prosper! This poor Boy has a spirit in him which strives beyond the Common; and alas out of the old stupid highways there is no safe travelling. I wish Charles were five-and-twenty, safe and fixed, and the man he was made to be. Did you never think more of sending him to Edinburgh; or did he never think of coming hither? The opening of the College classes for this winter again puts me in mind of it. Here he might live (in lodgings) at comparatively a trifling expence; fifty pounds, if he is thrifty, will support him even handsomely, including every charge, thro&#x2019; the winter; and <pb id="pg-04-281" n="04:281"/>he may study what he pleases. Without any difficulty I could engage to superintend the whole arrangement, procure him fit teachers, and set him on the right road; and every time he pleased to visit our little cottage, I think he ought, if we forgot not our just debts, to find in it some emblem of a home. I really wish you would consider this: it is still in time, tho&#x2019; now little more than so<supplied>[,]</supplied> two weeks of introductory lecturing being already past. I cannot prophesy; but for a youth of such a character, I might hope that the sentiment of entire freedom would bring his own <hi rend="italic">conscientiousness</hi> into action, and so operate very beneficially. Employ me if you can, and have any charity left for me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu was very grateful. She wrote: &#x201C;And first for you, my dear Thomas Carlyle, though it has not been quite well with me and &#x2018;my right hand hath-forgotten its cunning&#x2019; yet have I not forgotten you, or one tittle of your worth and kindness&#x2014;your worth I was always most sensible of, and valued you to the height of your deservings, your kindness was hidden in the depth of your heart, like the seed of some lovely flower, which waited only for the genial time, to expand and blossom&#x2014;you know not the pleasure your letters have given me&#x2014;you are not the same man&#x2014;a sweet humanity has come over you&#x2014; The arid and parched soil, is clothed with all the softness and beauty of the spring, the golden age with you must be fast approaching for the &#x2018;desart hath already &#x2018;blossomed like the rose&#x2019;&#x2014; For your kind offers to my misguided but most dear Charles, I can only give you my best thanks.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Of your own health I am afraid to inquire. Doctors may manipulate with all gravity, and talk in as clear language as they conveniently can: but in all cases of obdurate affliction, they are little better than a broken reed. Who ever had a chronical disease from which <hi rend="italic">their</hi> help delivered him<supplied>[?]</supplied> And yet if one <hi rend="italic">must</hi> suffer, it is strange with what quietness one learns to do it. Blessed Nature! She is a kind, tho&#x2019; a strict Mother: no one of her children, whose heart is wise, will she leave altogether comfortless. I myself can hope only at rare intervals that ever I shall see another healthy day; and yet I know not that I was ever much happier, not surely, at least, when I felt as if I had a frame of iron, and a heart burning and smouldering with a thousand discontents. My good wife also conducts herself <hi rend="italic">like</hi> a wife, and consents to be happy beside even a sick man whom she loves. Oh what a poor and very paltry race of philosophers are they that speak of women as one hears spoken! <hi rend="italic">They</hi> know not the depths of true love that dwell in those frail and noble beings; and they are punished for it, for they know not what is highest and holiest in mortal existence. Truly they deserve such women as they describe&#x2014;and nothing more.</p>
<p>We are still bent for Craigenputtock against Whitsunday; not indeed irrevocably, but with the main current of our purposing. They <pb id="pg-04-282" n="04:282"/>are plastering and papering there for us; and we do not fear the aspects of so secluded an existence; for it will be a free one, and perhaps easier to lead with propriety than the present. True we shall be solitary, and excluded from preferment: but <hi rend="italic">how</hi> much of society is better than solitude; and what fellowship hath a rational Philosopher with the dray-horses of mammon?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Craigenputtoch Mrs. Montagu wrote: &#x201C;I do not relish the name of your Country habitation<supplied>[.]</supplied> I have a strong notion that the Scottish people give not names in vain&#x2014;and I fear there is something desolate in that name&#x2014;if a <foreign><hi rend="italic">puttock</hi></foreign> is a toad which I almost think it is&#x2014;but your Juliet will say &#x2018;Whats in a name&#x2019; and I a Montagu, will not gainsay this assertion of your fair Capulet&#x2014;still go where you will, you are a happy Man&#x2014;and this will go more than half way to make you a healthy man.&#x201D; Mrs. Montagu was wrong about the name (see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 87): &#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign>Craig</foreign>&#x2019; of the &#x2018;<foreign>Puttock</foreign>,&#x2019;&#x2014;puttock being a sort of <hi rend="italic">Hawk</hi>, both in Galloway Speech, and in Shakespeare&#x2019;s Old English&#x201D; (cf. <hi rend="italic">Cymbeline</hi>, I, i).</note> A<supplied>[s]</supplied> for worldly preferment, it is or ought to be, moreover, among a very secondary class of my aims. The world&#x2019;s business is the sea we sail on; and its prizes are little very pretty glittering bubbles that flit hither and thither among the waves. But should a true sailor steer <hi rend="italic">after</hi> these; or only <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> them, and <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> some Loadstar that is fixed in the eternal sky?</p>
<p>For the rest, I have put the matter on a cast, and left the Presiding <supplied>[G]</supplied>en<supplied>[ius to]</supplied> decide. I have, by intervention, as good as offered myself to come and spend what streng<supplied>[th]</supplied> and life I have in teaching the little particle of Truth committed to me among my &#x201C;benighted brethren&#x201D; in your University. Will your people give me work, I am here; do they refuse me, God&#x2019;s free creation and my own soul are mine, and I will find work elsewhere, and it may be of a better sort. Thus the matter rests, and may rest for many days, or be decided to-morrow: we await the event as Attila Schmelzle&#x2019;s Biographer<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Paul Richter.</note> did, &#x201C;with unspeakable composure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile we like Edinburgh far better than ever we did. You must again and again thank Mr Procter for the kind and truly delightful acquaintance he has given us here in Mr Jeffrey. &#x201C;He has but one fault but that one is a thumper&#x201D;: O that law had never been invented, or that Francis Jeffrey had never been a lawyer! We see him but in glimpses; yet ever with new satisfaction. Truly a rare phenomenon; and among the best of that rather unhappy race, Men of Letters now extant.&#x2014; What do you think too? I am an acquaintance almost a friend of&#x2014;The Opium-Eater&#x2019;s! Poor Dequincey! He is essentially a gentle and genial little soul; only that the Liver is diseased, and the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;I-ety&#x201D;</hi> [egoism] is strong and both together sometimes overset his balance. Poor soul! One of the most perfect <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi> I have ever <pb id="pg-04-283" n="04:283"/>seen; and yet here he is living in <hi rend="italic">lodgings</hi>, with two of his little children (writing for bread in the paltriest of all newspapers) while his wife with other two resides in Westmoreland,&#x2014;as a kind of &#x201C;hostage&#x201D; to his creditors! O, well might the Poet say: <hi rend="italic">The Prison called Life</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> underscored twice]!&#x2014; I declare I could almost have taken the poor soul into my heart, and cried (like a madman as I should have been): come hither thou good soul, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will save thee!&#x2014; To which indeed Dequincey need but have answered: Physician heal thyself!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu replied: &#x201C;I almost commiserate you for the pain you must feel for and with poor DeQuinc<supplied>[e]</supplied>y&#x201D;; and she classifies him with &#x201C;bad specimens of human nature, the rickety children of the species.&#x201D; &#x201C;Physician heal thyself&#x201D; (cf. Luke 4:23).</note>&#x2014; After all, I must be becoming more Catholic in my feelings, I suppose; or perhaps I had always a love for good people, if they would have used me with any consideration. I like John Wilson also: I could almost love him, were not the Devil in him! He is a man of genius, of a noble glowing heart, and a head teeming with the most wild and wondrous products&#x2014;but&#x2014;he has sold himself to the world; and Satan (in the shape of Blackwood) pays him the price monthly; and this other &#x201C;Son of the Morning&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 14:12.</note> is falling or fallen from his azure sphere!&#x2014; Will you not come hither into Scotland and see these marvellous things? At the <hi rend="italic">Craig</hi> we shall and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have you; but there you have only one original, or at most two. <closer><salute>Believe me ever,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dear Alick&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute>&#x2026; During the late frost, I very much regretted that you had not taken this Great-coat down with you. I have very seldom had it on since you were here; it being out of date for street wear: besides at present the tailor is making me a new one. I design shortly, if I have no other opportunity, to send this old servant down by the Carrier. I will direct it to our Uncle John&#x2019;s, probably in some sort of box or gray-paper parcel; and if I can manage adroitly enough, you may have it in this way about to-morrow week. It will serve you many a day as well as a better; and for me, at least in this city, it is well-nigh useless.&#x2014; I have long forgotten to tell you to call at Johnstone the Bookseller&#x2019;s, and order, for my Mother, a certain Religious Magazine (called the &#x201C;Monitor&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Dumfries. The &#x201C;Monitor&#x201D; would be the old <hi rend="italic">Christian Monitor and Religious Register</hi>, which in <date when="1825">1825</date> became the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Theological Magazine</hi>.</note> or some such thing), which you will easily discriminate by this circumstance, that it is published <hi rend="italic">monthly</hi>, and costs one shilling per Number. Jack and I tried to get it here, but could find no way of having it conveyed to Ecclefechan. Will you see after it; and pay <hi rend="italic">six months</hi> of it in advance, and direct him to give it regularly to Nottman?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries-Ecclefechan carrier.</note> I think it may prove serviceable at Scotsbrig, and it costs but little.

<p>Can you tell me precisely when is rent-day? Now, or at Candlemas? For we wish to be particular; standing on so curious a footing as we do. Has Blacklock come for his money yet? If a loan of twenty or thirty pounds, or even of a far larger sum (for we have now money, like Schmelzle and his wife),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz,&#x201D; Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXII, esp. 146&#x2013;47.</note> would be of benefit to you, it can be had without any trouble; so you can let me know. Of course <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will pay this rent; for you will have other outlets for yours among Masons, etc. etc., and this perhaps before I see you.&#x2014; On the whole it is a most comfortable fact for me to find that, sick as I am, and indisposed to insinuate myself anywhere, I can still <hi rend="italic">live</hi>, independent of all persons whatsoever. At the Craig, if we stick together as we have done, we may fairly bid defiance to the Constable. Praised be Heaven! For of all curses, that of being baited for debt, or even <pb id="pg-04-285" n="04:285"/>frightened for falling into it, is surely the bitterest.&#x2014; If you see the last <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> you may read my Article in it, on the &#x201C;State of German Literature,&#x201D; some time when you have opportunity. The people here seem to think abundantly well of it: I am in fact becoming a sort of Literary Man like my neighbours, and the people wonder at me more than enough.

By the blessing of Heaven two good things shall happen: I will get my mind spoken out, and have a trade to follow in this Earth like others! Never fear, my good Alick!

<p>Mrs Graham,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elsewhere Carlyle refers to her as both Janet and Mary.</note> the maker of this hat, is a poor but industrious woman, about five-and-thirty years of age, resident with her husband and daughter, in a cottage belonging to a little farm called Myer, in the parish of Hoddam, Dumfriesshire. Her husband, who is a weaver, is, from the state of his health, unable to work much, so that, for a number of years, the charge of providing for the little household has fallen chiefly on his wife, who, although in poor health herself, has hitherto contrived to perform this task in a highly creditable manner. Her chief resource is the making of straw-hats, chiefly of the wheat-straw kind, for which, by reason of their cheapness, she finds a ready sale during the summer season, all over the neighbourhood.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Up to this point, the letter is based only on the printed text. The rest of the letter is based on both texts, though that in the <hi rend="italic">Sederunt Book</hi> appears to be much more trustworthy.</note> About four years ago she procured a loan of Cobbet<supplied>[t]</supplied>&#x2019;s Cottage Economy from a Farmer of that district, and finding there some instructions about the plaiting of Leghorn Bonnets, she forthwith set about turning it to advantage. By means of Cobbet<supplied>[t]</supplied>&#x2019;s figures &#x26; descriptions she succeeded in discovering the proper sort or rather sorts of Grass in the fields; and then in bleaching, cleaning, and plaiting it as he described. Further trials gave her more insight: In this branch of the business she was soon perfect. The <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi> of the plaited stripes together into a bonnet or other continuous <hi rend="italic">Web</hi> of straw plait cost her more trouble: But this also by unravelling and scrutinising several pieces of real Leghorn she at length accomplished to her own satisfaction. The art of pressing and otherwise smoking<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The printed text gives &#x201C;smoothing,&#x201D; but the following passage from William Cobbett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cottage Economy: A New Edition</hi> (London, <date when="1823">1823</date>), pars. 208&#x2013;36: &#x201C;English Straw Plat,&#x201D; indicates that &#x201C;smoking&#x201D; is the correct word: &#x201C;This clarifying is the easiest thing imaginable. The straw, the plat, or the bonnet, is wetted a little with clean cold water, which is then shaken off from it, leaving it in a wettish state. It is then shut up in a tub, in a box, in a cupboard, or in some place with some brimstone put into a little pan, and set upon the bottom of the box or tub, and set fire to&#x201D; (par. 230).</note> and trimming <pb id="pg-04-287" n="04:287"/>the plait was next learned; and ere long various Leghorns of her manufacture were to be seen in actual wear in that quarter; indeed as many as she could make were willingly bought by the Shopkeepers of Dumfries.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The printed source also gives Mrs. Graham&#x2019;s own account of the process by which she prepared rye-straw which was to be made into bonnets: &#x201C;It was cut when in bloom, and bleached in the following manner:&#x2014; After being cut, it was made up into small parceis. A tub being procured, as many of the parcels were put into it as it could conveniently hold. Boiling water was then poured in, till the whole of the straw was completely covered. When the water had acquired a sufficiently dark colour, the parcels were taken out and spread upon the ground, care being taken to turn them once every day, till the bleaching was completed. When the weather is unfavourable, the bleaching is attended with considerable risk, which I think may be estimated at the rate of about 50 per cent. on the whole. The best plan, I believe, is to secure the parcels of straw in sheds during the night. Straw bleached after this manner, will have a finer colour, and will be completely safe from mildew during the process.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>It is a thousand pities to send a Letter all the way to Munich, of so very insipid a composition as this must needs be; written as it is under the influence of a most decided <foreign><hi rend="italic">catarrh</hi></foreign>, which, tho&#x2019; now on the wane, is not by any means concluded, and for the last three days has kept me in the most interesting state. Even now, I have two shirts on, and a huge uncomfortable <hi rend="italic">comforter</hi>, and my seal-skin cap, and am gargling at intervals with a solution of cream-of-tartar and black-currant jelly. In short, I am an entire <foreign><hi rend="italic">Moluimbo</hi></foreign>:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a reference to a tribe in Africa.</note> &#x201C;I cannot eat,&#x201D; as a sick Englishman says; I cannot even <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>!</p>
<p>Nevertheless a Letter <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be written, that it meet the London foreign Mail on Tuesday; for I have put off far too long already; and unless I take heed, am like to lose all my old praise of regularity as a correspondent. The last Letter itself was too late (by two days or so?); and if you have written again before this arrive, it introduces a <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> [tangle] into our correspondendence, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign>, &#x201C;which has <pb id="pg-04-288" n="04:288"/>increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.&#x201D;&#x2014; Your Munich Epistle had reached London in 9 days; and to our great joy, it arrived here on the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> last. What wonderful things you must have seen by the road; things not to be comprised in one sheet, but in quires of sheets! Be sure you keep a full Notebook; and let us have the thing fresh and complete when you return. Meanwhile, your present <hi rend="italic">whereabout</hi> is the matter that concerns us most; let us know all about your studies and pursuits, and your manner of existence in that strange Eichhal <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schloss</hi></foreign> [Castle], with its marble-headed stoves, and its other exotic appurtenances. The old woman with her <hi rend="italic">portion Thee</hi> [pot of tea] and her <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schlafen Sie ja recht wohl</hi></foreign> [May you sleep very well]! set us all a-laughing, good dame; tho&#x2019; except in the circumstance of its being our own Doctor <hi rend="italic">Tongleg</hi> that was so addressed, there was nothing to laugh at in so charitable a wish. You mention that the journey &#x201C;cost you more than you anticipated.&#x201D; Alas! My good Doctor, our anticipations of foreign cheapness are almost always false. You add in Arabic numerals that you have still a number of hard sovereigns left, which we took at first to be <hi rend="italic">seventeen</hi>, but discovered afterwards to be <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi>; for the writing there seems blotted out as with a <hi rend="italic">tear</hi>. But do not, my good Brother, let thy mighty heart be cast down, for the Mammon of this world! A few more hard sovereigns we are yet, Thank Heaven, in a condition to furnish: write for what is necessary, and it will be sent, if you tell us also how to send it. Above all, do not neglect this same dissection and surgery, for the sake of any poor thrift there might be in the omission of it. Go on and prosper; learn all and everything that is to be learned: and if you come home to us a good well-appointed Man and Physician, we will not think the money ill-bestowed. Nay it is possible enough that you may even at Munich be able to earn so much yourself; at least, if you think of writing anything about <hi rend="italic">foreign medicine</hi> (that is, so soon as you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it), I have little doubt the Frazer Reviewers will readily accept it. But let not this, or any other consideration, divert you from your grand task, which is to learn at Munich whatsoever is specially or only to be learnt there.</p>
<p>But now I reverse the speculum, and bring you from Bayern to your own old Fatherland. We have heard both from Scotsbrig and Craigenputtock not long ago; and all was well or nearly so in both places. Our Father&#x2019;s rheumatism was all but entirely gone a fortnight ago; and I think had any change for the worse taken place they would have written us, for I charged them strictly. Both our <pb id="pg-04-289" n="04:289"/>Mother and he had been at the &#x201C;Michaelmas Market&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The great annual fair at Dumfries.</note> the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> also, including even the potatoes was safely housed; so that the goodman felt much more at ease. The only article of news that Mag sent me was tidings of the death very suddenly of Margaret Kerr, once of Bush, and whom we have often seen as the beauty of Hoddam Kirk, and truly one of the most bright and buxom women anywhere to be looked on. Thus in all provinces of existence are we reminded that man&#x2019;s foundation is on the quicksand, and that the fashion of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> world passeth away.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 7:26; 1 Cor. 7:31.</note> Happily there is another and a diviner one, which does not pass.</p>
<p>Neither our Mother nor Jane, as you will have guessed are yet here. My Mother <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not come, till I go and fetch her, which may not be till after some number of weeks: Jane is ready to come directly; and has written to that effect. We sent back an answer encouraging her to come up forthwith; and requesting that she would appoint the day, when I was to wait for her by the Langholm coach. We still expect her shortly; but since that time she has not written a word. I desired Alick, last Wednesday, to have her expedited if he could. Whether he would get my letter I know not; for perhaps he was not at the market; Dumfries, it would appear, being turned topsyturvy by rejoicing that <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Duke<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Francis Scott, fifth Duke of Buccleuch, seventh Duke of Queensberry (<date when="1806-11-25">25 Nov. 1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884">84</date>). The celebration occurred on Monday because the twenty-fifth fell on Sunday.</note> had come of age, on Monday last; an event which has filled three counties with sky-rockets, and whiskypunch, and every sort of tumult.</p>
<p>Here, at Comley Bank, we are all much as when you left us. Jane&#x2019;s complaint proved rather lingering, and no remedy, it seemed, but Time would avail: however she is now, when she does not walk too much, about as well as ever. As to myself, I do not reckon that I have fallen off in health, but rather improved; for this <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, which must soon be gone, I esteem of little moment; nay perhaps it may prove advantageous, for I have traced a sort of sub-feverishness lurking about me for several weeks, and I have hopes that this has brought it to a crisis and removed it.&#x2014; Pray Heaven, you may have no <foreign>catarrhs</foreign> at Munich! Keep warm wrappages about you; for I am told the climate is very severe.&#x2014; Alison Greave has left us with tears in her eyes, and we have got another handmaid who does very well; very superior indeed to Alison in <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, as far as she is inferior in depth of meditation and intellectual acumen. I should mention also that a most <pb id="pg-04-290" n="04:290"/>superb Leghorn Bonnet has arrived from the Straw-platter of <hi rend="italic">Meyer</hi> (Mary Gray);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle meant Mary Graham of Myer. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271100-TC-ANM-01">TC to ANM, [<date when="1827-11">Nov.</date>]</ref>.</note> and by me, with due introductory narrative, been presented to the Highland Society, where tho&#x2019; it is somewhat against their rules, we are in hopes it may gain a prize. Henry Inglis got it sent for us, thro&#x2019; the medium of some Hebridian Laird, who is his brother-in-law.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Inglis (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886">86</date>), Edinburgh lawyer and business man, was a litterateur who befriended the Carlyles in Edinburgh, and whose verses were published as <hi rend="italic">The Briar of Threave and the Lily of Barholm</hi> (<date when="1885">1885</date>). The Hebridean Laird was Alexander Norman Macleod, of Harris.</note> Poor Goody Graham has far more merit than many an Academician, who has carried off his prize-medal.</p>
<p>The Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review is out some time ago; and the &#x201C;State of German Literature&#x201D; has been received with considerable surprise and approbation by the Universe. Thus for instance, De Quinc<supplied>[e]</supplied>y praises it in his Saturday Post;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Saturday Post</hi>, <date when="1827-11-24">24 Nov.</date>, reviewing the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, No. 72.</note> Sir W. Hamilton tells me that it is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cap&#x2019;tal</hi>&#x201D;; and Wilson<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prof. John Wilson.</note> informs John Gordon that it has &#x201C;done me a <hi rend="italic">deal</hi> o&#x2019; good.&#x201D; May a bountiful Heaven be praised for its mercies! I suppose I shall by and by rise into a pitch of literary glory, which may all but equal me with the Stot<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid, like J. R. McCulloch called &#x201C;The Galloway Stot.&#x201D;</note> himself. In the meanwhile I have written another long paper on <hi rend="italic">Zacharias Werner</hi>, and sent it off the other day to Frazer, who seems very anxious to have it.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Basil Montagu in her letter to the Carlyles of <date when="1827-11-27">27 Nov.</date> wrote: &#x201C;Goethe did not dream of the value of his praises of you, as <hi rend="italic">value</hi> is counted on the Stock Exchange, but the transcript in your Wife&#x2019;s letter, so worked upon the fancy of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Frazer that he never rested till he drew you nearer to him&#x2014;and I trust that this demand for your German Literature will prove as useful to you, as it is valuable to him.&#x201D;</note> He is just returned from (the west of) Germany; and, I suppose, is all agog about their Literature. He had seen Goethe, Tieck, &#x26;c; and engaged <hi rend="italic">Julius</hi> to correspond with him.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle is dated <date when="1827-11-22">22 Nov.</date></note>&#x2014; All this being off my hands, I took a week&#x2019;s recreation, and two days before this catarrhal visitation, had begun to prepare for <hi rend="italic">Tasso</hi>, by reading his Life, Prose Works, &#x26;c &#x26;c. I hope to say something sensible about Tasso, if I have nothing of that sort to say, it will be better altogether to hold my peace. So much for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Literature, which is almost all I know of British Literature in general since you left us. To descend even lower, I may tell you that Patterson<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John B. Patterson. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270604-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1827-06-04">4 June</date></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">has</hi> got the College Prize, and his Essay is to be printed, <pb id="pg-04-291" n="04:291"/>and has been read with unexampled flourishing of drums and trumpets in Dr Hope&#x2019;s<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Hope, professor of chemistry at Edinburgh University, <date when="1795">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844">1844</date>. He had enormous classes, with more than five hundred students, and established by bequest an annual prize of &#xa3;50.</note> class-room. Henry Inglis reckons it rather bad; but all other men call it &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">splendid</hi>,&#x201D; or &#x201C;most eloquent,&#x201D; or &#x201C;magnificent,&#x201D; or &#x201C;admirable.&#x201D; Happily I have not been <foreign><hi rend="italic">trysted</hi></foreign> [afflicted] with <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much talk on the subject; and so wait without prepossession to see it in print. <hi rend="italic">Rate</hi> was here the other night, and even he spoke with moderation of it, concluding his eulogies in a single sentence, or two at most. The pious &#xc6;neas<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Eneas Rate, see also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240101-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1824-01-01">1 Jan. 1824</date></ref>. &#x201C;Pius&#x201D; is Vergil&#x2019;s stock epithet for Aeneas.</note> is hardly so bilious as he was last year; seems somewhat more argumentative; and talks as incessantly as ever about <hi rend="italic">Chraist</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Glory of God</hi>.&#x2014; A much stranger visiter was here last Wednesday-night: Thomas De Quinc<supplied>[e]</supplied>y the Opium-eater in person with his two children, and sat till midnight! The week before I half accidentally met him one night at Gordon&#x2019;s: he grew pale as ashes at my entrance; but we soon recovered him again; and kept him in flowing talk to a late hour. He is one of the smallest men you ever in your life beheld; but with a most gentle and sensible face, only that the teeth are destroyed by opium, and the little bit of an under-lip projects like a shelf.

Poor little fellow! It might soften a very hard heart to see him so courteous, yet so weak and poor; retiring <hi rend="italic">home</hi> with his two children to a miserable lodging-house, and writing all day for the King of Donkies, the Proprietor of the Saturday Post.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Crichton was the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Post</hi>, but the name of the proprietor has not been discovered.</note> I lent him Jean Paul&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> which I got lately from Hamburg, and advised him to translate it for Blackwood, that so he might raise a few pounds and &#x201C;fence off&#x201D; the Genius of Hunger yet a little while.

The Scottish Court of Session is divided into two houses.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>My Mother is arrived here on a short visit to us, and feels extremely anxious, among other purposes, to see her old Friend, your Aunt, Mrs Hope, whom she parted with in Ecclefechan many years ago with very little expectation of ever meeting her again. I think, you once told me the old Lady lived somewhere in the outskirts of this city: if so, it will not be impossible to bring about this interview, in which I myself feel somewhat interested; having still a vivid enough recollection of that disastrous gig-expedition, which I executed under your auspices on the Moffat Road. Will you be so good as send us a note of Mrs Hope&#x2019;s address, and let us try if we can find her? The sooner the better, for my Mother&#x2019;s time is limited.</p>
<p>I daresay you come often to Edinburgh: how is it that you never find your way to Comley Bank? Come hither, and I will show you my little cottage, and introduce you to my little wife, who will receive you with all graciousness as her husband&#x2019;s Friend. Come down, the very first time you visit Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>! There is a spare bed here, and many a reminiscence of <foreign><hi rend="italic">auld lang-syne</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>I am grown quite a stranger in Glasgow of late years; now that Grahame and Irving and all have left it: yet the memory of that hospitable jolly <hi rend="italic">well-living</hi> city still dwells with me fresh as ever; and hopes that a time is coming when I may behold it again. Meanwhile my true prayer is, in the words of your civic emblazonry: Let Glasgow flourish! and you and all the honest hearts that have your being in it!</p>
<p>My Mother brings no tidings from Grahame, except that he is still at Burnswark, irrigating meadows, salting bog-hay, and striving by agricultural philosophy to make the &#x201C;desart blossom as the rose.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 35:1.</note> I heard that he had hopes of returning to your City, and resuming traffic. I pray that it may be so; for it is a thousand pities so good and gifted a man, were not working in his proper sphere, where alone he can be happy and wholesomely active.</p>
<p>I have heard several times from the Caledonian Orator<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving. His new National Scotch Church, in Regent Square, had been opened in <date when="1827-05">May</date>; and increasingly, under the influence of Henry Drummond, he was turning to the subject of prophecy in the belief (as Mrs. Oliphant summarizes it, <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, I, 397) &#x201C;that the Lord was coming visibly to confound his enemies and vindicate his people!&#x201D; His second child, Mary, died this month.</note> of late. <pb id="pg-04-296" n="04:296"/>He does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> seem in the least millenniary in his letters: but the same old friendly man we have long known him to be. And yet his printed works are enough to strike one blank with amazement: for if the mille<supplied>[n]</supplied>nium is to come upon us in twenty years and odd months, ought we not to be turning a new leaf? Ought not you to shut up your Ledgers, and I my Note-books, and both of us to sit on the outlook, like Preventive-service men, spying and scenting, with eye and nostril, whether there be aught of it in the wind? Alas! Alas! The madness of man findeth no termination, but only new shapes, the old spirit being still the same. To the last, there is and will be a bee in his bonnet,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> slang, but listed by the <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> as first used by Douglas in <hi rend="italic">Eneados</hi> (<date when="1513">1513</date>), VIII, Prol. 120: &#x201C;Of what <foreign>bern</foreign> be thou in bed with <foreign>heid</foreign> full of <foreign>beis</foreign> <supplied>[?]</supplied>&#x201D; It is also in Udall&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Roister Doister</hi> (<date when="1553">1553</date>).</note> which only in every new generation buzzes with a new note!</p>
<p>I am scribbling here with considerable diligence, and not without satisfaction, tho&#x2019; still in very poor health. In the course of years I hope to grow better; but now, such is the extent of my philosophy, I think I can partly do whether ever I get better or not. My Brother John, the Doctor, is away to Germany; dissecting <hi rend="italic">subjects</hi> I suppose, at this very date, in Munich the Capital of Bavaria. He writes to us full of wonder at the marvels of that strange land. Mrs C. and I have some thoughts of going thither next winter ourselves!</p>
<p>But why should I darken counsel by words without wisdom?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 38:2.</note> Send us that address of Mrs Hope, as soon as possible; come over to Comely<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle spells the word both ways in this letter.</note> Bank the first day or night you are in Town, and believe me ever,</p>

<salute>My Dear Father,</salute>
<p>My Mother will not let me rest any longer till I write to you: she says, it was promised that a Letter should go off the very night Jane <pb id="pg-04-297" n="04:297"/>and she arrived; and nevertheless it is a melancholy fact that above two weeks have elapsed since that event, and no better tidings been sent you than a word or two in the blank line of &#x201C;The Courier.&#x201D; I would have written sooner, had I been in right case; or indeed had there been anything more to communicate than what so brief an announcement might convey as well as a much larger one.</p>
<p>The two wayfarers did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> find me waiting for them at the Coach, that Wednesday evening: unhappily it was quite out of my power to keep that or any other appointment; I had been seized about a week before with a most virulent sore-throat, which not only detained me close prisoner in the house, but incapacitated me from speaking (except in a pitiful humming snivelling tone of voice), and for three days, even from <hi rend="italic">swallowing</hi>. The suppuration (<foreign><hi rend="italic">bealing</hi></foreign>)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Swelling, formation of pus.</note> finally gave way, that very night they came. All that I could do, in these circumstances, was to send out a trusty substitute, a Mr Gordon who kindly undertook the office: but he, mistaking one Coach for another, went and waited at the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> inn; so that our beloved Pilgrims were left to their own resources, and had to pilot their way hither under the guidance of the Porter who carried their box. This, however, they accomplished without difficulty, or accident; and rejoiced us all by their safe and, in part at least, unexpected arrival.</p>
<p>Since then, all things have gone on prosperously: my sore-throat has been slowly amending; so that tho&#x2019; still rather weak, I can now venture out (well wrapped up) at any hour, and am in all points about as well as when the thing began. Jane has been busy and is still so, getting ready suitable apparel of bonnets and frocks: my Mother has heard Andrew Thomson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210309-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1821-03-09">9 March 1821</date></ref>.</note> (not much to her satisfaction in his &#x201C;<foreign>braw kirk</foreign>,&#x201D; since he &#x201C;had to light <hi rend="italic">four</hi> candles before ever he could strike&#x201D;); she has also seen old Mrs Hope, the Castle of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, the Martyrs&#x2019; Graves,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These were in Greyfriars churchyard. In <date when="1638">1638</date> the National Covenant was first signed at Greyfriars, and in <date when="1679">1679</date> about 1200 captured Covenanters were kept imprisoned in the open churchyard for about five months. Of these, 257 were sold as slaves, some died or escaped, and the remainder undertook never to take up arms against the government. The Martyrs&#x2019; Monument was erected in the northeast corner usually reserved for criminals. There is a long verse inscription, and also one in prose, recording the deaths of the Marquis of Argyle and James Renwick, of the unnamed 18,000 &#x201C;murdered and destroyed for the same cause,&#x201D; and finally of &#x201C;about a hundred of noblemen and gentlemen, ministers and others&#x201D; who had been &#x201C;executed at Edinburgh.&#x201D;</note> John Knox&#x2019;s house, and who knows how many other wonders; of which, I doubt not, she will give you a true and <pb id="pg-04-298" n="04:298"/>full description when she returns. As yet however the half has not been seen: the weather has been so stormy that travelling out was difficult; and I have been in no high condition for officiating as Guide. In stormy days, she <hi rend="italic">smokes</hi> along with me, or sews wearing raiment, or reads the wonderful <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> of my writing in the Edinburgh Review. She has also had a glimpse of Francis Jeffrey the great Critic and Advocate; and a shake of the hand from a true German Doctor!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Very probably Dr. F. W. Becker. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271025-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1827-10-25">25 Oct.</date></ref>; and Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 38.</note></p>
<p>Nevertheless she is extremely anxious about getting home; and indeed fails no day to tell us several times that she ought to be off. &#x201C;She is doing nothing,&#x201D; she says; and &#x201C;they&#x2019;ll a&#x2019; be in a <foreign>hubble</foreign> [bustle] of work&#x201D; at home. I tell her that she was never idle for two weeks in her life before, and ought therefore to give it a fair trial; that the &#x201C;hubble&#x201D; at home will all go on rightly enough in her absence; that in short she should not go <hi rend="italic">this</hi> year, but the next. So I am in hopes that we shall get her persuaded to stay where she is till after new-year&#x2019;s-day, which is now only nine or ten days distant, and then we will let her go in peace. The two Janes and she are all out in the Town at present buying muslin for sundry necessary articles of dress, which we have persuaded the Mother to undertake the wearing of: these may keep her, I hope, in some sort of occupation; for idle, I see, she cannot and will not be. We will warn you duly when you <supplied>[are]</supplied> to expect her.</p>
<p>Of news or speculations here, excepting these things, we are <supplied>[ver]</supplied>y nearly barren. I have not yet got my work resumed, but I am coming on towards that point. Meanwhile there has been a fresh enterprize started for me: no less than the attempt to be successor to Dr Chalmers in the St Andrews University! He, Chalmers, is at present Professor of Moral Philosophy there, but is just about removing to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, to be Professor of Divinity: and I have been consulting with my Friends (Jeffrey and others)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Among the others was the Rev. John Martin, of Kirkcaldy, Edward Irving&#x2019;s father-in-law, who had attended St. Andrews as a student. In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1827-12-18">18 Dec.</date>, written, he says, in answer to Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to him of <date when="1827-12-15">15 Dec.</date>, which seems to be lost, he gives Carlyle only moderate encouragement and also says that another of Edward Irving&#x2019;s children had died.</note> whether it would be prudent in me to offer myself as a Candidate for the vacant office. They all seem to think (sincerely) that if the Election proceeded on fair principles, I might have a chance of rather a good sort: but this proviso is only a doubtful one, the custom having long been to decide such things there by very <hi rend="italic">un</hi>fair principles. As yet nothing is determined, but my Patrons are making inquiry to see how the land lies; and sometime <pb id="pg-04-299" n="04:299"/>next week we shall know what to do. Most part are inclined to think that I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to try. At all events, if I do try, it will be several months before anything decisive is known.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>After so long an absence, I am happy to present myself again to you, tho&#x2019; on a matter of mere business.</p>
<p>There is some talk here of publishing my <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> a second time, and in a more cheap and popular form. As an indispensable preliminary it becomes necessary to inquire whether <hi rend="italic">your</hi> interest in the little Book has expired; whether the first Edition is all off your hands; and if so, whether a second would be of any value to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I might now enlarge and improve it, in some minute points, by means of my readier communication with Germany.</p>
<p>May I request you to give me information on these matters by your earliest convenience? It will be interesting to me as a mere piece of news; for I begin to have some touch of sympathy for that unhappy first-born of my brain, which certainly I left in a most ostrichlike fashion; never having heard one syllable good bad or indifferent respecting it, except once or twice that <hi rend="italic">here</hi> it was out of print, at least not to be had in any bookshop, many months ago.</p>
<p>I have been living for a year and a half here in the outskirts <supplied>[of]</supplied> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;wedded and what not&#x2014;happy enough in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> respects, save only th<supplied>[at]</supplied> like Juan&#x2019;s Father I &#x201C;was born bilious.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Don Jos&#xE9;, the father of Byron&#x2019;s Don Juan (Canto I, st. 35): &#x201C;As Numa&#x2019;s (who was also named Pompilius), / He had been ill brought up, and was born bilious.&#x201D;</note> Mr De Quincey is here also; a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> what may seem still stranger, he and I, the Reviewer and the Reviewed, ar<supplied>[e]</supplied> very good friends! Do not such instances of magnanimity ennoble the history of Letters? Your Opiumeater is in truth a most interesting man and must awaken a respectful sympathy go where he may.</p>
<p>Expecting soon to hear from you; and heartily wishing you in the meanwhile all happiness, both of &#x201C;New-years&#x201D; and other desirable things, I remain,</p>

<salute>Respected Sir,</salute>
<p>In addition to the valued marks of your regard already conferred on me, I have now to solicit a favour of a more practical, and as I may justly fear, of a more questionable nature. If the liberty I take is too great, let me hope that I shall find in your goodness an excuse.</p>
<p>I am at present a Candidate for the Professorship of Moral Philosophy in our ancient Scottish University of St. Andrews; a situation of considerable emolument and respectability, in which certain of my friends flatter me that I might be useful to myself and others. The Electors to the office are the Principal and actual Professors of the College; who promise in this instance, contrary indeed to their too frequent practice, to be guided solely by grounds of a public sort; preferring that applicant who shall, by reference perhaps to his previous literary performances, or by Testimonials from men of established note, approve himself the ablest. The qualifications required, or at least expected, are not so much any profound scientific acquaintance with Philosophy properly so called, as a general character for intelligence, integrity, and literary attainment; all proofs of talent and spiritual worth of any kind being more or less available. To the Electors personally I am altogether a stranger.</p>
<p>Of my fitness for this or any other office it is indeed little that I can expect you to know. Nevertheless, if you have traced in me any sense for what is True and Good, and any symptom however faint that I may realize in my own literary life some fraction of what I love and reverence in that of my Instructors, you will not hesitate to say so; and a word from you may go farther than many words from another. There is also a second reason why I ask this favour of you: the wish to feel myself connected by still more and still kinder ties with a man, to whom I must reckon it among the pleasures of my existence that I stand in any relation whatever. For the rest, let me assure you that good or ill success in this canvass is little likely to affect my equanimity unduly: I have studied and lived to little purpose, if I have not, at the age of two-and-thirty, learned in some degree &#x201C;to seek for that consistency and sequence within myself, which external <pb id="pg-04-302" n="04:302"/>events will for ever refuse me.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although the passage suggests Epictetus and the Stoicism of the <hi rend="italic">Encheiridion</hi>, which Carlyle had read, it appears to express a general idea rather than to be a verbatim quotation. It could, however, be an exact quotation from another source, possibly Goethe himself.</note> I need only add, on this subject, that the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of such a document as I solicit is altogether unimportant; that of a general Certificate or Testimonial, not specially addressed at all, being as common as any other.</p>
<p>The main purpose of my Letter is thus accomplished: but I cannot conclude without expressing my satisfaction at the good news we continue to hear from Weimar, and the interest which all of us feel in your present so important avocations. By returning Travellers, and Friends resident in Germany, we often get some tidings of you. A younger Brother of mine, at present studying Medicine and Philosophy in M&#xfc;nchen, has the honour of an acquaintance with your Correspondent, Dr Sulpiz Boisser&#xE9;e;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1827-12-29">29 Dec. 1827</date>, Dr. John A. Carlyle identifies Dr. Boisser&#xE9;e as &#x201C;formerly proprietor (or joint prop<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) of the celebrated picture Gallery at Stuttgart which he has sold to the King of Bavaria and which he is now here to arrange in order.&#x201D; He showed Dr. Carlyle several letters from Goethe and permitted him to copy out a long extract from two of them, which he sent to his brother. In the letters to Boisser&#xE9;e, Goethe praised Carlyle highly, saying that his translations were one of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Merkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi></foreign> [marvelous things] that had occurred at Weimar.</note> thro&#x2019; whose means I have just learned that you proceed with unabated diligence in the correction of your Works; and what especially contents me, that we are soon to expect some farther improvement, perhaps enlargement, of the <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi>; and at all events, a Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>. In the <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi>, so choice a piece of composition does it seem to me, I confess I see not well what improvements are to be made: so beautiful, so soft, and gracefully expressive an embodyment of all that is finest in the Philosophy of Art and Life has almost assumed the aspect of perfection in my thoughts; every word has meaning to me; there are sentences which I could write in letters of gold. Enlargement, indeed, I could desire without limit: and yet the work, as it stands, has the singular character of a <hi rend="italic">completed fragment</hi>; so lightly yet so cunningly is it joined together; and then the concluding Chapter, with its <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bleibe nicht am Boden heften</hi></foreign> [do not stay clinging to the ground],<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Translated by Carlyle: &#x201C;Keep not standing fix&#x2019;d and rooted&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi>, XXIV, 416).</note> as it were scatters us all into infinite Space; and leaves the Work lying like some fair landscape of an unknown wondrous region, bounded on this side with bright clouds, or melting on that into the vacant azure! May I ask if there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> any hope that these clouds will <pb id="pg-04-303" n="04:303"/>roll away, and show us the undiscovered country that lies beneath them? Of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> I am taught to expect with confidence not only a continuation but a completion; and share in the general curiosity of Europe to see what it is.</p>
<p>Will you pardon me for speaking so freely of what I know so slightly: I may well feel an interest in your labours such as few do. My Wife unites with me, as in all honest things, so in this, in warmest regards to you and yours. Nay your Ottilie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of Goethe&#x2019;s only surviving son, August.</note> is not unknown to her: with the sharp sight of female criticism she had already detected a lady&#x2019;s hand in the tasteful arrangement of that Packet, not yet understanding to whom it might be due. Will Ottilie von Goethe accept the friendly and respectful compliments of Jane Welsh Carlyle, who hopes one day to know her better? For it is among our settled wishes, I might almost say projects, sometime to see Germany, and its Art and Artists, and the Man who more than any other has made it dear and honourable to us. We even paint out to ourselves the too hollow daydream of spending next winter, or if this Election prosper, the summer which will follow it, in Weimar! Alas that Space cannot be contracted, nor Time lengthened out; and so many must not meet whose meeting could have been desired! Meanwhile we will continue hoping; and pray that, seen or unseen, all good may ever abide with you. <closer><salute>Trusting soon to have the honour of a Letter, I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have long felt that I owed you a letter of the kindest thanks: yet now I am not intending to repay you, but rather to increase my debt by a new request of favours. The case is this: I am, since yesterday, a Candidate for the Moral Philosophy Professorship in the University of St Andrews, soon to be vacated by the transference of <pb id="pg-04-304" n="04:304"/>Dr Chalmers to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and thus my task for the present is to dun all such of my friends as have a literary reputation for Testimonials in my behalf. Considerable support in this way I can promise myself, and except in this way I have no hope of any; being altogether unconnected, as you know, either with Church or State, and at all events unfit for the dark ways of political intrigue, which too often, I am sorry to own, lead safeliest and soonest to such a goal as I am now aiming at. However, the St Andrews Professors, the Electors to this office, boast much that they have amended their ways; and under terror of the late Royal Commission, who knows but the Melville interest<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Dundas, first Viscount Melville (<date when="1742">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811">1811</date>), politician and friend of Pitt the Younger, had been Chancellor of St. Andrews University; and so was his son, Robert Saunders Dundas, second Viscount (<date when="1771">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), politician, who held the appointment from <date when="1814">1814</date> to <date when="1851">1851</date>. Both were politically very powerful in Scotland. The Royal Commission of <date when="1826">1826</date> had made an enquiry into the methods and organization of the Scottish Universities.</note> <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have ceased to be omnipotent there. In this case I have some hope, in any other case little; but in all cases happily no great degree of fear. Meanwhile the business is to try, and try with my whole might, since I have entered on the enterprize. Your friend Mr Jeffrey is my <hi rend="italic">Palinurus</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pilot in the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>.</note> and forwards me with great heartiness: I may also reckon on the warm support of Wilson, Leslie, Brewster and other men of mark in this city; and now I am writing to London for yours and Mr Montagu&#x2019;s. If you and he, or you yourself can with freedom speak any word in my favour, I cannot doubt that you will do it readily.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will tell me that you have no special judgement in matters philosophic; and think within yourself that any skill <hi rend="italic">I</hi> may have possessed in this province must have been kept with extreme secrecy, during our acquaintance, in the recesses of my own consciousness. It were now too late to prove the error of these opinions, especially <hi rend="italic">the latter</hi>: but I may observe in refutation that it is not skill in Philosophy alone, but general talent, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sorts of literary gifts that come into play here; in which case, who is better entitled to speak than &#x201C;Barry Cornwall,&#x201D; if so be his conscience will let him?</p>
<p>The Editor of Bacon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Basil Montagu, who produced an edition of Bacon (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837">37</date>). Mrs. Montagu says in her letter to Jane (PM: <date when="1828-01-31">31 Jan.</date>) accompanying her husband&#x2019;s testimonial letter for Carlyle: &#x201C;Any one might have said with truth twenty times more&#x2014;but the very cold cautious temperament of the North, would have been startled and suspicious if there had been any thing like enthusiasm&#x2014; In Paris, or in Germany or in London, his praises would have been loudly re-echoed&#x2014;but in Scotland&#x2014;well&#x2014;I will not always bear <supplied>[hearing expressions of]</supplied> malice for Ferguson, &#x26; for Burns, for Home, and for many of her best Sons&#x2014; She is a stern matter of fact stingy Mother, sensible wise &#x26; prudent but she does not know a Genius when she sees him, and does not care for him, when others point him out&#x2014; Our friend shall read them a new lesson.&#x201D;</note> will be another name of weight in a professorial <pb id="pg-04-305" n="04:305"/>election: may I count on your laying this matter before him, and Mrs Montagu&#x2019;s friendly intervention in inciting him to act? I would have written to him in particular: but why, thought I, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> letters on one subject, and to one house? The rather, that I am busy to a degree; for tho&#x2019; the business may not be settled for many months, it is judged important by my friends that I should produce my documents without delay. Shall I hope then to ornament my little list with two other names? To see you, an English Poet, beside a Scottish one and a German, for Goethe also is written to? I believe, I shall. For the rest, I need give you no directions as to the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of your Testimonial; this being altogether arbitrary, equally effectual were it a Letter to me, or a Letter to the Principal and Professors of St Andrews, or a general <hi rend="italic">Testamur</hi> directed to all men at large. Edward Irving moreover knows the whole matter, and can explain it all if you have any difficulty, which however you will not have. And now enough of this poor business! Only do not think me a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sorner</hi></foreign> [one who intrudes or sponges] on your friendliness, and I will say no more about the matter. Speak for me also to Mr Montagu, and explain to him why I have not spoken for myself. Do I not hereby give you a full <hi rend="italic">power-of-attorney</hi>; and for which you are to be paid&#x2014;&#x2014;in windmoney, on the other side of the Border!</p>
<p>What do I not owe you already for one of the kindest and most pleasant friends I ever had! Francis Jeffrey is a man meant by Nature to be an intellectual Ariel, with a light etherealness of spirit which the weight of whole Courts of Session resting on it for quarter-centuries has not been able utterly to suppress. There is a glance in the eyes of the man, which almost prompts you to take him in your arms. Alas! that Mammon should be able to hire such servants, even tho&#x2019; they continue to despise him!</p>
<p>And where are you, my Friend? What is become of your sevenstringed shell that once gave such notes of melody? Do you not reckon it a sin and a shame to bury that fine sense, that truly Artist-spirit, under a load of week-day business? Ought not your light to shine before men, in this season of d<supplied>[im]</supplied> eclipse, when the opaque genius of Utility is shedding disastrous twilig<supplied>[ht over]</supplied> half the nations?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 5:16; and <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, I, 597&#x2013;98.</note> I swear that I will never forgive you, if you keep sile<supplied>[nce]</supplied> long. My <pb id="pg-04-306" n="04:306"/>only ground of patience is that you are <foreign><hi rend="italic">lente festinans</hi></foreign> [hastening slowly];<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240125-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1824-01-25">25 Jan. 1824</date></ref>.</note> fusing richer ores in the hidden furnace, that they may be cast in fairer moulds of purer metal, and become Shapes that will endure forever. Positively this is no idle talk, but the true wish and feeling of my heart, growing clearer to me and clearer the longer I know you. Remember my warning: it is your better Genius that speaks thro&#x2019; me.</p>
<p>Do you ever see Mr Fraser,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.</note> and why lingers his <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>? The other day I met a little man, whose eyes sparkled with fire in speaking of it, and he wished to enlist me into his own corps on the other side. I answered that like Dugald Dalgetty<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Soldier of fortune in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Legend of Montrose</hi>. He was courageous and not untrustworthy, if well paid.</note> I had taken bounty under the opposite flag, and so as a true <hi rend="italic">Soldado</hi> could not leave my colours; under which however I reckoned myself bound to fight not him, or Gillies, or Cochrane,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John George Cochrane (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852">1852</date>), editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833">33</date>. R. P. Gillies had also been connected with this journal. See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240302-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1824-03-02">2 March 1824</date></ref>.</note> but the Devil (of Stupidity), and the Devil only. Seeing matters take this turn, the little man&#x2019;s eye grew soft, and he left me.</p>
<p>What is this periodical of Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s, and have you seen that wondrous Life of Byron?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt was severely criticized by the British public in general for his unfavorable treatment of Byron in <hi rend="italic">Lord Byron and Some of His Contemporaries</hi> (<date when="1828">1828</date>). The periodical referred to here was probably <hi rend="italic">The Companion</hi> (<date when="1828-01-09">9 Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-07-23">23 July 1828</date>).</note> Was it not a thousand pities Hunt had borrowed money of the man he was to disinhume and behead in the course of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> afterwards? But for love or money I cannot see Hunt&#x2019;s Book; or anything but extracts of it, and so must hold my tongue. Poor Hunt! He has a strain of music in him too, but poverty and vanity have smote too rudely over the strings.&#x2014; Today too I saw Dequincey: alas poor Yorick!</p>
<p>But enough of gossip also, in which I delight more than I can own in writing! My Wife sends her kind regards to you, and I believe would prize two stanzas of your making at no ordinary rate. Is Mrs Procter well and <hi rend="italic">safe</hi>? Alas! It was for all the world such a night when I sat with you in Russel-street till the ghost-hour, and forgot that Time had shoes of felt. These times and places are all&#x2014;&#x2014;away.&#x2014; Will Mrs Montagu accept my thanks, at this late date, for her so kind and graceful letter. Jane would have written, but was making silk-pelisses and cloth-pelisses, and had semstresses white and black, <pb id="pg-04-307" n="04:307"/>and only three days ago obtained entire dominion over Frost, and marched the needlewomen <hi rend="italic">out</hi>.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu!</foreign> I am ever yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Being aware that you are sometimes in the habit of buying up <hi rend="italic">remainders of editions</hi>, I thought the following circumstance might be worthy of your notice; and <hi rend="italic">called</hi> yesterday to tell you of it.</p>
<p>I have just learned that the remaining copies of my <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> (amounting to several hundred) may be procured, in all probability, on what would be called easy terms. Taylor, the Publisher, of whom for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time I was inquiring its fate, seems tired of it: he is &#x201C;going into another branch of business,&#x201D; and the Book has done him harm rather than good.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Taylor had proposed a drastic reduction in the price in his letter of <date when="1828-01-14">14 Jan.</date> There were still 650 copies, he had said, in his warehouse. He continued, however, as a publisher, chiefly of educational books.</note></p>
<p>Nevertheless it is in itself no very bad, nor even unsaleable sort of Book. The truth is, it was <hi rend="italic">never</hi> advertised <hi rend="italic">at all</hi> (except perhaps twice in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, and as often in some printed <hi rend="italic">catalogue</hi>), never reviewed, even in the <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi>, never <hi rend="italic">shown</hi>, in short, either to friend or foe; but left lying in its <hi rend="italic">nameless</hi> simplicity in the Waterloo Place warehouses, to get out as it could! There, I suppose, it may lie till the &#x201C;wakeful trump of Doom&#x201D; disturb it.</p>
<p>Now the other morning Dr Irving<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Irving of the Advocates&#x2019; Library.</note> shows me the last vol. of <hi rend="italic">Constable&#x2019;s Miscellany</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Constable&#x2019;s Miscellany of Original and Selected Publications in the Various Departments of Literature, Science, &#x26; the Arts</hi> was a series of inexpensive books published from <date when="1826">1826</date> to <date when="1835">1835</date>. Carlyle refers here to vol. XVIII, Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Thirty Years&#x2019; War</hi>, I (<date when="1828">1828</date>). The translator, George Moir, quotes in his preface (p. xxxiv) from Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;admirable Life of Schiller&#x201D; and describes it as &#x201C;a work to which we have been largely indebted, and in our opinion, the ablest piece of biographical criticism which this century has produced.&#x201D;</note> and a most magnificent passage in the Preface about this very Book. Be so good as look at that before we go farther.</p>
<p>My own impression distinctly is that were a few pounds spent in spreading such an advertisement, and some twenty or thirty copies of the work given away to all manner of Editors, and ready-writers, <pb id="pg-04-308" n="04:308"/>the Edition might be sold at the <hi rend="italic">original</hi> price, and rapidly sold at a somewhat lower one.</p>
<p>I speak as a literary father; having happily no other interest in the Book, except fatherly pity for it. Would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> undertake to stand staunchly by me, I declare I should be tempted to buy these copies at my own expence, and risk the adventure myself! Tell me w<supplied>[hat yo]</supplied>u think of all this, and whether anything <supplied>[can be]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. For the rest, I need not request you <hi rend="italic">to be altogether secret</hi>.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I wrote yesterday on the Newspaper that you should have a letter &#x201C;in a day&#x201D;; and now with the first leisure of morning, breakfast and other <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> being over, I set about fulfilling my promise. It is the more necessary this week for me to be punctual, as no farther <hi rend="italic">newspaper</hi> for the present can come from me; the Dumfries Courier being henceforth discontinued, and no successor to it yet provided. Gordon has just found to his cost that M&#x2019;Diarmid charges him <hi rend="italic">in full</hi> for that poor rag of a sheet, certainly among the worst published in our generation; and as we think 7&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d far</hi> too high a price for the article, notice has been sent off, that it is not to come. It is chiefly for your sake and mine that I regret this alteration; for doubtless it was pleasant to us both that such a quiet messenger should pass weekly between us: but I will just <hi rend="italic">write</hi> more diligently; and if no new Paper offer itself for the same purpose, endeavour to make good the deficiency. Fear not, my dear Mother, that you shall ever want news of me, while my right hand has not forgot its cunning!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps. 137:5.</note> Besides Jane is fast becoming a tolerable writer, and will be able in time to divide the pleasant task with me, when I chance to be busy.</p>
<p>You will easily conceive with what satisfaction we received your letter on the appointed morning. Thank sister Mag in the name of us all for that prompt and truly charitable service; and say, in the <pb id="pg-04-309" n="04:309"/>old fashion, that on a fit occasion &#x201C;we will do as much for her.&#x201D; The Letter was clearly written in haste, and with a pen far from the best: but had it been composed by an Oxford Doctor and transcribed by Butterworth &#x26; Sons,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butterworth &#x26; Son brought out the <hi rend="italic">Durable Copy Book</hi> (London, <date when="1819">1819</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Elegant Extracts for Butterworth and Son&#x2019;s New Universal Penman</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1809">1809</date>).</note> it could have been no better to us. Encourage and exhort, and if need be command her to do the like in future, often and habitually. Many an anxious speculation did we send after our pilgrim-Mother, during her abode at Hawick, while the East wind was blowing with so <foreign><hi rend="italic">snell</hi></foreign> [piercing, biting] a breath, and a storm evidently <hi rend="italic">masking</hi> [threatening] in the atmosphere. More especially when it actually burst forth, that very morning you were bound to travel in! Let us all be thankful that the Expedition has terminated peaceably, without broken hearts or bones, and you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> seen us in our Edinburgh cottage, and can hope to see us still again and again and again, in other cottages or mansions, the welcomest of visiters, as you ought to be, wheresoever the kind sun shines on us.</p>
<p>I mentioned that Jack&#x2019;s letter had arrived. It was dated the day before new-years-day, and brought good tidings of the Doctor&#x2019;s entire prosperity. He is dissecting, and operating, and speculating, and dining with boundless alacrity. The Baron is delighted with him, and even <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and you; for he has read with great contentment of heart that &#x201C;able article&#x201D; in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review, and when Jack told him of your purpose to send him a Bible that he might be instructed in the Truth, Jack says, &#x201C;he was not pleased that I had not brought it.&#x201D; I have certain commissions to execute here for the &#x201C;Government-Counsellor&#x201D;; for which I wait, otherwise I should already have answered our Doctor. He says, he has written to Sandy too; but he seems to look my way for his chief answer. Poor Doctor! Honest, unsuspecting, all-knowing, nothing-doing Engineer of Trailbow! I firmly believe this expedition will do him more good than any year of training he has ever had. Doubt not a good sufficient man will yet come of him, for so much and more is in him.</p>
<p>As to myself, I think I have been stronger rather than otherwise since you went away; indeed <hi rend="italic">much</hi> stronger for the last week; tho&#x2019; still I am sorry to admit, till within the last three days, far <hi rend="italic">idler</hi> than I should have been, or wished to be. However, I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> at last got very near beginning to <hi rend="italic">write</hi>; and then I shall be busy enough with a vengeance. I have two papers to finish, one for each of my two Reviews, <pb id="pg-04-310" n="04:310"/>the Edinburgh and the London,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Articles would be &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Helena,&#x201D; which appeared in the <date when="1828-04">April</date> issue of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi> (the &#x201C;London&#x201D; Review), and the other for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>&#x2014;which he eventually abandoned&#x2014;was to be on Tasso and Italian literature.</note> before I can hope to see you. The first no. of the latter publication came to me yesternight (with the Article on that mad German<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Werner.</note> in it); and the man, I know, is anxious for another &#x201C;supply&#x201D; as soon as possible. From the complexion of Alick&#x2019;s letter (he seems to have got the great-coat, in <hi rend="italic">right</hi> time, after all) I can gather that little good is to be done at Craigenputtock by my going thither for a month or so at any rate; so that this arrangement of circumstances answers just as well as another.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I am as diligent as possible storming the battlements of St. Andrews University, for <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Professorship in which I have actually, eight days ago, declared myself formally a candidate! This was after all due investigation, conducted by Jeffrey and others; from which if I could gather no fixed hope of m<supplied>[y]</supplied> succeeding, it <supplied>[see]</supplied>med at least that there was no fixed determination against me; that I might <hi rend="italic">try</hi>, without censure; nay, in my circumstances, <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to try. I <supplied>[ac]</supplied>cordingly wrote off to St. Andrews; and next day, to all the four winds in quest of recommendations. To Goethe, to Irving, to Buller, to Brewster &#x26;c &#x26;c. These same recommendations are now beginning to come in upon me: I had one from Brewster<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Brewster&#x2019;s encouraging letter to Carlyle, dated <date when="1828-01-21">21 Jan.</date>, has been preserved. David Irving wrote an almost unreserved letter of praise for Carlyle to John Hunter (<date when="1828-01-20">26 [20?] Jan.</date>), in which he said: &#x201C;In one word, from all that I know or can conjecture, I should conceive him to be by far the ablest man that you have any chance of procuring for this important situation.&#x201D;</note> two days ago (with the offer of <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> help); and this morning, came a decent testificatory letter from Buller, and a most majestic certificate in three pages from Edward Irving. The good orator speaks as from the heart; and truly says, as he has ever done, that he thinks me a most worthy man; not forgetting to mention among my other advantages the &#x201C;prayers of religious parents&#x201D;; a blessing which if I speak less of it I hope I do not feel less than he.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle postmarked <date when="1828-01-23">23 Jan.</date> also warns him against Brougham, who would have great influence in making the appointment at the new London University. &#x201C;You are in bad company with Brougham. Dear Carlyle I pray you guard against the cant of natural religion which that man is adding to the cant of natural science.&#x201D;</note> On the whole it is a splendid affair this of his; and being tempered by the recommendation of John Leslie a professed infidel and scoffer, may do me much good. Before the end of next week, I expect to have all my testimonials sent off; and <pb id="pg-04-311" n="04:311"/>there the matter may for a long time rest; the period of the Election being still unfixed, tho&#x2019; I hope it may take place <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Whitsunday rather than after.&#x2014;Of my hopes and calculations as to success I can say nothing; being myself able to form <hi rend="italic">no</hi> judgement. I am taught to believe that if merit gain it, I shall gain; which is a proud belief, and ought to render failure a matter of comparative indifference to me; more especially as, like the weather in Cowthwaite&#x2019;s calculations,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cowthwaite was probably a neighboring farmer who, as a weather prophet, refused to commit himself.</note> I can do &#x201C;owther way.&#x201D; I often care not sixpence whether I get it or no. But we shall see: if it is laid out for me, it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come; if not, not.</p>
<p>I have left scarce a fraction of room for many little odd matters that I had to speak of. Your waffler is so uncertain a person, that we never once looked for him, and shall not, till we see his porter at the door. At any rate we got a stock of eggs from Templand; which, tho <hi rend="italic">preserved</hi> professedly, are threatening to spoil. Is my Father better, and did the gloves go on? I hope Mag (or what is to hinder Jamie?) will write a word or two soon.&#x2014; I have left a little space for Jane (the younger) to write a particle of her mind in. To me she seems to be doing very well: her stocking is (at length) completed; she now writes a copy daily, says a lesson in French &#x26;c &#x26;c; and promises in all things to be useful and comfortable both to herself and to us. Within her heart I doubt she regrets the loud sociality of Scotsbrig, and now and then contrasts with it our very quiet existence: yet she gives no symptom of melancholy, and takes lightly to her occupation, which indeed is the grand cure for melancholy whether in young or old.&#x2014; But I must have done, as the time and the paper are nearly so<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>Make them write, my dear Mother, if you can; and write half a line yourself! If not, I will write <hi rend="italic">my</hi>self: and know as ever that your best wishes are with us. My love to all from Jenny upwards!&#x2014;</p>
<closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate Son&#x2014;</salute></closer>

<ps><p>My dear mother I promised, on your leaving Comleybank to write you a lette<supplied>[r]</supplied> which I will do by the first opportunity; when I shall tell you about all my little concerns: but in the mean time I may assure of my welfare.

I am much <supplied>[better]</supplied> now than I was when you were here; as I have got something to do you will not believe me if I say that I am writing every day so I must refer you to another time.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I half meant to write to you last Tuesday; but put it off till night, when the weather became so bad, or I myself became so oppressed with Jack&#x2019;s &#x201C;fever of digestion,&#x201D; that I could not venture out. I now take time by the forelock; writing in the morning.</p>
<p>Your letter relieved us from a world of anxieties about your goings on, and the fate of that &#x201C;old garment,&#x201D; which I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> now defends you in some measure, on wet Wednesdays,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Market days.</note> from the &#x201C;tempests of life&#x201D;; at least from the far slighter and more tolerable portion of them that are <hi rend="italic">material</hi>, and come down from Heaven only in the shape of <hi rend="italic">bad weather</hi>. I think you should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> cut off the skirts of that ancient watch-coat; for I now find that all such things are made fully as long as it (my own new one dangles on my heels); and truly, long skirts are a great comfort on horseback.&#x2014; O that I too were on horseback, tho&#x2019; it were but in Glen Esley,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably in the vicinity of Glenessland Burn in western Dunscore.</note> and the Dunscore moors! Day after day I long more and more for it.</p>
<p>Grievous is it for a man of spirit to be so poor, as you are at this date: yet so long as the Constable is fairly excluded from us by solid smith-work, one ought in this world to be patient. I hope, another year, Craigenputtock will not be so hard run upon; for, this time, it has had <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than its due produce to yield. Meanwhile I have paid the half-year&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">rent</hi>; and I must again repeat that when you need more money, for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> purpose that you reckon essential, you have only to let us know. Strands&#x2019;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strand lived on the neighboring farm of Blackmark. (From Alick&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1828-02-20">20 Feb.</date>)</note> advice was doubtless a wise and highly virtuous counsel; yet at times even a wise and virtuous man may feel justified in departing from it. For the rest, our &#x201C;whole fortune&#x201D; is lying <hi rend="italic">in the Bank</hi>; so that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can judge as well as I can, whether any proposed employment of it would be preferable or not.</p>
<p>We were thunderstruck to hear of that terrific visitation of smoke! Gracious Powers, are we doomed then to the everlasting curse of a choking atmosphere, and sulphurous vapours, which, it is taught in <pb id="pg-04-313" n="04:313"/>Scripture, are the portion of Devils only, not of still-living men? I vow and swear that it is not so; that free air is the birthright of every free man. This kitchen-chimney <hi rend="italic">must be cured</hi>, my dear Alick; I say, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be, come of it what will. Surely we will try every expedient that man&#x2019;s wit can devise: old-wires, boxes, <foreign>canns</foreign> [chimney-pots], contractions; and if we cannot cure it, we will blow up the whole concern with gunpowder rather than leave it stewing there; for <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, as our Father says, it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be.&#x2014; I am much inclined to think with you that lengthening the chimney-head will be the only effectual cure: if so, do for Heaven&#x2019;s sake get it set about and tried: a cart-load or two of bricks will do the whole matter; and if it be still smouldering and fumigating when I come down to stay with you, it will quite depress my weak heart, I fear, with anticipation of coming woes. Speak to our Uncle on the subject, with the tongue of an eloquent orator: tell him that we are <hi rend="italic">undone, undone</hi>, if that <foreign>reek</foreign> continue! Let all the soothsayers and astrologers and smoke-doctors and cunning-men of every sort, therefore, turn out with one accord; and, thro&#x2019; the strength of Heaven, allay this pest, and finally sweep and garnish that fire-place, and let us live in peace!</p>
<p>Of the road also I am sure you will not be unmindful; but on the contrary do all that the most active husbandman can do <supplied>[to]</supplied> get it put in order. If you want money, tell us. I consulted Robert Welsh<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191000-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1819-10">Oct. 1819</date></ref>.</note> (a shrewd lawyer) about that dog of a <hi rend="italic">gate</hi>; and find that the man neither has nor can have any kind of right to stick it up there; but that, as I supposed, <hi rend="italic">any man</hi> may &#x201C;take his hammer,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Judg. 4:21.</note> and <hi rend="italic">brash</hi> it when he pleases. I hope the man will take it away peaceably; if not, it must be taken away by <hi rend="italic">war</hi>.</p>
<p>On the whole, my dear Brother, I see you have a rough time of it: but what man, this side the moon, has a smooth one? Bear up a little; and surely we are justified in hoping that every month (which is the grand blessing of <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> quarters) things will grow quieter and quieter.&#x2014; You did not tell us what sort of servants you had got: <hi rend="italic">we</hi> here are going to be ill off in that particular; for our present maid turns out unworthy of being transported to Dunscore, or indeed as Jane often thinks, any whither, except to Purgatory. Mrs Welsh is on the outlook for us; but as yet without success.&#x2014; If you are <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> at present, it is not so bad: but if tedium come over you, Craigenputtock would be a sad station. In the dark season, and for long <supplied>[cold?: word covered by seal]</supplied> &#x201C;forenights,&#x201D; I hope you have a complete <pb id="pg-04-314" n="04:314"/>and sufficient stock of <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>? They are a present help, and their compa<supplied>[n]</supplied>y is profitable in the <hi rend="italic">future</hi> too.</p> <p>Jack tells me he sent you a letter, for I also heard from him about ten days ago; and should have written back ere now, were it not that I am waiting over some commissions he gave me for his Baron. The Doctor is perfectly well and prosperous; learning all things with alacrity of soul.&#x2014; For myself I am sorry to say that I am still rather weak, and still rather idle, which is as bad. Neither of my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Papers has yet advanced half a line; in the manuscript way at least. I begin sternly, but something ever comes in the way and takes me off. At present, it is that St. Andrews Professorship; of which I must now tell you a word or two. I am actually a formal Candidate for the office; having declared myself to that effect a week ago! Ever since then I have been gathering Certificates from all quarters; and now I have got a goodly stock, which I am to send off tomorrow. Brewster, Leslie, Dr Irving, John Wilson, Jeffrey and Edward of Hatton Garden<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving.</note> all speak for me with emphasis; Edward, good man, gives me <hi rend="italic">five</hi> full and fearless pages, and Jeffrey writes me a Testimonial which should get me the best Professorship of the Island in that kind. So you see I am doing all I can; tho&#x2019; without fixed hope, or stranger still, without fixed anxiety or even desire, to succeed; but willing to try all points of my <hi rend="italic">condition</hi>, and take the one which promises even a little better. If I miss St. Andrews, why then I <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> get it; and to me, it ranks with the viceroyship of India, or the post of British Prime Minister; a thing, as the Cumbrian said, &#x201C;quite out of our district.&#x201D;&#x2014; On the whole, I think there is a chance: at least if these testimonies of merit will not carry it, one need not ever more attempt to carry such a thing in that way. &#x201C;But,&#x201D; says Brewster, &#x201C;they are a corrupt race, and will not like you.&#x201D; But, say I, can they take the Craig O&#x2019; Putta from us, or dare one of them shew his fat face there?

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your long-expected Letter did arrive about ten days ago; relieving us from a multitude of anxieties on your account, such as take root in friendly imaginations when Correspondents at a distance seem to get lazy. I would have answered you almost by return of Post, being anxious to hear again, had it not been for those Queries of the Herr Bergrath,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About matters relating to British economics and politics. The Bergrath was Baron d&#x2019;Eichthal.</note> to which I had no means of sending such specific and authenticated replies as for many reasons I was bound. Nor have I yet, I am sorry to say succeeded according to my wish; tho&#x2019; now, it may be hoped, I am in a fair way of succeeding; for without loss of time I transmitted the whole inquiries, thro&#x2019; Murray, to M&#x2019;Culloch <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Political Economist, who cheerfully engaged to do the needful in regard to them, to consult Parliamentary Reports, to cite printed works, if there were any, and so forth; only that he lingers somewhat, and so lately as the day before yesterday, when I stopped him on the street, did not seem able to fix any term for the fulfilment of his promise. In a fortnight at farthest I think I may calculate on some authentic result from him; and otherwise, I shall use means to procure such elsewhere. Meantime you can assure your friend the Bergrath that I hold myself honoured by his commissions, and bound to be in readiness for giving him, concerning these or any other points of his Inquiry, all the light I can possibly obtain. Of your own knowledge, at the same time, you will be able to inform him that our salt-works and mines and Forests are in a state little likely to illustrate the practice of Germany or any other part of Europe in those particulars. So far as I have understood there is not now anywhere such a thing as a <hi rend="italic">Regality</hi> properly so called to be found in these Islands; the King having long ago formally given up all such signorial rights, and accepted instead of them such an allowance in money as the Parliament annually pleases to grant. <hi rend="italic">Salt</hi>, in particular, is <hi rend="italic">free</hi> as the air of Heaven; made and vended by <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man that can <pb id="pg-04-316" n="04:316"/>find a salt-rock in his grounds, or has a pan and fuel to evaporate sea-water. We buy it in our retail shops at 2/6 per <hi rend="italic">cwt.</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">rock</hi> is exported from the Cheshire mines at somewhere about 12 or 14 shillings per <hi rend="italic">ton</hi> (of 2,240 lbs <foreign>avoirdupois</foreign>); to what extent, I have not in the least learned, understanding only incidentally from Graham that there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> such a trade between Liverpool and America. Our Mines also are free and private in the fullest sense (whether any <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> even is levied I doubt, tho&#x2019; there is a &#x201C;Stannary&#x201D; (i.e. Tin) &#x201C;Court&#x201D; in Cornwall); and for our woods and Forests, so far as these belong to individuals (and not as in the case of Rockingham,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A parish in Northhamptonshire on the site of the ancient Rockingham Forest.</note> &#x201C;merry Sherwood,&#x201D; &#x26;c to the nation), any proprietor may lop and fell as he thinks best, or indeed, if it so please him, clap a live-coal to the lee side of his woods and reduce the whole to potash.&#x2014; This is the universal understanding, as you know; which however I hope to expand into more particular details, ere long. A few Books, if I can find such (which may be doubted) were the best present I could make to your Bergrath.</p>
<p>Neither am I unmindful of the Baron&#x2019;s kind orders, tho&#x2019; as yet I have taken no final step in the business. I was in waiting for Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s &#x201C;Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries,&#x201D; a book which fills the magazines at present; but learned two days ago that the price would be, not 7 shillings or so, but 3 guineas! For which reason, like Jedidiah Clieshbottom&#x2019;s Bookseller, I purpose to &#x201C;decline the Article,&#x201D;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; Jedidiah positively affirms that <hi rend="italic">the Article</hi>, according to all Grammars, is <hi rend="italic">in</hi>declineable.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to a ponderous joke by Scott, in the &#x201C;Peroration&#x201D; at the end of vol. IV of <hi rend="italic">Tales of My Landlord</hi> (<date when="1816">1816</date>, i.e., <hi rend="italic">Old Mortality</hi>), in which he says that his publisher or bookseller refuses to allow the tale to go on beyond four volumes, and that if not finished and published separately he will &#x201C;decline the article (O ignorance!).&#x201D;</note> Moreau &#x26;c &#x26;c shall be sent by the very first Rotterdam Packet. One of my questions to M&#x2019;Culloch was after &#x201C;Statistical books&#x201D;: in natural Philosophy, I think there can be little new; but on this too I shall make investigation.</p>
<p>And now, my own dear Jack, having finished these public matters, let the remainder of the sheet, my boy, belong to ourselves. Heaven be praised that thy mighty heart is getting domesticated at Munich, and thy soul expanding, as it evidently is, to so many kindly and enlightening influences that encompass it, in that far city! We likewise are all well, and at Scotsbrig and the Craig such also was the case a few days ago, our Father being nearly altogether recovered and <pb id="pg-04-317" n="04:317"/>our Mother safely arrived <hi rend="italic">from</hi> her visit hither, and &#x201C;the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter&#x201D; too; so that for the present, all is as it should be. Let us be thankful to God; and study to use well the fair time he grants us!&#x2014; I have much to tell you about our proceedings here; so must avoid preambles. In the first place, I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> very ill, the cold I last time spoke of having grown into a violent suppuration of the throat, and kept me for several days living &#x201C;in an element of slime.&#x201D; In the second place Becker cured me, in the most cunning way, and I am now as well as ever. In the third place, I am at this moment a formal Candidate for the Professorship of Moral Philosophy in the College of St. Andrews; Chalmers, as you know, being bound for Edinburgh! Is not this a novelty? A week ago I sent off my formal application (Jeffrey having previously written to smooth the way); and yesternight, as I compute, the Packet containing my Testimonials would reach Principal Nicol and the other Professor-Electors. Chalmers, it is said, lingers unaccountably in giving in his resignation; so that the matter may hang in the wind for many months; nevertheless, I have hopes that it may be in part decided before Whitsunday,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1828-05-26">May 26</date>.</note> which is all I want; and what is more, it seems even possible that it may be decided in my favour. At least I am recommended and witnessed for as few men can be: by Brewster, Leslie, Wilson, Procter, Irving, Dr Irving, Buller, Jeffrey &#x26;c; and all in such terms that if I cannot carry the place, I think it may seem vain to attempt carrying <hi rend="italic">any</hi> such place by means of Testimonials to <hi rend="italic">merit</hi> alone. The dear little &#x201C;Duke&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey, nicknamed by the Carlyles &#x201C;the Duke of Craigcrook.&#x201D;</note> (Jane says, she could <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> him) has written me a paper, which might of itself bring me any Professorship in the Island. Irving also spends <hi rend="italic">five</hi> heroical pages on my merits; and Wilson says there is no man known to him fitter for the office. So what more can I do but let the matter take its course, and await the issue &#x201C;with indescribable composure&#x201D;?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech.</note> The truth is, I hardly care sixpence myself which way it go: a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>, if you give him meat and clothes, is or ought to be sufficient for himself in this world; and his culture is but beginning if he think that any outward influence, of person or thing, can either make him or mar him. If I do not go thither (which after all is very likely, for a certain Dr Cook,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Cook (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845">1845</date>), son of Rev. John Cook, onetime professor of moral philosophy at St. Andrews. George Cook became leader of the &#x201C;moderate&#x201D; party in the Church of Scotland about <date when="1819">1819</date>. In <date when="1829">1829</date> he was chosen professor of moral philosophy, United College, St. Andrews.</note> an &#x201C;old stager,&#x201D; talks of applying), why then, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> <pb id="pg-04-318" n="04:318"/>shall not go, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> will not get me; and the Sun will rise and set, and the grass will grow, and I shall have eyes to see and ears to hear, notwithstanding. Do <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that you can in honesty; and reckon the result <hi rend="italic">indubitable</hi>; for the <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> result will not fail, if rightly endeavoured after; and for the outward, <foreign><hi rend="italic">non flocci facias</hi></foreign>, &#x201C;do not value it a rush.&#x201D; Between writing Wotton Reinfred in the Dunscore Moors, and teaching Moral Philosophy at St Andrews, I would not at this moment make a choice, but rather leave Destiny to make it for me.&#x2014; I must not forget to say that I have written to Goethe also for a Testimonial; and may expect his answer in some two weeks. You and Dr Boisser&#xE9;e were alluded to, and much talk there was about the <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>.</p>
<p>In fact, dear Doctor, I cannot but think that you have lighted on your feet at Munich. So many kind and courteous acquaintances; such opportunities for scientific improvement, and such a lordly world of Art laid open round you. Would I had Dr Boisser&#xE9;e for my Cicerone, and the King&#x2019;s Galleries for my place of study! Jane and I are actually talking of a visit to Germany for the study of music and painting (<foreign><hi rend="italic">artes perditae</hi></foreign> [lost arts] in this political and economical, and man-of-business land), and of spending six months (in an excursion from the Craig) at Weimar itself! We <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do it, if the Fates forbid not.&#x2014; Your description of Schelling interested us much; and warmly do I commend your purpose of studying Philosophy under such a man.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s description of Schelling in his letter of <date when="1828-12-29">29 Dec.</date> is worth quoting: &#x201C;Schelling is a littlish man about the size of Moncrief the Advocate and not unlike him in make and appearance, only the features magnified, larger eyes, larger mouth and larger curved nose, and gray hair, and a stronger voice though also somewhat shrill and asthmatic. He reads slowly and with remarkable distinctness and precision, pausing now &#x26; then to get breath and to take snuff&#x2014;which last by the by is almost universal here among the professors. His style is an iron style with no superf<supplied>[l]</supplied>uous ornament. He has many similes it is true, but these are told in the firmest language, and no word or idea comes forward that has not its meaning. What he says sometimes excites violent laughter, but he himself never does more than smile. He has a very large number of hearers, many of them old people. He reads for the first time in M&#xfc;nich, and as he says himself<supplied>[,]</supplied> gives the first complete account of his <hi rend="italic">Philosophie</hi>. Hitherto he has been employed in giving a review of the systems of Spinosa, Leibnitz, Kant, Fichte: and has said almost nothing about his own as yet. Last lecture he concluded with a short poem written by himself several years ago, of which I would send you a copy but I have not room here. He said at the end of his review of the system of Fichte, &#x201C;The philosophy of Fichte was like lightning, it showed itself only for an instant, but it kindled a fire which will burn forever.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> For Heaven&#x2019;s sake get some <hi rend="italic">real</hi> Knowledge of this high matter: be not disheartened with difficulties, for all things are possible to all men, if they but will them stoutly; and let us &#x201C;wash away&#x201D; the insipid <pb id="pg-04-319" n="04:319"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">palabra</hi></foreign> which for the present disgraces Britain in this matter. Have you heard of Cousin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Fragmens Philosophiques</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in <date when="1826">1826</date>.</note> a pragmatical creature, I fear, who arrogates to himself the opinions which he is hardly able even to <hi rend="italic">steal</hi>. Stewart thinks him a high Philosopher, and he thinks Stewart the highest (it would seem): so of two tired <foreign><hi rend="italic">garrons</hi></foreign> [broken-down horses or ponies], grazing in the meadow, if the one scrape the other&#x2019;s neck with friendly tooth, the good turn will be repaid; and mutual solacement, and increase of mettle, for these generous draught-horses be the issue.&#x2014; Tell us all about Schelling, and Cornelius and all men that follow their course. Continue also to frequent, as you have means, the society of your Physicians, and other men of accomplishment; and esteem this as among your richest fields for study, both in science and manners, tho&#x2019; for the time it may not seem so. Send for money also, when you need it: meantime I will pay the Baron&#x2019;s Books, and you can settle with him, which may afford some interim &#x201C;supply.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I must now descend, or perhaps you will call it mounting, to domestic news. Our Mother came hither, as you have partly understood, soon after my last letter went away: she durst not fully trust Jane by by herself, so came and escorted her in person. She staid about four weeks; then went home by Hawick,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton gives a note by Mary Aitken Carlyle saying that old Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s sister, Isabella Mackinnon, lived at Hawick.</note> pausing a few days there. She was in her usual health; wondered much at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, but did not seem to relish it excessively. I had her at the Pier of Leith, and showed her where your ship vanished; and she looked over the blue waters, eastward, with wettish eyes, and asked the dumb Space, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">When</hi> he would be back again&#x201D;? Good Mother! But the time of her departure came on, and she left us stupefied by the magnitude of such an enterprize&#x2014;as riding over eighty miles in the Sir Walter Scott,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A coach which left from the Black Bull and Crown Hotel every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, at half past six, for Carlisle, Manchester, Liverpool, and London.</note> without jumping out of the window, which I told her was the problem. Dear Mother! Let us thank God that she is still here in the Earth, spared for us, and I hope, to see good! I would not exchange her for any ten mothers I have ever seen.&#x2014; Jane (the less) she left behind her, to &#x201C;improve her mind.&#x201D; The creature seems to be doing very fairly, is well and contented. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> Jane, I grieve to say, is yet far enough from well; but I hope much from Summer Weather, and a smart pony in the South. She is not by any means an established <hi rend="italic">valetudinarian</hi>; <pb id="pg-04-320" n="04:320"/>yet she seldom has a day of true health, and has not <hi rend="italic">gained</hi> strength certainly since you left her.&#x2014; Frank Dixon, I heard incidentally, was at Brocketless, and worse this winter than ever: Dr Irving said he was really thought to be dying! Alas, my poor Frank! is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> to be the end of it, thou weary and heavy-laden heart! I trust and pray, not so.&#x2014; Edward Irving talks of coming hither, in General Assembly time, to preach every night, on the Prophecies! He is not mad; but neither surely does he speak forth the words of truth with soberness. Dr Waugh is said to be again bestirring himself into practice, urged on &#x201C;by Hunger and request of friends.&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<ps><p>The &#x201C;Foreign Review&#x201D; is out with my poor Paper on <hi rend="italic">Werner</hi>; concerning which I heard today that there was a kind of eulogistic discussion in today&#x2019;s or yesterday&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">London Courier</hi>.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the issue of <date when="1828-01-26">26 Jan.</date> It reads in part: &#x201C;The fourth article is a contribution of Mr. Carlyle, who is universally acknowledged to be the first German scholar of which the country can boast. It is a powerful and eloquent delineation of the mysticism of German poetry, and dwells on the life and writings of a man who was one of a numerous class peculiar to Germany, of whose precise character none but profound German students can have the slightest idea.&#x201D;</note> The Foreign Review professes to be <hi rend="italic">sold</hi> at Munich in the <hi rend="italic">Lindauerscher Buchandlung</hi>. Do you know such a &#x201C;house&#x201D;?

I mentioned in my last note to the Editor that you would perhaps write him a Paper on the State of German Medicine: of course if you can say aught definite about Animal Magnetism, it will be still more interesting, and gladly received.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have just got a <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi> for the poor Bonnet-woman, at Myer,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Graham. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18271222-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1827-12-22">22 Dec. 1827</date></ref>. In calling her Janet later, Carlyle either confuses the name or knows that she had two given names.</note> to tell the honest housewife news of her Bonnet; and I think I may as well throw you a word or two at the same time, tho&#x2019; I have nothing new or old of the slightest consequence to say to you. Honest Janet Graham, however, has got a prize of five pounds for her Bonnet; and will not grudge carrying this note over to you.</p>
<p>I have been stirring all things to the right and left in this matter of St. Andrews: I sent off my certificates three days ago, and expect some kind of word that they have arrived in safety about Monday; tho&#x2019; nothing definite can be known about the matter of the Election for perhaps many weeks. I think, I may flatter myself with having the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> testimonials that any man will show here, or has shown in such a case for a series of years. I have been recommended by Leslie, Wilson, Dr Irving &#x26;c, men of the most opposite parties and opinions, yet all testifying warmly in my favour; and Jeffrey writes me such a certificate as I could hardly have composed for myself had a blank sheet been laid before me with instructions to fill it in my own praise. <pb id="pg-04-322" n="04:322"/>The Newspapers also, I know not well how, are talking about me, and my bits of Articles in Reviews: this at the present time may have its uses.</p>
<p>On the whole, I am not without expectation of being elected: unless some old-established <hi rend="italic">Stipend-lifter</hi> or other come in by a backdoor, and forestall me, every one seems to think that my chance is fair. For myself I have all along professed, and do still profess, to care next to nothing about the issue, be it what it might. I have done all I could to help myself; and the rest&#x2014;must be left to a higher guidance. I am going to drive the whole thing out of my head, and begin writing my two <hi rend="italic">Papers</hi>, which, I am sorry to say, are still in an altogether rude condition. If these were done, I intend to start for Nithsdale and Annandale!</p>
<p>I wrote, the day before yesterday, to Jack; it will be a fortnight before the sheet see Munich. The Baron&#x2019;s Books &#x26;c are not provided; but must be attended to forthwith.</p>
<p>Today I got a large unwieldy Letter sealed in black; inviting me to attend the funeral of Willie Carlyle&#x2019;s wife tomorrow. So the poor soul is dead! And he himself seems in no enviable case. I will surely go. He talks in a down-stricken manner about &#x201C;what it has pleased the Lord to lay upon him,&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>I hope my Father is recovered completely, and overlooking the ploughing concerns, and all proceeding as it ought to do. Will not Mag or Jamie write me a line? But here is <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, with her pen in readiness; I must give her a line or two:</p><lb/>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>We had some expectation of hearing from you; but were informed yesterday by a Letter from Scotsbrig that you were not to write till after the Fair. When the Fair is I know not; but I hope it may be tomorrow, in which case you are like to get this without waiting, and to answer it in like manner. Not that there is anything of importance in the wind; but simply that we would fain hear of you, and of your welfare, and the prosperity of the Craig and Craig-people.</p>
<p>I think when I have mentioned that we are well, and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in want of butter</hi>, at present, I shall have exhausted the whole pith of my commission. Such, I assure you, are the facts; a pleasant one, and a sad one, as joy and sorrow will often go together in this world: we are in fair health, and have no butter! The question now is, Can you send us any? If these <hi rend="italic">tubs</hi> we heard of are still in existence, you have only to buy a Maryport pot; and little Missus will fill it, and the first trusty Dumfries Carrier will bring it hither, where all due honour will be done it. Fear not for the <hi rend="italic">smoky</hi> qualities of the ware: the hard weather of winter takes away smoke; and at any rate I have a notion it would be found highly tolerable even as it was. By all means, let us try. At the same time, I need hardly add that if you have none, you are to give yourself no particle of disturbance about it. There is butter to be had here, of all sorts; and in a month or two, the fresh will be better than any other. Comfort your dear little Housewife, then, if her stock is done, and think no more of it.</p>
<p>I have a whole legion of questions to ask you about Craigenputta had I room here, or any hope of getting answers. Meanwhile it is satisfactory to believe that all things are made to get along as diligently as they could be were I questioning about them every hour. Have you got that villain of a vent put into &#x201C;any kind of moderation&#x201D; yet? Or is there any hope of it? And how fares it with our Road? And <pb id="pg-04-324" n="04:324"/>how with your Cattle and the prices of them? I could like much to hear about all this; and have a picture to myself of your way of life in that wilderness thro&#x2019; the storms of winter, now happily we may hope doing their <hi rend="italic">last</hi>. But I am to get insight and tidings on all these things face to face ere long: and I believe the best way will be for you to consider when it will be fittest for me to come down, and tell me in your next letter; for in <hi rend="italic">three weeks</hi> I shall be ready to come when I like and find it suit you. I set to work stoutly a few days ago to a thing I had to write;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Helena,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, I (<date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>), 429&#x2013;68; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, Works</hi>, XXVI.</note> and can now calculate with confidence on being done then, and for a time at complete liberty. So consider and tell me. I long to see you all and ascertain how you look. I hope you will not be so lonely another winter; for either you will have us with you, or a Wife, which last I take to be an excellent preservative against weariness. Perhaps you may have both. Mag indeed tells of a <hi rend="italic">dryness</hi> which she suspects may have sprung up in a certain quarter:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Alick-Rachel relationship.</note> but I hope it may not be irremediable, or at worst, if it cannot be cured, it may be made good some other way. Our Father spoke about coming up to see you, if he could ride so far: I pray you, encourage him by all means in your power. Alas! I meant to plant trees this very spring at the Craig O&#x2019; putta myself; and you see how it is: I am still here, and when I do arrive there will be nothing but plastering and pargetting,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ornamental plastering.</note> and all in a haste to be ready for whitsunday.</p>
<p>For to the Craig at whitsunday we will come; and for aught I can see may abide there. The St Andrews Professorship, like Attila Schmelzle&#x2019;s, seems a thing not to be counted on.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Schmelzle in Richter&#x2019;s tale, which Carlyle translated for his <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, sought to obtain a &#x201C;Catechetical Professorship.&#x201D;</note> It is true, I have sent off my Certificates; and such Certificates as might do one&#x2019;s heart good to look upon: but what then? The probability is that they have other meal to grind than choose by certificates; and so all the proofs you can give them of your deservings will be but as music to the deaf adder which refuses to hear the voice of the charmer, charm he never so wisely. We this morning got a letter from a Friend of Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s a person professedly intimate with the business and people of St Andrews: he gives it as his clear opinion that the project is <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, the man being pitched upon long before I made any application.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >So it would seem. (See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 41&#x2013;43, 47&#x2013;48.) The position went to George Cook. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref> Mrs. Welsh&#x2019;s friend is unidentified.</note> <pb id="pg-04-325" n="04:325"/>This to Jane seems decisive; not in the least so to me; tho&#x2019; I must still think, as I before thought, that my chance is doubtful enough. The best part of it is that I am not conscious of caring three farthings which way it go. I think and believe that they <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to choose me, from the circumstances before them, if they do fairly; and if they do unfairly, why in Heaven&#x2019;s name let it be so, and each party will bear his own loss. Here therefore it rests, and may do for many months<supplied>[.]</supplied> If I had Goethe&#x2019;s Certificate<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which was not written until <date when="1828-03-14">14 March</date> and did not arrive in time to serve. (See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, 71&#x2013;80.) Part of it follows in Norton&#x2019;s translation: &#x201C;&#x2026; I have observed with pleasure Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s admirably profound study of this literature [German], and I have noticed with sympathy how he has not only been able to discover the beautiful and human, the good and great in us, but has also contributed what was his own, and has endowed us with the treasures of his genius. It must be granted that he has a clear judgment as to our Aesthetic and Ethic Writers, and, at the same time, his own way of looking at them, which proves that he rests on an original foundation and has the power to develop in himself the essentials of what is good and beautiful.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;In this sense, I may well regard him as a man who would fill a Chair of Moral Philosophy, with single-heartedness, with purity, effect and influence; enlightening the youth entrusted to him as to their real duties, in accordance with his disciplined thought, his natural gifts and his acquired knowledge, aiming at leading and urging their minds to moral activity, and thereby steadily guiding them towards a religious completeness.&#x201D;</note> I would send it also, and then leave them to make a kirk and a mill of the whole matter.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Make what they will of it.&#x201D;</note> The old Laureate did write me since I wrote; but not in answer to my letter which he had not then got: he merely warned me that another packet of Books &#x26;c was on the way for me: owing to the bad weather, I do not look for it for several weeks. There are two <hi rend="italic">medals</hi> in it which I am to present in his name to Sir Walter Scott!</p>
<p>Jack, whom I heard from some three weeks ago, tells me that he had written to you. He seems to be doing well every way. I wrote back a while ago, and am to send a Letter shortly by some Books for the Baron.&#x2014; Jane, the lesser, still abides with us in good health and heart: she with her namesake sends her best regards to you and Mary. We heard that Mary was at Scotsbrig, but going back to you in a day. Tell her that I owe her <hi rend="italic">somewhat</hi>, and will try to pay her when I come down. I am sure she will make me tea of the very best. By the bye, do you or does she know of any sort of person who would be likely to suit us for a servant<supplied>[?]</supplied> The present house-maid is a sort of thickheaded handless and rather wasteful person, and not likely to do. I fear we shall have our own difficulties in arranging everything. But <foreign><hi rend="italic">stout heart to staye brae</hi></foreign> [stout heart for a steep hill] is the word: what is Life itself that one should either sorrow over it or rejoice <pb id="pg-04-326" n="04:326"/>for it?&#x2014; Write to us very soon, My dear Alick. <closer><salute>I am ever <supplied>[your]</supplied> true Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>
<ps><p>I know not whether you have heard that Jenny Graham (of Myre) has got a prize of &#xa3;5 from the Highland Society for her straw bonnet. I am to send her the money tomorrow, in a <hi rend="italic">frank</hi>, and will write at the same time to Mother. At St Andrews I have Certificates from Jeffrey, Wilson, Brewster, Leslie, Irving &#x26;c &#x26;c all praising me, as is the style in these things, for one of the best men now extant.</p></ps>

<p>[Jean Carlyle:] <salute>My dear Mother,</salute></p>
<p>I was unwilling to fill up this room which I knew might have been used to more purpose; but I am to write <hi rend="italic">good or bad</hi>. and I may here thank very heartily for the nice little gown that you sent me, and I may also say that fortune seems to fa&#x2014;[Jane Welsh Carlyle:] vour I suppose; but the rest will follow in another place; here <hi rend="italic">I</hi> must write a few lines. For in a minute Ellen will be come in with materials for a Dumpling (to regale my Aunt Grace<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of her two &#x201C;Edinburgh aunts,&#x201D; her father&#x2019;s sisters.</note> at dinner,) and I shall have little enough time to manufacture it, being to attend a chemical lecture in the College at two oclock. I were very ungrateful however if I did not thank you by the earliest opportunity for the shower of christian comf<hi rend="italic">orts</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s notes, <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251114-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>JWC</sic><corr>JBW</corr> to MAC, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date></ref>.</note> you have sent down upon us, particularly on unworthy me. The drawers I have had on and find still more comfortable than my flannel ones; the stockings too are far warmer than Crookshank&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cruikshank and Bell&#x2019;s, 57 George St., Edinburgh, manufactured hosiery.</note> particularly the black ones which look as if they were made for eternity. And Mag I am sure will be glad to hear that no egg was b<supplied>[r]</supplied>oken, only one or two of the uppermost <foreign>lair</foreign> [layer] were cracked, and these we fried and eat upon the spot. In short the box as a whole gave high and general satisfaction; and is likely to keep us all in mind of Scotsbrig for some twelve months to come (for I see not how all these puddings and hams &#x26;c are to be consumed in a shorter period). I for one, so long as the ham lasts, shall every morning at breakfast remember you with thanksgiving, and perhaps some time after it is done.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-327" n="04:327"/>In case Jane [Jean] does not tell you herself I may assure you she is doing exceedingly well. She enjoys good health, seems content with her earthly lot, and by her good behaviour gives the greatest contentment to both her Brother and me. So keep your good heart at rest about her for I dare promise you will have no occasion to repent letting her come.</p>
<p>You inquire after my dear little Aunt;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh, her mother&#x2019;s sister.</note> I grieve to say she is no better. Indeed last week she was in the most perilous condition with spasms in her lungs. at present however thank God she is out of danger. Surely the warm weather will bring her round again. in nothing else have I any hope&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle is to be down to you in a few weeks&#x2014;but recollect you are not to keep him above a day or two. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> off to my Dumpling&#x2014; I am already too late.</p>
<p>God bless you all&#x2014;<closer><salute>affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>
<p><name>Jane Welsh Carlyle</name></p><lb/>
<ps><p>[Jean Carlyle again:] -vour&#x2014;me in that particular at present&#x2014;only this week there came to me from Mrs Welsh a beautiful red printed one with a fine silk napkin so you see&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p><lb/>
<p>[TC:]&#x2014;Poor Jane is off again, some interruption having occurred; and I being obliged to write at present or not at all, for I am busy all morning, and have an odd hour even now. I hope Janet Graham&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">frank</hi> will carry this down safe for you, and her own five pounds: and doubtless you will like it no worse for having a word in it from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>
<p>We are all as well as usual, and I am busier, which is a better way of it. I have a little <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> to write (on Goethe) for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, and it is to be done against a <hi rend="italic">day</hi>; I believe this day fortnight. The people seem to wonder much at my Reviewing operations, but on the whole they do me good, and make me known over the country as a distinct man that mean well, and stand (rather decidedly) upon my own legs. I sent you down a newspaper the other week, where one Brown<supplied>[e]</supplied>, an Advocate and Loggerhead,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Browne (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841">1841</date>) had studied first for the ministry and then for the law. He received the LL.D. from St. Andrews in <date when="1826">1826</date>. Most of his work, however, was done in journalism and literature. He edited the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi> until <date when="1827">1827</date>, when he became editor of the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury.</hi> In <date when="1830">1830</date> he started a new paper, the <hi rend="italic">North Britain</hi>, but afterward returned to the <hi rend="italic">Mercury.</hi> See <ref target="volume-04/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3680"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. It was probably an issue of the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> which Carlyle sent to his mother.</note> speaks of me in a wondrous <pb id="pg-04-328" n="04:328"/>style. I am told there was great praise given me in other papers, but I chanced to see no other, so could not send them. I think in about twenty years, if there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything in me, such men as Brown<supplied>[e]</supplied> and Company may begin to see it; not sooner, nor do I wish it.&#x2014; But I must tell you a word about St Andrews; and a single word will settle it all for you: I yet know nothing farther, nor, I think does any one else, as to how the business will go. My certificates (except Goethe&#x2019;s) are all there; the men have not yet decided; and if they are to decide by appearance of merit, I imagine they must give the place to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. If not they may give it to whomsoever they list; and I as one individual shall never be heard complaining. I hope only we shall know before whitsunday, that so we may settle the flitting rightly.&#x2014; Goethe <hi rend="italic">has</hi> written to me, but unluckily our letters must have crossed each other on the road, and his is not an <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">question</hi> and an announcement. There is another packet of books &#x26;c coming for me; and two medals which I am to deliver in his name to Sir Walter Scott! This may prove a strange introduction to the Baronet: I am only grieved that the packet must be so long in arriving; the Leith people tell me it cannot be here for five weeks.&#x2014; But I must draw bridle for this sheet is all but done. I wrote yesterday to Sandy, saying that after three weeks I should be ready to come down whenever he pleased; and I need not say that I shall be few days in Dumfriesshire till I see my dear good mother, and have a dish of tea and a smoke with her again! Meantime you will thank Mag again for her pains in writing; and tell my Father with what joy I saw his firm old rugged handwriting (tho&#x2019; only a fragment) once more: I <supplied>[have]</supplied> begged Sandy to forward his journey to Craigenputt<supplied>[och]</supplied> [letter torn] persuade and <hi rend="italic">force</hi> him to go.</p>
<p>This after all is but a very <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> letter: but I know you will be glad of it, and receive it without criticism. Remember me to Jamie and poor little Jenny, into the state of whose <hi rend="italic">medals</hi> I propose inquiring minutely when I come down. Good-night my dear Mother&#x2014;<closer><salute>ever your Son&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I have sat down here, before breakfast, and cut away part of this sheet for the purpose, if possible, of defrauding his Majesty of eightpence-half-penny; believing it to be an overcharge on the part of his Majesty; and also that the single postage will suit you better. I fear still that we may not be able to manage this latter point. But in any case, you will receive the Twenty Pounds,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a new plow horse.</note> which I here inclose for you (part of earnings from the London Foreign Review); and I trust it may partly reli<supplied>[e]</supplied>ve you from your &#x2018;straitened circumstances,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1828-02-20">20 Feb.</date>, Alick writes at length about needing money.</note> which indeed are a hard enough concern.</p>
<p>I fear you would not get the Letter I sent last Tuesday, but that you may still find it waiting for you tomorrow, with all our news untold, and our <hi rend="italic">cry for butter</hi> unappeased. Doubtless, however, the little <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> will lose no time in satisfying us, if it lie in her power.&#x2014; I have nothing farther, under this state of matters, to tell you of ourselves; for nothing new has happened; I am still scribbling as diligently as I can; and growing more and more impatient, as is my wont, <pb id="pg-04-330" n="04:330"/>to be done with scribbling. The rest of us are all well; and in our usual state of occupation.</p>
<p>I had a Letter yesterday from our Bavarian Doctor: it came to Dr Brewster, by a private hand, among some philosophical papers; and at first we knew not well what to make of the Melrose post-mark, and the reduced rate of post-charges; and supposed the Doctor might have taken leg-bail from Munich, and be lying squatted, somewhere in the East Country. But no: the beloved Mr Greatheart<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian&#x2019;s companion in <hi rend="italic">The Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>.</note> is still in his old quarters, dissecting, speculating, reading; in fair health and spirits, only very anxious to hear from us, my last letter not having yet come to hand. He longs especially for some message from you, and is &#x2018;afraid his letter may never have reached you.&#x2019; It were well, if you had any time, to write to him: I here send you his address, which you will write on several lines as I mark them: Doctor Carlyle / Bey dem Herrn R. R. Freyherrn von Eichthal / in M&#xfc;nchen / Bayern /. You may also write &#x2018;Germany&#x2019; on some part of the letter for the information of British postmasters. But what is more important is that you take the letter to the post-office, and pay some halfcrown or so for it, without which it will not leave Britain, or even Dumfries. Choose a large sheet, and the <hi rend="italic">thinnest</hi> you can get, for in Germany it pays by <supplied>[weig]</supplied>ht. And so send the worthy Greatheart all your news.</p>
<p>I ought now to tell you when I am coming down. If you <supplied>[have]</supplied> anything to say <hi rend="italic">against</hi> my coming down very soon, then write me <hi rend="italic">next</hi> Wednesday, and appoint the time. If not then expect a Letter from me this day fortnight; and therein I will specify the day, when I am to arrive at Templand; and you can send over Larry, and I will canter on the back of that ill-conditioned brute over to you next morning. For the present, why should I attempt cramming into short space what I shall soon have an opportunity of discussing in all its breadth and length?&#x2014; I rejoice to hear of that infatuated mortal&#x2019;s letting his <foreign>ligget</foreign> [gate] go down, and so saving one the trouble of <hi rend="italic">brashing</hi> it [breaking it down]. Have you done anything to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign>, or is it still raging as in Mount Vesuvius? I hope and pray that it may be subdued speedily and utterly.&#x2014; There is no farther tidings of St. Andrews: indeed we expect to hear none, for a month or two. I am still in as good expectation, and still as indifferent about it as ever. For the rest, my Dear Alick, keep a good heart, and let neither this nor that in the warfare of existence too much depress you. It is a <pb id="pg-04-331" n="04:331"/>great truth that the thing which most cuts and grieves one at the present moment, will in twenty years most probably be matter of entire indifference. There is nothing <hi rend="italic">really</hi> and permanently important, except a &#x2018;conscience void of offense.&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 24:16.</note>&#x2014; I must leave the small remnant of this sheet to Jane and Mag.

<ps><p>[Postscript by Jane Carlyle, TC&#x2019;s sister:] My dear Mary. It is a long time since I heard of you and still longer since I saw you.

Robert Bryden (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">1860</date>), son of William Bryden, a gunsmith of Edinburgh. He was educated at George Heriot&#x2019;s school, from there won a bursary to Edinburgh University, was licensed by the presbytery of Stirling <date when="1820-10-04">4 Oct. 1820</date>, and ordained at Dunscore on <date when="1822-04-25">25 April 1822</date>. Because of the active part he played in the Disruption, he was on <date when="1843-05-24">24 May 1843</date> declared no longer a minister of the Church of Scotland, and became minister of the Dunscore Free Church. In <date when="1853">1853</date> he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Dartmouth College. (Records also show that he made a monetary contribution to the college library from Scotland in <date when="1860">1860</date>.) Concerning his trouble with Mrs. Welsh (which is clarified in Alick&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1828-02-20">20 Feb.</date>), there was a question whether she or the Carlyles were to pay the tithes due him from the heritors of Craigenputtoch, and the minister had become impatient.

<p><salute>My Dear Brother Jack&#x2014;</salute>I have felt for some time that I owed you a long Letter; and now I seize the earliest vacant hour to pay it. I got rid of a piece of scribblement last night, which had vexed me as usual for several weeks; and Tait also informs me that those Books for the Baron are within three days&#x2019; distance of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, while the Leith shippers engaged yesterday that their Rotterdam Packet would sail about the middle of next week; so that my writing at present may serve likewise to announce the approach, and I hope, seepidily [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>: speedily] subsequent arrival of that too long delayed consignment. Inform your Baron, therefore, with many sincerest compliments from me, that a Parcel will be sent off as specified, containing some what like the following articles: Caesar Moreau<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1791">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>), French economist and author, principal founder of the Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; Fran&#x26;ccedil;aise de Statistique Universelle and the Acad&#xE9;mie de l&#x2019;Industrie.</note> (if it come which I think likely); the <hi rend="italic">Epicurean;</hi> Cobbett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cottage Economy</hi>, and his two little works on <hi rend="italic">America</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cobbett (<date when="1763">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">1835</date>), <hi rend="italic">Cottage Economy</hi> (<date when="1821">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">22</date>); <hi rend="italic">A Year&#x2019;s Residence in the United States</hi> (<date when="1818">1818</date>); and <hi rend="italic">The American Gardener</hi> (<date when="1821">1821</date>).</note> which I thought might be interesting to a lover of rural matters. I purpose also to add a copy of the <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> on my own account; and Jane has been manufacturing a pretty enough Trinket, which now lies ready as a small memorial for that foreign Friend. M&#x2019;Culloch&#x2019;s Answers to Kleinschrod will also be there; which indeed contain little that we did not know already, and no references that I remember to Books of a purchaseable character; only to the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review, Encyclopedias &#x26;c &#x26;c: however, I will examine again before it goes off, and see whether aught farther can be done. For yourself there will be a letter; and four old <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Couriers</hi>!&#x2014; And now having discussed this little piece of business I must take to another little piece, which seems not less but more essential. Owing to the low state of his funds, our foreign Doctor must now be beginning to feel his mighty heart not a little straitened for want of mere terrestrial cash. Explain to me therefore how I may send him a matter of Twenty Pounds, or such other Sum, as he may require to bring him home to us again. I have no want of money for all needful purposes at present; and (thank God for it!) I am able to earn more; neither is there any investment for it half so good as <pb id="pg-04-333" n="04:333"/>there, in the Bank of Affection, where perishable silver and gold is converted into imperishable remembrances of kind feelings. Let the Doctor speak, therefore, plainly and speedily; and &#x201C;it shall be done.&#x201D;&#x2014; Would to Heaven I had a better Pen! But it is hopeless today; for I have already tried about twenty, and my hand is out.&#x2014; Dear Doctor! Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upwards; yet gleams of comfort now and then visit him notwithstanding; so here you see, after all, is a Pen which in the strength of Heaven may see me thro&#x2019;. Let us be thankful!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your Melrose Letter (for Dr Brewster lives there now) surprised us much when we saw it, and gratified us much when we read it over. I know that style well: it is the letter of a man thoroughly busy, endeavouring with his whole heart to get hold of knowledge; and worrying himself because, as in all earthly things his progress cannot be instantaneous and <foreign><hi rend="italic">per saltum</hi></foreign> [by leaps], but gradual and after all incomplete. Never fear, my good Jack! Continue with unabated heart; and long after you will find that you have amassed more, <hi rend="italic">far</hi> more, than you were for the time aware of. The Doctor &#x2018;cannot see the wood for the trees&#x2019;! So is it with all of us. This journey to Munich will not be lost, but a great gain, or I am mistaken; both from what you learn, and what you unlearn. We are greatly pleased with your sketches of &#x2018;German character&#x2019;; your Oken, your pert Surgeon, your Schelli<supplied>[n]</supplied>g &#x26;c must surely be pictures from the Life. Becker says Oken and Wilhelmi are true portraits, as I described them from your letter. Above all I am glad to find both that you admire Schelling and know that you do not understand him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter from Munich of <date when="1828-02-06">6 Feb.</date> John had referred to Karl Joseph Kleinschrod (<date when="1797">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866">1866</date>), a lawyer of W&#xfc;rzburg and Munich; Lorenz Ochenfuss (<date when="1779">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851">1851</date>), called &#x201C;Oken,&#x201D; German naturalist and philosopher, who foreshadowed theories of the cellular structure of organisms and of the protoplasmic basis of life; and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">1854</date>), German philosopher who accepted a professorship at Munich in <date when="1827">1827</date>. John&#x2019;s letter reads, in part:
<q>&#x201C;An opportunity of sending a letter from M&#xfc;nchen to Edinburgh is not to be neglected; and such a one I have at present by means of the English Ambassador, Sir Brooke Taylor, from whom a Courier with despatches sets out tomorrow for London. This letter goes with a parcel of Meteorological Observations for the Royal Society of Ed<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by Kleinschrod of whom you have already heard, which has been waiting for some time for such an opportunity. It will come to you from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Brewster to whom the Parcel is addressed. Thus much, to explain away the surprise you will feel on receiving it by such means&#x2014;and I am ready to proceed to action without farther introduction. &#x2026;</q>
&#x201C;I still hear the lectures of Schelling thrice a week, and though there is much that I cannot understand, I feel that I shall derive great benefit from them. The spirit, geniality, clearness and firm precision with which he states his principles, are not lost for me, and will banish that portion of selfsufficient scepticism, which I have imbibed from the conclusions of Scotch philosophy&#x2014;about the vanity and uselessness of all speculations of the kind. I wish you could see the toleration and compassionate gentleness with which Schelling speaks of the Utilitarians in Philosophy, and the composure with which he at length dismisses them from the scene of action. Hitherto he has been giving an introduction, and has just commenced with his own System, and the first peculiarity of it he is now engaged in showing, by many illustrations and arguments which I yet comprehend almost nothing of. &#x2026; I have been introduced to Schelling since I wrote last, by Boisserie, and had some talk with him though not as I could have wished for we were in a large company. We spoke of Coleridge whose Translation of Wallenstein and <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Biographia Literaria&#x2019;</hi> he had seen. Thought Coleridge understood the German Philosophy but did not speak clearly of it. Schelling speaks always of Goethe with boundless praise in his lectures and in private, &#x26; he mentioned the review he had seen of his Life in Ed<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review as very <foreign><hi rend="italic">b&#xF6;se</hi></foreign> [ill-spirited] and shallow. Schelling is lively in society without frivolity, takes his share of the conversation that is going without speaking in a dictatorial tone to anyone; and his clear blue eyes seem to indicate that he is at peace with himself. Tonight I was to have him after the lecture at his own house, but owing to some unexpected occurrence there was no lecture and so I must wait till friday. The Baron told him of your Article, and I must send it to him as he is very desirous of knowing what can appear in the Ed<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Review in favour of German Literature&#x2014; But here is the Baron to interrupt my story, and besides it is time for bed, so I will leave you till to-morrow morning, wishing a hearty good night.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;<date when="1828-02-07">Thursday 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> February</date>. There is yet a little time to spare as this does not go off till eleven o&#x2019;clock and I can proceed with my talk. I have met with Professor Oken several times. Perhaps you have heard of him as the Editor of the &#x2018;Isis,&#x2019; which he has published for some time&#x2014; I believe seven or eight years in Jena where he was formerly professor. He lectures here on what is called <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Naturgeschichte&#x2019;</hi></foreign> (a general idea of Botany, Mineralogy, Zoology) and on the <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Entwickelungs-Geschichte der Natur&#x2019;</hi></foreign> a sort of air-philosophy, an intellectual <hi rend="italic">fantas</hi>ying with the philosophy of Nature, which is here listened to with avidity. He reads in the same room as Schelling, and just before him. I sometimes go to hear him, and really he is very amusing, I mean his conclusions. He ended the last lecture I heard with <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;<foreign>Ernstlich und wahrhaftig meine Zuh&#xF6;rer, ist Venus aus dem Meeres Schaun enstanden</foreign>&#x2019;</hi> [&#x201C;Seriously and truly, my listeners, did Venus arise out of the foam of the sea&#x2019;]. I have not met with any thing resembling these combinations of Ideas without principles except perhaps Howison&#x2019;s &#x2018;Grammar of infinite forms&#x2019; may have something akin to it. Oken is an extremely little, care-worn, man. He squints perceptibly with his large black eyes, and there is a sort of convulsive simper or grin which gives a painful expression to his whole countenance. He speaks in a solemn tone of voice, and that even in society. You would laugh if I could send you one of his <hi rend="italic">a</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">aber</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">s</hi> [<hi rend="italic">abers</hi>: but, with extra letters and strokes to suggest Oken&#x2019;s tone] which present themselves so oft in his lectures and discourse. But enough of him. He is a sort of phenomenon here and his lectures have certainly something <hi rend="italic">original</hi> in them, if they have nothing else worthy of recommendation.&#x201D;</note> That is right my dear <pb id="pg-04-334" n="04:334"/>Greatheart: look into the deeply significant regions of Transcendental Philosophy (as all <hi rend="italic">Philosophy</hi> [underscored twice] <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be), and feel that there are wonders and mighty truths hidden in them; but look with your clear grey Scottish eyes and shrewd solid Scottish understanding, and refuse to be <hi rend="italic">mystified</hi> even by your admiration. I <pb id="pg-04-335" n="04:335"/>reckon this to be strength of your Intellect, Jack; its solidity, its imperturbable quietude and clearness. A precious gift; and coupled as it is in you with deep feeling of various sorts, still more precious. In truth, Doctor, I begin to have better hopes of you than ever. You must be the Friedrich Schlegel, and I will be the August Wilhelm:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two brothers, Friedrich von Schlegel (<date when="1772">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>), Oriental scholar, Roman Catholic, poet, and critic, who married Dorothea, daughter of Moses Mendelssohn; and August Wilhelm von Schlegel (<date when="1767">1767</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845">1845</date>), professor and man of letters, who with his brother Friedrich founded the <hi rend="italic">Athen&#xE4;um</hi> (<date when="1798">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800">1800</date>), the chief journal of the Jena romantic school.</note> only you must not turn Catholic; neither will I turn Dandy! This is not altogether idle talk: I have my own thoughts about our Doctor, some of which I might tell better to a third party perhaps than to himself. Meanwhile Diligence, Truth! Truth, Diligence! these are our watchwords, whether we have ten talents, or only a small decimal fraction of one.&#x2014; But whither am I running? Your Diligence needs rather to be bridled than spurred. If I had aught to advise, it would be that you should study <hi rend="italic">sciences</hi> less and <hi rend="italic">men</hi> more. Mingle with the world in all directions; let its influences come freely in upon you; for now I am assured they cannot corrupt you, and will in many ways instruct. Despise not even the Carnival, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">herrliche Musik</hi></foreign> [delightful music]! Man is Man, both at Munich and at Craigenputtock!</p>
<p>Doubtless you are dying for news. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vernimm</hi></foreign> [Listen] then! Perpend<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, II, ii.</note> my words! I have not a syllable to tell you about the London University, except that according to all human probability the people neither now nor at any other time will not [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] have the least to do with me. After a long silence I heard the other day from Charles Buller the Younger (it appears they have never got or heard of the German Romance volumes, and learned with difficulty even my address!); and he says that hearing of my purpose he went to Mill (the British India <hi rend="italic">Philister</hi>) who is one of the Directors, and spoke with him;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mill (<date when="1773">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836">1836</date>), who wrote the <hi rend="italic">History of India</hi> (<date when="1818">1818</date>) and was associated with Thomas Love Peacock and Edward Strachey in the India Office.</note> but found that my German Metaphysics were an unspeakable stone of stumbling to that great Thinker; whereby Buller began to perceive that my chances had diminished to the neighbourhood of zero. It appears, however, that I am become a sort of newspaper <foreign><hi rend="italic">Literatus</hi></foreign> in London; on the strength of these <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> (bless them!), and that certain persons wonder what manner of man I am. A critic in the Courier (apparently the worst in nature&#x2014;from the one sentence I read of him) says that I am the supremest German Scholar in the <pb id="pg-04-336" n="04:336"/>British Empire!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Das hole der Teufel</hi></foreign> [Let the devil take it]!&#x2014; However I was rather amused at the <foreign><hi rend="italic">naivet&#xE9;</hi></foreign> with which Crabbe Robinson talks to me on this subject. He characterises the Papers as a <hi rend="italic">splendid</hi> instance of literary <hi rend="italic">ratting</hi> on the part of the Editor; and imputing the whole composition to &#x2018;a Sir&#x2014;&#x2014;Hamilton, Advocate,&#x2019; says it has some eloquence, and tho&#x2019; it cuts its own throat (to speak in a figure) will do good.&#x2014; I know not whether you have seen the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>; it is not worth going far to see. A stupid Book, but pays well, and edited by a very civil and well-meaning man:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> I design from time to time to correspond with it. They gave me &#xa3;47 for my trash on <hi rend="italic">Werner</hi>: I have sent them a far better paper on Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> [underscored twice], for which I shall not get so much. The man Frazer expresses a real anxiety to hear from <supplied>[me]</supplied> on <hi rend="italic">any</hi> subject. Unless your Paper is <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> a different thing than I expect, he would positively be glad to pay you well for it. Suppose you try an Essay on <hi rend="italic">Animal Magnetism</hi>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John writes of his interest in this subject in his letter of <date when="1828-03-01">1 March</date>.</note> if the general state of Medicine be yet, as I think it may, too heavy a corncern for you. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Warum nicht</hi></foreign> [Why not]? It will do yourself a deal o&#x2019; good; and you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> manage it. Only be sceptical, quite sceptical; tell in clear language what the Magnetisers <hi rend="italic">say</hi> they can do; and then <hi rend="italic">translate</hi> scores of remarkable cases &#x26;c and things that they <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done. Tell also how many A.M. Periodicals they [there] are; by whom edited and of what character; that so people may see in what degree of estimation our Germans hold it. Do my good Doctor try this! I am quite sure it will be serviceable to your medical proficiency, and what to Jonathan&#x2019;s proud heart will not be indifferent it must &#x201C;put money in his purse.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Iago to Roderigo in <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, I, iii.</note> I do not imagine that you will find the task so difficult; and as for the editorial reception of it, I incline to suppose that Frazer <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not well but accept it. A word to the wise! The paper on Tasso has never yet been touched, I have been so sick and weak: I expect to have it in readiness next Number. For the Foreign Review next No. I have also engaged to send in a long paper on Goethe&#x2019;s Character generally; this of <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> [underscored twice] being only a sort of introduction. Before I quit this subject of Reviews, I must quote you the following sentence written, <foreign><hi rend="italic">mit eigner hand</hi></foreign> [with his own hand],<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A comical Germanizing of the often-quoted phrase from Edward Irving.</note> by Goethe in a letter I had from him three weeks or four ago. He <pb id="pg-04-337" n="04:337"/>says: <foreign><hi rend="italic">K&#xF6;nnen Sie mir vertrauen wer den Aufsatz</hi></foreign>: State of German Literature <hi rend="italic">im</hi> Edinburgh Review No. <supplied>[&#x26;c]</supplied><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC actually drew a box around &#x26;c.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">geschrieben hat?

Ernst und Wohlwollen sind gleich verehrungswerth?</hi></foreign><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >English translation of a passage from Goethe taken from the letter to Carlyle of <date when="1828-01-01">1 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Can you tell me in confidence who wrote the article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, No. XCII., <date when="1827-10">October 1827</date>, on the <hi rend="italic">State of German Literature</hi>? Here, people believe it was Mr. Lockhart, Sir W. Scott&#x2019;s son-in-law. Its earnestness and good feeling are alike admirable.&#x201D; (Norton&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 45.)</note> Good!&#x2014; Goethe wrote on this occasion to say that another <hi rend="italic">box</hi> was coming for us &#x2018;over Hamburg,&#x2019; but the Leith men have never yet had a ship, and do not expect one for a week yet. It contains books; and, stranger still, two medals which I am to give Sir Walter Scott in Goethe&#x2019;s name with <foreign><hi rend="italic">verbindlichsten Gr&#xfc;ssen</hi></foreign> [most courteous greetings]! This will prove a curious introduction: I will tell you about it when it happens. No answer to the letter written about St Andrews, which must have met his at sea.&#x2014; And here I am reproachfully reminded that I should have told you about this other university scheme, long ago. Alas, it is soon told: from all that I can conjecture by various rumours of late days it would appear that the whole matter has evaporated, and Goethe&#x2019;s certificate need not be presented at all. An old stager (Cook of Laurencekirk)<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> is to be appointed, at least is applying: he will vote for another old stager succeeding to the Principality, and a young stager will get his Kirk, and so the whole thing be rounded off in the neatest manner possible. In which case what would the certificate of the Angel Gabriel himself avail me? No pin&#x2019;s worth. But the <hi rend="italic">Deevil</hi> [underscored twice] may care! I can <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> independent on thee; and so nothing more need be said. All this is not certain, but next to it: you shall hear as it advances. What we are to do in that case is yet nowise clear. The people have not yet asked us about quitting the house here, the term for that business being altered to the <date when="1828-03-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>; and how matters stand at Craigenputtock I can only guess, but am soon going down to see. I am in no small uncertainty. This Edinburgh is getting more agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>able to me, growing more and more a sort of home; and I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> live in it, if I like to live perpetually unhealthy, and strive forever against becoming a <hi rend="italic">hack</hi>, for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I cannot be. On the other hand, I should have liberty and solitude for aught I liked best, tho&#x2019; among the moors: only Jane, tho&#x2019; like a good wife she says nothing, seems evidently getting more and more afraid of the whole enterprize. O Jack, Jack! &#x2018;The <hi rend="italic">Prison</hi> <pb id="pg-04-338" n="04:338"/>called <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> [underscored twice]!&#x2019;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Life and Writings of Werner,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 109.

<p>In ten days, then, I expect to be in Dumfriesshire, and to continue there perhaps a fortnight. They were all well and moderately hearty when I heard about a week ago. The Scotsbrig people sent us a box of buttered eggs. Alick&#x2019;s courtship, I think, must have assumed an unpromising aspect; but nothing positive was said. He inquired your address; which I sent him; so probably by this time he may be writing to you himself. Whenever I get word from you, I send it off directly; and all and sundry are eager as you could well fancy to learn it. One and all would send you the best affection of their hearts, only that they are dumb thro&#x2019; distance and want of penmanship. I get scarcely any tidings except thro&#x2019; Alick. Little Jane does well, and seems to conduct herself with great prudence, and be contented enough. Poor little Crow! And for my own little &#x2018;Goody&#x2019; I am sorry she is not at all stout in health; otherwise I had nothing but joyful things to tell of her. Both of them are absent; but they have sent you their love in words almost daily since you went away, and in thought far oftener.<closer><salute>God bless you. My Brother!

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I have taken, as you see, an enormously long sheet, that so I may have space to write at pleasure; intending not to be concise but the very contrary. It is true, I sent you all our news, by Post, only a few days ago; but much <foreign><hi rend="italic">palabra</hi></foreign> still remains at the bottom of my inkstand; and in the case of a ship-packet, one may speak freely.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was no restriction on the length of the letter, as there was, because of cost, on the inland post.</note> I have endeavoured also to forage for you in other quarters: letters from Murray and Gordon I expect this evening; one from William Grahame with a Book is already lying on the table for you. Could I but have added a stock from Craigenputtock and Scotsbrig! But the good people there lie out of the way; so all that I can do is to inclose for you such fragments, of their Letters to me, as I can still find secreted about my pockets; wher<supplied>[e]</supplied>by you may see that they are all moderately well, and nowise forgetful of Mr Greatheart. I have scraped together four Dumfries Newspapers, and sundry smaller items may still present themselves; so that on the whole, I may hope this package will prove a windfal<supplied>[l]</supplied> to you. A &#x201C;collection of handbills,&#x201D; as Quintus Fixlein would say, must always be very incomplete: indeed I did not think of it till yesterday, and so have gathered only <hi rend="italic">one</hi>; otherwise the whole &#x201C;picture of Edinburgh&#x201D; might in this way have been very comfortably presented to you.</p>
<p>But what chiefly grieves me at present is the tardiness of Tait&#x2019;s London Shippers. The Books should have been here last week; and <pb id="pg-04-340" n="04:340"/>were not come yesterday at noon; nay nor yet, as I conjecture; for Tait was to send me instant word. And then the Rotterdam Ship was to sail one of these days, perhaps tomorrow; and we have already fixed monday next for setting out to Dumfriesshire. Judge whether I am anxious! Besides all which I yesterday chanced to slide away my heel at the north-east corner of the College, on the steep dry slippery pavement, and stagger and sprawl up and down in consequence, nay even for a moment to stretch my entire length on the causeway; by which means my left knee is lamed in some degree, and I cannot walk, on rough ground, without halting, or at all, without difficulty. However, I will write to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>; then hop along to Tait&#x2019;s and see whether there is news; and so do all I can, which tho&#x2019; not much is evidently the <hi rend="italic">most</hi>.</p>
<p>We have not the slightest particle of news here, since I wrote; no farther word of St Andrews; except a report that it is not to be finally settled till <date when="1828-11">November</date>; Dr Chalmers for reasons best known to himself having declined resigning till then. I suppose they mean formally settled; for finally settled it will be long before that time, nay as I believe is very nearly so already. Dr Cook will be Professor there, as will be both seen and heard tell of; and I&#x2014;shall be Professor nowhere. In fact, the people incline to reckon me a somewhat dubious character in these parts. One Brown<supplied>[e]</supplied>, an Advocate, and Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> Newspaper, published a critique of me the other week,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280219-JJT-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1828-02-19">19 Feb.</date></ref></note> which I would give sixpence that I had here to send you, but I despatched it straightway to Scotsbrig. He says that I am as it were the most beautiful penny-candle you could see in a winter night, but that unhappily a &#x201C;murky cloud of German Transcendentalism&#x201D; is descending over me; whereby what can tallow and wick avail tho&#x2019; never so goodly? The light must go out in its socket; and nothing remain but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">waily-dreg</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Defective &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">dip</hi>&#x2019;; the last-made candle, thin and ill-shaped, which utilises the remaining tallow, was called, in Annandale, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">waily-dreg</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note quoted by Norton).</note> of the <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> to illuminate the Earth. I have met Brown<supplied>[e]</supplied> since, at Sir W. Hamilton&#x2019;s: he looked very frightened, but gathered confidence in my greatness of soul, as the night went on; and proved himself indeed, to speak with brevity, an <hi rend="italic">en</hi>tire <foreign><hi rend="italic">hash</hi></foreign> [a foolish, confused person: underscored twice]. That is the short definition of him.</p>
<p>This night at Sir W. Hamilton&#x2019;s I reckoned on the whole a pleasant one. Moir was there; a kind, lively, very ingenious <hi rend="italic">Small</hi>, with <pb id="pg-04-341" n="04:341"/>whom I am growing very intimate; Dequincey also, tho&#x2019; in the <hi rend="italic">low</hi> stage of his opium-regimen, and looking rather care-stricken; then &#x201C;Cyril Thornton&#x201D; or &#x201C;Odoherty,&#x201D; Sir W&#x2019;s Brother,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Captain Thomas Hamilton (<date when="1789">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842">1842</date>), the original &#x201C;Ensign O&#x2019;Doherty&#x201D; of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi>, was author of the novel <hi rend="italic">Cyril Thornton</hi> (<date when="1827">1827</date>), <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Peninsular Campaign</hi> (<date when="1829">1829</date>), and <hi rend="italic">Men and Manners in America</hi> (<date when="1833">1833</date>).</note> an exceedingly gentle and wholesome man, and, stuttering in his speech, who reminds you much of our East-Lothian Dickenson. The rest were German Tourists, and Editorial gentlemen; and babes and sucklings. One was a son of Dr Russel&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. James Russell (<date when="1754">1754</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836">1836</date>), Regius professor of clinical surgery at Edinburgh University and lover of the fine arts and literature.</note> who had been Aitken&#x2019;s pupil, and at Munich: he has since brought me down Jean Paul&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Campaner Thal</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Das Kampaner Thal</hi> (<date when="1798">1798</date>).</note> and his own card. We sat till the small hours, and Sir W. proved a modest and most courteous landlord: Cyril Thornton and I drank half a glass of Claret, and supped on one potatoe each. One &#x201C;mealy root&#x201D;; and this without comment from any one, which I reckoned polite. Of talk there was no end; and tho&#x2019; much of it was of the smallest, it was innocent to a degree, and perhaps better than mere nothing.&#x2014; I have met the <hi rend="italic">Stot</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably J. R. McCulloch. Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211215-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1821-12-15">15 Dec. 1821</date></ref>; <ref target="volume-03/lt-18230408-TC-JJ-01"><date when="1823-04-08">8 April 1823</date></ref>.</note> also (at MacMillan&#x2019;s); but think not of him more highly than I was wont. On the whole, the literary society of Edinburgh may be about as good as any other literary society; and here as well as there and everywhere it well beseems us to be &#x201C;content with the day of small things.&#x201D;&#x2014; Among our visiters I may mention a little <hi rend="italic">wizzened</hi> Captain Skinner,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 90, 98, 133&#x2013;34. Skinner returned to Weimar soon, where he died the next year.</note> who produced a card from Goethe &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Sch&#xF6;nstens gr&#xfc;ssend</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;with most affectionate greetings&#x201D;]. Skinner turns out to be from Kirkcaldy, a lively harmless little man, and the best singer perhaps &#x201C;within a hundred miles of him.&#x201D; He gave us <hi rend="italic">Kennst du das Land</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Knowest thou the land</hi>],<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mignon&#x2019;s song from <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230708-TC-JJ-01">TC to JJ, <date when="1823-07-08">8 July 1823</date></ref>.</note> in a style which even at M&#xfc;nchen must have been pronounced to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">herrlich</hi></foreign> [delightful] and <foreign><hi rend="italic">himmlisch</hi></foreign> [heavenly].&#x2014; So goes it with us here; &#x201C;much in the old way.&#x201D; Jeffrey and I continue to love one another, like a new Pylades and a new Orestes; at least such often is my feeling to the little man. But he is so busy, that it is not once in the month you catch a glimpse of them; and even then he is spirited away from you in five minutes by some solicitor before the Supreme Court, and you see no more of him. Poor good little Duke! There are few men like thee in this world, Epicurean in creed tho&#x2019; thou be, and living all thy days among <pb id="pg-04-342" n="04:342"/>Turks in grain! Wilson I can get little good of, tho&#x2019; we are as great as ever. Poor Wilson! It seems always as if he shrunk from too close a union with any one: his whole being seems hollowed out, as it were, and false and counterfeit in his own eyes; so he encircles with wild cloudy sportfulness, which to me often seems reckless and at bottom full of sharp sorrow. O that a man would not halt between two opinions! How can any one love Poetry and <foreign>rizzard</foreign> [dried] haddocks with whisky toddy; outwatch the Bear with Peter Robinson<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Peter Frederick Robinson (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858">1858</date>), architect. See <ref target="volume-04/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23862"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>. For &#x201C;outwatch the Bear,&#x201D; see &#x201C;Il Penseroso,&#x201D; l. 87.</note> and at the same time with William Wordsworth? For the last four weeks, poor Wilson has been very unwell; and his friends are not without apprehensions for him. He purposes to visit Switzerland in summer, and to take Dequincey with him. I called yesterday on Dequincey about two o&#x2019;clock, and found him invisible in bed. His landlady, a dirty very wicked looking woman, said if he rose at all it was usually about five o&#x2019;clock! Unhappy little opium-eater; and a quicker little fellow, or of meeker soul (if he but lived in Paradise or Lubberland) is not to be found in these parts!</p>
<p>I have involved Mr Greatheart in an ocean of gossip; so I may as well go on to say that the &#x201C;intellectual city&#x201D; is at present entertaining itself not a little with the &#x201C;Apocrypha controversy,&#x201D; in which Grey the minister and Thomson the minister<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The feud was between Henry Grey (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859">1859</date>) and Andrew Mitchell Thomson (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">1831</date>). Both were Evangelicals in theology and had once been warm personal friends. The basis of the feud was Thomson&#x2019;s attack on the British and Foreign Bible Society for binding the Apocrypha in with the Bible.</note> are exhibiting &#x201C;the various manners&#x201D; of offence and defence to the edification of all parties interested. Translated into the language of the Shambles, where their spirit clearly enough originates, these pamphlets of theirs mean simply: &#x201C;Sir! you are a d&#x2014;&#x2014;d rascal&#x201D;; and &#x201C;No Sir! <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are a d&#x2014;&#x2014;d rascal.&#x201D; Happily I have read next to nothing of the whole, and heard as little of it as I possibly could: but now some private wag has taken up the task of caricaturing in pictorial wise these reverend persons; and a crowd, shoving and shouldering for a clear and clearer view, may be seen at all printshop windows, contemplating the distorted figures of their <hi rend="italic">paws</hi>tors,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pastors, with dogs&#x2019; paws.</note> depicted as bull-dogs and greyhounds; as preachers and prize-fighters, climbing the steeple like orthodox men, or throttling one another like exasperated fishwomen; for there are said to be <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> caricatures in the course of publication; and a fresh one comes out every now and then. What Thomson and Grey say to <pb id="pg-04-343" n="04:343"/>it I know not; for myself <supplied>[I]</supplied> sh<supplied>[all]</supplied> only say in the words of that old poem:</p>
<lg><l>May the Lord put an end unto all cruel wars,</l>
<l>And send peace and contentment unto all British Tars!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the chorus of a broadside ballad of the Napoleonic Wars.</note></l></lg>
<p>With regard to Edinburgh, then, you see pretty well how matters stand. I must now for a moment or two direct your at<supplied>[tention]</supplied> to Munich. That you will continue to keep the most copious <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of your procee<supplied>[dings]</supplied> there I cannot for a moment doubt; no less that you will continue from time to time sending me sufficient news of your adventures outward and inward, that we may see how it fares with you, and has fared. Would I could send you some <foreign><hi rend="italic">gepr&#xfc;ftes Wort</hi></foreign> [expert advice] about the plan of conducting your investigations, and the points you should inquire into there! I can only again bid you in general <hi rend="italic">keep your eyes open</hi>, and gather knowledge of men and things wherever it is to be had. Do you look at all into the political condition of Bavaria? Endeavour to ascertain this, as the basis of all other inquiries. How does the social machine work? Where is the security each man feels that no one will molest him or his rights? Inquire of well-informed men as to this, and all that pertains thereto. I feel great dimness in regard to the History of Germany generally: I know no book but some one or two of <hi rend="italic">Dohm&#x2019;s</hi>,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Wilhelm Conrad von Dohm (<date when="1751">1751</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">1820</date>).</note> and these only by report. Doubtless there are many persons in your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Umgebung</hi></foreign> [company], that can tell you all that; which, therefore, mark down in your Journal, and your memory, for your letters must treat of more special matters. Then as to the Education of Germany the plans of its Gymnasiums and Universities: I reckon that a great service might be done to Britain were this matter fully expounded and set before them. The manners of the people you naturally study; and having a shrewd comprehension will not fail to see a little into. I asked you somewhat about Books last time; but will not enter into that matter farther here; unless you are very poor, I mean to say unless <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am very poor, I will send you a sum to lay out for me in that way before you leave the country. Meanwhile as a matter of course, in spite of all these extraneous calls, you may properly direct your main attention to Medicine; and incidentally and almost insensibly you will acquire from the society you move in much cultivation no less available than surgery or anatomy in practice. Keep your clear Scotch eyes open, Doctor! that again is all I can tell you.&#x2014; I suppose, <pb id="pg-04-344" n="04:344"/>it is much too soon to talk of seeing you home again: yet perhaps you could throw a little light on this point also, which more than one of us now and then discusses with himself. True there is no need for haste; while you feel that you are learning <hi rend="italic">fast</hi>, and are not weary, stay where you are: yet home is home; and there is a time for all things.</p>
<p>How we are to be disposed of for next year is still as uncertain as ever. The p<supplied>[l]</supplied>asterers have not done at Craigenputtock, it will be seen, perhaps not nearly so; and the road is lying as we left it. For this year there will be many drawbacks at the Craig, and only one furtherance, the cheapness of living. Heaven direct us how to do! For my own share I have long known that all places which the eye of Heaven visits<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Richard II</hi>, I, iii.</note> are most respectable places: but we shall, as usual, <hi rend="italic">see</hi>!&#x2014; Perhaps I may write to you from Scotsbrig or the Craig, if there be any news. I am to be thereabouts for perhaps two weeks<supplied>[,]</supplied> Jane meanwhile at Templand, where I grieve to say there is but a sad and sorrowing household at present. The old man is getting weaker; and poor dear little Auntie<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s Aunt Jeannie Welsh.</note> has suffered and is suffering hard things. We are all alarmed for her of late; for she seems to be in the last stage of exhaustion, and afflicted with dreadful spasmodic affections. Good soul! But Heaven is merciful to her; for it sends her a humble and loving heart.&#x2014; Jane I believe means to write you a word, and perhaps the <foreign><hi rend="italic">wee</hi></foreign> Jane too.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >These postscripts were not written.</note> I also may add a word or two before the Packet goes off. At present my time and space are done. No syllable about these Books! I must up to Tait, and then to meet Grahame at the Royal Exchange, and bring him down to dinner. <closer><salute>All good be with you my Brother!</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<salute>My Dearest Wife,</salute>
<p>I am just returned from Dumfries, where your melancholy letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> lay waiting for me; and I write literally for no other purpose but to say where I am, and to beg of you to write me again. I could not <pb id="pg-04-345" n="04:345"/>find any corner of Dumfries that was not full of uproar; and had to retire <hi rend="italic">to the street</hi>, not to send you a letter, but to consider whither I should betake myself for the night; a package of proof-sheets, parcel from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, &#x26;c &#x26;c having also arrived, and requiring immediate attention. The result was that I determined on coming hither, and waiting till I should hear from you again, which I pray that I may do if possible by return of post, to regulate my farther movements. Direct me how you wish that I should proceed; and if I can I will comply.</p>
<p>Poor Auntie! Poor dear gentle soul, and is it come to this with her! Till your letter reached me, I had never left off hoping; nay my hopes were stronger than my fears. Tell her that I weep for her, and pray for her; yes, pray, as I am enabled, to that great Being to whom the issues both of life and death equally belong. O, Jane!&#x2014; But what is the use of talking? May the Great God be merciful to her, and to us whom He is threatening to bereave of one so dear to us! Alas! alas! Life is but a Shadow and a Show. But the Substance and the Truth lies beyond it; and they that are of upright heart shall not long and hope in vain.</p>

<dateline><place>Scotsbrig</place>, Thursday Night (Late) [<date when="1828-03-27">27 March 1828</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My Dear little Wifie,</salute>
<p>I write two words to prevent uneasiness on your part, tho&#x2019; I know not that I was ever much unfitter for writing. I have just returned from Annan, where after a long and laborious consultation with Surgeon Thom,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-02-01">1 Feb.</date></ref></note> I do not find that I have realized anything of almost any tangible consequence. He thinks on all grounds that the prime root and origin of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> our dear Auntie&#x2019;s maladies is deranged digestion; and agrees warmly with Mr Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied> in considering this as the great object to be kept in view, now and henceforth. Were it not for the great weakness of our dear Patient, he could have no doubt that the disease might be completely brought under subjection; and by new regulations of diet and medicine finally extirpated. As it is he strongly advises antibilious medicines, tonics &#x26;c: the chief thing of any novelty seemed to be the stress he laid on <hi rend="italic">Sarsaparilla</hi>, which he said would do all the good that <hi rend="italic">Mercury</hi> could do with far less harm. His notions about <hi rend="italic">diet</hi>, mastic-and-aloes pills &#x26;c were such as I had often heard before.</p>
<p>On the whole, he expressed himself as uncertain whether he could understand the case <hi rend="italic">much</hi> better by seeing it than by such a description as he got of it. At first, indeed, he seemed to think it decidedly <hi rend="italic">un</hi>advisable that so much trouble should be incurred for such an object: but on our second interview (for we met twice today) he seemed to be rather fonder of coming up, tho&#x2019; more as it struck me out of a certain newfangledness than from any fresh hope of doing good. Meanwhile, he gave me a paper containing his deliverance (of which the chief feature is that of <hi rend="italic">sarsaparilla</hi>); and it was agreed on between us that I should write to him or see him again; and he would at all times be ready to come up whenever it should be requested.</p>
<p>I could not by any means resolve to press this journey of his till I got farther confirmation. Thom has degenerated not a little in point of manners and I think general character since I met him last, which is about ten years ago: he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> now what you could call a Gentleman in any sense; but a sturdy, vindictive, decided and rather as I fear ill-principled Plebian. The man, I still believe, has talent and invention beyond the common level; distinctly beyond, but not <hi rend="italic">far</hi> beyond: <pb id="pg-04-347" n="04:347"/>add to this a fiery, resolute temper, and a character broken in the eyes of the world, and not very whole in his own eyes; and you have the materials out of which a sort of <hi rend="italic">gifted quack</hi>, perhaps a Liston or Saunders<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Liston (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), eminent Scottish surgeon, born at Ecclefechan, where his father was parish minister. In <date when="1827">1827</date> he was elected one of the surgeons to the Royal Infirmary. A bold and rapid operator, he was fertile in expedients, great in nerve. Saunders is probably William Saunders (<date when="1743">1743</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817">1817</date>), who received his M.D. from Edinburgh University, though possibly Richard HuckSaunders (<date when="1720">1720</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785">85</date>), physician, who did some work at Edinburgh University. Russell is Dr. James Russell of Thornhill, who would later be Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s physician. He is not to be confused with Dr. James Russell of Edinburgh.</note> or some such character might be compounded. To bring up a man of this sort seems highly questionable: accordingly, as you see, for the present I have left it altogether open; and tho&#x2019; I certainly think that other advice than Dr Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied>&#x2019;s ought forthwith to be looked after, I will limit Thom to his written Paper alone, which I am to bring up with me, and exhibit on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>.</p>
<p>Yes, Dear, on Saturday; for that knee of mine is sore, and I am very saddle-sick, and must have <hi rend="italic">a</hi> day&#x2019;s rest before I ride farther. Besides I partly engaged that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were to go up with me to Craigenputtock on Sunday afternoon, or early on Monday Morning to meet our two Architects, my Uncle and the Joiner; who wish to have their <hi rend="italic">final</hi> directions on the spot. With this view I directed Alick to send over little <hi rend="italic">Pen</hi> (so they call your old friend the Shelty of last year, which is now at least a very <hi rend="italic">swift</hi> and assiduous <hi rend="italic">canterer</hi>) to convey you up; for the men are to be there early in the forenoon. I am not ignorant that it will be a poor enough conveyance for you, the back of Pen: but there is no other, <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> you can hire or borrow or otherwise procure some <hi rend="italic">gig</hi> or vehicle of that sort, in which Larry could draw us both, <hi rend="italic">up</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">down</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day. This surely were much better; very much, for the riding will not agree with you. Try therefore what can be done on Saturday; and if you succeed, just request the Boy to take back little <hi rend="italic">Pen</hi>, and dispose of her as he sees best (at Minnyhive or Craigenputtock), and do you hold yourself in readiness for Monday Morning <hi rend="italic">early</hi>; and send back word to that effect with the Boy, that they may not expect us on Sunday. The accommodation is about equal to what we had there last year: but there is a rather fair prospect held out (of the house <hi rend="italic">ultimately</hi>, and even soon being <hi rend="italic">good</hi>).&#x2014;&#x2014; One other resource remains for you: to send <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by myself; but this, unless you are particularly detained, would be the worst of all; for several <hi rend="italic">new</hi> arrangements will have to be mooted and fixed upon. Decide dear Wifie as it pleases thee.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-348" n="04:348"/>A boy runs over with this early tomorrow, and strange to tell, if all prosper, it will go round by Moffatt and Dumfries, and find <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in the Evening. Kiss me, thou foolish Creature, and let me go. Dost thou not see that my fingers are blue, and my nose with a doxology; and my Mother stirring the porridge for me, which is now boiled to the uttermost? She specially <hi rend="italic">bids</hi> me send her kindest regards. So good night, thou good Cheapie, and believe thyself ever dearest to me&#x2014;at least till Saturday perhaps about tea-time. <closer><salute>Thy own Husband</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Wife,</salute>
<p>Alick is here and going round by Dumfries homewards; so I write a single line to say that I am waiting anxiously for word from you. I have already sent three times to Ecclefechan, there being some dubiety in the route of the Dumfries Mail. By Carlisle nothing came for me this morning: but I still hope from Moffatt in the afternoon. Poor Auntie! It seemed as if I were waiting for her sentence of life or death. Again say to her that my best love and prayers are with her.</p>
<p>All my business is done here, and my Mother going with Alick to Craigenputtock: I wait only for your Letter, and light how I am farther to proceed. <closer><salute>God bless you always! I am in great haste; and ever my dear Jeanie&#x2019;s affectionate Husband,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Little Crow,</salute>
<p>I duly received your Munich Letter, and your Proofsheet Package, on two successive Wednesdays; and had reason to approve your activity and sagacity in managing so many new concerns. It was a deadening and a killing Letter that of the <hi rend="italic">un</hi>franked Proofs; more <pb id="pg-04-349" n="04:349"/>especially as it was totally superfluous, and must have been sent you by mistake alone. Had one possessed the gift of divination (which very few possess), the right way would have been to let the Postman keep that epistle to himself; you keeping your 5/ 4&#xBD;, which would have answered better. However, it is all settled now; and the damage any way is not considerable.</p>
<p>The next thing to be discussed is when you are to be relieved from your wardenship, and the natural guardians of the Mansion to return. We purposed, you know, to be back in a fortnight; that is tomorrow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This indicates that the Carlyles left their home in Edinburgh on <date when="1828-03-17">Monday, 17 March</date>.</note> Yet back tomorrow we shall not be; for all is in derangement about Templand, Jane cannot be wanted there, and her engagements have hitherto cramped mine also. Poor Miss Welsh is dreadfully ill; the Doctor and Jane seem to have little doubt but she is dying: Mrs Welsh also has fallen sick; so that now it seems to be arranged that I am to return home myself, and leave Jane at Templand till some better season for quitting it. Miss Welsh&#x2019;s Brother is now come thither from Liverpool;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh, Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s maternal uncle and father of her Liverpool cousins.</note> so that they are better off for men; but of women there is none except Jane that can take any full charge; her Mother being to all appearance exhausted with over-exertion. Poor little Auntie! I myself have great fears for her; but I do not think the Doctor knows his right hand from his left in the matter; so that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> predictions give me little concern.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >If Carlyle refers to Dr. Russell of Thornhill, as he almost surely does, he is badly mistaken, as he discovered years later when Dr. Russell attended Jane Carlyle. He was an excellent physician.</note></p>
<p>Now I have not yet finally settled at Craigenputtock, and was to be up there again before leaving the country. I purpose, therefore, setting off for Thornhill tomorrow; then next day for the Craig; and unless some new scheme be started, you may expect to see me on Thursday-night. But I can predict nothing with certainty; all things are in such a state of agitation. I fear greatly your <hi rend="italic">funds</hi> must be getting low; and were it not for the dangers of double postage, I would send you a pound herewith: however, you must try to hold out till Thursday night, and if I do not come then I will enclose you the so needful &#x201C;supply.&#x201D; But I think and calculate that starting that morning from Thornhill I shall <hi rend="italic">come</hi>; and doubtless the tea will be ready, and the house swept and garnished for me, when I ring the bell. The Crow also will greatly rejoice at relief from her solitude; <pb id="pg-04-350" n="04:350"/>and will actually betake herself to keeping house for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, till the real Goodwife arrive.</p>
<p>I have been at the Craig and here and back again like a weaver&#x2019;s shuttle on the back of Larry, whose hoof has had no rest since I revisited him. They are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> well. Alick was down here yesterday for seed-corn, and our Mother went off with him in the Cart; so that I expect to see her again on Tuesday. Mag and Jenny are here; Jenny at the Sewing-school school with Jene Combe, and making <hi rend="italic">great</hi> progress. Jemmy and the rest are busy sowing oats, at least were yesterday, for today they are all at the Kirk. Every one of them has been asking again and again after &#x201C;Jean,&#x201D; and rejoicing to hear that she does well. If I can persuade them, I will make them write their compliments with their own hands. Meanwhile do thou, my dear little &#x201C;wise young Stewardess,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An echo of Luke 12:42: &#x201C;faithful and wise steward&#x201D;; or of the virgins and their lamps in Matt. 25:1&#x2013;13; chiefly of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April</date></ref>).</note> continue to behave thy bit of a self (for thou also art a <hi rend="italic">self</hi>) with propriety; and expect thy natural guardian and Brother on Thursday night, unless something unexpected intervene. All manner of news (if I can remember any) I will tell thee when I come. Jane sent her love to thee in her letter of last night. <closer><salute>I am ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Wifie,</salute>
<p>I am to see thee again before leaving the Country. Alick and my Mother left this place on Saturday (before your letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> came) for Craigenputtock, where I am to meet them, our business being not yet finally arranged. If I prosper, I will see you at Templand on Wednesday; and, if I cannot persuade you home with me, set off next morning myself. I would not withdraw my good Jeanie from so sacred a duty, while she feels that she has such a duty to discharge; but I feel that the Edinburgh home will be no home without her.</p>
<p>My decided impression with regard to our poor Auntie is that <pb id="pg-04-351" n="04:351"/>Dr Maxwell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Maxwell (d. <date when="1834">1834</date>), M.D., a physician at Dumfries, who had been a member of the French Revolutionary National Guard and who was the descendant of staunch Jacobites of Dumfriesshire and Kirkcudbrightshire.</note> should be sent for again. Who knows but an Inflammation of the Liver, a disease curable by proper treatment, may be the cause of all these frightful symptoms? O for a Good Physician, were there such a one to be found! I have no grain of faith in Dr Russel<supplied>[l]</supplied>&#x2019;s theory; nor indeed in his seeing half an inch beyond the surface into the malady. Speak to your uncle of Dr Maxwell: while there is Life there is Hope.&#x2014; On Wednesday Night, or Afternoon!&#x2014; I carry this with me to Dumfries, and there put it into the Postoffice.&#x2014; I leave Scotsbrig, as I do all places, with sadness and regret; and can expect but a sombre day in my solitary ride, thro&#x2019; a solitary region, all sicklied over with the pale cast of memory,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, i.</note> and reflecting from every bush and crag some image of a time that will not come again, and looks far holier than it was while with me.</p>
<p>However when you read this, I am sitting by a peat fire among the moors, amid known kind faces that Providence has still mercifully spared me. It seems strange that one should ever <hi rend="italic">smile</hi> in this so hollow and fearfully encompassed scene!&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you all! I will see my wifie soon; and am and ever must be</salute></closer></p>

<p>Your sad Messenger is just arrived. I had again been cherishing Hopes, when the day of Hope was clean gone. Compose yourself, my beloved Wife, and try to feel that the great Father is <hi rend="italic">Good</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do nothing wrong, inscrutable and stern as his ways often seem to us. Surely, surely there is a Life beyond Death; and that gloomy Portal leads to a purer and an abiding Mansion.&#x2014; Suffering Angel!&#x2014; But she is now free from suffering; and they whom she can no longer watch over are alone to be deplored.</p>
<p>It seems uncertain to me whether I can be aught but an encumbrance at Templand: yet I feel called to hasten towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, at this so trying moment. I mean to set out for Dumfries (and order mournings), and be with you some time tonight. I am almost lamed for <pb id="pg-04-352" n="04:352"/>riding; so that it may be rather late (eight or nine o&#x2019;clock) before I can arrive.</p>
<p>My Mother is here; and bids me, with tears in her eyes, send you her truest love, and prayers that God may sanctify to you this heavy stroke. The World, she says, is a Lie; but God is a Truth, and His Goodness abideth forever.</p>

By a slow enough conveyance, this <foreign><hi rend="italic">K&#xE4;stchen</hi></foreign> [little box], with its medals in perfect safety, has at length yesterday come to hand; and now lays on me the enviable duty of addressing you.</p>
<p>Among its multifarious contents, the Weimar Box failed not to include a long Letter; considerable portion of which, as it virtually belongs to yourself, you will now allow me to transcribe. Perhaps it were thriftier in me to reserve this for another occasion: but considering how seldom such a Writer obtains such a Critic, I cannot but reckon it pity that this friendly interview between them should be anywise delayed:</p>
<p>&#x201C;<foreign>Sehen Sie Herrn Walter Scott, so sagen Sie ihm auf das Verbindlichste in meinen Namen Dank f&#xfc;r den lieben heitern Brief, gerade in dem sch&#xF6;nen Sinne geschrieben, dass der Mensch dem Menschen werth seyn m&#xfc;sse. So auch habe ich dessen Leben Napoleons erhalten, und solches in diesen Winter-Abenden und N&#xE4;chten von Anfang bis zu Ende mit Aufmerksamkeit durchgelesen. Mir war h&#xF6;chst bedeutend zu sehen, wie sich der erste Erz&#xE4;hler des Jahrhunderts <pb id="pg-04-353" n="04:353"/>einem so ungemeinen Gesch&#xE4;ft unterzieht und uns die &#xfc;berwichtigen Begebenheiten, deren Zeuge zu seyn wir gezwungen wurden, in ruhigem Zuge vor&#xfc;berf&#xfc;hrt. Die Abtheilung durch Capitel in grosse zusammengeh&#xF6;rige Massen giebt den verschlungenen Ereignissen die reinste Fasclichkeit [Sachlichkeit], und so wird denn auch der Vortrag des Einzelnen auf das unsch&#xE4;tzbarste deutlich und anschaulich. Ich las es im Original, und da wirkte es ganz eigentlich seinem [seiner] Natur nach. Es ist ein patriotischer Britte der spricht, der die Handlungen des Feindes nich<supplied>[t]</supplied> wohl mit g&#xfc;nstigen Augen ansehen kann, der als ein rechtlicher Staatsb&#xfc;rger zugleich mit den Unternehmungen der Politik auch die Forderungen der Sittlichkeit befriedight w&#xfc;nscht, der den Gegner im frechen Laufe des Gl&#xfc;cks mit unseligen Folgen bedroht, und auch im bittersten Verfall ihn kaum bedauern kann</foreign>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<foreign>Und so war mir noch ausserdem das Werk von der gr&#xF6;ssten Bedeutung, indem es mich an das Miterlebte theils erinnerte, theils mir manches Uebersehene nun vorf&#xfc;hrte, mich auf einen unerwarteten Standpunkt versetzte, mir zu erw&#xE4;gen gab was ich f&#xfc;r abgeschlossen hielt, und besonders auch mich bef&#xE4;higte die Gegner dieses wichtigen Werkes, an denen es nicht fehlen kann, zu beurtheilen und die Einwendungen die sie von ihrer Seite vortragen zu w&#xfc;rdigen. Sie sehen hieraus, dass zu Ende des Jahres keine hohere Gabe h&#xE4;tte zu mir gelangen k&#xF6;nnen. Es ist dieses Werk mir zu einem goldnen Netz geworden, womit ich die Schattenbilder meines vergangenen Lebens aus den letheischen Fluthen mit reichem Zuge heraufzufischen mich besch&#xE4;ftige</foreign>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<foreign>Ungef&#xE4;hr dasselbige denke ich in dem nachsten St&#xfc;cke von Kunst und Alterthum zu sagen, wo Sie auch einiges Heitere &#xfc;ber</foreign>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The following translation of the passage from Goethe&#x2019;s letter is from the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Sir Walter Scott</hi>, II, 483&#x2013;86: Should you see Sir Walter Scott, be so kind as return to him my most grateful thanks for his dear and cheerful letter,&#x2014;a letter written in just that beautiful temper which makes one man feel himself to be worth something to another. Say, too, that I received his Life of Napoleon, and have read it this winter&#x2014;in the evening and at night&#x2014;with attention from beginning to end. To me it was full of meaning to observe how the first novelist of the century took upon himself a task and business, so apparently foreign to him, and passed under review with rapid stroke those important events of which it had been our fate to be eyewitnesses. The division into chapters, embracing masses of intimately connected events, gives a clearness to the historical sequence that otherwise might have been only too easily confused, while, at the same time, the individual events in each chapter are described with a clearness and a vividness quite invaluable.<lb/><lb/>
I read the work in the original, and the impression it made upon me was thus free from the disturbing influence of a foreign medium. I found myself listening to the words of a patriotic Briton, who finds it impossible to regard the actions of the enemy with favourable eye,&#x2014;an honest citizen this, whose desire is, that while political considerations shall always receive due weight, the demands of morality shall never be overlooked; one who, while the enemy is borne along in his wanton course of good fortune, cannot forbear to point with warning finger to the inevitable consequences, and in his bitterest disaster can with difficulty find him worthy of a tear.<lb/><lb/>
The book was in yet another respect of the greatest importance to me, in that it brought back to my remembrance events through which I had lived&#x2014;now showing me much that I had overlooked, now transplanting me to some unexpected standpoint, thus forcing me to reconsider a question which I had looked upon as settled, and in a special manner putting me in a position to pass judgment upon the unfavourable critics of this book&#x2014;for these cannot fail&#x2014;and to estimate at their true value the objections which are sure to be made from their side. From all this you will understand how the end of last year could have brought with it no gift more welcome to me than this book. The work has become to me as it were a golden net, wherewith I can recover from out the waves of Lethe the shadowy pictures of my past life, and in that rich draught I am finding my present employment.<lb/><lb/>
I intend making a few remarks to the same purpose in the next number of <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi>. &#x2026; [Goethe&#x2019;s letter to TC is continued in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, p. 50.]</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-354" n="04:354"/>With regard to the Medals, which are as I expected the two well-known likenesses of Goethe himself, it could be no hard matter to dispose of them safely here, or transmit them to you, if you required it, without delay: but being in this curious fashion appointed as it were Ambassador between two Kings of Poetry, I would willingly discharge my mission with the solemnity that beseems such a business; and naturally it must flatter my vanity and love of the marvellous to think that by means of a Foreigner whom I have never seen, I might now have access to my native Sovereign whom I have so often seen in public, and so often wished that I had claim to see and know in private and near at hand. Till Whitsunday I continue to reside here; and shall hope that some time before that period I may have opportunity to wait on you, and as my commission bore, to <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> you these memorials in person.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Meanwhile I abide your farther orders in this matter; and so with all the regard which belongs to one whom I in common with other millions owe so much, I have the honour to be,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Sir, / Most respectfully your servant, /</salute></closer>
<name>Thomas Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Beside the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> medals specially intended for you, there have come <hi rend="italic">four</hi> more, which I am requested generally to dispose of among <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;wohlwollenden&#x201D;</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;well-wishing persons&#x201D;]. Perhaps Mr Lockhart, whose merits in respect of German Literature, and just appreciation of this its Patriarch and Guide, are no secret, will do me the honour <pb id="pg-04-355" n="04:355"/>to accept of one, and direct me thro&#x2019; your means how I am to have it conveyed?</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>You must look for a most pitiful Letter at present; embracing only the needful; for I am much pressed for time. We are sending back the Dumfries Paper-specimens; seeing we can get the article a good deal better here: I am writing to our architect<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their uncle, John Aitken.</note> at any rate, to get us a proper workman to paste up the Paper and inspect it when it comes; so I throw you in a few words also, especially as they can go without cost.</p>
<p>The most important thing I had to say, is that <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming down to the Craig at Whitsunday<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., term day, <date when="1828-05-26">26 May</date>.</note> first! Our house had been let here in our absence; and that of itself was sufficient to decide us. So see, my good Boy, to have all in the best order you can get it in!</p>
<p>We are still in great distress about a servant; but we have the prospect or offer of several; and surely among these we shall find some one to fit us better or worse for one half year. It is an awkward case; but nothing else than <foreign><hi rend="italic">hubble</hi></foreign> [tumult] is to be looked for throughout for a time.</p>
<p>Jane thinks that our proposed roofing-in of the pump may be postponed till after we arrive; especially as you have so much else to attend to. The most needful thing will be the inside of the house; and immediately next to that, the making of the road, and gravelling the front-door.</p>
<p>As to the main <hi rend="italic">turnpike</hi>, tho&#x2019; I have great faith in your activity and ingenuity, I doubt much if we shall get any help in our enterprize from the Dunscore Public: however, you will leave no stone unturned; and at the worst, it is but the old story: &#x201C;Man, help thyself&#x201D;! I suppose something <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be done before Whitsunday; or the Furniture carts will not be able to pass.</p>
<p>We have been talking about the Garden; and it seems to be agreed upon that there shall be a <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> all round, some five feet or so from the walls. If this can be of any service in your arrangement of the matter, well and good: but I rather incline to suppose there <pb id="pg-04-356" n="04:356"/>will be little done in that way. Meanwhile neglect not to plant us <supplied>[a]</supplied> store of early potatoes; to sow carrots, leeks, and all manner of greens, that there may be food for man and beast.</p>
<p>I am in a great hurry at this moment; and generally of late days in a troublous enough humour; being <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> in addition to my other cares: nevertheless, I cannot regret this <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> of our determining on Country life; and feel much inclined to augur good of it, were we once all settled. Where nothing but honest wishes and purposes exist, a prosperous issue may surely be hoped for. We all intend <hi rend="italic">well</hi>; we have all some inkling of sense to see what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> well: certainly some right relation will not fail to spring up among us; and with all necessaries of existence, we shall contrive to exist in peace and some degree of earthly comfort together. It has ever been my wish to live among those dear to me by nature: I cannot but hope that now it will be happily realized.</p>
<p>Besides Goethe&#x2019;s Letter which I received at Craigenputtock, there was the long-expected Box lying waiting for me when we returned hither at Leith. There are the Medals for Scott in it; Books, manuscript verses, trinkets for <hi rend="italic">the</hi> wife and a long and somewhat garrulous letter; all which you sh<supplied>[all see]</supplied> in time. I have to answer the Poet without delay; I have to distribute his presents; I have a Letter to write Jack, and Letters to his Librarians; and in short so many odds and ends to gather up, that I bid fair to be utterly tired of epistles before all be over. And then <hi rend="italic">two</hi> long Articles for Reviews;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first, the last he wrote at Comely Bank, was &#x201C;Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, II (<date when="1828-07">July 1828</date>), 80&#x2013;127; the second, not written until he was settled at Craigenputtoch, was &#x201C;Life of Heyne,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, II (<date when="1828-10">Oct. 1828</date>), 43764; both were reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays, Works</hi>, XXVI. Carlyle may refer however to the not yet abandoned article on Tasso.</note> of which I see not how above one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be ready before Whitsunday. But courage! Hard work is no-wise the hardest of evils; and there is a braw time coming for us to rest in. But enough for the present. Wish me well my dear Alick as I heartily do you. Best affection to <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their sister, Mary Carlyle.</note> whose present <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> received with high gratification. By the way, I should tell you that <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> conducted her housekeeping in the most <hi rend="italic">masterly</hi> style while we were absent: she is a shrewd little creature, as ever had a head. Tell our dear <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi>, that she must make arrangements for learning to sew, this summer; and I will see her thro&#x2019; the expence. She must and shall learn it; shall, if I can help her.&#x2014; But again good night!</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1828-03-01">1 March</date>. In this letter John said that the librarian at Munich had asked that Carlyle find out whether the Advocates&#x2019; Library in Edinburgh and the British Museum had duplicates which they would be willing to exchange for his, of which he said that he had 150,000. John also wrote: &#x201C;Your letters always animate me to more genial exertion, and I rise from the perusal of them with better feelings and better purposes. A letter from you is like a sunny spot amid the dim detail of every-day transactions, lighting up into brightness and poetry what seemed ready to degenerate into common-place. &#x2026; You have right in regard to Germany; I feel my mind awaken to kindlier influences, and find that there is something better in the world than the contemptuous indifference of Scottish Skepticism, something that can embrace it in all its bearings and yet see what is higher and worthier. I trust we shall live to see a better spirit in our own country also, in spite of the utilitarian, commercial, shallow philosophy which has the upperhand in these times, and I am vain enough to believe that my brother will contribute much to bring about that happy change. It seems to me as if this could be done only by one who has been trained up in Scotland, and who has studied its philosophy with fearless inquiry, and thoroughly understood, before he has begun to contemn it; who can think and write with Scottish clearness and German depth; for as shallow precision bears rule in our own country, so in Germany with all its pre-eminence there will be found a certain tendency to mystical speculation and extravagance among the multitude of its authors to which a Scotch education is the best and surest antidote. &#x2026; Two or three nights ago I saw Schelling, and he told me he had read it [Carlyle&#x2019;s article on the &#x201C;State of German Literature&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, <date when="1827-10">Oct. 1827</date>)], and was much satisfied with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Edelmuth und hohem Geist&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;nobleness and high spirit&#x201D;] in which it is written, and with the justice of your remarks on the German philosophy; but that some of the opinions which you had expressed regarding German Literature might be disputed.&#x201D;</note> has been long unanswered, and yet I may justly say this is the first moment in which I could with any propriety undertake the answering of it. I have been in Dumfriesshire for several weeks; and am only half thro&#x2019; the press of correspondence, which I found calling for immediate attention at my return four days ago. I had gone, and Jane with me, a very short while before your Letter of the <date when="1828-03-01">1st March</date> reached Edinburgh; and if you had seen Scotsbrig, Templand, or the Craig, all the time I was in those parts, I should not now need to tell you how impossible it was to write a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gepr&#xfc;ftes wort</hi></foreign> [expert advice] from any of the three. But you will have received a mass of tidings from us long before this time, by other conveyances; and will not have waited long for the present sheet, when, as I may hope, it shall find you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-358" n="04:358"/>Our errand to Dumfriesshire was twofold. I went thither principally to survey the state of matters at the Craig; Jane to see her Aunt at Templand, who was very sick; sick, as it proved, even unto death! Yes, that gentle soul is taken from us: she lingered, in great suffering, some two weeks after we arrived; and the third I saw her laid beside her Mother in the Churchyard of Crawfurd. How much all this must have shocked us, and deranged the purposes of those connected with us, you need not be told. Jane suffered and still suffers deeply tho&#x2019; in silence; and that house of mourning at Templand!&#x2014;there is something in the thought of it that still not only saddens but pains me. Our old Grandfather rose like a Giant from sleep when the stroke fell on him: but there was in that grim stony aspect of his a trouble to one more than the loudest lamenting. The Liverpool Brother, a solid blunt, true-hearted man, is returned home as well as we; and now Mrs Welsh and her Father are left alone; and how they are to fare together still seems a problem. Poor Jeanie! Meek good, long-suffering heart! For her I do not grieve: she is at rest in her still dwelling;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An echo from Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> (see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 154).</note> her fair image indestructible in our memories, and no sorrow or sadness can reach her pure spirit any more. But for the rest that still struggle in pain, and what is worse in blindness, in this vale of Tears, O Jack! It is they, it is we, that are to be pitied! God help us, and enlighten us in the way that we should go; and make us also ready, for the Hour cometh and is near at hand to us all!&#x2014; I must think no more of this; or my whole Letter will be little else than a Dirge.</p>
<p>At Scotsbrig, where I staid in all about a week, I found every thing as it might have been hoped and was wont to be. All were in health; our Father seemingly quite recovered in his general health, only complaining a little of weakness in his limbs, especially in one knee; and tho&#x2019; grave in general, yet fond of talking as ever, and rising into brilliant activity as he saw the sowing advance. Of our Mother I saw more; for Alick came down for seed-oats, and took her up in the cart with him to the Craig, where I lived with her at two times for several days; and only took my leave last Wednesday at Dumfries, whither the whole household of us, Mary included, had gone down a-marketting or a-travelling. She was well, even better than usual, and living harmoniously with Mag. I had many a long spell, reading them two and Jamie, sometimes also with Jenny and our Father, the Munich Letters, all of which I had brought down in my pocket. <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> meanwhile was here; keeping house, no less; and truly was found <pb id="pg-04-359" n="04:359"/>in this new department to have acquitted herself with <hi rend="italic">consummate</hi> address. She has gained the title of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die Kluge Schaffnerinn</hi></foreign> [The Wise Stewardess], partly borrowed out of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Helena.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The wise stewardess of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> is old and ugly. See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 168.</note> And thus, you see, they were <hi rend="italic">all</hi> well and in order. Of Alick I shall only add, that he has lost or rather left his Middlebie love,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rachel Ritchie.</note> as I think, forever and a day; yet seems no worse but better, and is even friendlier and shrewder than he was. He and I found your Letter (read, and sent down for us by <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>) at the Dumfries Post-office, the first day and the first hour I entered their market; and forthwith, at rather a quick step, we hastened with it to &#x201C;our inn&#x201D;; where private, yet in sight of the <hi rend="italic">dealing</hi> multitude, with each of us a glass of innocent beer and a well-going pipe of tobacco, I read it with &#x201C;<foreign>yen</foreign> audible voice.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Scotticizing of a phrase in the Anglican order of worship.</note> Alick admitted, I think, that your Letter to him, had made him &#x201C;greet.&#x201D; From him, from our Mother, and all quarters I was loaded with salutations to you; and assurance that if they <hi rend="italic">could</hi> write a letter worthy to go so far, they would do it with all their heart and all their soul. And so for the present, good Doctor, let this suffice you.</p>
<p>And now I must tell you somewhat of ourselves; concerning whom much might be said, had I room. We <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to commence a new sort of life: it is at length decided that we go to Craigenputtock this Whitsunday ! The house there already looks a world better, and the painters and paperhangers undertake to be gone from it before we come; so that only the out-of-doors part will require arrangement. I confess, I had many doubts and misgivings about removing thither for the present; and possibly enough, had our house here, conditionally given up before we left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, been still to let, we might have been tempted to engage it again, and stay here at least another year. But such was not the case: poor No. 21. was already let; so that no rational alternative remains for us. Accordingly Jane is out endeavouring to hire a fit servant; we are chusing paper-specimens; forwarding all plans of repair and adjustment; and six carts come hither in the <date when="1828-05">end of May</date> to transport us hence bag and baggage. Neither am I sorry that we have now so decided. I anticipate with some confidence a friendly and rather comfortable arrangement at the Craig; in the midst of which, not in idleness, yet in peace and more self-selected occupations, I may find more health, and what I reckon weightier more scope to improve and worthily employ myself, which either <pb id="pg-04-360" n="04:360"/>here or there I reckon to be the great end of existence, and the only happiness one has any right to look for or even to wish. At the Craig, then, our Munich Doctor will find us! And Dumfries may still be a station for him; and then, as we contemplated, we are all in sight of one another! So it has been ordered, and surely it is best so.</p>
<p>By this the Doctor infers that St Andrews is gone to the dogs. With the dogs in truth it is, and may be for me; seeing I have now no part or tot in it, and am like to have none. Dr Cook is as good as appointed; and all my most magnamimous Testimonials have been as music to the deaf. Goethe&#x2019;s certificate arrived while I was in the country: mustard after dinner; which these rough feeders shall not so much as smell! It also is a magnanimous Testimonial, beautifully written, and may elsewhere avail me. The old Sage fills a whole sheet with his <foreign><hi rend="italic">A&#xfc;sserungen</hi></foreign> [remarks]; of which not quite one leaf belongs directly to me; the rest being as it were <foreign><hi rend="italic">Erkl&#xE4;rungsbetrachtungen</hi></foreign> [explanatory observations]. Many things are mentioned <foreign><hi rend="italic">wodurch an den Tag gelegt wird, dass er auf einem originalen Grund beruhe, und die Erfordernisse des Guten und Sch&#xF6;nen aus sich selbst zu entwickeln das Vergn&#xfc;gen habe</hi></foreign>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Translation: By means of which it is made clear that his thought rests on an original foundation, and that he takes pleasure in developing the demands of the good and the beautiful out of his own being.</note> a praise which <hi rend="italic">He</hi>, could he appropriate it rightly, ought to value more than any Professorship in these parts. Tomorrow I am to write to the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weimarischeni</hi></foreign> [underscored twice]; for his Box also has now come to hand; with its medals for Sir Walter, its Books and Letters and verses for me; and beautiful trinkets, a bracelet, and the prettiest breast-pin, for Jane. Four other medals are here for distribution; which I think of conferring severally on Jeffrey, Wilson, Lockhart, Wordsworth: but have yet had time only for writing to Scott, who is at present in London. To a certainty you must come round by Weimar as you return, and see this world&#x2019;s-wonder, and tell us on your sincerity what manner of man he is, for daily he grows more inexplicable to me. One letter is written like an oracle, the next shall be too redolent of <hi rend="italic">twaddle.

It should be at Munich by this time: perhaps indeed you have already written to let me know that it is in your hands. It contained &#x201C;salt-information&#x201D; for Kleinschrod; and since then, only yesterday indeed, I saw the title of a Pamphlet on the &#x201C;Salt-laws,&#x201D; which I would buy for him, and send him if he liked.

It is little likely that either or both of these Establishments will be able nearly to exhaust such a mass of exchangeable ware; for with us 150,000 tomes make a handsome library of themselves. However something may be done; and willing and happy shall I be to forward it. Dr Irving himself is willing to exchange, so far as he can go: but the duplicates here were all sold off some years ago; and now, the Doctor thinks, they have only &#x201C;a few hundreds.&#x201D; However, he will look, <hi rend="italic">better.</hi></p>

<salute>Respected Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1828-01-01">1st January</date> reached me in due course of Post; awakening the gladdest anticipations, which however there was little hope of soon seeing fulfilled; for, owing to the state of the Elbe, our Hamburg Shippers seldom sail in winter; and in this case, no vessel was to be expected till the beginning of the present month. A second Letter, enclosing the Certificate I had requested from you, found me, some ten days ago, in the Country: and last week, after my return hither, the so long wished-for <hi rend="italic">Box</hi> did at length actually arrive, with all its contents in perfect entireness and safety. It is now my duty and privilege to acknowledge so many favours, yet with regret that I have done and can do so little to deserve them. Our best thanks are heartily yours: and with this may all be understood that could not in many words be expressed; for feelings of such a sort are at no time capable of being rightly translated into speech. To give glad hours to those that love us, tho&#x2019; &#x201C;over the Sea,&#x201D; must be the truest happiness; and here surely it is yours.</p>
<p>To Sir Walter Scott, who is at present in London, I have already <pb id="pg-04-364" n="04:364"/>written; announcing so delightful a message; and even transcribing for him what you say of his <hi rend="italic">Life of Napoleon</hi>; a friendly criticism which, from such a quarter, must gratify him highly, contrasted as it is with the frequent censure he has had to suffer on this head both from foreign and domestic readers. Already we have even a second <hi rend="italic">Life of Napoleon</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That published in four volumes in <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830">30</date> by William Hazlitt (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830">1830</date>).</note> also by a man of talent, where an altogether opposite spirit prevails; and which, if I may judge from appearances, must have been considerably applauded.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written to Jane on <date when="1828-02-27">27 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Do not forget to read Hazlitt&#x2019;s Life of Buonoparte, how entirely he has beat Sir W. Scott out of the field&#x2014;&#x201D;</note> Ere long, I expect to see Sir Walter, and present him your Medals in person. I know not whether you are aware that he too is a reader of German; nay that at the entrance of his literary life, he translated your <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tz von Berlichingen</hi>, to which circumstance many of his critics attribute no small influence on his subsequent poetical procedure.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott&#x2019;s translation of Goethe&#x2019;s play of <date when="1773">1773</date> appeared in <date when="1799">1799</date>. <hi rend="italic">G&#xF6;tz</hi> was the progenitor of the drama of <hi rend="italic">Sturm und Drang</hi> and set the tone in Germany, as Scott&#x2019;s translation did in England, for much romantic literature of chivalry. Scenes from the play influenced <hi rend="italic">Marmion, The Lady of the Lake, Ivanhoe</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Anne of Geierstein.</hi> Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXII, 15.</note></p>
<p>The other four Medals I shall also endeavour not rashly but worthily to dispose of. One I already think of bestowing on Mr Lockhart, Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s Son-in-law, whose love of German Literature, and debts to you in particular he has omitted no opportunity of acknowledging. And here I must not forbear to mention that Mr Lockhart certainly did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write that Essay on the &#x201C;State of German Literature&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>; as indeed he has never written aught in that Journal, and could not well write aught, being Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, a work directly opposed to it, and organ of the Tory party, as that other is of the Whig, or Liberal. If you have not already forgotten our dim notions on the &#x201C;State of German Literature,&#x201D; it must gratify me much to say that they are, in this instance, due to myself. The Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Jeffrey, in the <date when="1825-08">Aug. 1825</date> issue.</note> who himself wrote the Critique on <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, and many years ago admitted a worthless enough Paper on your <hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, XXVI (<date when="1816-06">June 1816</date>), 304&#x2013;37; XXVIII (<date when="1817-03">March 1817</date>), 83&#x2013;105. By Sir Francis Palgrave (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">1861</date>), British historian, knighted in <date when="1832">1832</date>.</note> is thought hereby to have virtually recanted his Confession of faith with regard to German Literature; and great is the amazement and even consternation of many an &#x201C;old stager,&#x201D; over most of whom this man <pb id="pg-04-365" n="04:365"/>has long reigned with a soft yet almost despotic sway. Let it not surprise you if I give one of your Medals even to him; for he also is a &#x201C;well-wisher,&#x201D; as one good man must always be to another, however distance and want of right knowledge may, for a time, have warped his perceptions, and caused him to assume a cold or even unfriendly aspect.</p>
<p>On the whole, our study and love of German Literature seem to be rapidly progressive: in my time, that is, within the last six years, I should almost say that the readers of your language have increased tenfold; and with the readers, the admirers; for with all minds of any endowment these two titles, in the present state of matters, are synonymous. In proof of this, moreover, we can now refer not to one but to two Foreign Journals, published in London, and eagerly if not always wisely looking towards Germany: <hi rend="italic">The Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, with the last of which I too have formed some connexion. Number First contained a sketch of your unhappy <hi rend="italic">Zacharias Werner</hi> from my hand: and here, since I began writing, has No. II. arrived, with a long paper in it, from the same unworthy quarter, on the Interlude <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>, with the promise of a still longer one, by the next opportunity, on your Works and Character in general!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, <date when="1828-07">July 1828</date>.</note> Nor am I without hope that these Criticisms, set forth with the best light and convictions I had, may meet with a certain tolerance from you. It is not altogether, yet it is in some degree with mind as with matter, in this respect; where the humblest pool, so it be but at <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> within itself, may reflect faithfully the image even of the Sun. For the rest, there must be more <hi rend="italic">Menaechmi</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plautus&#x2019; comedy by this name turns upon the resemblance between twin brothers.</note> among us than was supposed; seeing no one of those three Papers, mentioned in your Letter, was by me, and no two of them by the same person. That Article on <hi rend="italic">Hoffmann</hi> was written by Sir Walter Scott; the two others by young men of this city, one of them Editor of the Work;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser.</note> the other (Schulze&#x2019;s Critic) a translator of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi>, and my acquaintance.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Moir (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870">70</date>), who became professor of rhetoric and English literature at Edinburgh University (<date when="1835">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840">40</date>) and afterward Sheriff of Ross-shire. He was also professor of Scots law, Edinburgh University (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">65</date>). See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 85; and Ritchie, pp. 150&#x2013;51. His review of Ernest Schultze&#x2019;s poetic works appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, I (<date when="1827">1827</date>), 333&#x2013;58.</note> A worthless bookseller-dispute, now terminated, gave rise to this division into two <hi rend="italic">Reviews</hi>, which therefore to a certain <pb id="pg-04-366" n="04:366"/>extent, at least in the eyes of their Publishers, appear as rivals; tho&#x2019; among the Editors and Writers there seems to be no quarrel; and our English readers, deriving only benefit from this competition, view it with indifference or even satisfaction.</p>
<p>But I must not neglect to speak of Mr Des V<supplied>[o]</supplied>eux&#x2019; &#x201C;Translation&#x201D; of your <hi rend="italic">Tasso</hi>,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Torquato Tasso</hi>, from the German of Goethe: with other German Poetry translated by Charles Des Voeux, Esq.,&#x2019; dedicated to Goethe (1 vol., Longman and Co., <date when="1827">1827</date>). A second edition, revised and corrected, according to Des Voeux&#x2019; wish, by Ottilie, appeared at Weimar in <date when="1833">1833</date>. He [Goethe] died before the printing of this Weimar edition was completed&#x201D; (Norton&#x2019;s note).</note> concerning which you honour me by asking my opinion. Sorry am I to be forced unequivocally to call it trivial, nay altogether unworthy. No English reader can here obtain any image of that beautiful Drama; or at best, such an image as the rugged, bald and meagre school-versions of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> may give him of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>. More than once I had to turn to the original even for the meaning; nay in some instances the Author himself seems not to have known it; for <foreign><hi rend="italic">ich soll</hi></foreign> [I shall] is rendered (p. 69.) by <hi rend="italic">I will</hi>, thus expressing a <hi rend="italic">purpose</hi> instead of an <hi rend="italic">obligation</hi>; and (p. 78) <foreign><hi rend="italic">erreicht</hi></foreign> is mistaken for <foreign><hi rend="italic">darreicht</hi></foreign>, and translated not <hi rend="italic">attains</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">presents</hi>; to say nothing of <foreign><hi rend="italic">wacker</hi></foreign> everywhere translated by <hi rend="italic">valiant</hi> which means only <foreign><hi rend="italic">k&#xfc;hn</hi></foreign>; and <foreign><hi rend="italic">klug</hi></foreign> by <hi rend="italic">shrewd</hi> (properly <foreign><hi rend="italic">scharf, scharfsinning</hi></foreign>); <foreign><hi rend="italic">Faun</hi></foreign> (p. 60) by <hi rend="italic">fawn</hi> (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Rehkalb</hi></foreign>, probably a misprint); and (p. 77) <foreign><hi rend="italic">meine Hand</hi></foreign>! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schlag&#x2019;ein</hi></foreign>! by <hi rend="italic">My hand to shake</hi> (literally and properly, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hier ist meine Hand&#x2014;zu sch&#xfc;tteln</hi></foreign>!). Instead of general observations, I once thought of drawing your attention to some single passage; for example, to Antonio&#x2019;s truly graceful character of Ariosto, in Act I., to show in detail how the fine spirit has evaporated in the transfusion, and nothing remains to us but such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">caput mortuum</hi></foreign> [dead issue] as &#x201C;source of love or child of glory,&#x201D; &#x201C;talent&#x2019;s power&#x201D;; &#x201C;spirit-forms &#x26;c&#x2014;yet in person&#x201D;; and worst of all, &#x201C;in <hi rend="italic">juggle formed</hi> [<hi rend="italic">formed</hi> underscored twice] by sportive Cupid,&#x201D; which indeed is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">ne-plus-ultra</hi></foreign> both in sense and expression. But I have already occupied you too long with such a matter, concerning which nothing but your request could have authorized me to say one word. In short, this Translation is like our common Translations from the German; works which no reader of that language ever willingly looks into; passable, or at least only mildly condemnable when they deal with Kotzebues and Hoffmanns; but altogether <hi rend="italic">sacrilegious</hi> when they fix on <hi rend="italic">Fausts</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tassos</hi>.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi>,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In 6 vols.

On some future occasion it may avail me; tho&#x2019; for the present it was too late, and yet indeed early enough. Too late, because the Election had already terminated; early enough, because not even this, or any other earthly proof of mere <hi rend="italic">merit</hi>, could have made it terminate differently. But enough for once! <closer><salute>I shall again and still again hope to hear from so honoured a Friend; being now and ever,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You must long ere this be returned (I hope, safely) to your home, as we are to ours; and well do you deserve a Letter from your Children; which also I, the spokesman of the party, now mean in full measure to pay you. On Monday morning, after a long bout of Letterwritings to almost all quarters of the Earth, I have to begin an equally assiduous and still longer bout of Review-writing; so that tonight, if at all, in season, I must despatch your sheet. I am tired and dull: but that you will not mind much.</p>
<p>Jane and I had a pleasant enough drive into Edinburgh, the day after I parted with you: we arrived some time between eight and <pb id="pg-04-369" n="04:369"/>nine in the evening; and found all well at Comley Bank; only the fire a little low, and Ellen gone out &#x201C;seeking places&#x201D; (or rather <hi rend="italic">a</hi> place&#x2014;for the next half-year, which the poor slut has not yet found); so that it was some considerable space before <hi rend="italic">Tea</hi> could be raised, tho&#x2019; I was happy in firing a <hi rend="italic">pipe</hi> almost instantaneously. The &#x201C;wise young Stewardess,&#x201D; had sunk considerably into pecuniary embarrassments; but in all other points was well to live and happy; and had managed herself throughout with a degree of prudence and <hi rend="italic">gumption</hi> far beyond her years. Indeed, both Jane and I were surprised at the acuteness the little crow had displayed in all emergencies; and perhaps still more at the strange growth she had made in manner and bearing during our absence; for she seemed almost to have enlarged into a sort of <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> during that period of self-direction; and could not surely have improved so much at any boarding or other school or College during twice the time. She had employed her spare hours in knitting <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a sort of strange thrum-combination, which I think she calls bobbin-net or thread-net: this she is even now finishing at my hand, and will send you, I suppose, by the first opportunity; tho&#x2019; in all human likelihood, whent it is sent it will &#x201C;d&#x2019; ye neither ill no&#x2019; good.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, the expression of an Annandale cattle dealer. See Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 278&#x2013;79 n.</note> She really manages well; and seems to steer her way here with no ordinary sagacity.</p>
<p>The best of our news, at least the most important, since I parted with you, is that we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> coming down to the Craig this Whitsunday, to take up our abode there! This house was found to have been <hi rend="italic">let</hi> during our absence; and such a circumstance was sufficient to end our hesitation. Since we had to <hi rend="italic">flit</hi> any way, whither should we flit but to our own House in the Moor? We are coming down, then, against the term, to <hi rend="italic">neighbour</hi> you. Will you be good neighbours or bad? I cannot say, Mrs Carlyle; but I jealouse<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Distrust,&#x201D; said jokingly.</note> you, I jealous you!&#x2014; However we are to try; for Jane and I were out this very day buying Paper for these two Rooms, which is already on its way to Dumfries; and the Painters, we trust, are busy; and Alick and Uncle John doing great things, that the &#x201C;Mansion-house&#x201D; may be swept and smooth by the <date when="1828-05-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of May</date>, when we visit it with bag and baggage, we hope as a permanent home.</p>
<p>Another great uncertainty has been happily got over: I mean the hiring of a servant. We have got a Maid<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Macdonald, who proved to be an excellent servant.</note> engaged; a staid, discreet, <pb id="pg-04-370" n="04:370"/>active, decided looking personage from East Lothian originally, now serving in a family here; highly recommended to us, and who I think promises to do moderately good service in the household. This I always reckoned a great point; and naturally I feel some relief in seeing it so hopefully settled. The woman is above thirty, has known hardship, and is without ties to any particular spot, her parents and relations being all dead or dispersed: if we can manage her rightly, it seems to me that there is some talent in her.</p>
<p>And farther I must tell you of the arrival of Goethe&#x2019;s Box, with such a Catalogue of rarities as would perfectly astonish you. There was a bracelet and gold breast-pin (with the Poets <hi rend="italic">bust</hi> on a ground of steel), besides two gilt books for Jane; and for the Husband I know not how many verses and cards and beautiful volumes, the whole wrapped in about half a quire of German Newspapers. Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s Medals are not yet delivered, the Baronet being at present in London: but I have written to him announcing what lies here for his acceptance; and in some week or two I cannot but expect that I shall speak with the great man, and having delivered him my commission&#x2014;wish him good morning! To Goethe I have already written, to thank him for such kindness. He resembles Calendar Jardine surely in one particular: he is &#x201C;a queer man, yes, a very queer man.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Doctor also, if he had the gift of prophecy, might this very hour be looking for a letter from me; for one is already (since yesterday) steering across the German ocean to salute him. I told the man all and sundry about Scotsbrig and the Craig, and how you would one and all have written, had the flesh been as strong as the spirit was willing. I expect a Letter from himself one of these weeks: so soon as it arrives you shall have notice.</p>
<p>I am sorry to find that for the present there is no faith to be put in the <hi rend="italic">Examiners</hi>. They do not come regularly, indeed not at all; for we have only had three yet in whole; of which the two last came <hi rend="italic">together</hi>, at quite an unexpected time. One of these I sent off to you, old tho&#x2019; it was. When Fraser comes hither from London, we shall try to settle it on a better footing. Meanwhile you can now and then (Jenny can) keep asking; for as the Papers chance to reach me, I will send them, that the &#x201C;ganz wohl&#x201D; may content you from time to time. If none come, why then I will <hi rend="italic">write</hi>; and after Whitsunday you will not only hear of me but see me &#x201C;many a time and oft,&#x201D; if Larry&#x2019;s feet do not fail him. Were the Doctor once settled in Dumfries, we should all be together, and as snug as people need be, at least if we had any wisdom.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-371" n="04:371"/>I hope your husbandmen have fairly done sowing, and planting: all is under clod here, and the weather indifferently good, tho&#x2019; rather sharp when dry.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>We are not without hopes of getting a Letter from you on Friday morning to tell us how matters progress at the Craig; but lest there should be any disappointment, indeed whether or not, I must write to you tonight, for the time is approaching, and our movements ought to be arranged.</p>
<p>As I am excessively busy with my Reviewing (in which I prosper as badly as may be, being <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>) I shall restrict myself at present to the rigidly needful: we shall have time enough soon to discuss everything with far more freedom.</p>
<p>You would get the Paper<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wallpaper.</note> almost a fortnight ago, and a little Note along with it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> The parcel was directed to our Uncle; and as I <pb id="pg-04-372" n="04:372"/>have heard no word, I infer that the whole tale of <hi rend="italic">Pieces</hi> [lengths of wallpaper] was complete, and everything as it should be.</p>
<p>The next point to be considered is that of the <hi rend="italic">flitting.</hi> Our term day falls a day earlier than yours, on Sunday come a fortnight; but of course there can be no entrance effected by our Successor till the Monday following. The process of packing, and stowing is to begin very soon; so that all may be in some degree of readiness for throwing on the carts when you arrive. But here a rather important consideration occurs: how the sufficient stock of carts is to be obtained? They promised two from Scotsbrig; we counted also on two from Templand, and the rest from the Craig. But now, it appears, neither two nor even one from Templand can be had: there is no such thing either as a roadworthy vehicle and horse there, or a roadworthy man! Yet somehow or other <hi rend="italic">five</hi> carts, as we calculate, must be come at; nay we are still in doubt whether six may not be required. We judge thus: it took two carts and a half, and a waggon drawn by two strong horses, to bring the articles from Haddington; and we have got the grates &#x26;c in addition, a sideboard on the other hand being wanting. You can judge from this, as well as I: but I should think <hi rend="italic">five</hi> carts might do.</p>
<p>To get us these five carts and appear with them on the ground, we trust of course to our general Provider, Alick of the Craig. Will you consult with Jamie (I do not think I need write to him; for it will be necessary that you should see him), and adjust the business between yourselves? Have not you <hi rend="italic">three</hi> horses? Surely some way or other, you will raise the required number. Sufficiency of straw should be brought in them for <hi rend="italic">loading</hi> the articles (they will be packed in mats &#x26;c before you come); and that, I think, is all <hi rend="italic">we</hi> want you to bring.</p>
<p>The next thing to be considered is the time. As I mentioned already, we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> stay here till Monday the 26<hi rend="italic">th</hi>: but it will create a dreadful hurry, and besides throws you under the necessity of staying over sunday by the road. We reckon it would be better were you to come earlier, so that we might have &#x201C;a&#x2019; by&#x201D; the previous week. If Jemmy and you were to arrive on the Wednesday night or so, you might load on Thursday, and be at the Craig on Saturday Night. This <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can manage, and as it will save expense perhaps it may be better, but you and he can judge. The only thing is to let us know in time. The servant maid, we suppose, will have to go down with the other baggage: she has a pair of limbs, and seems to be a shifty sort of character.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-373" n="04:373"/>I know not if you are aware of the stages on the road but you will soon learn. You Craigenputtochers come by Elwanfoot,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Twelve miles northwest of Moffat.</note> Crawfurd, Chesterhall<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eight miles from Crawfurd and six miles from Biggar.</note> (a solitary inn), Biggar, and then you have two roads, by Noblehouse or by Bridgehouse, of which both have been lately repaired and are very smooth, but perhaps the first is better and rather longer. If you take this <hi rend="italic">first</hi> track, your road comes upon Jemmy&#x2019;s some five miles before you reach Noblehouse; and you and he by timing matters might contrive to meet before you came to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, so that the <hi rend="italic">stranger</hi> might not be apprehensive. Biggar is about thirty miles from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and a town such as Lockerby; Crawfurd is some twelve miles nearer you. The roads I believe are <hi rend="italic">very good</hi> all the way after you cross the Nith.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Alick, if you can unravel what I have here put down, I believe there is in it the most of what it concerns us that you should know in this business, which you will now be able to adjust of yourself. Write to us, as soon as possible, at farthest next Wednesday, to say how it is settled, and on what day we are to expect you; for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> doubtless will require to be among the number to watch over such a cargo on such an expedition. Doubtless we shall get <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> this, as one gets thro&#x2019; so much, and then we may look for quieter times. Write to us, then, the sooner the better.&#x2014;&#x2014; We are all well, as you may have guessed from my omitting to say the contrary: I am struggling only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> thro&#x2019; a long string of a story for the London Review.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, II (<date when="1828-07">July 1828</date>), 80&#x2013;127.</note> We have not heard a word of Jack; but I am not very impatient yet, for I think he must be waiting for the Leith parcel,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A box from home, which Carlyle had mentioned in his last letter to John.</note> which would travel rather leisurely. How is your Dear little Missus? Has she arranged about her sewing? Best love to her from all of us&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are thinking that if the Kitchen grate is still <hi rend="italic">to set</hi>, it may be as well to put in an <hi rend="italic">oven</hi> at once: suppose you bought that secondhand one we saw at Lonsdale&#x2019;s, as cheap as you could? But is the chimney-head on, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">reek</hi></foreign> surmounted? We hope and pray that it may be so. And how fares it with the painting, the papering, the roadmaking &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c? Alas! poor Alick! There is no rest for the wicked,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 48:22.</note> nor the righteous either, in this world.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am eve<supplied>[r]</supplied>your affectionate Brother&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Will you have to ride down to Scotsbrig, and adjust the thing by <pb id="pg-04-374" n="04:374"/>speech with him.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jamie.</note> In that case I need not write. Perhaps (only <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>) I shall be writing to our Mother at any rate. Fail not to let us hear from you.</p>
<p>I think you had better get a <hi rend="italic">bell</hi> hung in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> room too; to divide you from the <hi rend="italic">rabble</hi>.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>What a selfish monster you must have thought me, to trouble you with Books and other trifles at such a time! It was only yesterday that I heard the bad news;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;bad news&#x201D; appears to have been concerned with Inglis&#x2019; financial losses.</note> and truly I may say that since then they have been little out of my head.</p>
<p>To speak of hope and comfort were but impertinent: nevertheless will you allow me to say that in my humble view this very misery may be the means of greater blessing to you than anything that has ever befallen in your history. I know what I am saying. It is not with such a mind and character as yours that soft nursing will profit: Neither is he miserable that is poor; but he that is frivolous and selfish, and a lover of Pleasure rather than of Truth. Take courage, such as you have it in you, and be a <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>, and it matters little, really very little, whether you ride in triumphal chariots or earn your morsel of bread by the sweat of your brow. And yet it is hard, hard; and I sympathize with you from my heart; and you will say all this is <hi rend="italic">words</hi>, and see no meaning in it. But one day you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see meaning in it, and find that I spoke <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, and that even <hi rend="italic">this</hi> suffering was necessary for you, and the root of richest blessings. God bless you, and guide you thro&#x2019; joy or pain to become what you are capable of being, yet what it will cost you much to be!</p>
<p>Write to me, so soon as you can. I will call again; but scarcely
hope to see you. Irving&#x2019;s Note<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>About six weeks ago, I had the honour to write to you, announcing the arrival of a small present from the Poet Goethe, and transcribing for your perusal his compliments and thanks for the <hi rend="italic">Life of Napoleon</hi>. I wished and purposed, as my orders bore, to <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> you that present; but receiving no reply, I must now be content to forego such pleasure. Mr Jeffrey takes charge of delivering these <hi rend="italic">medals</hi>; and next time I write to Weimar, I hope I may be able to say that you have received them safely.</p>

<p><name>Thomas Carlyle.</name><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was unquestionably disappointed and hurt by the failure of Scott to acknowledge his earlier letter. What had appeared to be a highly auspicious opportunity not only to meet Scott but also to have delectable conversation about Goethe with him had come to naught.

<salute>My Dear Murray,</salute>
<p>I write as usual only to give you trouble. In the confusion of removal, the inclosed highly essential piece of Paper was by mistake stuffed into a trunk, and packed before it was missed into the very centre of a cart overloaded with luggage. The Forbes Bank has no Agent in Dumfries; and the cashing of the Receipt thro&#x2019; any other Bank seems to be a matter of difficulty and some expence. The consequence of all which, you see, is that I apply to you, as the most punctual, trustworthy and obliging man whom I have left behind me in Edinburgh; and must request you to take the trouble of helping me out of this difficulty. I have indorsed the Receipt; you take it to Sir Will. Forbes&#x2019; Bank, and draw the whole cash (&#xa3;300, with the interest first of &#xa3;460, then of 400, then of 300, for the times therein specified); which having done, you pay the said cash into the Commercial Bank, with the direction that it be handed over to me on Wednesday at their Office in Dumfries. Whether any <hi rend="italic">document</hi> from the Commercial Bank may be needful I cannot say: I understand that they are always ready for such negotiations, whereby their own Notes may get in circulation; and transact these things punctually enough by means of <hi rend="italic">private</hi> orders communicated once a week: but if a stamp is essential, get one, deducting the cost of it, and of this postage (which I am striving, tho&#x2019; with uncertain hope, to make <hi rend="italic">single</hi>); and send it down to me, so that it may reach Dumfries on Tuesday night, and the business be transacted next morning. Otherwise write to me (without enclosure); and tell me that you excuse me for this application; that you have done the business, and how you have done it. Doubtless you will excuse me: and I shall find your Letter out and dry awaiting me at the Post office on Wednesday Morning.</p>
<p>This is &#x201C;the needful&#x201D; at present; and with this for the present I ought to stop; since to describe the chaos out of which we have come, into which we alighted, in which all and sundry of us have as it were been swimming for life, these last weeks, would <supplied>[small tear: be no]</supplied> easy or useful task. Painters, carpenters, masons, smiths, are thundering <pb id="pg-04-377" n="04:377"/>and splashing on all sides of us; and it is only with difficulty that we have established a temporary lodging in two upper bedrooms, from which we sally forth vigorously enough into the Empire of Night, thro&#x2019; which, however, only the faintest dawn of Order can still be discerned to glimmer. God help us! And keep all mortal sinners from flitting! However, the time of Arrangement and Peace must come; and when all this is swept and garnished, a man will be able to sit down and smoke a pipe under his own Elm tree, and none to make him afraid. <supplied>[O Mur]</supplied>ray! how we poor sons of Adam are shovelled to and fro! Do you r<supplied>[emem]</supplied>ber when we walked together, you escorting me, to the fifth mile-stone on the Dumfries Road?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When Carlyle left Edinburgh, at the conclusion of his studies in <date when="1814-05">May 1814</date>, to go to Dumfries.</note> Two young pilgrims; yet even then the Future looking stern and fateful in our eyes!

Well, let us travel cheerily, for after all it is a brave journey; the great Universe is around us; Time and Space are ours; and in that City whither we are bound, it is said, there &#x201C;are many mansions.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 14:2.</note></p>
<p>But why do I moralize and meditate when that red horse is scraping at the door? I am bound to Dumfries for the purchase of grates. You will write to me, and help me in that Difficulty: and one day you and your<supplied>[s]</supplied> will see us here, all green and clear, like an <hi rend="italic">oasis</hi> in the wold. Remember me in kindest regards to your lady. I had arranged to call and say farewell; but we went a day earlier than had been counted on: and then the very night before we left Town, when I still meant to call with Mitchell, strangers came in, and letters were to write, and I could not get away.&#x2014; By and by I mean to trouble you about Books.&#x2014; For the present enough!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your old Friend&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>We received your much-longed-for Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Munich on <date when="1828-05-05">5 May</date>. In it John acknowledged receiving the longexpected parcel from Carlyle containing books, letters, and newspapers. He also wrote: &#x201C;After all my prattling about Schelling and his lectures, I must confess, at the conclusion I found that I had not understood him, and that, setting aside the wholesome and spirit-stirring exercise which I often found in following him, his philosophy was a lost philosophy for me. But I often wish that circumstances would permit me to spend a year or two in Germany in order to get acquainted with its philosophy; and at present, undiscouraged by former bad success, I hear the summer lectures of Schelling on the philosophy of mythology which he began last week. &#x2026; Schelling tells me he will first publish his lectures on Mythology, and intends them to be a sort of preparation to his other lectures which will be afterwards printed. &#x2026; I hope my Essay on Animal Magnetism will be ready to send with the parcel next month, for I have now first set seriously to work; and have the necessary apparatus all around me. The greatest difficulty I have had has been to find Books on the subject. The Bookseller&#x2019;s shops have hitherto been very bad here, and it is only a month or two more since Gotta [Cotta?] established himself in Munich; so that it was not easy to find materials sufficient for giving a view of the present state of Animal Magnetism in Germany. &#x2026; Poor Dequincey! your description of his situation is truly affecting. Poor Wilson! he has not chosen the better part, but has offered up purity and truth and freedom, for that false &#x26; hollow joy which he derives from his revelries, his toddy and riot. You will not lose very much in leaving the literary gentlemen of Edinburgh in general, for you must ever steer a different course from them.&#x201D;</note> two days before leaving Edinburgh; in a scene of such chaotic uproar as I had never witnessed, <pb id="pg-04-379" n="04:379"/>and do earnestly hope I shall never witness again. For the house was full of mats and deal-boxes and straw and pack thread; and there was a wrapping and a stitching, and a hammering and tumbling; and Alick and Jamie came with six carts to take away our goods; and all things were wrenched from their old fixtures, and dispersed and scattered asunder, or united only by a common element of dust and noise. What would the sack of a city be, when the dismantling of a house is such! From all Packers and Carpenters, and Flittings by night or day, Good Lord deliver us!</p>
<p>I have waited here, above two weeks, in the vain hope that some calmness would supervene: but Painters and Joiners still desecrate every corner of our dwelling; and I write in the middle of confusion worse confounded, as better than not writing at all. We have arrived at Craigenputtoch, and found much done, but still much to do; we must still ride and run with carts and saddle-horses to Dumfries every second day, and rejoice when we return if the course of events have left us a bed to sleep on. However, by the strength of men&#x2019;s heads and arms, a mighty improvement is and will be accomplished; and one day as we calculate a quiet home <hi rend="italic">must</hi> stand dry and clear for us amid this wilderness; and the Philosopher will hoe his potatoes, in peace, on his own soil, and none to make him afraid. Had we come hither out of whim, one might have sickened and grown melancholy over such an outlook: but we came in search only of health with food and raiment, at least of the latter two without it; and will not start at straws. Away then with <foreign><hi rend="italic">Unmuth und Verdruss</hi></foreign> [vexation and ill-humor]! Man is born unto trouble, unto toil, as the sparks fly upwards: let him toil therefore, as his hest is, and make no noise about the matter. Is the day wearisome; dusty and full of <hi rend="italic">midges</hi>, that the galled limbs are like to fail?</p>
<lg><l><foreign><hi rend="italic">Ein guter Abend kommt heran</hi></foreign></l>
<l><foreign><hi rend="italic">Wenn ich den Ganzen Tag gethan</hi></foreign>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A good evening comes if I have worked the whole day long.&#x201D;</note></l></lg>
<p>Next evening after the arrival of your Letter, I wrote to Messrs Black Young and Young, Booksellers, London (of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>), directing them to pay twenty out of forty pounds, which they had ordered me to draw on them for, into the hands of Messrs Ranson <pb id="pg-04-380" n="04:380"/>and Co to be <hi rend="italic">re</hi>paid to the Baron von Eichthal at Munich. I wrote <hi rend="italic">two</hi> letters<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> on the subject, and endeavoured to impress them with the necessity of speed and punctuality; so that as they are men of business, I can hope that the money may have reached you almost by this time; at all events, that you will be able to inform me of its safe arrival when you answer the present Letter. I told the Blacks also that perhaps you might send a little packet of Books by Frankfort a. Mayn to their care; which if you have not already sent them off otherwise will probably be the best plan, now that I am away from Leith and its customhouse, which at any rate is said to be the most villainous establishment of its kind in the British Empire. I told the Blacks farther that along with this parcel might probably come an <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> for their <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>. I meant the Article on <hi rend="italic">Animal Magnetism</hi>: this you will direct: &#x201C;W. Fraser Esq<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 64. Pall Mall, London&#x201D;; and mention to him simply that you are my brother, and this Paper is for him; <hi rend="italic">supposing</hi>, let us understand, that the Paper <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there and ready, which it must be confessed is a proviso that may be &#x201C;doubted.&#x201D; However, if you cannot get it forward, do not take the matter to heart: the wells of thought will flow better in the Doctor&#x2019;s head some future day; at least &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Naiter and Airt working together</hi>&#x201D; will make them flow, or I am no Prophet. The grand thing at present is the want of money; but this we shall try to front some other way. I sent these Booksellers a long Paper on Goethe for their next, still unprinted Number; the Forty Pounds was for an Essay on his <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>. I meant to send them another piece (on the Life of Heyne) for this Number: but where is the cunning that could write a Paper here, in the middle of uncreated Night?&#x2014; But I am getting very sick, and must leave you till after dinner, and go <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> some rows of peas which are already flourishing in our &#x201C;new Garden.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x2014;Alas, Jack! There is no sticking of peas for me at this hour, the cutting-tools being <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in active operation elsewhere; so I sit down to talk with you again, still <foreign><hi rend="italic">impransus</hi></foreign> [without eating], tho&#x2019; better in health than I was an hour ago. Indeed, I have been on the whole in considerably better health ever since I came hither, and found my red-chestnut Irish Doctor (tho&#x2019; ill-saddled) waiting for me in his stall. By degrees I do think I shall grow as sound as another man; and then when the German Doctor is settled within sight of me at Dumfries, and we see him twice a-week, and all is fixed on its own footing, will not times be brighter than they have ever been <pb id="pg-04-381" n="04:381"/>with us! One blessing we have always to be thankful for: unity and brotherly love, which makes us tho&#x2019; a struggling still a united family. And are we not all spared together in this wonderful Existence, still to hope as we struggle? Let us ever be grateful to the Giver of all Good; and struggle onward with good heart in the path He directs. Some traces of our presence may also be left behind us in this pilgrimage of Life; some grains added to the great pyramid of human Endeavour: what more has man to wish for?</p>
<p>So long a space has elapsed since our last Letter, that considerable store of news must have accumulated in the interim, did I know rightly where to find, and how to arrange them. Of the Craig o&#x2019;Putto I cannot yet rightly speak till we have seen what adjustment matters will assume. Hitherto, to say truth, all prospers as well as we could have hoped: the house stands heightened, and white with roughcast; a tight hewn porch in front, and canns on the chimney-heads; and within, it seems all firm and sound; during summer as we calculate, it will dry, and the smoke we have reason to believe (tho the grates are not yet all come) is now pretty well subdued: so that on this side, some satisfaction is to be looked for. We appear also to have been rather lucky in our servants. An active maid came with us from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; a dairy-woman, also of good omen, comes to us tomorrow from Thornhill; and a thoroughgoing out-of-doors good-humoured slut of a byre-woman was retained after half a year&#x2019;s previous trial. Then we have two sufficient farming men; and a bonnetted stripling, skilful in sheep, from this glen. Alick himself is an active little fellow, as ever bent him; and tho&#x2019; careworn, is diligent hearty and compliant: he lives in his little room, which is still but half-furnished like the rest of the house; yet peculiarly favoured in the blessing of a grate. Mary has been visiting at Scotsbrig, and is now learning to sew at Dumfries: she resides for the present with her Aunt Jenny, but speaks of making some other arrangement with some Bonairick Cousin, who also would fain be perfect in needlework. Jane (the lesser) has taken her place here, and furnishes butter and <hi rend="italic">afterings</hi> (<foreign><hi rend="italic">jibbings</hi></foreign>) for tea, tho&#x2019; we are still in terrible want of a <hi rend="italic">cheeseboard</hi>, and by the blessing of Heaven shall get one tomorrow afternoon. Jane (the greater) is surveying all things, proving all that she may hold fast what is good: she watches over her joiners and painters with an eye like any hawk&#x2019;s, from which nothing crooked, unplumb, or otherwise irregular can hide itself a moment. And then to crown our felicity, we have&#x2014;two fowls hatching in the wood&#x2014;a duck with twelve eggs, and a hen with (if I mistake not) eleven; from which, for they are properly <pb id="pg-04-382" n="04:382"/>fed and cared for, great things are expected. Nay it was but three nights ago that we slew a Highland Stot, and salted him in barrel; and his puddings even now adorn the kitchen-ceiling!</p>
<p>At Scotsbrig I have not been; but Mag was here when we arrived, and Jamie was here yesterday, and is to return for Kelton-hill in two weeks; and Scotsbrig was all pretty much as it should be; and your Letter had been duly received, and all good wishes were as usual sent to you daily, in thought or word. Grahame also, it appeared, had got his Letter, and was well contented therewith. And now, adding only that &#x201C;Johnnie Macaw,&#x201D; surely the dirtiest man in Nature, paid Jane a complimentary visit the other day, and that we and the Parish together <hi rend="italic">are</hi> actually gravelling that <hi rend="italic">mile of road</hi>, I must conclude my summary of country news.</p>
<p>From Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, or other peopled quarters of the world, I have yet heard nothing. We left Edward Irving there, preaching like a Bo<supplied>[a]</supplied>nerges,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221220-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1822-12-20">20 Dec. 1822</date></ref>.</note> with (as Henry Inglis very naively remarked) &#x201C;the town quite divided about him, one party thinking that he was quite mad, another that he was an entire humbug.&#x201D; For my own share I would not be intolerant of any so worthy man; but I cannot help thinking that if Irving is on the road to truth, it is no straight one. We had a visit from him, and positively there does seem a touch of extreme exaltation in him: I do not think he will go altogether mad, yet what else he will do I cannot so well conjecture. Cant and Enthusiasm are strangely commingled in him: he preaches in steamboats and all open places, wears clothes of an antique cut (his waistcoat has flaps or tails midway down the thigh), and in place of ordinary salutation bids &#x201C;the Lord bless you.&#x201D; I hear some faint rumour of his outheroding Herod<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, III, ii.</note> since we left the North, but we have not yet got one newspaper, and know nothing positive. So &#x201C;the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lawrt</hi></foreign> bless <hi rend="italic">him</hi>!&#x201D; for the present; and if you pass thro&#x2019; London on your return, you are engaged to go and see him, and I think he said, abide with him, or tarry with him on your way.&#x2014; The last two nights we spent in Edinburgh were spent&#x2014;where think you? In the house of Francis Jeffrey; surely one of the kindest little men, I have ever in my life met with. He and his household (wife and daughter) have positively engaged to come and pay us a visit here this very summer! I am to write him an article on Burns, as well as one on Tasso: but alas! alas! all writing is yet far from my hand. Walter Scott I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see, because he was in London; nor hear of, perhaps because he was a busy <pb id="pg-04-383" n="04:383"/>or uncourteous man; so I left his Goethe-medals to be given him by Jeffrey. Lockhart had written a kind of <hi rend="italic">Life of Burns</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Life of Robert Burns</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1828">1828</date>).</note> and men in general were making another uproar about Burns: it is this Book (a trivial enough one) which I am to <hi rend="italic">pretend</hi> reviewing. Farther, except continued abuse of Leigh Hunt for his <hi rend="italic">Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries</hi>, there seemed no news in &#x201C;The Literary world,&#x201D; or rather Universe, for was there ever such a <hi rend="italic">world</hi> as it has grown?</p>
<p>And now, Jack, allow me to ask thee one plain question? When is thy broad face to be turned homewards, and how? Specify, specify; for all and sundry are inquiring. Has Herr von Lichtenthaler got his Letter, and written another to Oxford? Did you see Becker? He is gone to Italy as a sort of travelling Physician. What says Schelling, what does the Doctor now think of him?

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have been purposing to come and see you, long; but am going to accomplish it now. Jane (little <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>) and I will come down, on ponies, possibly about the end of this week, or the beginning of next; in fact so soon as the wet weather seems to give us promise of a tolerable day to ride in. Then shall you hear all our news; and a long string there should be of them by this time. I have scarcely a moment to write in; for Alick is about setting off: but what need is there? Believe that for the present we are all well; that you are very soon to see us (I hope) and hear answers to whatever you can ask. <closer><salute>With best love to all, I am always,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>&#x201C;My dear dear Angel Bessy&#x201D;!!!</salute>
<p>What a world of trouble is in these words announced to you! In fact my tea is done, and my coffee is done, and my sugar white and brown; and without a fresh supply of these articles my Husband would soon be done also: it might be got at Dumfries&#x2014;but bad; and so I have bethought myself of your kind offer to do my commissions as of old, and find it come more natural for me to employ <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in this way than another.</p>
<p>To proceed then, at once, to business; that so I may afterwards proceed with freedom to more grateful topics: will you order for me at Polland&#x2019;s in North Hanover Street (nearly opposite Miss Grey&#x2019;s) two stones of brown sugar at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and one stone&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> brown at 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#xBD;; as also a small loaf of white at 12<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014;with five pounds of ground rice. Then Angel Bess you must not go home by the Mound but rather along the Bridges that you may step into the new tea establishmen<supplied>[t]</supplied> <pb id="pg-04-385" n="04:385"/>in Waterloo place and get me four pounds of tea at five and four pence per pound&#x2014;two pounds at seven shillings&#x2014;and two pounds of ground coffee at two shillings&#x2014;this the Cockneys must be instructed to wrap up in strong paper and carry to Pollands addressed to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle Craigen &#x26;c &#x26;c And you will have the goodness to tell Polland before hand, that such a parcel will be sent to him to forward along with his sugar&#x2014;and that he must pack the whole nicely up in a box and send it to the first Dumfries carrier addressed to me to the care of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aitken Academy Street Dumfries. Now one thing more thou Archangel Bessy you will pay these things (somewhere about 4 pounds as I calculate) in the trembling hope of being repaid by the earliest opportunity&#x2014; And unless it goes hard with me I will take good care that you are not dissappointed&#x2014; The truth is I have no five pound note to send you and four small ones would make rather a bulky letter&#x2014; And here you may draw your breath as I do mine; for I have nothing farther to trouble you with except on recollection half a pound of Dickson&#x2019;s mustard; not even a long-winded apology for the trouble already given.</p>
<p>By this writing you will know that I have survived my astonishing change&#x2014;and the talk about tea &#x26;c will show you that I even look hopefully into life. Indeed Craigenputtoch is no such frightful place as the people call it: till lately indeed our existence here has been made black with smoke; and confusion unspeakable was nearly turning our heads. But we are begin<supplied>[n]</supplied>ing to get a settlement made at last; and see a distinct prospect of being more than tolerably comfortable<supplied>[.]</supplied> The solitude is not so irksome as one might think. if we are cut off from good society, we are also delivered from bad; the roads are less pleasant to walk on than the pavement of Princes Street but we have horses to ride; and i<supplied>[nstead]</supplied> of shopping and making calls I have bread to bake and chickens to hatch&#x2014;I read, and work &#x26; talk with my Husband and never weary.</p>
<p>I ride over to Templand occasionally; and my Mother and Agnes Ferguson were here last week<supplied>[.]</supplied> They seemed content with the aspect of things. but my Mother is so confined at home now! she cannot be absent one night, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> home, I fear is no peaceful place for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> I am sadly vexed about her she is looking so ill and so unhappy.</p>
<p>You will write and tell me how all is going on at 22 and in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> generally. dear Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I was very happy there; and shall always love it and hope to see it again often and often before I die&#x2014; Will you give my kind regards to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Simpson<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18230121-JBW-EA-01">JBW to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, <date when="1823-01-21">21 Jan. 1823</date></ref>.</note> when you see him and tell him I was <pb id="pg-04-386" n="04:386"/>well pleased to hear of his success. Remember us also to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aitken and most affectionately to your Uncle. Do you know of any good Habit maker in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (not very expensive)? I have got fine cloth for a habit and am almost afraid to risk the making of it in Dumfries. Perhaps you could make enquiry for me and let me know the charge. and whether a habit could be made from a pattern gown or <foreign>peliss</foreign>. Grace Macdonald<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their servant brought down from Edinburgh.

<salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Jane being from home these two days, visiting her Mother, I made bold to open your Letter last night; especially as I saw that it was yours, and had &#x201C;with speed&#x201D; on it. My first duty is to thank you and Mr Montagu, with warmest gratitude, for your continued kindness to me, and remembrance of my interests now when I have been long out of your sight, nay of late am as it were &#x201C;dead in law.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter to Carlyle of <date when="1828-08-13">13 Aug.</date>, Mrs. Montagu had written: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Montagu has just told me that two professorships are vacant in the London University one for the Philosophy of the Human Mind, and the other the History Professor.&#x201D; She urged Carlyle, &#x201C;Who is a philosopher, and has always been a Teacher,&#x201D; to apply for one of them.<lb/><lb/>
M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>. Montagu had also written to Jane on <date when="1828-07-12">12 July</date>. The passages which follow are from that letter: &#x201C;How often have I asked myself where are my friends, keeping their open night for the Wits of the Modern Athens, or astonishing the simple residents of Craigenputtock, by insisting upon paint, Whitewash glazed windows, and divers and sundry newfangled notions of comfort, never before heard of among the moors of Dunscore.&#x2014;I can fancy your Husband, more erect, and breathing more freely in the bosom of Nature, than dandled in the most flattering and fondling manner, by her spurious Sister, Art; I often fancied his bitter laugh, and indefinable motion of one shoulder, as if to shake off the load of vexation which the follies or faults of others laid upon his back, that bitter laugh, which was more than once raised at my expence, and which I heeded no more than the proud scorn of my own wilful Charles, except so far, as it discovered the hurt, and wounded state of the mind&#x2014; One day when he was elbowing off some proffered kindness of mine (half-touched and half incredulous) I was seized with an irresistible fit of laughter, he reminded me so much of a stubborn child, who having been deceived more than once by some nauseous medicine administered with fair speeches and a shew of kindness, shuts his mouth resolutely against the next sugar plum that is offered to him&#x2014; This capricious poet is once more among the Goths, a banished man, but with his Nut-brown maid, who is prepared to meet and to share all evils, to assist all noble enterprize, and to forget every petty annoyance in the proud delight, of making her Husband forget them too&#x2014; Oh glorious triumph over all the petty evils of life when the Wife&#x2019;s sweetness makes sunshine in the most dense atmosphere&#x2014;her voice, music in the desolate wilderness&#x2014;ordinary food a banquet by her neat serving&#x2014;stuff, velvet, by her handsome wearing&#x2014;sickness endurable, by her tender nursing, and misfortunes, trode down, by her patient yet lofty bearing&#x2014; This is the true field for the Wife&#x2014; Gay assemblies are for the heartless Coquette, who may be outshone there, by any painted Harlot, but solitude and sorrow, and sickness, can only be made happy by the Wife. &#x2026; Why does not your Husband translate some pretty German Tale, or write one, for some of the Souvenirs, which Walter Scott, and Southey &#x26; Wordsworth do not disdain to enrich with their works&#x2014; One of them has already had <supplied>[1?]</supplied>0,000 Copies subscribed for at a Guinea, or 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi> a Copy&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle can tell you the enormous profit this must leave&#x2014;they give good prices I am told&#x2014; Coleridge &#x26; Wordsworth are gone to Germany near to where Goethe resides&#x2014;they will of course see him&#x2014; One of my dissappointments has been seeing very lately, Cooper, the American&#x2014;who has so well described the &#x2018;Last of the Mohicans&#x2019;&#x2014;how bitterly he has awaken&#x2019;d me from the dream in which I pictured him, not as to person, for that I did not care about, but as to mind and manner and cast of thought&#x2014; I found him rude, irritable, a very Yankee, with all the little pride of a little mind&#x2014;the very reverse of every thing he has described in his Books&#x2014;querulous about paltry things, fond of precedence as a woman&#x2014; I felt just as people do, who gaze at a fire-rocket, and think it a Comet, and come in time to have their heads broken by the falling stick&#x2014;he seemed very much inclined to quarrel with me, and if nobody had been by, might very likely have beaten me&#x2014;perhaps this was more than he was equal to, but he looked as if he could pinch or bite&#x2014;perhaps he was annoyed by some other person, and I came in for the fray&#x2014;this is probable, for there were five or six professed authors who might have baited him on the score of his Country which Englishmen have a bad practise of doing. &#x2026; tell your good husband that an obstinate temper induces me to go on loving him as heretofore, with the least encouragement ever given to mortal woman. &#x2026;&#x201D;</note> In the <pb id="pg-04-389" n="04:389"/>next place, I must remind you, for surely I understood you to know already, that I actually was, many months ago, as good as a candidate for that very office of Moral Professorship; in which quest too, it is needless to add, I nowise succeeded. About this time twelvemonth, I had much talk on the subject with Mr Jeffrey, who, being one of the most friendly men now breathing, entered zealously into the matter; wrote twice to Brougham about it, and receiving no answer, besieged the great Lawyer in person for a whole day, in &#x201C;six assaults,&#x201D; I think he said, to the same effect, and with the same discouraging result. Brougham fought shy, and even to his most intimate companion would give no definite reply. I myself was willing to have travelled as far as Penrith, and spoken with the man, at great length on the subject: I was even anxious to have stood forth before so influential a person in my natural figure; and said to him: Here am I, Sir; the man my stars and I have made me, so weak and so strong as you see; I have a message to my fellow men on this very subject to Moral Philosophy: can I be allowed to deliver it from your pulpit, or must I seek myself some other?&#x201D; It even struck me that I might make rather a good Teacher in this department; for I actually felt that I not only <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> but <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> and <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> some little regarding it; there seemed to be a <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> in me; which there or elsewhere I must and would deliver. &#x201C;Elsewhere,&#x201D; Mr Brougham seemed to think would be better; <pb id="pg-04-390" n="04:390"/>and I knew not but he was right. At all events, it was clear that nothing more was to be said or done on the subject <hi rend="italic">by me</hi>; so, being thus gently waved away from the arena, I turned my face elsewhither, and since then have heard or said or thought little more about the business.</p>
<p>Not long ago some new light was thrown on that hitherto almost invisible obstruction, and I had farther confirmation in my system of indifference. Charles Buller, a good pupil of mine, had, as he informed me, been endeavouring to strengthen my interest with Mill;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mill. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280307-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1828-03-07">7 March</date></ref>.</note> but was met by information that &#x201C;I was a mystic, and <hi rend="italic">altogether</hi> inadmissible.&#x201D; Now, God knows I am no mystic, but have a clear Scotch head on my shoulders, as any man need, and too strong in logic and scepticism rather than too weak: however once for all these good souls (Leonard Horner<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270913-JWC-JAC-01">JWC to JAC, <date when="1827-09-13">13 Sept. 1827</date></ref>.</note> thinks so too) are possessed with this notion; and how can I or any mortal influence drive it out of them? Nay, is it not true, and clear as day, that I do reckon Jeremiah Bentham no Philosopher, and the Utilitarian system little better than the gross Idol-worship of a generation that has forsaken and knows not the &#x201C;Invisible God&#x201D;? And will these &#x201C;silver-shrine-makers,&#x201D; can I hope, give me their conviction, or even give me hearing? Will they not &#x201C;cry the more, for the space of two hours,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen. &#x2026; But when they knew that he [Paul] was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians&#x201D; (Acts 19:24, 34).</note> let the Townclerk reason never so plausibly?</p>
<p>On the whole I could not pretend much anxiety about that Professorship; as indeed for many years I have been learning to feel less and less about all terrestrial arrangements whatsoever. Food and raiment surely I shall get in this world; and, as I profess to believe, it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> nothing more that a true man cannot give to himself. Nevertheless, happy enough to have at length in some measure discovered my true vocation, and nowise blind to the dangers from without and from within that beset a man isolated from his fellow-men, I applied, as you know, for another office of the same sort; preferring even St Andrews to utter solitude. To the St Andrews Electors I was recommended by Saint and Atheist, by Poet and Philosopher, Tory and Whig; Jeffrey wrote a Letter which itself (had it been half true) might have got me any Professorship in this Kingdom; nay I have still, unpresented, a Testimonial in three pages from the wisest living man,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe.</note> <pb id="pg-04-391" n="04:391"/>which I prize more than any patent in the Herald&#x2019;s Office. The St Andrews Professors thought a certain Dr Cook would be more suitable: and I accordingly came hither; still bent on &#x201C;professing Morals,&#x201D; in one shape or another, but from a <hi rend="italic">chair</hi> of my own, and to such audience as I myself could gather round me.</p>
<p>And now, my dear good Madam, after this heroical narrative, you see as clearly as myself all that I mean and think in regard to this London or any other Professorship. Has any change taken place in their views with regard to me or their office, I am ready at an hour&#x2019;s warning to treat with them, to give and take the fullest explanation; and will accept that or any such service, with purpose to labour truly in it, so soon as it appears that I, and not some altogether different man, am wanted there. After all this, I need hardly add that I think <hi rend="italic">no</hi> such change can have taken place: for I heard from Mr Jeffrey only two weeks ago, and nothing was <supplied>[said]</supplied> or hinted on that matter. Judge ye! And if it seem of any consequence, let me <supplied>[hear instant]</supplied>er. But I believe it will be of none.</p>
<p>So much for business properly so called. Will you, some time when you can save an hour from such &#x201C;business,&#x201D; call forth all your charity, and write me a long Letter, of the sort I used to read three years ago? Kind it is in you not to forget me; yet it is a kindness not unrepaid. O why is the spirit of man so often jarred into &#x201C;harsh thunder,&#x201D; when sweetest tones of melody may be awakened from its strings! Why do we not always love, and why is the loved soul shut out from us by poor obstructions, that we see it only in glimpses, or at best look as from a prison-grate and into a prison-grate! Surely, surely, in that other country, &#x201C;they order matters better.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Poor Charles!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu had written on <date when="1828-08-13">13 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Charles is labouring under the same stomach disease that afflicted M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Badams says in a greater degree&#x2014;dear Boy, how he is afflicted,&#x2014;the derangement of the stomach affects the Optic nerves so that he sees nothing in a just proportion, or truly.&#x201D;</note> What a sore fight, at the very entrance of the battleground! Yet who knows whether it be not better? Pain, incessant Pain, is a stern monitor: but it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a lesson to teach us, a lesson which we cannot learn too soon. The Hebrew Psalmist prayed that he might not fall into the hands of men but of God:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the Lord; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man&#x201D; (I Chron. 21:13).</note> and is it not as well to learn the nothingness of Life, and man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">true</hi> strength and glory, in youth as in old age? In the silent school of Disease, as in the noisy school of Business, from false men and weak men and thousand times <pb id="pg-04-392" n="04:392"/>repeated disappointment? Of late years I begin to be even thankful for my sickness: you speak of it in the past tense, &#x201C;suffered&#x201D;; but you might have used the present and the future; I believe I shall never more have health. I required it all, for I was a fool; and so does your Charles: yet at times it is hard for us. I do not love this clay tenement of mine: I think were my little Task once done, I could be well enough contented to <hi rend="italic">flit</hi>. But <hi rend="italic">Whither</hi> [underscored twice]?&#x2014; Whither I am <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi>, should it even be <hi rend="italic">Nowhither</hi> [underscored twice]. God bless you always!</p>
<closer><salute>&#x2014;Your affectionate Friend, /</salute></closer> <name>Thomas Carlyle</name>

<p>Are you thinking you are never to see my sweet face anymore? Indeed this long self-banishment may well surprise you; but when you hear how I have been forced to stay voluntarily<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210604-TC-JBW-01">TC to JBW, <date when="1821-06-04">4 June 1821</date></ref>.</note> you will excuse it.

Wallace Hall was near Closeburn, Dumfriesshire.</note> do not like fresh air, and I get sick in a carriage without it: accordingly by the time we reached Wallace Hall that night, what with their close mode of travelling, and Miss Anderson&#x2019;s green tea I found myself ready to faint. I hoped a sound sleep would put me all to rights; but no sleep was to be had; and the morning found me entirely demolished. <hi rend="italic">In a case of this sort</hi> to walk to Templand seemed an impossibility and the Bundel-carriage was gone to <pb id="pg-04-393" n="04:393"/>Dumfries to fetch old ladies. Mr Anderson (the Minister) was very pressing that I would join my Mother and Agnes at his house at Dinner and so I stayed, simply because I was unable to go away. My Mother was almost frightened into fits when she found me sitting &#x201C;like a picture&#x201D; in the room where she was put to take off her shawl. Well I had yawned over the forenoon; I almost groaned over the afternoon, and at length was landed at Templand little more than alive. For once my Mother succeeded in persuading me that I was very bilious and must submit to be treated accordingly. And so I have been spending half the days in bed&#x2014;taking physic even <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi>, brandy also to a considerable extent and various other items &#x201C;which I am told are to do me good.&#x201D; In a few days I shall be returned to you a well physiced Goody; On Sunday perhaps you could send William for me with the horses, by which time I expect to have tried the water at Moffat Wells!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A spa famous for its medicinal waters, just over a mile NE of Moffat.</note></p>
<p>Meanwhile the business I came about is not neglected; Agnes wrote away to Glasgow the other night so that the curtains &#x26;c might be sent by the Carrier on Friday. I have ordered them not of chintz but moreen which is against your taste, and hardly according to my own, but the latter article proved on inquiry to be far the thriftier as well as the most comfortable, and therefore the best adapted for our purpose.

<p><pb id="pg-04-394" n="04:394"/>Is there any letter from Jeffrey<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey had written on <date when="1828-08-01">1 Aug.</date> to say that he was leaving next day for Loch Lomond.

<salute>My dearest Jane</salute>
<p>I was meaning to write you a long letter by Alick: but I have been in bed all day with headach<supplied>[e]</supplied>; and am risen so confused and dull, that for your sake as well as my own I shall keep my speculations (news I have none) till another opportunity&#x2014;Merely dispatching in few words a small piece of business I have to trouble you with which will not wait.</p>
<p>My Mother is wanting a woman at next term to take charge of her few cattle, work out, and assist at the washings. Not wishing to hire one out of Thornhill she has requested me to look about for her. and would have liked Betty Smail whom I formerly recommend<supplied>[ed]</supplied>, provided she had been leaving the Andersons&#x2014; But I was happy to find (having been the means of placing her there) that she is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> leaving them, and continues to give great satisfaction by her honest careful obliging character&#x2014;</p>
<p>Miss Anderson happened to mention to Betty that I had been inquiring about her for my Mother&#x2014;when she suggested that her Sister Jean who is out of place might possibly answer&#x2014; You know this Jean&#x2014; Is she still disengaged? would she be willing to come? and do you think she would be fit for the place&#x2014; That you may be better able to <pb id="pg-04-395" n="04:395"/>form a judgement in the matter I must tell you my Mother has already <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Jean who is <hi rend="italic">a favorite</hi> of some standing&#x2014;and you know there is not house-room at Templand for <hi rend="italic">two favorites</hi> at once.

<salute>My Dear Brother Jack,</salute>
<p>I write to you at present in no ordinary anxiety; impelled to do so by my own feelings and the importunity of almost every friend you have. It is near four months since I had a Letter from you!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On this very day Dr. Carlyle was writing to his brother Thomas. He says that he had been going through a period of great dejection.</note> Surely you that were wont to be so punctual a correspondent must have fallen into some strange perplexity that we do not hear of you. More especially even as there was a <hi rend="italic">money affair</hi> to be looked after, if any such poor stimulus had been needed for your writing. About three days before Whitsunday, and the day after receiving your last letter I sent off an order to London; and have some months ago received the following document: &#x201C;London, <date when="1828-05-27">27 May 1828</date>. Received, for Baron von Eichthal, Twenty Pounds, to be accounted for on demand. (For Ransom and Co) <hi rend="italic">W. Tomlin</hi> [underscored twice].&#x201D; By your Letter to Alick, which arrived here about the <date when="1828-06">end of June</date>, it appeared that you <hi rend="italic">had not</hi> at that time received this sum; tho&#x2019; I wrote at large some ten days after coming hither, and specified that transaction among others. What on Earth can have befallen? For you tell Alick that you would answer any letter of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, as if that other letter to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> had not been sent. Every post-day these five weeks we have been waiting with more or less eagerness; which of late has amounted to a really painful solicitude. Heaven grant that it be only some fit of business or indolence or indecision! Alick and I hide our anxieties; but you may guess how our Mother is feeling. My only comfort is that had you been seriously <hi rend="italic">sick</hi>, or otherwise in distress, the Baron would have written to me. And my only resource is to write to yourself, ignorant as I am of your present movements, and even abode (for by this time perhaps you are <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> again); and to beg of you for the love of Heaven, wherever you may be, provided it be in a civilized country where a sheet of paper or even a banana-leaf is to be had by purchase begging or theft, to let us have news of you without loss of one moment. This is the sum total of my petition, and indeed the gist of this whole Letter. I would not exaggerate painful possibilities; nay <pb id="pg-04-397" n="04:397"/>many a time our unbelieving imaginations have been belied, as we hope they will still be this time: but twelve hundred miles, you will observe, is a long distance; and misfortune lies in wait for all the sons of Adam. Heaven grant our Doctor were safe home among us, and curing disease on his native soil! It is our Mother&#x2019;s prayer, and every one of us joins in it.</p>
<p>You spoke of some parcel of Books coming from Munich; and sometimes it strikes me that you may have written by these, and calculated on their arriving, not after many months, but after a few weeks. I wish I had known in time to bid you send them &#x201C;to the Address of Mr F. L. Horbig [I think]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are Carlyle&#x2019;s.</note> Bookseller in Leipzig; he is our (Black Young and Young&#x2019;s) Agent; and will forward it with other things to us by Post.&#x201D; I had told these people of it, and also of a probable <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> from you for their <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article on &#x201C;Animal Magnetism&#x201D; for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, edited by William Fraser, V (<date when="1830">1830</date>), 96&#x2013;124.</note> but on this last, I suppose, they have not reckoned. The truth is, as you see, your whole history has of late become involved to us in inscrutable mystery. By this we expected to have known that you were almost on your return to us; for your summer classes must have terminated before now: and in Alick&#x2019;s last letter, you talk of &#x201C;liking to spend <hi rend="italic">another</hi> year in Germany, <hi rend="italic">if you had the means</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John says in his letter of <date when="1828-08-25">25 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;The Baron wishes me to stay with him during next winter also, but this I shall not think of doing and indeed have told him as much. I shall find some nook which I can call my own where I can live in freedom however frugally.&#x201D;</note> O Jack! thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 26:24.</note></p>
<p>But not to trouble you with any more of these regrets and sorrows, let me try if I can find any word of news to tell you; of which necessary you too must be getting somewhat short. Heaven be praised, I have still comfortable tidings to send you of all your friends at both <hi rend="italic">homes</hi>: Jemmy was here this week (Saturday, Sunday, and went on Monday); carting down the half of a fierce Bull, now no longer mischievous, but beneficent, not assaulting husbandmen, but nourishing them with other than babes&#x2019; meat: and from Jemmy we heard nothing but good. Little Jean and I, moreover, were at Scotsbrig some three weeks ago, for a few days: our Mother seemed to be even rather better than her wont; and all the rest about as well. Of other persons I spoke with none but Grahame, and had a short note from Ben Nelson wherein he inquired minutely after you. Rachel Ritchie <pb id="pg-04-398" n="04:398"/>is <hi rend="italic">married</hi>, and to Jock of Relief.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></ref>. &#x201C;Relief&#x201D; was a farm near Hoddam.</note> &#x201C;What the Deevil,&#x201D; as Sandy Corrie<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a neighbor near Scotsbrig.</note> said, &#x201C;was the use of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> keeping a man carrying <foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddifuls</hi></foreign> [gutter-fuls: underscored twice] of water all summer from the Brantith well, to cure a <hi rend="italic">swelling</hi>, and she in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> state,&#x201D; namely far gone in the family way? The laughter and the spite and malice were considerable there; for the world is the world, in Middlebie as in London. Farther, poor Wull Tait<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another neighbor.</note> was killed in the head of Scotsbrig ground, by the rushing in of a <foreign>quarry-<hi rend="italic">brow</hi></foreign> [quarry-edge]. He called to his neighbour to run; but was too old and stiff to run himself, and so sank in the flood of rubbish, and died that afternoon. Thus does Fate play its pranks; and everywhere there is Comedy and stern Tragedy if there be men. The Scotsbrig moor was as grim an arena for poor Wull, as Trafalgar for Nelson, or L&#xfc;tzen for Adolphus; and the Spirit of the Universe equally beheld it; and in His eye it was of equal moment.</p>
<p>I have heavy news of your old friend Duncan Church; which tho&#x2019; long since commissioned to tell you, I still hesitate to send, for they are still in some measure uncertain, that is, undecided. One night about five weeks ago, returning late from Templand with Jane, I found a Letter which had lingered a fortnight by the road, from Church of Kirkchrist: it bade me tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that Duncan had taken a bad cold, which being neglected had grown into an inflammation of the lungs; that his mother had gone up to London to watch over him; but that the best watching and utmost efforts of medical skill had been in vain; and the Father &#x201C;trembled for the next letter, having scarcely a ray of hope.&#x201D; I wrote back next day, making the most earnest inquiries; and received for answer next week a letter which seemed to indicate that no very decided change, indeed no change at all for the better, had taken place; except indeed what I could infer from the fact that poor Duncan still lingered in life. Every day since then I have looked for intelligence: but none having come, I conclude that nothing decisive has yet happened; and often hope the best: I send you the sad circumstance as I had it myself. Poor Duncan! He was a worthy lad; and, I will still trust, ma<supplied>[y]</supplied> be spared to do good and see good on the Earth.</p>
<p>As for ourselves at Craigenputtoch we are still struggling, as men must ever strugg<supplied>[le]</supplied> with the perversities of existence; but in as manful a manner as we can. It has been judged best to build <hi rend="italic">another</hi> house, where Alick and his Agriculture may go on apart altogether <pb id="pg-04-399" n="04:399"/>from this establishment. Accordingly four walls do actually now stand, fronting the east, exactly at right angles to the direction of the Barn, in front of the Millshed, and on the spot where the stackyard used to be.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s cottage still stands at Craigenputtoch.</note> Stumpie Cottage has been taken down to help to build it and cover it. Weeks ago the place should have been <hi rend="italic">inhabited</hi>: but torrents of rain, and of ill-luck have kept us back, and the Slater only came yesterday. We reckon nevertheless that it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get finished at last, and be a very fair kind of house. Mary and Alick are to keep it, and <hi rend="italic">we two</hi> shall live here; much more commodiously for all parties. Mary has been at Dumfries all summer; but is here for these some days manipulating <hi rend="italic">wool</hi>, and is to return back &#x201C;for good&#x201D; next week, as our harvest is commencing. In this mansion itself we have had a battle like that of St George and the Dragon; neither are we yet conquerors. Smoke and wet and Chaos! The first we have subdued, the last two we are subduing. May the Lord keep all Christian men from flitting! As to Literature, which also is breadmaking, I have done nothing, since whitsunday, but a shortish paper on <hi rend="italic">Heyne</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, which will appear in No. 4.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1828-10">October</date>.</note> A long Article on <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi> is just publishing in No. 3,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1828-07">July</date>.</note> which has been (for want of cash, I believe) exceedingly delayed. And at this very date, I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> busy, and third part done, with a &#x201C;fair full and free&#x201D; Essay on <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1828-12">December</date>.</note> a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of that Poet having appeared by Lockhart. None can say how bilious I am and am like to be. But I have begun to ride daily on Larry, and so Jeffrey <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> have his <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> at the appointed time. That wonderful little man is expected here very soon with <foreign><hi rend="italic">Weib und Kind</hi></foreign> [wife and child]! He takes no little interest in us; writes often, and half hates half loves me with the utmost sincerity. Nay he even offers me in the coolest lightest manner the use of his <hi rend="italic">purse</hi>, and evidently rather wishes I would use it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Proh De&#xFB;m atque hominum fidem</hi></foreign> [Ah, faithful to God and man]!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Terence, <hi rend="italic">Andrea</hi>, I, v, I. 246.</note> This from a Scotchman and a Lawyer!&#x2014; Jane is in considerable trepidation, getting the house fully equipped for these <date when="1828-08">august</date> visiters. Surely I think she will succeed: nay already we are very <hi rend="italic">smart</hi>. Here is a drawingroom with Goethe&#x2019;s picture<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had sent Vogel&#x2019;s portrait of Goethe to Carlyle.</note> in it, and a <hi rend="italic">piano</hi>, and the finest <hi rend="italic">papering</hi> on the walls; and I write even now, behind it, in my own little Library (once Alick&#x2019;s bedroom and sitting-room); <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of <pb id="pg-04-400" n="04:400"/>which truly I can see nothing but a barnroof, tree-tops, an empty hay-cart, and under it perhaps a stagnant midden-cock with hens, overfed, or else <hi rend="italic">dazed</hi> with wet and starvation; but <hi rend="italic">within</hi> which I may see a clear fire (of peats and Sanquhar coals), with my desks and books and every accoutrement I need in the fairest order.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This room, not much changed today, is where Carlyle later wrote <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> Shame befal me, if I ought to complain, except it be of my own stupidity and pusillanimity! Unhappily we still want a front-door <hi rend="italic">road</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">lawn</hi> is mostly a quagmire, however harvest <hi rend="italic">will</hi> end. Several weeks ago I had a long letter from Goethe, inclosing another from Dr Eckermann his Secretary full of commendations and congratulations about my criticism of his <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi>. I ought to have written long ago, but cannot and must not till I have done with <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi>. If you pass within any manageable distance of Weimar, you will surely wait upon this sage man. Seriously I venerate such a person considerably more, not only than any King or Emperor but than any man that handles never so expertly the <hi rend="italic">tools</hi> of Kings and Emperors. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sein Excellenz</hi></foreign> already knows you by name, and will welcome you in his &#x201C;choicest mood.&#x201D;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, quoting Edward Irving.</note> By the by, can you get us a Lithograph of <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>, anything like this of Goethe? But I must not enter on commissions, my paper being as it is. Did you hear of the horrible accident at Kirkcaldy: Irving was going to preach there, and the kirk fell and killed eight and twenty persons. &#x201C;What thinkst <hi rend="italic">a</hi> he means,&#x201D; said my Father, &#x201C;gawn up and down the country <foreign><hi rend="italic">tevelling</hi></foreign> [raging] and <hi rend="italic">screaching</hi> like a wild bear?&#x201D; Heaven only knows completely. Walter Welsh wonders they do not &#x201C;lay him <hi rend="italic">up</hi>&#x201D; [imprison him].<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving had been due to preach for his father-in-law at Kirkcaldy parish church on <date when="1828-06-15">15 June 1828</date>, and 2,000 people crowded into the building (built in <date when="1807">1807</date>), thought to be fit for about 1,800. Irving Street, Kirkcaldy, was so named in honor of the occasion. Just before the service started, a gallery collapsed and about 27 of the congregation were killed and many more injured. Irving was partly blamed, for having attracted so many to hear him, and his attempts to help clear the wreckage were indignantly rejected by the crowd.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am very tired with writing all day, and it is now half past eleven o&#x2019;clock: nevertheless I must write you a few words before I go to sleep; for a <hi rend="italic">Letter has just this minute arrived from Jack</hi>!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter of <date when="1828-08-25">25 Aug.</date> previously cited. Dr. Carlyle mentions Vienna as one of the places where he feels that he should spend some time before coming home.</note> The man, William, brought it from Dumfries, and will take this down tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Doctor is well in health; but seemingly somewhat afflicted in spirit; the old demons Pride and Poverty being at work with him. He has received the Twenty Pounds; but most part of it, he says, was already spent in clothes &#x26;c. The Baron continues very friendly to him: <pb id="pg-04-402" n="04:402"/>but the Doctor&#x2019;s proud stomach has evidently for many months been getting highly squeamish on the subject of <hi rend="italic">dowrying</hi> [living on gifts]; and now he has determined he says to quit the Baron&#x2019;s house (altho&#x2019; he has even pressed him to continue), and to spend &#x201C;the winter&#x201D; elsewhere. And where? think you. At Scotsbrig, the Craig, or Dumfries? No such matter! In Germany, where he proposes to subsist by teaching English, and translating German books for the London Booksellers! I declare I am sorry for the Doctor, and angry with him. This foreign jaunt of his has cost him a round sum of money, and seems to have taught him no new wisdom; not a whit abated his love of vagrancy, or opened his eyes to the necessity of settling down as a quiet professional man. He talks of the Baron&#x2019;s having offered him a &#x201C;Letter of Credit&#x201D; to any amount; and of this being a great accommodation; as if the worthy Doctor had some landed property, or annuity in this country to draw upon, and pay that &#x201C;Letter of Credit&#x201D; whenever he pleased! After all, I believe, he is partly sorry for his German jaunt; and wishes he had let it alone: yet with his usual sagacity, is not for abandoning it, the sooner, the better; but for staying yonder till he can come home with more pomp than in this half-bankrupt condition.</p>
<p>I am rather at a loss what to do. My first feeling is to write instantly, and advise him home forthwith, nay <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> him to come, if he would not quarrel with every one of his friends here; and to make no more use of the Baron&#x2019;s &#x201C;credit&#x201D; than what is necessary for bringing him hither. But it strikes me on the other hand that the Doctor has a spice [small quantity] of delirium in him, which perhaps there were no better way to cure than even letting him try to fight his own battle where he is, for a season. No mischief can readily happen him; and I believe, if he once felt the true pinch of want, he would be a wiser man all the rest of his days. However, I still rather think it will be better to take the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> plan. At all events, I can do nothing for a week; being so terribly busy: indeed in about a month I expect to hear from the Doctor again; for there is a letter for him which he will receive in about a week, and has promised to answer when it arrives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my dear Mother, do not disturb yourself about the youth; for evidently he is in perfect health; and ails <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, except from the old Devil&#x2019;s-disease, haughtiness of heart.</p>
<p>I expect to be down ere long; perhaps in a week or two: I will bring the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter with me. Jeffrey is coming hither very soon: <pb id="pg-04-403" n="04:403"/>it may be I shall not get away till he is gone. I am in my usual state of health; better than usual with me when I am writing.</p>
<p>The rest of us are all in our usual way; except that Alick had some touch of sore-throat yesterday, which he has cured, he thinks, by a sound&#x2014;dose of Epsom Salts. Only we are in such a confusion, as to out-of-doors work, as you have seldom seen. The shearing could be finished in about a week, were not the weather broken: but there are masons, and joiners, and flaggers and hewers and plasterers; and all is swashing and swattering [splashing and spattering] in extremity of bustle, which is tolerable o<supplied>[nly]</supplied> because we do hope it will be done soon. It is one great mercy, surely, that we are all spared in health. So let us fight away as long as we <foreign><hi rend="italic">dow</hi></foreign> [are able], and fear no colours!</p>
<p>This night also, Hugh of Hawick&#x2019;s stockings (for Jane and me) are come to hand; and good stuff they seem to be; only there is no <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> with them.</p>
<p>This moment I have found a little scrap in the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter, which seems to hint that perhaps he might write to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at present. Yet in another part of it he bids me send word directly to Scotsbrig. I will send this therefore; tho&#x2019; if his Letter have reached you, my poor sheet will be a dear pennyworth. However, my good dear Mother will take the will to serve her for the deed.&#x2014; I rejoice to learn that you are pretty well; that you sometimes <hi rend="italic">shear</hi> on afternoons. Mag will be here one of these days, and tell us all about it. Alas! It is long, long, since I had a quiet word with my Mother! But surely this hubbub will subside, and I shall be my own master, <hi rend="italic">and Larry&#x2019;s</hi>.&#x2014; Meanwhile my best prayers are with you all. Remember me in love to my Father, to Mag, Jemmy and Jenny. <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>
<ps><p>They are all asleep here, and cannot send you there love, except in dreams. I am the only reasoning mortal in the house at this moment.&#x2014; One smoke, and I too am off!&#x2014;&#x2014;If you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> received the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter, it were well to call now and then till it come. If you <hi rend="italic">have</hi>, send it by Mary. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Adieu!</hi></foreign></p></ps>

<salute>Dear and Honoured Sir,</salute>
<p>A pleasing duty, which has long lain before me, need not now be put off any longer. Both your Packets are at length in my hands: the Post-Letter, enclosing Dr Eckermann&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Peter Eckermann (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854">1854</date>), Goethe&#x2019;s friend and literary assistant, author of <hi rend="italic">Gespr&#xE4;che mit Goethe (Conversations with Goethe</hi>), 3 vols.

All was in perfect safety, Books, Music, Manuscript; and certainly a singular and most welcome appearance in this our remote home, where, it would still seem, we are not <foreign><hi rend="italic">toto divisi orbe</hi></foreign> [cut off from the whole world], but in kind relation with what we reckon highest and best there.

<lg><l>Know&#x2019;st thou <hi rend="italic">Yesterday</hi>, its aim and reason;</l><lb/>
<l>Work&#x2019;st thou well <hi rend="italic">Today</hi>, for worthy things?</l><lb/>
<l>Calmly wait the <hi rend="italic">Morrow&#x2019;s</hi> hidden season,</l><lb/>
<l>Need&#x2019;st not fear what hap soe&#x2019;er it brings.</l></lg><lb/><lb/>
The engraving is by S. Bendixon, after the painting by Carl Christian Vogel von Vogelstein (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868">1868</date>), which is now at the Prado, Madrid.</note> has drawn him, will look down on us, while we listen, with a friendly monition that if Yesterday and To-day have been spent in wise activity, we &#x201C;may also hope for a Morrow which <pb id="pg-04-405" n="04:405"/>shall not be less happy.&#x201D; In a few hours, too, I purpose to enjoy this Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>; and explore what farther novelty these estimable volumes contain. One dainty little article I already notice in the <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi>: your translation of our ancient Scottish &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Schwank</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;Merry Tale&#x201D;], as Hans Sachs would call it, <hi rend="italic">Get up and bar the Door</hi>!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Get Up and Bar the Door&#x201D; is a popular Scottish song, its hero being one Johnnie Blunt, who lived on Crawford Moor. Carlyle could have seen it in David Herd, <hi rend="italic">Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1776">1776</date>), or in James Johnson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Scots Musical Museum</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1790">1790</date>), or in Ritson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Scottish Songs</hi> (London, <date when="1794">1794</date>). Goethe&#x2019;s translation is in his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (Weimar, <date when="1891">1891</date>), IV, 336.</note> The manuscript version I have often read; and not without a smile that I should hear, in a strange tongue, the old rough rhymes of my childhood so faithfully rendered back by the Author of <hi rend="italic">Mignon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi>. As you are curious in Popular Poetry, I might mention that Scotland is very rich in such things; old, quaint, rugged Songs and verses, written with a sly humour, a sly meaning, which still as we think characterises the national mind. Some of these pieces have even Royal Authors: there is <hi rend="italic">The Wife of Auchtermuchty</hi>, a far homelier piece than yours, and of a similar character, which one of our Jameses is said to have written; as another of them did undoubtedly compose our <hi rend="italic">Christs Kirk on the Green</hi>, a fragment full of a still more genial humour.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle probably thought that James V was the author of &#x201C;The Wife of Auchtermuchty,&#x201D; a view popular at the time, though probably groundless. &#x201C;Christis Kirk on the Grene&#x201D; has been attributed to both King James I and V. The Bannatyne MS firmly says James I, whereas the Maitland MS gives no author. Allan Ramsay in his <hi rend="italic">Evergreen</hi> attributed it to James V in the first edition, and to James I in the second. Most modern critics attribute it, hesitantly, to James V.</note> But of all this, at some other time.</p>
<p>For the present I should thank you again, had I words, for this new testimony of your friendliness. Doubtless it does seem wonderful to us that you and yours, occupied with so many great concerns in which the whole world is interested, should find any time to take thought of us who live so far out of your sphere, and can have so little influence reciprocally on aught that pertains to you. But such is the nature of this strangely complected Universe, that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men are linked together, and the greatest will come into connexion with the least. Neither, tho&#x2019; it is a fine tie, do I reckon it a weak one, that unites me to you. When I look back on my past Life, it seems as if you, a man of foreign speech, whom I have never seen, and, alas, shall perhaps never see, had been my chief Benefactor; nay I may say, the only real Benefactor I ever met with; inasmuch as Wisdom is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> real good, the only blessing which cannot be perverted, which <pb id="pg-04-406" n="04:406"/>blesses both him that gives and him that takes.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Merchant of Venice</hi>, IV, i.</note> In trying bereavements, when old Friends are snatched away from you, it must be a consolation to think that neither in this age, nor in any other, can you ever be left <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>; but that wherever men seek Truth, Spiritual Clearness and Beauty, there <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have Brothers and Children. I pray Heaven that you may long, long be spared to see good, and do good, in this world: without you, existing Literature, even that of Germany so far as I can discern it, were but a poor matter; and without one man, whom other men might judge clearly and yet view with any true reverence. Nevertheless the good seed that is sown cannot be trodden down, or altogether choked with tares; and surely it is the highest of all privileges to sow this seed, to have sown it: nay it is privilege enough if we have hands to reap it, and eyes to see it growing!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 13:8&#x2013;9.</note></p>
<p>But I must refrain myself here; one small sheet will not hold everything; and I have business matters to speak of. Sir Walter Scott has received your <hi rend="italic">Medals</hi>, several months ago; not thro&#x2019; me directly, for he had not returned to Edinburgh, when I left it; but thro&#x2019; Mr Jeffrey, our grand &#x201C;British Critic,&#x201D; to whom, as I learn, Sir Walter expressed himself properly sensible of such an honour &#x201C;from one of his Masters in Art.&#x201D; The other medals have all been distributed, except one which I still hesitate whether to send to Mr Lockhart, or to Mr Taylor of Norwich,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Taylor of Norwich (<date when="1765">1765</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836">1836</date>) helped to introduce German poetry and drama to English readers; translated Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi> (<date when="1793">1793</date>); edited <hi rend="italic">Historic Survey of German Poetry</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1828">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830">30</date>). His <hi rend="italic">Historic Survey</hi> was roughly reviewed by Carlyle in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, No. 105, with emphasis on the sensual nature of Taylor&#x2019;s philosophy. &#x201C;He recognises nothing that cannot be weighed, measured, and, with one or the other organ, eaten and digested. Logic is his only lamp of life; where this fails, the region of Creation terminates&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> XXVII, 359). Taylor obviously had read this, and been piqued by it, as is evident in Robberds, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of William Taylor</hi> (London, <date when="1843">1843</date>), II, 550.</note> who is at present publishing <hi rend="italic">Specimens of German Poetry</hi>, is a man of learning, and long ago gave a version of your <hi rend="italic">Iphigenie</hi>, which, on report, I understand to be of a superior sort. Farther, at your request, I must mention that the Translator of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> is George Moir,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280418-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1828-04-18">18 April</date></ref>. Moir&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> was published in <date when="1828">1828</date>.</note> a young Edinburgh Advocate, who cultivates Literature in conjunction with Jurisprudence, and promises to do well in both, being a person of clear faculty, and tho&#x2019; young, without any marked deficiency or redundancy, either in talent or temper. <pb id="pg-04-407" n="04:407"/>He is a man of very small bodily stature; from which cause perhaps in part, I used to regard him rather with a sort of fondness than of pure equal friendship: he seemed to me a little polished crystal, nearly colourless for the present, but in which, at some hour, the Sun might come to be refracted and reflected in a fine play of tints. As to the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, you may by this time have seen a long Paper entitled &#x201C;Goethe,&#x201D; which appears in No. III; and for which I can only ask your pardon; knowing too well that it is a poor enough affair. A far poorer one on <hi rend="italic">Heyne</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Life of Heyne,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, <date when="1828-10">Oct.</date></note> is to come out shortly, in No. IV; after which I know not what, or whether anything from me, is to follow; tho&#x2019; Jean Paul, Novalis, Tieck, nay Lessing and Klopstock are all still lying before me. The only thing of any moment I have written since I came hither is an Essay on <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi>, for the next No. of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>, which I suppose will be published in a few weeks.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published in the <date when="1828-12">Dec.</date> number.</note> Perhaps you have never heard of this <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi>: and yet he was a man of the most decisive genius; but born in the rank of a Peasant, and miserably wasted away by the complexities of his strange situation; so that all he effected was comparatively a trifle, and he died before middle age. We English, especially we Scotch, love Burns more than any oth<supplied>[er]</supplied> Poet we have had for centuries. It has often struck me to remark that he was born a few months only before Schiller, in the year <date when="1759">1759</date>; and that neither of these two men, of whom I reckon Burns perhaps naturally even the greater, ever heard the other&#x2019;s name; but that they shone as stars in opposite hemispheres, the little atmosphere of the Earth intercepting their mutual light.</p>
<p>You inquire with such affection touching our present abode and employments, that I must say some words on that subject, while I have still space. Dumfries is a pretty town, of some 15,000 inhabitants; the Commercial and Judicial Metropolis of a considerable district on the Scottish border. Our dwelling-place is not in it; but fifteen miles (two hours riding) to the Northwest of it, among the granite mountains and black moors, which stretch westward thro&#x2019; Galloway almost to the Irish Sea. This is, as it were, a green oasis in that desart of heath and rock; a piece of ploughed and partially sheltered and ornamented ground where corn ripens, and trees yield umbrage, tho&#x2019; encircled on all hands by moorfowl and only the hardiest breeds of sheep. Here, by dint of great endeavour, we have pargetted and garnished for ourselves a clean substantial dwelling; and settled down, in defect of any Professorial or other official appointment, to cultivate <pb id="pg-04-408" n="04:408"/>Literature on our own resources, by way of occupation; and roses and garden-shrubs, and if possible health, and a peaceable temper of mind, to forward it. The roses are indeed still mostly to plant; but they already blossom in Hope; and we have two swift horses, which, with the mountain air, are better than all physicians for sick nerves. That exercise, which I am very fond of, is almost my sole amusement; for this is one of the most solitary spots in Britain, being six miles from <hi rend="italic">any</hi> individual of the formally visiting class. It might have suited Rousseau, almost as well as his Island of St. Pierre:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An island in the middle of the Lake of Bienne, Switzerland, where Rousseau spent several idyllic months in the autumn of <date when="1765">1765</date>.</note> indeed I find that most of my city Friends impute to me a motive similar to his in coming hither, and predict no good from it. But I came hither purely for this one reason: That I might not have to write for bread; might not be tempted to tell lies for money. This space of Earth is our own; and we can live in it and write and think as seems best to us, tho&#x2019; Zoilus<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zo&#xEF;lus, a Greek of the <date>fourth century, <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>, who criticized Homer and Plato severely; hence the term <hi rend="italic">Zoilism</hi>, meaning &#x201C;carping criticism.&#x201D;</note> himself should become King of Letters. And as to its solitude, a Mail Coach will any day transport us to Edinburgh, which is our British Weimar<supplied>[.]</supplied> Nay even at this time, I have a whole horse-load of French, German, American, English Reviews and Journals, were they of any worth, encumbering the tables of my little Library. Moreover from any of our heights I can discern a Hill, a day&#x2019;s journey to the eastward, where Agricola with his Romans has left a camp,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Birrens, or Blatum Bulgium, near Ecclefechan. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140701-TC-TM-01">TC to TM, <date when="1814-07-01">1 July 1814</date></ref>.</note> at the foot of which I was born, where my Father and Mother are still living to love me. Time, therefore, must be left to try: but if I sink into folly, myself and not my situation will be to blame. Nevertheless I have many doubts about my future Literary activity; on all which how gladly would I take <hi rend="italic">your</hi> counsel! Surely, you will write to me again, and ere long; that I may still feel myself united to you.<closer><salute>Our best prayers for all good to you and yours are ever with you. Farewell!</salute></closer></p>

<p>Dr Eckermann&#x2019;s friendly and very flattering Letter deserved a speedier reply, and shall not long want a reply, tho&#x2019; now a late one. <pb id="pg-04-409" n="04:409"/>He is known to me by his writings and by report, as an able and amiable man; for whose acquaintance I should heartily thank you.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I have been meditating a journey to you almost every day for three weeks, but some pitiful thing or another has always come in the way. I really believe that I shall be obliged to put off my journey, after all, till the Jeffreys are gone.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Jeffreys came on <date when="1828-10-07">Tuesday, 7 Oct.</date>, and left on the morning of <date when="1828-10-10">Friday, 10 Oct.</date></note> We expect them this week. Meanwhile, accept this assurance that we are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> well, and struggling away in our usual style. The London Reviewers have anxiously agreed to pay me at the highest rate, if I will continue to write for them.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser to TC, <date when="1828-09-30">30 Sept.</date></note> I go down today to Dumfries to draw on them for &#xa3;50.</p>
<p>Here are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Letters from the Doctor, the last<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1828-09-16">16 Sept.</date> The letter begins: &#x201C;You will be not a little surprised at seeing the date of this letter from Vienna instead of Munich. Last time I wrote it was my purpose to remain at the latter place for a month longer, but the Baron suddenly resolved to make a journey to Berlin, and his brother and family were also going to leave Munich for some time so that I found my stay there could no longer be agreeable or proper. The baron insisted upon my remaining another year in Germany, and furnished me with the means of doing so which I shall make use of in case of necessity. Perhaps it was foolish to take this resolution, but I could not set up my face to come home again after my whim of going to Germany had cost you so much more than I anticipated. I feel now what you told me before I left Scotland that I should not have undertaken the journey at all on such terms being altogether unqualified for living comfortably in the way proposed. On the contrary I feel also that the advantages of this adventure will not be small in my future professional life.&#x201D; Most of the letter is devoted to details about the journey from Munich to Vienna and a description of the part of Vienna in which John lives.</note> of which only came on Saturday. You will see that he is at Vienna, somewhat <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> from home than Munich, and living in his own hired house! He talks about Lakes and villages and all other trash, but not a word of what <pb id="pg-04-410" n="04:410"/><hi rend="italic">he</hi> is doing, stumbling and <hi rend="italic">clooting</hi> [cuffing, fighting] in these foreign places. Poor Doctor, and foolish Doctor! I will write to him tomorrow.&#x2014; Mr Grahame brings you this: he has been here since Friday, and is in <hi rend="italic">great</hi> haste to be gone this moment. So I have done.</p>

<p>I know not whether the highly economical consideration of saving you double postage, together with excessive occupation of late weeks be reasonable apologies for not sooner paying my debt to you of money and thanks: At all events I rely on your known <hi rend="italic">goodnature</hi> to make the best of them.</p>
<p>You did not mention the amount of the said debt,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably for the purchases which she had asked Eliza to make for her in her letter of <date when="1828-07-29">29 July</date>.</note> but I calculate it was somewhere within five pounds which I now take the opportunity of sending safely by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jeffrey.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have received both your Letters, the last about a week ago; and studied them, as you may suppose, with no ordinary interest. Two or three days ago, I made them up into a parcel, and sent them down to Scotsbrig, with William Graham, who was here visiting us, when the Vienna despatch arrived. I would have written sooner, indeed immediately: but ever since, there has been a constant flood of visiting passing over us; the Jeffreys&#x2019; only left us last Friday. Meanwhile, dear Doctor, do you in future above all other epistolary sins, avoid as the <foreign><hi rend="italic">peccatum mortale</hi></foreign> [deadly sin] ever again throwing us into such a quandary by <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>. Write, at least, if you will not come home to us; write duly and without any delay; if you would not have your Mother set out herself in search of you.</p>
<p>We have all a very mixed feeling, I think, with regard to your Austrian pilgrimage. It seems to be the unanimous opinion that you should have turned your face homewards, when the resources of Munich were exhausted: what you specially want, or how you mean to <hi rend="italic">better</hi> your fortune, in that stupid Sybarite Metropolis is not clear to any of us. However, my dear Jack, we will not argue about this: one comfortable feature of the business is that you have now heartily taken the management of your destiny into your own hands, and feel yourself a <hi rend="italic">free agent</hi>, responsible to no one; which, after all, is the only wholesome state for any <hi rend="italic">man</hi> to be in. My distinct persuasion is that you should continue to travel, till that maggot is <hi rend="italic">fully</hi> cleared out of your head, and in no danger of ever stirring there again. For unless the whole world is a mistake to me, you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> by and by discover that &#x2018;God&#x2019;s Earth&#x2019; is everywhere very much the same, in most points; that true Knowledge grows not here or there in external Space, but everywhere in the Mind of a thinking man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This could reflect Carlyle&#x2019;s reading of Dr. Johnson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi>.</note> Meanwhile, I need not remind you that for all purposes of living by English Literature, surely England itself is the fittest scene. Would you not <hi rend="italic">translate</hi>, think you, more comfortably in your Brother&#x2019;s or your <pb id="pg-04-412" n="04:412"/>Father&#x2019;s house, than there, in the Alter Vorstadt, some fifteen hundred miles from your printing-office? O Jack! thou art a <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> man, yes a <hi rend="italic">very queer</hi> man! Nevertheless, my poor truehearted, tho&#x2019; misguided Doil, let no word of mine discourage thee. Know always that when you want a <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi> in Germany, you have three <hi rend="italic">homes</hi> in Scotland; the warmest nook of which will always be your own. Furthermore, despise the weak vanity, which leads you to be ashamed of returning <hi rend="italic">poor</hi>. Our last shilling will ever be at your command to bring you home with; this you already know: and if the expense has already been too great, depend upon it, Jack, Britain and the exercise of your Profession are the only way of making it good again. I could say much, much on this subject; but I restrain myself. In truth, I am very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign>, at this hour, to think of my Brother &#x2018;looking out on the Glacis,&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Carlyle had written in his letter of <date when="1828-09-16">16 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I have hired myself a neat comfortable room in a well aired part of the suburbs looking towards the town with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Glacis</hi></foreign> between it &#x26; me.&#x201D; Carlyle appears to have associated <foreign><hi rend="italic">Glacis</hi></foreign> with ice, but Dr. Carlyle in his letter to his mother of <date when="1828-10-19">19 Oct.</date> spoke of it as &#x201C;a level space of green ground about a quarter of a mile broad which seperates the suburbs from it all around like a belt.&#x201D;</note> at the End of Europe, with such plans and means as those of his are. Why does he not come home to his own land? Why are those fine faculties so long unoccupied, still training never trained, by which not only a money fortune, but something worth twenty money fortunes might be made, would he use them wisely?&#x2014; But enough, and more than enough! In one word, understand that the <hi rend="italic">means</hi> of coming home, and the warmest of welcomes there (poor or rich), will <hi rend="italic">always</hi> await your asking; at the same time, walk by <hi rend="italic">your own</hi> best light in this matter; and God ever keep you, my Brother, in these far countries, and (as they seem to us) wild projects!</p>
<p>We long much, of course, to hear all manner of details about your new situation. Do send us word of the minutes sort, for our curiosity on all hands is extreme. Not indeed about Vienna and the Danube, the <hi rend="italic">Stephansthurm</hi> [Stephen&#x2019;s Tower] or the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Strudel und Wirbel</hi></foreign> [Whirlpool and Maelstrom]; but about our own Brother who is living there. Indeed in the name of all parties, I have to request that you would tell us about yourself and yourself only, at least till the main matters become clear to us. Graphic as your descriptions are, we grudged not a little that mere geography and topography should occupy a line of your sheet, when so much concerning our own Doctor remained untold. Remember, Jack, that there is for the present but one interesting object for us in Germany: the wilful wayfarer. Nothing is of consequence to us but what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has to do with; and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that he <pb id="pg-04-413" n="04:413"/>has to do with, were it but the hour when he rises, or the <foreign><hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;stauration</hi></foreign> where he dines, cannot fail to interest us. But I must expostulate no longer: so here endeth the Litany, and next commenceth the Discourse.</p>
<p>Duncan Church<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Carlyle had asked about his health in his letter of <date when="1828-09-16">16 Sept.</date></note> is dead! I had a letter from his Father four days ago, announcing that mournful event; on which I forbear to express my feelings, or farther to excite your own. He died in London, on the <date when="1828-10-01">first of October</date>, unexpectedly, and seemingly without pain; his Mother says he had eaten his dinner with better appetite than usual; and shortly afterwards, a blood-vessel burst, and in a few hours the sad scene was at an end. I suppose, the inflammation had subsided into consumption, and so the poor Youth had been snatched away. O God! it is a fearful world this we live in; a film spread over bottomless abysses, into which no eye has pierced! Frank Dixon also, I fear, is dying. Mag saw him the other week in Dumfries: he was worn to a thread; seemed to think that it was now nearly all over with him. He had been living all summer in lodgings at Dumfries; &#x2018;for,&#x2019; said he, &#x2018;they are tired of me at Belcathill.&#x2019; I wrote to him next day inviting him hither (he was gone to Moffat), but have not since heard of him.&#x2014; Let us leave these funereal scenes.</p>
<p>Of your own relations I am still [God be thanked for it!]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brackets.</note> enabled to send you favourable tidings. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> of us are well: still fighting our way, with the old measure of strength, courage and success. Our day too will come: we have been <hi rend="italic">long</hi> spared. I myself am in better rather than in worse health than usual; have been rather busy for some time; and am again purposing to begin scribbling. This <date when="1828-10">October</date> season always makes me pensive, sometimes absolutely melancholy: however, melancholy itself is not a miserable state. The Paper on Burns is finished; and I suppose will appear in <date when="1828-12">December</date>; being too late for this present Number. The Proof-sheets of it are even now in the house, and corrected. Jeffrey had clipt the first portion of it all into shreds (partly by my permission), simple because it was too long. My first feeling was of indignation, and to demand the whole back again, that it might lie in my drawer and worm-eat, rather than come before the world in that horrid <foreign>souterkin</foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Usually spelled <hi rend="italic">sooterkin</hi> by Carlyle. See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170331-TC-RM-01">TC to RM, <date when="1817-03-31">31 March 1817</date></ref>.</note> shape; the body of a quadruped with the head of a bird; a man <hi rend="italic">shortened</hi> by cutting out his thighs, and fixing the Knee-pans on the hips! However, I determined to <hi rend="italic">do nothing for three days</hi>; and now by replacing and readjusting <pb id="pg-04-414" n="04:414"/>many parts of the first sixteen pages (there are three sheets in all; and the last two were not meddled with) I have once more put the thing into a kind of publishable state; and mean to send it back, with a private persuasion that probably I shall not soon write another for that quarter. Nevertheless, I will keep friends with the man; for he really has extraordinary worth, and likes me, at least heartily wishes me well. We had three such days of him last week! Wife and child and lapdog and maid were here with him; and the storm vainly howled without, and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud] vainly gaped for us (we are <hi rend="italic">making</hi> a road to the front door; and the poor Duke was forced to dismount from his carriage at some of the <foreign><hi rend="italic">yetts</hi></foreign> [gates]); for we had roaring fires within and the brightest talk, enough and to spare! It was a fairy time: but you shall hear of it all by word of mouth. Robert Welsh had also been here with a Sister. Then came William Grahame (who still loves you truly), and Dobie the Preacher, and a <hi rend="italic">threat</hi>, which ended as such, from John Gordon at Kirkcudbright. It seemed as if the whole world had at once broken loose on us; according to the old adage: &#x2018;It never rains but it pours.&#x2019; However, it is all done now, and the quietest and I hope busiest winter lies before us. Alick is in his new house, which promises, were it rightly swept and garnished, to be a first-rate cottage; Mary is with him, and Jane also lives there for the present: we are all in harmony, and have tea together at least every Sunday-night. Mary and Jane have just left us after that very business: Alick was not with them; for we calculate that tonight he must be in the precincts of Falkirk, to buy his winter-stock tomorrow. So soon as I get Larry back, I am for Scotsbrig; where however, we heard two days ago that they are all well. After that, I resume my writing (as I have al<supplied>[r]</supplied>eady done my reading) for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>. Black, by the bye, informs me that he has got your Letter: but not being at all in the way of publishing in that kind, &#x2018;will answer it when he has spoken to Longman.&#x2019; Have you yet heard from him? Fraser also, the Editor, inquires earnestly the other day for your &#x2018;Article of German Medicine&#x2019;: why do you not rather write <hi rend="italic">this</hi> than plague yourself with Translations? &#x2018;Cannot do it&#x2019;? <hi rend="italic">Who</hi> wrote the Thesis on Insanity?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to Dr. Carlyle&#x2019;s dissertation, &#x201C;De Mentis Alienatione.&#x201D;</note> O Jack, Jack, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> labour for the present is joyous but grievous. It seems to me that here (supposing you <hi rend="italic">home</hi> safely) were a rationa<supplied>[l]</supplied> hope of making a little money, and farther it seems to me, almost the only rational one. But my sheet is done, and I must send you my blessing, not my advice.&#x2014; We expect Ben Nelson here, on <pb id="pg-04-415" n="04:415"/>his wool-gathering: he often and affectionately inquires after you. Did you learn that Ben Nicholson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but possibly related to Benjamin Nicholson, merchant and provost of Annan in the <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2019;s.</note> had died, suddenly, some months ago?&#x2014;George Irving is returned from Paris, and at Annan; whither bound I know not. Dr Waugh, I believe, is there also; becoming a perfect <foreign><hi rend="italic">skite</hi></foreign> [a disagreeable, offensive person].&#x2014; Goethe has sent me another Lieferung of his works, with a kind and rather sad letter, all in black for the Duke of Weimar.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had died on the way back from Berlin on <date when="1828-06-14">14 June</date>.</note> I said that probably <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would see him in winter or spring: he will welcome you in his choicest mood.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own dear Jack! with all thy faults I love thee, and am ever thy true Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>Could you but see how it stands with me just at present; you would not be too much elated by this favour. For I am sitting here companionless &#x2018;like owl in desert&#x2019;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Scottish metrical <hi rend="italic">Psalms</hi>, CII:<lb/><lb/>
<lg><l>&#x201C;I like an owl in desert am,</l><lb/>
<l>That nightly there doth moan;</l><lb/>
<l>I watch, and like a sparrow am</l><lb/>
<l>On the house-top alone.&#x201D;</l></lg></note> with nothing pressing to do, having learnt my daily task of Spanish, and also finished a shirt&#x2014;let me speak truth&#x2014;a nightshirt I was making for my Husband; and it is come into my head as a resource from <foreign>ennui</foreign> that I should write somebody <pb id="pg-04-417" n="04:417"/>a letter: and thus, Dear, all you have to be proud of is, that my choice of an object is fallen on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. I tell you this out of my natural love of plaindealing.</p>
<p>You would know what I am doing in these moors? Well! I am feeding poultry [at long intervals and merely for form&#x2019;s sake],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The brackets are JWC&#x2019;s.</note> and I am galloping over the country on a bay horse, and baking bread, and improving my mind, and eating, and sleeping, and making, and mending and in short, wringing whatever good I can, from the ungrateful soil of the world<supplied>[.]</supplied> On the whole, I was never more contented in my life: one enjoys such freedom and quietude here; nor have we purchased this at the expence of other accommodations; for we have a good house to live in, with all the necessaries of life, and even some touch of the superfluities. &#x201C;Do you <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> to raise any corn?&#x201D; the people ask us. Bless their hearts! we are planning strawberry-banks, and shrubberies, and beds of roses, with the most perfect assurance that they will grow: as to the corn, it grows to all lengths, without ever consulting the public about the matter. Another question that is asked me, so often as I am abroad, is, how many cows I keep, which question, to my eternal shame as a housewife, I have never yet been enabled to answer; having never ascertained, up to this moment whether there are seven cows or eleven. The fact is I take no delight in cows, and have happily no concern with them. Carlyle and I are not playing farmers here; which were a rash and unnatural attempt. My Brother in law is the Farmer, and fights his own battle, in his own new house, which one of his sisters manages for him.</p>
<p>In the Autumn I had enough to mind without counting cows; the house being often full of visitors. There was Robert (my uncle) and Ann<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Welsh and his sister.</note>&#x2014;A M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Graham of Burnswark&#x2014;Jeffrey with wife and child and maid and lapdog&#x2014;George<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Welsh, another of Jane&#x2019;s uncles.</note> and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wife&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">our dear</hi> Henry Inglis, and several others whom you do not know. And how on earth did M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey get himself amused at Craigenputtoch? Why, in the simplest manner: he talked&#x2014;talked from morning till night, nay till morning again&#x2014; I never assisted at such a talking since I came into the world; either in respect of quantity or quality.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Richardson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Mrs. <sic>Caroline</sic><corr>Catherine E.</corr> Richardson, the Dumfriesshire poet<sic>ess</sic>.

John Carlyle is still in Germany. We looked for him home; but he has found, that he could neither have peace in his lifetime, nor sleep quiet in his grave, had he missed studying six months at Vienna. Little Jane <supplied>[is]</supplied> gone back to Scotsbrig, where she could not be well spared, another Sister being here with Alick. So that Carlyle and I are quite by ourselves at present, moralizing together, and learning spanish together, and in short living in the most confidential manner imaginable. You never saw so still a house: we have just one servant [Grace Macdonald] and not even a cat in addition [for we find mousetraps answer much better]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s brackets in both instances.</note> By the way, this Grace is just the cleverest servant I ever had occasion to know; and would be a perfect paragon in her line were it not for certain &#x2018;second table&#x2019; airs about her,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Airs of an upper servant in a large house, where the upper servants have a table of their own, known as the &#x2018;second table,&#x2019;&#x201D; (Ritchie&#x2019;s note).</note> which without doubt she must have picked up at the Manner&#x2019;s&#x2014;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably her former employer, Alexander H. Manners, Writer to the Signet, West Maitland Street, Edinburgh.</note></p>
<p>My Mother dined here ten days ago, and stayed a night,&#x2014;her <hi rend="italic">second</hi> and <hi rend="italic">longest</hi> visit since we came. But she is of necessity much confined at home now, and also imagines the necessity to be greater than it is. You inquire if I will be in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> this winter. I think the chances are about two to one that I shall. We are pressingly invited to spend some time with the Jeffreys; and Carlyle has agreed to go, provided he gets three papers, promised to the Foreign Review, finished by then. Should he be belated with these he would have <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to go without him, but that I shall not dream of doing&#x2014; It would be poor entertainment for one in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or anywhere else to think one&#x2019;s Husband was here in the desert <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>&#x2014;his stockings get all into holes, and perhaps even his tea ru<supplied>[nn]</supplied>ing down.</p>
<p>Remember me in the kindest manner to your Uncle, and say to him, that if he will come and see us in summer the fatted calf shall be slain to make him welcome&#x2014;to say nothing of lambs and poultry.</p>
<p>Remember me also to Sam;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken.</note> and to David Aitken when you see him. You talk of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Simpson as an invalid; I hope he is recovered? Will you write to me soon? A letter from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is such a treat to one here.</p>
<p>Carlyle is away in Annandale at present. His eldest Sister has been ill for some time and, he is gone to see what can be done for her. I <pb id="pg-04-419" n="04:419"/>am afraid she is in a very bad way&#x2014; <closer><salute>Do write<supplied>[.]</supplied> ever affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>As the Letters seem to take at least a week longer in travelling to Vienna than they did to Munich, it behoves me to answer you with the least possible delay. Ten days have already elapsed much against my will; and I write to-night in great haste, rather than wait a few days more. Your welcome Letter met Mary and me at Dumfries, as we were bound to Scotsbrig, in stormy weather, on a rather melancholy errand; and diffused a gleam of real joy over that otherwise rather despondent household. For you must know that our sister Mag was very ill, and we were sent for to come and see her with our own eyes. Happy that I can now in a great measure say <hi rend="italic">was</hi>; for tho&#x2019; still very weakly the poor lassie is considered out of danger; indeed I did not see that any real immediate danger had ever been in the case, tho&#x2019; for two or three days, some of the symptoms were alarming enough. I judge it fair and right to tell you of this fact; but, not to give you unreasonable anxieties on the subject, I must explain it with more minuteness. All Autumn and Fall, poor Mag had been labouring under great indigestion (not in the form you saw her suffer it, but in that of want of appetite and the necessary consequences); one day in &#x2018;Potatoe-raising time,&#x2019; she had farther caught a little cold; and so when I was at Scotsbrig about six weeks ago, she looked very pale, complained of feverishness, and could not speak with any force for a swelling in her gums and windpipe. I rode down with her to Annan; consulted Waugh, who declared it to be a disease of the small intestines, to be cured by senna &#x26;c; the main thing for the present, however, being to subdue the inflammation in the larynx&#x2014;by leeches, unguents, and a blister. Leeches accordingly were applied, with some effect; then a blister, which almost instantly removed the whole pain and swelling from the <hi rend="italic">in</hi>side, but left a wound on the <hi rend="italic">out</hi>side, which to the surprise and partial terror both of Simpson and our Mother, not only did not heal, but was visibly spreading and deepening! Cressfield <pb id="pg-04-420" n="04:420"/>and Dr Arnott were sent for; they conceived this strange gangrening of the blister to indicate a bad habit of body; and proposed with new medicines a different sort of dressing. Before Mary and I arrived (9 days ago), the worst was over, and the wound looked decidedly better. So far as I could judge, the whole sickness that she had might be thought to originate from the fretting of so large a sore, and the mere languor produced by a <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> state to which I myself am no stranger. The whole method of cure seemed plain enough: to keep the bowels as easy as possible (our Mother had already done good service by her <hi rend="italic">Castor-oil</hi>); on the other hand to support the strength by nutritive alements (arrow-root, fresh-eggs, beef, wine) till the blister being once healed, horse-exercise might be added, and so our poor Mag once more restored to her wonted activity. She lies at present mostly in bed (in the room that was our Mother&#x2019;s and Father&#x2019;s) pale and thin, but clear and undespondent; supporting her painful <hi rend="italic">dressings</hi> &#x26;c with a Spartan silence. It would have done you good to see how she brightened up when I read her your Letter, as I had to do that night I arrived. Mary and I left her exactly this day week, and she seemed growing better and better; since which, a short letter received two days ago gives a similar report. Our Mother and all the rest were perfectly well (Jane is returned thither some weeks ago, and proves highly useful); and all seemed greatly lightened in their prospects with regard to the sick one, and indeed not even my Mother seemed to apprehend anything. This is the true account of the matter, Jack, so far as I can express it; I myself do not think there is danger, tho&#x2019; I should not say but the <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> amendment may be tedious, I mean that of the bowels and general health. If any perceptible alteration for the worse take place, be sure I will warn you instantly: so, in the mean time, do not annoy yourself with surmises and forecastings, where, tho&#x2019; no one is sure of more than the breathing he draws, there seems no reason for special fear. I believe, I have said too much about it already; indeed far too much: but I approve of punctuality in ill as well as good news; and I think I have made it <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> rather than better for the telling. And so let us rest (in this as in all other matters) in hope and contentment not grounded on darkness but on light.</p>
<p>Your last Letter, as I have said, gave us all the greatest pleasure; both by the news it brought us, and the sensible style it was written in. It exhibits you in quite another state of welfare both outward and inward than any Letter we had received for months. And the grand news of all news for us is that your travelling mania has now <pb id="pg-04-421" n="04:421"/>subsided, and we are to see the Doctor&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">gawsie face</hi> back among us, so soon as the winter is over! Come, dear Jonathan, for thou hast tarried too long already. What is in Dutchland or any other land save old Scotland, but a sun above thee, and earth and water beneath; and no soul that has time to care truly for thee? Here is bread and lodging on your <hi rend="italic">native</hi> soil; and fool is he that expects aught more from any soil under the heavenly vault. O that the roads were open, and we saw our brave Lord Moon, once more stumping about these wolds, whether it were that he walked <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> with the left foot or the right! His very Logic would be welcome to us; and I have it on authority, that a <hi rend="italic">dumpling</hi> of one cubic foot in extent would be cooked on the day of his arrival. Come therefore, dear Doil; and do not lose thyself in Pepperfield any longer!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton quotes the following note provided by Mary Aitken Carlyle: &#x201C;John had, as a mere baby, sallied out, as he afterwards tried to explain, to fight the French, and was lost for several hours. He was at last found in Pepperfield (close to the old home at Ecclefechan), where among the tall growing corn he had cried himself to sleep, hopeless of ever finding his way out of it.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>But I must more seriously incline to send you news of Craigenputtoch, for which you express such friendly curiosity. Know then that we are all well, and struggling with as much heart as ever. The fruit of our labour is not to be altogether hid in a bushel; for we expect to astonish you with the figure we make here, even by the time of your arrival. This house (bating some outskirt things which must be left till Spring) is really a substantial, comfortable and even half-elegant house<supplied>[.]</supplied> I sit here in my little library, and laugh at the howling tempests, for there are green curtains and a clear fire and papered walls; the &#x2018;old Kitchen&#x2019; also is as tight a dining-room as you would wish for me, and has a black clear-barred grate, at which, when filled with Sanquhar<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sanquhar, where coal-mining is an important industry, is a town and parish in upper Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire.</note> coals, you might roast Boreas himself. The goodwife too is happy, and contented with me, and her solitude, which I believe is not to be equalled out of Sahara itself. You cannot figure the stillness of these moors in a <date when="1828-11">November</date> drizzle: nevertheless I walk often under cloud of night (in good Ecclefechan <hi rend="italic">clogs</hi>) down as far as Carstammon-burn, sometimes to Sandy-wells) conversing with the void heaven, in the most pleasant fashion. Besides Jane also has a pony now, which can canter to perfection even by the side of Larry! Tomorrow she is going over to Templand with it; and it is by her that I send this Letter. Grace, our servant, a tight, tidy, careful sharptempered woman is the only other inmate of the house; and except <pb id="pg-04-422" n="04:422"/>Ben Nelson, we expect no more visitors thro&#x2019; winter. But I write hard all day; then Jane and I (both learning Spanish for the last month) read a chapter of Don Quixote between dinner and tea, and are already half thro&#x2019; the first volume, and eager to persevere.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The reading of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> was to have an important influence on the writing of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>.</note> After tea, I sometimes writ<supplied>[e]</supplied> again (being <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">dre</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">adfully</hi> slow at the business); and then generally go over to Alick and Ma<supplied>[ry and]</supplied> smoke my last pipe with them; and so end the day, having done little good perhaps <supplied>[but]</supplied> almost no ill that I could help to any creature of God&#x2019;s. So pass our days; except that sometimes I stroll (with my axe or bill) in the plantations; and when I am not writing, am reading. We had Henry Inglis here for three days; and our Father for a week, lately; both of whom seemed highly contented with this wonderful Craig.&#x2014;&#x2014; Alick and Mary, you already understand, live in their own cottage, or rather <hi rend="italic">double</hi> farmhouse; for, were it once dried, it will be the <foreign><hi rend="italic">bieldest</hi></foreign> [best-protected] tightest mansion of its sort within some miles of it. They have two men-servants and two maid-servants; are fattening or merely boarding quantities of black-cattle, have almost a dozen pigs, and plenty of weak-corn and about 80 cartloads of potatoes (to say nothing of turnip-acres) to feed them with. Alick is about thatching a cattle-shed, long since built (of dry stones)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stones without mortar.</note> down near the moor; and we have had roadmen, for many weeks, gravelling the front of this door (a most marked improvement), making us a proper road to it, and thoroughly repairing the old road (to the <hi rend="italic">outmost <foreign>yett</foreign></hi> [gate]), which last task they have not yet completed. Thus you see, Chaos is rolling himself back from us by degrees; and all winter, we are to have stone-diking and planting and draining (if I can <hi rend="italic">write</hi> for the cash!) till by and by I think this hermitage will positively become a very tolerable place, and the Doctor, as we said, will be astonished to behold it. For the rest, we drink tea together every sunday night, and live in good brotherhood, having <hi rend="italic">no</hi> neighbours that do not wish us well.&#x2014;&#x2014; As to my writing of which you hear so much, it is only for the present a most despicable &#x2018;article&#x2019; entitled <hi rend="italic">German Playwrights</hi> (including your Grillparzer)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, <date when="1829-01">Jan. 1829</date>.

<p>Our news, beyond our own household, are mostly I think of a sombre cast. James Anderson, the young Laird of Stroquhan, our kind neighbour and acquaintance died of two days&#x2019; illness a few weeks ago; an event which causes deep sadness among all connected with him. What will become of his Distillery is not known. Poor John Welsh, the Coachman, was to be buried the last day I was at Ecclefechan: other deaths also there are of persons known to us; for &#x2018;the cup goes round and who so cunning as to pass it by?&#x2019;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Source not found.</note>&#x2014; Waugh still lives with <hi rend="italic">Marion</hi>; the laziest man the sun shines on. Thom is degenerating or degenerated into a blackguard. Ben Nelson and Carlyle are still buying wool; the former seems to have a real friendship for you.&#x2014; Alas! I had almost forgotten to say that honest good old John <hi rend="italic">Grier</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;John Grierson, husband of Carlyle&#x2019;s maternal-aunt &#x2018;Jeannie&#x2019; (died <date when="1810">1810</date>).

Alick and Jamie and I assisted at his funeral some three weeks ago: he also died suddenly; but like a just man, and with entire composure. Gracious God! Is not this thy world a mystery, and grand with Terror as well as Beauty!&#x2014; My Letter, you see, will end in sable, like the life of man. My own thoughts grow graver every year I live.&#x2014; Write instantly my dear Brother; say that you are well, and will soon be with us. <closer><salute>Good night! my candle and time and paper are done.

<p>The broad sea and the long, long miles which ly between us.&#x2014;and the bustle of life, have I am sorry to acknowledge, all but utterly, cut off our correspondence: neither breadth of sea however nor length of road, can stay the kind wishes or supress the earnest heart-felt prayer. Nay, my dear Jack, thine is a heart that I can, independent of our brotherhood, cease to love and admire, only when very good and honest emotion has withered &#x26; faded within me. Mary my little housekeeper sends her dearest love to you and prays for your speedy and safe arrival on this side the watters.

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>Here is a very old coat, and some fractions of old trowsers which Carlyle bids me send to your Mother&#x2014;with what view, I cannot possibly imagine; unless it be to nail currant bushes&#x2014;or rig out a <foreign>pottato-boggle</foreign> [scare-crow].</p>
<p>I take the opportunity of sending at the same time my tin dressing-box which you may perhaps find useful in holding little <hi rend="italic">sundries</hi>&#x2014; The whole &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">sendung</hi></foreign>&#x2019; is of the most precious description; and it is to be hoped you will welcome it in your choicest mood.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;&#x2014;will welcome you <hi rend="italic">in our choicest mood</hi>,&#x2019; said Irving once, in some sermon or address that had been reported to us&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note></p>
<p>We are all quite well here but exceedingly cold and illnatured. I hope Carlyle told your Mother how much I was gratified by her kind present. I assure you I am very vain of the beautiful little shawl so vain that I rode to Templand with it <hi rend="italic">above my habit</hi>. Jemmy would tell you of the gallant expedition<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Probably to Templand)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> which Mary and I executed in Carlyles absence? But nobody can have told you how we were bitten with the cold&#x2014; or what temptation we resisted to halt for whiskey at <pb id="pg-04-425" n="04:425"/>a public house by the way. I shall not travel in a winter day again without a small phialfull in my pocket.</p>
<p>My kind love to you <supplied>[al]</supplied>l and a kiss to your Father, if any of you dare give it him.</p>
<p>I shall certainly see your Mother before long&#x2014; She will come up hither if there is grace left in her; at all events I will be down&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hear you are very diligent and very good. I on the other hand am very idle and bad. I have done no one useful thing for a week except making <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> two <foreign><hi rend="italic">daidlies</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;(Pinafores <hi rend="italic">Anglice</hi>)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I certainly seem to owe you some apology for so long neglecting to answer your friendly Letter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1828-06-15">15 June</date>. Pbd: Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 104&#x2013;11.</note> which has now lain in my hand for several months. The incessant bustle, from a thousand causes, which involves all householders at the outfit of a new establishment, joined to various retardments arising from ill health and the like, must plead my excuse with you. For you are not to doubt but I feel greatly flattered with this my introduction to you, obtained in so gratifying a way; and shall always reckon the correspondence of such a man, whether it be <hi rend="italic">to</hi> me or <hi rend="italic">from</hi> me, one of my most pleasing concerns. A young German<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Becker?</note> of my acquaintance lent me your Book,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Beitr&#xE4;ge zur Poesie mit Besonderer Hinweisung auf Goethe</hi> (<date when="1823">1823</date>).</note> about a year ago; so that, on your own footing, you are not unknown to me; to say nothing of your close connexion with a man, who gives an interest of a quite peculiar sort to whatever or whomsoever he may be related with.</p>
<p>Your promised publication on the three national Criticisms of <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> cannot fail to be an object of great curiosity to me: <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> I reckon to be a piece of that depth, and genuine life, that it will <pb id="pg-04-426" n="04:426"/>yield a new significance almost from every new point of sight; and, as in the case of all true <hi rend="italic">Creations</hi>, the Critic in judging it, never so faithfully, will not so much exhaust and completely depict <hi rend="italic">its</hi> whole spirit and purport, as depict his own. Viewed under a national aspect, the comparison of these Criticisms may give rise to many important considerations. Meanwhile let me thank you for the kind judgement you express of my poor labours in this matter: it were foolish enough in me, did I subscribe <hi rend="italic">literally</hi> to your encomiums but I see, the truth of my Endeavour is recognised, and these things are meant for my encouragement, in which sense I gratefully accept them. My own obligations to Goethe have been such as they are to no other man; a truth which, as a well-wisher to my brethren of this age, mostly in need of similar help, I hold myself bound, on all fit occasions, to make known: but that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should in any wise concern himself with my exertions was a thing I had not hoped for, the more delightful therefore, now when it actually occurs.</p>
<p>As to the reception which <hi rend="italic">Helena</hi> has met with generally in England I can say little. The Newspaper Critics in most quarters, as I have understood, declared their dissatisfaction with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at least, and I suppose, by implication, with my original. These, however, are a class of persons from whom next to no light is to be obtained; except it were on the length to which Triviality has extended its empire over the British printing world, where indeed we knew already that, as in most other countries, it reigns well nigh <hi rend="italic">supreme</hi>. The aspects of our Literature at present, had one a weak Faith, are in fact discouraging enough: our real Poets, Wordsworth, Coleridge driven into silence by the state of public taste; and the air filled with nothing, as it were, but the chirping of ten thousand grasshoppers, each firmly believing that it is a mighty Singer. Politics also take up far too much attention, even with the best heads; as if a man were alive in the world not to <hi rend="italic">live</hi>, but forever and ever to mend his <hi rend="italic">house</hi> for living in. Thomas Moore is nothing better than one of your <hi rend="italic">Heinses</hi>, or other <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kraft-m&#xE4;nner</hi></foreign> [affected strongmen]; he has published an <hi rend="italic">Epicurean</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilhelm Heinse (<date when="1746">1746</date>&#x2013;<date when="1803">1803</date>), German writer. The <hi rend="italic">Kraftm&#xE4;nner</hi>, including Byron as well as Thomas Moore, were writers of great energy and force but little intellect. Moore&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Epicurean</hi>, his last book of verse, was published in <date when="1827">1827</date>.</note> resplendent with gold-leaf and Bristol diamonds, and inwardly made of mere Potter&#x2019;s-clay. Walter Scott manufactures Novels. Peace be with them! But the spirit of England is not dead, only asleep; neither, as I firmly believe, is the day distant when these men will be for most part swept into the lumber-room, and quite another scene enacted.&#x2014; <pb id="pg-04-427" n="04:427"/>In your Germany too, I grieve to say, I can see less encouragement, for the coming time, than I once did. Were it not for Goethe, who is himself a nation, one might ask where are your Schillers, Herders, Wielands; your Kants and Fichtes and Jean Pauls? Schelling and Tieck are still with you, and I hardly know another. But time is still rich; neither is it my part to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">difficilis, garrulus laudator temporis acti</hi></foreign>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A difficult, chattering eulogist of the time past (Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, l. 173). Horace wrote <foreign><hi rend="italic">querulus</hi></foreign> not <foreign><hi rend="italic">garrulus</hi></foreign>.</note> Nay perhaps, according to your wise adage, the case is only that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> &#x2018;cannot see the wood for the Trees.&#x2019; Show it me, and you will do me a real service.</p>
<p>I must not omit to mention that I have myself been slinging a smooth stone from the brook against certain of your Philistines.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Sam. 17:40.</note> There will be a short Paper in next <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, entitled <hi rend="italic">German Playwrights</hi>, which I recommend to you in some tolerant hour. It turns on Grillparzer, Klingemann,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst August Friedrich Klingemann (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831">1831</date>).</note> and Dr M&#xfc;llner:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adolf M&#xfc;llner (<date when="1774">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1829">1829</date>).</note> I wrote it unwillingly, by earnest &#x201C;request of friends&#x201D;;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Fraser and Black, Young, and Young, of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>, had urged Carlyle to make his attack on M&#xfc;llner and some of the other German playwrights of the day as fiery as possible in his &#x201C;German Playwrights.&#x201D; This, they felt, was good journalism and would help to correct current British taste. See Black, Young, and Young to TC, <date when="1828-09-18">18 Sept.</date> For &#x201C;request of friends,&#x201D; cf. Pope, &#x201C;Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot,&#x201D; 1. 44.</note> and promise for a long time to steer clear of these unfortunate people. The mischief was that some other persons among us were violently recommending M&#xfc;llner and Company, as the true pillars of German Literature; for human Stupidity is infinite. But next time, I mean to write on <hi rend="italic">Novalis</hi>, and not in the style of mockery, but in the true &#x2018;mystic&#x2019; vein, which is thought to be peculiar to me. For you must know that I pass here generally enough for a &#x2018;Mystic,&#x2019; or man half-drowned in the abysses of German speculation; which, considering everything, is all, in my opinion, exactly as it should be. I confess I begin to grow tired of <hi rend="italic">Reviewing</hi>; but whether there is any force in me to produce an original work is a question which I am still agitating, and I believe, shall never leave at rest, till I have practically <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>,&#x2014;and too probably got answer in the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi>.</p>
<p>You inquire kindly about our household arrangements here. I may say that <supplied>[I]</supplied> reckon this position at Craigenputtoch quite an original one for a Philosopher and lover of Literature; as it were, a sort of <pb id="pg-04-428" n="04:428"/>Crusoe&#x2019;s Island, where the whole happiness or sorrow depends on the Islander himself. We are busy making clean gravel-roads, digging gardens for the planting of many a flower and shrub in Spring. These grim moors are all ice-bound for the present, and doubly stern and solitary. Nevertheless we bolt the door against Frost, and utterly defy him with blazing fires. By day, I lop trees for exercise, or gallop down the valley on an Irish nag; and at night, when the curtains are all drawn, and the hearth swept, and the fire bright and strong, it is even a luxury to listen to the piping of the tempests, and think that far and wide the black winter is looking in on us in vain. I read or write all morning; for two hours every evening, my Wife and I are learning Spanish; we have already finished the first volume of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>. From time to time also, we have real <hi rend="italic">Literary</hi> visiters, men from the &#x2018;Modern Athens&#x2019; as Scotchmen fondly denominate Edinburgh; and then there is an expounding and a canvassing <foreign><hi rend="italic">de omni scibili</hi></foreign> [concerning everything knowable],<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270604-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1827-06-04">4 June 1827</date></ref>.</note> such as, to a certainty, was never heard in these desarts before. Often we speak of Weimar, and oftener think of it: a half mournful wish lies in us, which sometimes rises into a faint hope, one day to visit that little city, which in our view is for the present before all other cities of the world. When this wish is to be gratified, or whether ever, is still too uncertain. Meanwhile, let us be thankful that we can send Letters thither, and hope for answers to them. I have a Brother, perfecting himself in the study of Medicine in your Country, whom I expected home this winter with fullest tidings from the Dukedom: however he has left M&#xfc;nchen, not for Edinburgh, but for Wien, and does not return to us till Spring. I expect he will come by Prag, Dresden and Weimar. Are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever coming to Britain? What a scene it would be to have you here! Meanwhile is there <hi rend="italic">any</hi> service that I can do you? If so, apply to me without reluctance, for it will give me the truest pleasure. My Wife unites with me in best regards.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> arrived this morning to breakfast, and set the table in a roar,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, V, i.</note> hearty enough to make up for the fatal nature of both the others that came along with it. For you are to know that we had two Letters besides; one as it chanced for every member of the household, including the servant maid herself. I burst open mine; and was obliged to close it again after the first three words: it was from New York, and belonged to quite a different man, an Advocate in your city, I suppose, with whom I have no community except that of name.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle, the advocate, of Edinburgh, to whom Carlyle often referred as his &#x201C;double.&#x201D;</note> Our poor maid fared still worse: she had infused a certain modicum of tea, and was quietly toasting bread for the nourishment of these earthly bodies, when the fateful scroll with &#x201C;hast&#x201D; (haste) written on it was delivered to her: instantly I hear a crash as of broken crokery, then a movement to and fro; breakfast lingers in appearing: Jane goes to investigate the matter; finds that it is a proposal of marriage, or perhaps it might be refusal to marry, from some Shoulderknot<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly &#x201C;liveried servant.&#x201D; Carlyle used the word in <date when="1826">1826</date> at the beginning of <hi rend="italic">Wotton Reinfred</hi>, where he describes Edmund Walter &#x201C;with his body and shoulder knots.&#x201D;</note> in the North Country; in consequence of which the lovesick Abigail has smashed that old-established teapot into a thousand shards! Conceive our situation: a raw <date when="1828-12">December</date> morning; one Letter <pb id="pg-04-430" n="04:430"/>still sealed, another broken by mistake on the table; and apparently even the hope of tea evaporated into air! However, as I hinted, tea did arrive, indeed with astonishing promptitude; your Letter is opened; and in one loud peal of innocent laughter, the whole catastrophes forgotten. This surely is what Baillie Waugh<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edinburgh bookseller. Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210225-TC-JCE-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCE</corr>, <date when="1821-02-25">25 Feb. 1821</date></ref>.</note> would call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">foin wroiting</hi>&#x201D;; such an effect has it on the minds of men.</p>
<p>But to be serious one moment. Here is a Letter for the <hi rend="italic">Opium-Eater</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Quincey (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281211-TC-TD-01"><sic>next letter</sic><corr>TC to TD, <date when="1828-12-11">11 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>).</note> whose address, if you cannot find it elsewhere, you will learn at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Post</hi>, in Register Street. There is at the end a small but sufficient introduction for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in that Sheet, if you choose to deliver it in person, or rather to call after it is delivered: you will find Dequincey a man of very considerable genius; and labouring in a state of depression (for he is by birth a man of fortune), which renders him still more interesting. He also is a German, a Kantist; a Mystic also, I suppose.</p>
<p>Would you ask Clark, as you pass some day: What he has done with my No. 4 of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>? It is not at Sinclair the Bookseller&#x2019;s in Dumfries; should have been sent to the &#x201C;care of Mr Aitken, Academy-street&#x201D; and so may probably have gone to the Limbo of vanity some weeks before its time. I have a <hi rend="italic">Life of Heyne</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1828-10">Oct.</date> issue.</note> in it; not worth sixpence; and all misprinted, I believe, for the Proof-sheets were lost. There will be a highly <hi rend="italic">un</hi>mystical Paper in the next No.; on <hi rend="italic">German Playwrights</hi>, without any undue admiration from beginning to end. I mean to continue reviewing, in that melancholy vehicle, for some months yet.</p>
<p>By all means buy me that <hi rend="italic">Spanish Grammar</hi>; that I may light my Pipe with that other one at the very earliest date. <hi rend="italic">Harmoniere&#x2019;s</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. Hamoni&#xE8;re, French grammarian, wrote and edited grammars, phrasebooks, and dictionaries Carlyle presumably refers to his edition (<date when="1818">1818</date>) of the Spanish grammar by the Abb&#xE9; Auguste-Louis Josse.</note> is the title, which I mention because without any exception known to me, it is the worst <hi rend="italic">Grammar</hi> in existence at this era. Nevertheless we shall be thro&#x2019; the first vol. of <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> tomorrow night; and have liked it exceedingly. Few languages seem equal to the Spanish; few lips so melodious, in any language, as those of the old maimed Soldier; who had not, in this world, so much as a house to live in, except a Jail. Shame on us! who are <hi rend="italic">we</hi>; and what do <hi rend="italic">we</hi> complain of, knowing that such things have been and are and will be!</p>
<p>Persevere in your German: Lessing is a true man, tho&#x2019; a tart one; <pb id="pg-04-431" n="04:431"/>and Repp<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >T. G. Repp at the Advocates&#x2019; Library. See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270415-TC-NHJ-01">TC to NHJ, <date when="1827-04-15">15 April 1827</date></ref>.</note> will carry you thro&#x2019; triumphantly, if you apply. Make my best respects to him. By and by he will let you into Schillers <hi rend="italic">Jungfrau von Orleans</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">History of the Netherlands</hi>; either of which will interest you more.</p>
<p>Farther I must say that you are infinitely unjust to &#x201C;Blockheads,&#x201D; as they are called. Ask yourself seriously within your own heart, what right <hi rend="italic">have</hi> you to live <supplied>[wise]</supplied>ly in God&#x2019;s world, and they <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, to live a little less wisely? Is the<supplied>[re]</supplied> a m<supplied>[an mo]</supplied>re to be condoled with, nay I will say, to be cherished and tenderly-treated, than a man that has no brain? My Purse is empty: it can be filled again, the Jew Rothschild could fill it; or I can even live with it very very far from full. But gracious Heavens! <hi rend="italic">What</hi> is to be done with my <hi rend="italic">empty Head</hi>?&#x2014; Consider too, if you object to the vanity of Blockheads, how little harm it does. If a man <hi rend="italic">will</hi> wear a bladder full of wind, and call it a Purse full of gold, does not every shopman he offers it to, shed a kind tear over him?&#x2014; But the &#x201C;Leddy,&#x201D; as she is called here, wants to say a word or two: so good night! Write whenever you have leisure, and send me all manner of tidings: at present I do not even see an Edinburgh newspaper. <closer><salute>Ever truly yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having the opportunity of a frank, I cannot resist the temptation to send you a few lines, were it only to signify that two well-wishers of yours are still alive in these remote moors, and often thinking of you with the old friendly feelings. My Wife encourages me in this innocent purpose: she has learned lately that you were inquiring for her, of some female Friend; nay even promising to visit us here, a fact of the most interesting sort to both of us. I am to say, therefore, that your presence at this fireside will diffuse no ordinary gladness over all members of the household; that our warmest welcome, and such solacements as even the desart does not refuse, are, at any time and at all times, in store for one we love so well. Neither is this expedition so impracticable: we lie but a short way out of your direct route to Westmoreland; communicate, by gravelled roads, with Dumfries, and other places in the habitable globe; were you to warn us of your approach, it might all be made easy enough. And then such a treat it would be to hear the sound of Philosophy and Literature, in the hitherto quite savage wolds, where since the Creation of the World no such music, scarcely even articulate speech, had been uttered <hi rend="italic">or</hi> dreamed of! Come, therefore, come and see us; for we often long after you: nay I can promise too that we are almost a unique sight in the British Empire; such a quantity of German Periodicals, and mystic speculation, embosomed in plain Scottish <hi rend="italic">Peat-moor</hi> being nowhere else that I know of to be met with.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-04-433" n="04:433"/>In idle hours, we sometimes project founding a sort of Colony here, to be called the &#x2018;Misanthropic Society&#x2019;; the settlers all to be men of a certain philosophic depth, and intensely sensible of the present state of Literature; each to have his own cottage, encircled with roses or thistles as he might prefer; a Library and pantry within, and huge stack of turf-fuel without; fenced off from his neighbours by fir woods, and when he pleased, by cast-metal railing; so that each might feel himself strictly an individual, and free as a son of the Wilderness: but the whole Settlement to meet weekly over coffee; and there unite in their <foreign><hi rend="italic">Miserere</hi></foreign>; or what were better, hurl forth their defiance, pity, expostulation, over the whole universe civil, literary and religious. I reckon this place a much fitter site for such an Establishment than your Lake Country; a region abounding in natural beauty, but blown on by coach horns, betrodden by picturesque Tourists, and otherwise exceedingly desecrated by too frequent resort; whereas here, tho&#x2019; still in communication with the manufacturing world, we have a solitude altogether Druidical, grim hills tenanted chiefly by the wild grouse, tarns and brooks that have soaked and slumbered u<supplied>[n]</supplied>molested since the Deluge of Noah, and nothing to disturb you with speech, except Arcturus and Orion, and the Spirit of Nature, in the Heaven and in the Earth, as it manifests itself in anger or love, and utters its inexplicable tidings, unheard by the mortal ear. But the misery is: the almost total want of Colonists! Would <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come hither, and be king over us; <hi rend="italic">then</hi> indeed we had made a fair beginning, and the &#x2018;Bog School&#x2019; might snap its fingers at the &#x2018;Lake School&#x2019; itself, and hope to be one day recognised of all men.</p>
<p>But enough of this fooling! Better were it to tell you in plain prose what little can be said of my own welfare; and inquire in the same dialect after yours. It will gratify you to learn that, here in the desart, as in the crowded city, I am moderately active and well; better in health, not worse, and tho&#x2019; active only on the small scale, yet in my own opinion honestly, and to as much result as has been usual with me at any time. We have horses to ride on, gardens to cultivate, tight walls and strong fires to defend us against Winter; books to read, paper to scribble on; and no man or thing, at least in this visible Earth, to make us afraid; for I reckon that so securely sequestered are we, not only would no Catholic rebellion, but even no new Hengist-and-Horsa Invasion, in any wise disturb our tranquillity. True, we have no society; but who has, in the strict sense of that word? I have never had any, worth speaking much about, since I came into this world: in the next, it may be, they will order matters better. Meanwhile, <pb id="pg-04-434" n="04:434"/>if we have not the <hi rend="italic">wheat</hi>, in great quantity, we are nearly altogether free from the <hi rend="italic">chaff</hi>, which often in this matter is highly annoying to weak nerves. My Wife and I are busy learning Spanish; far advanced in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> already: I purpose writing mystical <hi rend="italic">Reviews</hi> for somewhat more than a Twelvemonth to come; have Greek to read, and the whole Universe to study (for I understand less and less of it); so that here as well as elsewhere I find that a man may &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dree his wierd</hi></foreign>&#x2019; [endure his destiny] (serve out his earthly Apprenticeship) with reasonable composure; and wait what the flight of years may bring him, little disappointed (unless he is a fool) if it bring him mere <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>&#x2014;save what he has already, a Body and a Soul, more cunning and costly treasures than all Golconda and Potosi could purchase for him. What would the vain worm, Man, be at? Has he not a Head, to speak of nothing else, a Head (be it <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a Hat or without one) full of far richer things than Windsor Palace, or the Brighton Teapot<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., the Royal Pavilion, Brighton, built in an extravagant mixture of styles for George IV when he was Prince of Wales.</note> added to it? What are all Dresden Picture-galleries, and Magazines <foreign><hi rend="italic">des Arts et des M&#xE8;tiers</hi></foreign> [of the Arts and Handicrafts] to the strange painting, and thrice wonderful and thrice precious workmanship that goes on under the cranium of a Beggar? What <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be added to him, or taken from him, by the hatred or love of all men? The gray-paper, or the white silk-paper, in which the gold-ingot is wrapped: the gold is inalienable; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is the gold.&#x2014; But truce also to this moralizing! I had a thousand things to ask, concerning you; your employments, purposes, sufferings and pleasures. Will you not write to me, will you not come to me and tell? Believe it, you are well loved here; and none feels better than I what a spirit is for the present eclipsed in clouds. For the present it can only be: time and chance are for all men; that troublous season will end; and one day with more joyful, not deeper or truer regard, I shall see you &#x2018;yourself again.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle may have in mind Shakespeare&#x2019;s &#x201C;Richard is himself again.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220527-TC-JBW-01"><sic>JBW to TC</sic><corr>TC to JBW</corr>, <date when="1822-05-27">27 May 1822</date></ref>.</note> Meanwhile, pardon me this intrusion; and write, if you have a vacant hour which you would fill with a good action&#x2014; Mr Jeffrey is still anxious to know you: has he ever succeeded? We are not to be in Edinburgh I believe till spring; but I will send him a Letter to you (with your permission) by the first conveyance.&#x2014; Remember me with best regards to Professor Wilson and Sir W. Hamilton, neither of whom must forget me; not omitting the honest Gordon who, I know will not.</p>
<p>The bearer of this Letter is Henry Inglis, a young gentleman of <pb id="pg-04-435" n="04:435"/>no ordinary talent and worth; in whom, as I believe, <foreign><hi rend="italic">es steckt gar viel</hi></foreign> [there is quite a bit]. Should he call, himself, pray let this be an introduction, for he reverences all spiritual worth, and you also will learn to love him.&#x2014; <closer><salute>With all friendly sentiments, I am ever, My Dear Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Misfortunes seldom come single</hi>&#x201D;; so here is another letter for you, and of the most vexations sort too, being all in the commission way. For alas, Dear, I can no longer hide the sad truth from myself, and as little would I conceal it from you my early friend that my tea and sugar are drawing fast to a close. And should a fall of snow take place in this state of things, blocking up the <hi rend="italic">passes</hi> and cutting off our imports!&#x2014;the idea is too horrible. But you will &#x201C;do the impossible&#x201D; to help me; for are you not &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">obliging</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">goodnatured</hi>&#x2019; to a proverb? and yet if you had to begin the world again, I doubt whether [with your country cousins at least]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s brackets.</note> you would cultivate so praiseworthy a reputation&#x2014; Just see what it involves you in! here must you tramp away to Pollands&#x2014;to the Waterloo tea warehouse&#x2014;the Register paperwarehouse&#x2014;the St Andrew&#x2019;s Square china-warehouse&#x2014;and buy and arrange and despatch&#x2014;and all thro&#x2019; no fault of yours; but because you have the merit of being the most obliging person of my acquaintance. Such a reward for Virtue! but the Moralists say virtue is its own reward; and the Transcendentalists go a step farther, and maintain that virtue must have no view to reward whatever, else it is no virtue but merely a cunning calculation of profit and loss. This last, I take it, is the opinion which would stand you in most stead on the present occasion.</p>
<p>Having preluded so long it is time I were coming to the tune which runs thus&#x2014; Six pounds of tea [from the Waterloo company]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s brackets.</note> at 5/4<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and two pounds of coffee&#x2014; From Pollands three stones of sugar at 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014;and two stones at 6&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014;also 8 pounds of rice (whole): and here there is a sort of &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Da Capo</hi></foreign>&#x2019; to be performed; for in addition <pb id="pg-04-436" n="04:436"/>to what is already set down, you will have the goodness to get other two pounds of tea (of the same quality) and one other stone of 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi> pence sugar&#x2014;packed up by themselves&#x2014;being for a seperate purpose. Then we are woefully off here as to pens and paper, which for people who live by writing are as essential as sugar and tea. So that it is earnestly desired and (your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">goodnature</hi>&#x201D; being so notorious) even pretty confidently expected, that you will proceed to a certain paperwarehouse in Register Street and procure us a supply as follows. eight slips of post paper&#x2014;wove&#x2014;blueish&#x2014;without any bath stamp&#x2014;the same, in short, as this I am writing on, only a degree smaller (for me, or rather my Husband is &#x201C;a great connoisseur in <hi rend="italic">paper</hi>&#x201D;) he used to buy such at the above mentioned place about a half-penny a sheet&#x2014; I mention this to help you to the right sort&#x2014;not to tie you down in the matter of a halfpenny. Secondly three quires of <hi rend="italic">long</hi> paper&#x2014;24 sheets each&#x2014;this also to be <hi rend="italic">blue</hi>&#x2014;and a ragged edge no objection. The sort he used to buy was called &#x2018;scrolling paper&#x2019;&#x2014;or broken paper and cost between a <hi rend="italic">farthing</hi> and a halfpenny a sheet. Now the Lord help you thro&#x2019; this transaction, for as you perceive it is of the most delicate nature. A quarter hundred <hi rend="italic">made</hi> pens of the best sort, and two sticks of red sealingwax in addition to the above will put us in a situation for holding correspondence with the home worl<supplied>[d a]</supplied>ll winter. And now comes my last wan<supplied>[t]</supplied> which I am sure you will &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">welcom</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">e in</hi>]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">your choicest mood</hi>, as his gracious Maje<supplied>[sty d]</supplied>id the youngest of the Misses Titler<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ritchie says that <hi rend="italic">Titler</hi> probably should be <hi rend="italic">Tytler</hi>, perhaps presented to George IV on his visit to Edinburgh.

For you must know that some mornings ago there came a letter to Grace Macdonald from some absent Lover with &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">hast</hi>&#x2019; on the outside and heaven knows what within&#x2014;but things of moment, evidently, from the consequences&#x2014;as she all at once bolted up from her peaceful occupation of toasting bread for breakfast&#x2014;and dashed the poor old coffee pot with its precious contents on the kitchen floor&#x2014;one more proof if any such were wanting that &#x201C;accidents will happen in the best regulated families.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Now as to the packing of these things&#x2014;I am really without any blarney, seriously vexed to put you to so much trouble&#x2014;but I see no other way for it except that you should pack them at your own house in some box of my Mother&#x2019;s (if you have such a thing) or of your <pb id="pg-04-437" n="04:437"/>own (and it will be returned by the first opportunity) and sending it from thence to the Dumfries Carrier (charging the porterage &#x26;c to my account if you would ever have me to employ you again) addressed as formerly to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aitken Academy Street. For the last supply was sent off by Pollands in the thin<supplied>[n]</supplied>est of sacks, so that had it rained, as it does almost continually at present, it must have been entirely spoiled by the way&#x2014; And should I find my sugar all melted, and the paper all blot<supplied>[t]</supplied>ed, and the coffeepot broken&#x2014; I might be tempted to do some desperate thing, that would haunt your conscience to the end of your life! You will do this then, for the love you bear me or at all events for the love of doing a good action&#x2014;and you will believe that if our situations were exchanged I would do as much for you in return? We have resolved on deferring our visit to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> until the Spring&#x2014;when it will be in all respects more convenient&#x2014; Why do you not write?</p>
<p>My kindest regards to your Uncle&#x2014; <closer><salute>I shall remain som<supplied>[e]</supplied> shillings in your debt but always affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Well dearest,</salute> you are one of the sublimest geniuses that the world ever saw! To imagine for a moment I would not live anywhere on earth rather then in this vile Haddington! What a surprising, <hi rend="italic">inhuman</hi> scheme! bring me back to Haddington after all my longing to get out of it, back to such an Inferno just when I thought my deliverance sure. <foreign>Nein, Nein</foreign>, my will is not so entirely &#x201C;cast into fusion&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech originating with someone who had intended to say &#x201C;cast into confusion.&#x201D;</note> that it should by any possible process be moulded to <hi rend="italic">this</hi>. Only think Mr. Carlyle could you, you of all men living&#x2014;associate with or bear to see <hi rend="italic">your</hi> wife associate with the inane, low minded people who make up the society of Haddington. No truly, unless you be an infinitely more tolerant person than I have hitherto taken you for&#x2014;more tolerant than I should like to think you, you would rather at once curse God &#x26; die.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 2:9.</note> The last proposed arrangement then is out of the question; for your sake not less than my own it must not be&#x2014; For really to slam this door in the face of people whom it has been open to from my childhood upwards and who with all their faults &#x26; failings have never behaved but civilly &#x26; often even kindly to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, would be such an assertion of the independance [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of the human mind as I confess I have not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> got sufficient nerve for. So if you please Dearest, indeed whether you please or no, we will not live at Haddington, so long as there is a habitable world all about it. And my Mother may conclude what bargain she pleases with Dr. Fyffe, just the same as if no such proposal had been made to her. This is rined <supplied>[?]</supplied> &#x26; knit.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The phrase seems to mean &#x201C;done,&#x201D; with a strong sense of finality.</note> And now having as usual demolished your project I come next to set up one of my own, or rather one of my Mother&#x2019;s in its place.</p>
<p><foreign>Eh bien!</foreign> would you have any objection so soon as your task is completed to bring me home to Edin. at once; provided some kind geni of the lamp was meanwhile to get a house there all ready furnished for our reception. My good Mother is extremely desirous that this should be the way of it&#x2014;that we should we have [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] a comfortable home at our outset in life thro her means. And as I am fully persuaded that she will have more real enjoyment in doing us this kindness than all the fine gold in the world could procure her in any other way, I for one have been inclined to give a grateful assent to the generous proposal. And will not you my best Beloved do the same? Assuredly you will. But Whitsunday is at hand; so that if we are to come to Edin. before winter there is no time to be lost in looking out for the said house So do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> lose no moment in transmitting to my Mother the seal of your sovereignty for it would be folly I presume to propose your coming &#x26; choosing for yourself in your present press of business. However if we had only some idea of the whereabouts I have no fear that she &#x26; I together should be able to suit your taste in a habitation. Do you like Morning side<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At this time a village on the southern outskirts of Edinburgh.</note> or is there any other situation you like better. It would certainly be preferable both in respect to comfort &#x26; economy that we should live out of the hubbub of the town, at least this is my view of the matter, and yours if I mistake not is the same. Forgive me for wishing to take the labour of the Commonwealth <hi rend="italic">this once</hi> into my own hands, it is not out of any love of rule but merely to save you all sort of trouble &#x26; annoyance.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane wrote to Carlyle on [<date when="1826-05-23">23 May</date>] to say that her mother had rented for them a house at 21 Comely Bank, Edinburgh (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260523-JBW-TC-01"><sic>4:97&#x2013;98</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1826-05-23">23 May 1826</date></corr></ref>).</note></p>
<p>Did you ever see such a letter, so ugly so all said so altogether abominably? But I am unwilling to miss a single post&#x2014;and today I am hurried beyond all belief. Dr. Fyffe is coming to take a survey of the house again along with his Father (for the third &#x26; I hope in Heaven the last time) and as his Doctorship and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> are twenty times worse friends now than ever before I must shift my quarters until the inquisatorial visit be past. Give my kindest love &#x26; a kiss to Jane.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s sister.</note> After I had dispatched my last letter it occurred to me in the dead of night that I forgot to thank her for the wristlets and I actually all but cried with vexation it was so kind of the little soul! tell her there never were such wristlets seen and that I have laid them by in the most secret part of my wardrobe in expectation of a future winter Dear Jane she shall be my child after all. My love to your Mother also and the rest</p>

<salute>My Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>I got your letter on monday; and I need not tell you that the contents of it gratified me not a little. You must have had a busy time of it lately; taking houses, and getting degrees! Let us be thankful that things wear so fair an aspect and have hitherto turned out so well. I doubt not but we shall all by and by be wonderfully comfortable.</p>
<p>I gratified all hands here, as I myself had been, by informing them of your first step towards graduation. &#x201C;Not of works, lest we should boast!&#x201D; the Apostle says;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eph. 2:9.</note> but really it is fair enough to go thro&#x2019; so handsomely, without aid from any grinder or <hi rend="italic">honer</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Someone to sharpen his wits: a tutor.</note> whatever, but purely by one&#x2019;s own resources. For the rest, doubt not that your moodiness was temporary; the slackening of the long-stretched cord, when the arrow was shot away: in a day the yew will tighten it again. The world is but beginning for you yet; and it is wide and broad, far beyond what you conjecture. It really is, Jack; tho&#x2019; in hypochondriacal moments, you will not believe a word of it. Come to me wherever I be, when you have finished; and take plenty of time to consider what your next step must be. While either of us has a home, the other cannot want one.</p>
<p>We are all got over with whole bones to this new country;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Mainhill and Hoddam Hill to Scotsbrig.</note> and every soul of us, our mother to begin with, much in love with it. The house is in bad order; but we hope to have it soon repaired; and for farming purposes, it is an excellent &#x201C;shell of a house.&#x201D; Then we have a <foreign><hi rend="italic">linn</hi></foreign> [waterfall] with crags and bushes, and a &#x201C;fairy <foreign>knowe</foreign> [knoll]&#x201D; tho&#x2019; no fairies that I have seen yet; and, cries our Mother, abundance of grand thready peats, and water from the brook, and no reek and no Honour<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. Matthew Sharpe, the landlord at Mainhill.</note> to pester us! To say nothing, cries our father, of the eighten <hi rend="italic">yeacre</hi> [acre] of the best barley in the country; and bog-hay, adds Alick, to fatten scores of young beasts!</p>
<p>In fact making all allowance for newfangledness, it is a <hi rend="italic">much</hi> better place, so far as I can judge, than any our people have yet been in; and among far better and kindlier sort of people. I believe of a truth they will find themselves much obliged to his Honour for persecuting them away. Long life to his Honour! I myself like the place considerably better, tho&#x2019; I have slept but ill yet, and am billus enough. But I have mounted your old straw-hat again; and fairly betaken me to work; and should, as we say Aberdeen-awa, &#x201C;be bauld to compleen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The other day, just on Monday indeed w<supplied>[ith my]</supplied> letter in my hand, I met &#x201C;Wull Eggar&#x201D; or &#x201C;Don <supplied>[Quixote&#x201D;?]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> of Deerhopes, mounted on a clipt and garnished quadruped, riding with an air of daring enterprise towards Ecclefechan. Laughter had fled from his diaphragm, and he told me at last that he was on his way to Annan, there to <hi rend="italic">set up</hi>, in place of Waugh,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Smith Waugh.</note> or rather in absence of him. Thus round and round about go we! Poor Waugh is still in the Kings Arms inn; madly in love, they say, and persuaded that the Chambermaid has a mind to do him bodily harm, for reasons to herself best known. Seriously, I wish I could see Waugh: he has no friend on Earth, scarcely any relative; and Heaven knows, I would gladly enough see him act more wisely.</p>
<p>I have had a vile bout with this life of Hoffmann: it is far the worst, and has been far the most troublesome of them all. Henceforth <supplied>[I hope]</supplied> to supply M&#x2019;Cork regularly. Write more at large if you can next time. Alick goes to Whitsuntide fair at Dumfries tomorrow, and this should go with him; and all hands are already sound asleep.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I shall now make to you in writing the proposal I lately made in words, on the part of Herr von Lichtenthaler, Keeper of the Royal Library at Munich.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:361</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April</date></corr></ref>, where Carlyle describes his earlier conversation with Irving.</note></p>
<p>It appears that in the Munich Library there are about 150,000 <hi rend="italic">Duplicate volumes,</hi> &#x201C;some of them very valuable&#x201D;: these the Directors are desirous of exchanging with similarly superfluous Duplicates in other Libraries.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This information had come through John at this time staying in Munich (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:357</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April</date></corr></ref>).</note> Should there be any considerable stock of such in your Collection, perhaps you might not feel disinclined to this negotiation; in which case, a Catalogue of the Munich Duplicates, with the price and external character of each work, would be transmitted to you; and a corresponding Catalogue on your part being sent thither, the business could be transacted without difficulty, and, as might be hoped, to mutual advantage.</p>
<p>If you judge it suitable to entertain this proposal, I shall beg of you to let me know: mentioning in general the number of volumes you may have it in your power so to offer in exchange.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving thought the Advocates&#x2019; Library only had &#x201C;a few hundreds&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280416-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:361</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-04-16">16 April</date></corr></ref>).</note> The affair, once entered upon, may be prosecuted and concluded in concert with the Baron von Zetto, Bavarian Ambassador in London.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Auguste von Cetto (<date when="1794">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), Bavarian ambassador to London, later to Vienna, son of Anton von Cetto (<date when="1756">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830">1830</date>), diplomat.</note></p>
<p>I make a similar application to Mr Ellis of the British Museum,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Henry Ellis (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">1869</date>), principal librarian of the British Museum, <date when="1827">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856">56</date>; knighted, <date when="1833">1833</date>.</note> to Dr Bandinel of the Bodleian Library;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulkeley Bandinel (<date when="1781">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861">1861</date>), principal librarian of the Bodleian, <date when="1813">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860">60</date>.</note> and to no other.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have sent up my last packet of sheets to honest Mr M&#x2019;Corkindale, the most faithful and best of Printers; with directions to give you the <hi rend="italic">Revise</hi> of the Preface and Title-page; which so soon as you have satisfied yourself about it, they can fold up (uncut) in the shape of a letter, and send me by post, to look at once more before it go to press.</p>
<p>I bow without repining to your condemnation (if irrevocable) of this unhappy Title; judging you to understand far more about it than I. Nevertheless, if we except &#x201C;German Novelists with&#x201D; &#x26;c, which was the Title I had all along in my head, I cannot think of any better, or even of any other that shall express the gist and purpose of the Book. The present one undoubtedly is hard and heavy; but it has this first and most indispensable quality; and to my own mind, it does not appear altogether uninviting of investigation, or unlikely to attract the better class of readers. Its hardness of intelligibility, provided it <hi rend="italic">be</hi> really at last intelligible, may perhaps rather provoke curiosity than satisfy it. A reader often wondering what the deuce it means, will look into the Preface for information; and be tempted, who knows, (consummation devoutly to be wished!)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 3.1.</note> to table his cash, and take the Book home in his pocket! Such was my view of it: but as I said, it is the view of one who can pretend to none but theoretical knowledge on the matter. For the rest, do not think that I like this Title; on the contrary I rather dislike it, and have chosen it only as the bad best; as expressing (the former one being forestalled) the object of the Book in plain rugged and firm language, and distinguishing our <hi rend="italic">Novelists</hi> at a glance, from all the Roscoe, Gillies &#x26; Company fraternity,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Roscoe, <hi rend="italic">The German Novelists</hi>, 4 vols. (London, <date when="1826">1826</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260731-TC-WT-01"><sic>4:120</sic><corr>TC to WT, <date when="1826-07-31">31 July 1826</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261204-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>161</sic><corr>TC to NHJ, <date when="1826-12-04">4 Dec. 1826</date></corr></ref>. R. P. Gillies, <hi rend="italic">German Stories</hi>, 3 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1826">1826</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261204-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>4:162</sic><corr>TC to NHJ, <date when="1826-12-04">4 Dec. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> beyond the possibility of confusion. I confess however that I rather have a pique at <hi rend="italic">dandyism</hi> both in men and books; and so perhaps rather an undue tolerance for the opposite excess. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Highways and Byeways</hi>,&#x201D; for instance, is a book which I should never buy, or care for looking into; and I am too apt to forget that many others might.</p>
<p>One other thing I may add: &#x201C;Romances,&#x201D; &#x201C;Tales,&#x201D; &#x201C;Novels&#x201D; &#x26;c should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> (unless in the very last extremity) be the Title of your work. First, because it is a Title which promises nothing, and has been used already by many men and women, Holcraft (Gillies), Cruikshank (?) &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Holcraft, <hi rend="italic">Tales from the German</hi> (London, <date when="1826">1826</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Tales of Humour and Romance Selected from Popular German Writers</hi> (London, <date when="1829">1829</date>); <hi rend="italic">German Popular Stories</hi>, illus. by George Cruikshank (London, <date when="1823">1823</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261204-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>4:162</sic><corr>TC to NHJ, <date when="1826-12-04">4 Dec. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note> Secondly because the Book is not of Novels but of Novelwriters, or at the utmost of Novel-writing. I think you should keep this steadily in view.</p>
<p>After all, I believe, the Title is of very little real moment in the long run; for if the Book is a ragwort no name of rose or lavender will keep it from offending the nostril; and <foreign><hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi></foreign> also. Therefore do you and Mr Ballantyne take solemn counsel together; read over the Preface, and settle the whole according to your best judgement: I shall scarcely object, I think, be the result what it may. All I want is that it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> settled: yet let not this hurry you too much, for I can wait.</p>
<p>I have sent Mr Buchanan&#x2019;s books, which have long been lying on my conscience: be so good as return him my best thanks along with them, and real regret that I should have so overstretched his goodness. Desire him also from me to direct you how to pay Perthes &#x26; Besser if he can; I am very anxious that the debt were cancelled.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Buchanan of Leith, a friend of William Tait, mentioned as a source for borrowing German books (<ref target="volume-03/lt-18250513-TC-CTA-01"><sic>3:325</sic><corr>TC to CTA, <date when="1825-05-13">13 May 1825</date></corr></ref>) and as one who dealt with Hamburg booksellers (<ref target="volume-04/lt-18260314-TC-NHJ-01"><sic>4:57</sic><corr>TC to NHJ, <date when="1826-03-14">14 March 1826</date></corr></ref>); probably Thomas B., merchant, of 6 Leopold Pl., Leith; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> David B. as noted in <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260822-TC-WT-01"><sic>4:128</sic><corr>TC to WT, <date when="1826-08-22">22 Aug. 1826</date></corr></ref>.

<p>My engagements at present are not at all of a literary sort: and I promise or threaten you that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are likely to have the <hi rend="italic">refusal</hi> of my next literary enterprise, be what it may. The &#x201C;Literary Gazette&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tait was presumably still planning to publish a literary magazine.

I wish you would study the project maturely, and have some decisive news of it to tell me when I see you.</p>
<p>I declare I am absolutely <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to take leave of the good M&#x2019;Corkindale<supplied>[;]</supplied> thank him from me for all his punctuality and clearness of judgement, unexampled in my previous experience of printers, and tell him that I hope soon and often to meet him again.</p>

<salute>My Dear and Honoured Friend &#x2026;</salute>
<p>The thing which occasions my writing at present is as follows: My friend Thomas Carlyle whom the world now knows as the author of several works connected with Literature wrote me concerning a purpose which he had of applying either for the Moral Philosophy or Rhetoric Chair in the London University. In reply to which I wrote to him mentioning in confidence how you had been entreated to accept the former, and explaining to him how vain it was for any other man living to enter into any competition with you, set as the Directors were upon you, and all-interested in your acceptance of it. But nothing of this kind was necessary to determine him: for the moment he heard of your name being before the Directors, he resigned all thought of presenting him: and began to prosecute enquiries by the help of his friend M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey concerning the Chair of Rhetoric: in the pursuit of which certain things came to his knowledge which led him to believe that you had given a formal refusal to their application, and at the same time he found the sphere of the Rhetoric Chair so narrowed &#x26; circumscribed in the idea of the directors, as to lead him greatly to prefer the other, if it was open to his pursuit. But being unwilling to take any measures whatever until he shall have ascertained exactly the ground which you occupy at present, he has requested me to write to you which I also was willing and indeed offered to do, in order to have from yourself the information direct. Would you be kind enough to let me know by return of Post: for it would seem in the Month of <date when="1827-11">November</date> the Professorships are all to be appointed to. Be assured that I will make no improper use of the information which you are pleased to communicate to me.</p>
<p>My feelings towards Thomas Carlyle are exactly such as your feelings are towards M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey with whom he takes counsel in this matter. I trust and pray that the Lord would open his eyes to the beauty and all-suffering which is on the face of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. And I hope the Lord is leading him in that way. He has a very deep feeling of &#x201C;what is true and honest and pure and lovely and of good report&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Phil. 4:8.</note> and I think he has a right idea of &#x201C;Wisdom&#x201D;: but it has not yet pleased the Lord to bring him to that condition of &#x2018;the babe&#x2019; to whom it <supplied>[is]</supplied> his will that the things of Christ should be revealed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 11:25.</note> What a mystery, Dear Doctor, that is of the great Counsel of Eternity, to bereave the glory of the human understanding by the foolishness of preaching, that no flesh should glory in his presence.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Cor. 1:29.</note> And how needful for an intellect like yours to bear it in even mind. For myself I ever pray to be enabled &#x201C;so to receive that I may be worthy to understand; so to believe that understanding may come as the reward of my faith.&#x201D; My Dear friend Carlyle is making approaches to this ground but hath not yet been permitted to stand firmly upon it. And being conscious with myself that he is an enemy of all unrighteousness, and of all those who profane the holy name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and set at naught his Holy Gospel, I feel that he is of that class &#x201C;who are not against us and therefore for us.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 12:30.</note> For if I thought that he was to oppose in any thing the name of Christ I durst not upon my fealty to my Sovereign Lord give him any encouragement, in any way, remembering the word of the blessed Apostle &#x201C;that we should not bid such God-speed&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 John 10.</note> But feeling on the other hand convinced that he is a proper person to reclaim the rage of those disputers of this world who would cast off the bonds of our God and his Church, and so lead man into other views of truth. I feel very desirous that he might succeed in this object, and should augur[?] better for[?] his success than of any other Moralist of the School of Stewart and Reid or even Locke,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dugald Stewart (<date when="1753">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828">1828</date>) and Thomas Reid (<date when="1710">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1796">96</date>), both Scottish profs. of moral philosophy; John Locke (<date when="1632">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1704">1704</date>).</note> and I can find no one except &#x201C;our old Coleridge&#x201D; who goes higher. &#x2026;</p>
