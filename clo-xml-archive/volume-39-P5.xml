<p>Volume 39 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> includes 193 letters and covers the period from <date when="1862-12-00">December 1862</date> through <date when="1863-12-00">December 1863</date>. Of the 114 letters by TC and the 79 by JWC, only 7 are written to each other (3 by TC and 4 by JWC), which indicates both a significant contribution by JWC and a year spent without the customary respite of separate vacations. Remarkably, 158 (or 82 percent) of the letters in this volume are identified either as hitherto unpublished or as previously published in incomplete form. Although much of the material in this volume constitutes business as usual for the Carlyles, three events dominate the period: the illness of the Carlyles&#x2019; great friend Lord Ashburton, the publication of TC&#x2019;s only direct commentary on the American Civil War, &#x201C;Ilias (Americana) in Nuce&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> <date when="1863-08-00">Aug. 1863</date>), and the catastrophic fall of JWC on <date when="1863-09-22">22 September 1863</date>, when she slipped while trying to avoid a cab in the congested St. Martin&#x2019;s le Grand near the General Post Office. Her excruciatingly painful convalescence during the ensuing months demonstrated the fragile condition of her health and seemed an ominous portent of the future.</p>
<p>For JWC, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date> ended in a typically chaotic fashion. In December she found herself embroiled in quarrels with three of her servants, Maria, Flo, and Elizabeth, all of whom were in various stages of having their services no longer required. According to JWC, the outgoing Maria had given the incoming Elizabeth some last words of wisdom: &#x201C;&#x2018;Take <hi rend="italic">my</hi> advice Lizzy! and get yourself out of this Prison House as fast as you can! <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> have felt a great deal lighter since I knew myself going away!!&#x2019; you will never have an hours happiness in this house.&#x2019;&#x201D; Elizabeth, whom TC had dubbed the &#x201C;mooncalve,&#x201D; received her own notice after, according to JWC, she &#x201C;spoiled a whole weeks bread so that it had to be given to poor people to <hi rend="italic">boil</hi>&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">they could.</hi>&#x201D; JWC was forced to seek new help, an activity that she always found to be both difficult and distasteful. The voice with which she ends her discourse on help to Mary Russell is clearly JWC&#x2019;s own: &#x201C;So I am still &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> servants&#x2019; which is far worse than &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> a Doctor&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621210-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-10">10 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>The triumph of seeing the third volume of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> into print earlier in the spring of <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date> was affirmed in <date when="1862-12-00">December</date>, when TC received a letter from Emerson, the only one exchanged between the two friends during the year. In it, Emerson&#x2019;s praise of the third volume is effusive, to say the least: &#x201C;Tis sovereignly written, above all literature, dictating to all mortals what they <pb id="pg-39-xiv" n="39:xiv"/>shall accept as fated &#x26; final for their salvation. It is mankind&#x2019;s Bill of Rights &#x26; Duties, the royal proclamation of Intellect ascending the throne.&#x201D; Later in the letter, Emerson provides TC with gloomy news of events in America: &#x201C;Here we read no books. The war is our sole &#x26; doleful instructer. All our bright young men go into it, to be misused &#x26; sacrificed hitherto by incapable leaders. One lesson they all learn&#x2014;to hate slavery, <hi rend="italic">teterrima causa</hi> [the most dire cause]&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621208-RWE-TC-01">RWE to TC, <date when="1862-12-08">8 Dec. 1862</date></ref>, in Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 535&#x2013;36). TC had professed to his brother John in <date when="1862-01-00">January 1862</date> that &#x201C;No war ever waging in my time was to me more profoundly foolish-looking&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 38:45). Emerson&#x2019;s missive did not change his mind. TC enclosed it in a letter to his brother in which he articulated continuing ambivalence toward the war: &#x201C;Emerson&#x2019;s letter will rather disappoint you; nothing in it, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Practical State of America, that is not more or less chimerical,&#x2014;conquering the South, and becoming celestial by emancipating Niggers, and so forth&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621228-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-12-28">28 Dec. 1862</date></ref>). The callous acerbity of TC&#x2019;s language obscures his underlying suspicions about the North&#x2019;s justification for war. Begun ostensibly to save the Union from dissolution, the <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> according to Northern supporters, including Emerson, was being transformed into a divinely mandated war against slavery. Many neutral observers in Britain, including TC, were skeptical of the contradiction. Lincoln&#x2019;s Emancipation Proclamation, having been announced in September, became law four days later.</p>
<p>But the close of <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date> presented both JWC and TC with a deeper source of concern, one that transcended both the American conflict and the customary travails of Cheyne Row. From Paris, where Lord Ashburton had been for some weeks alternately turning for the worse and then the better, word came that their friend&#x2019;s health had reached a crisis point. Further, as Lady Louisa Ashburton nursed her desperately ill husband, she received the news of her mother&#x2019;s death. Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s sister Mrs. Anstruther, unable to travel to France because of her own ill husband, urged JWC to write and ask if she was needed in Paris. To Mary Russell, JWC reports that she may have to give up her search for a new servant in order to help her friends: &#x201C;And only imagine! in the midst of this botheration, it is possible I may have to go to&#x2014; &#x2014;Paris! <hi rend="italic">Me</hi>! at this season of the year! and with my horror of sailing!&#x201D; Although clearly upset at the prospect, JWC goes on to inform Russell that she indeed has written to Lady Ashburton with surely honest resignation: &#x201C;If she says yes, I will go at once, and trust all the rest to Providence&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621210-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-10">10 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>). The next days were full of dread for the Carlyles, especially for JWC, who writes again to Mary Russell and informs her in passing that she has dosed herself with morphine in order to sleep. She also confesses in the same letter to Russell that TC, &#x201C;for all his outward <hi rend="italic">grim</hi>ness, has far more Hope in him than I have&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621212-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-12">12 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>). To TC&#x2019;s sister Mary Carlyle Austin, however, JWC expresses the depth of her husband&#x2019;s concern: <pb id="pg-39-xv" n="39:xv"/>&#x201C;We dread now that the next post will bring the news of our dear Lord Ashburtons death. Carlyle will lose in him the <hi rend="italic">only friend</hi> he has left in the world. and the world will lose in him one of the purest hearted, most chivalrous men&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621211-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1862-12-11">11 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>). Days later, JWC writes again to Mary Carlyle Austin: &#x201C;[E]very knock at the door makes my heart jump into my throat, for it may be news of his death!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621216-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [ca. <date when="1862-12-16">16 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>As the end of the month approached, guarded hope turned to real despair at any chance of improvement for Lord Ashburton. In a letter full of anguish, TC writes to Lady Ashburton and imparts what he believes will be the last word to reach his friend before death: &#x201C;If your loved Partner is still with you, and can hear my message, let it be to him: &#x2018;God go with you, guileless, pure and valiant man, who have accompanied me in my Pilgrimage so far, and been friendly to me like a Brother;&#x2014;whom I shall soon follow. Farewell!&#x2019;&#x201D; TC then closes with instructions for Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">You</hi> will not give way, I am sure; you will summon yourself together, for high and important duties that remain, and that will still give a sacred beauty to your days. I pray silently, yet do pray, for one and all of us. Yours and his, faithful till I also die&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621220-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1862-12-20">20 Dec. 1862</date></ref>). It is a remarkably Victorian moment for both Carlyles as they consider the impending death of Lord Ashburton, with TC saying goodbye in the lofty, Hebraic tone of his attic study, and JWC expressing resignation in the practical register of daily life: &#x201C;There are no words for such misfortune. Meanwhile one&#x2019;s own poor little Life struggles on, with its daily petty concerns, as well as its great ones!&#x2014; About these eggs, which mustnt be neglected if the Solar System were coming to a stand! &#x2026;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621211-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1862-12-11">11 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>JWC was much relieved when Lady Ashburton wrote to tell her that she was not to come to Paris, but another person whose presence was requested was the popular society doctor Richard Quain. Earlier in the month, JWC had described Quain as a &#x201C;Little Beast&#x201D; with &#x201C;whom the Ashburtons are infatuated&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621212-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-12">12 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>). When he appeared at Cheyne Row unannounced on Christmas day, JWC feared the worst:</p>
<p>My first words to him (he had never been in the house before) were &#x201C;Oh D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain what has brought you here?&#x201D; a reception so extraordinary, that he stood struck speechless! which confirmed me in my idea. and I said violently; &#x201C;tell me at once!&#x2014;you are come to tell me he is dead?"&#x2014;"My dear Lady, I am come to tell you no such thing; but quite the contrary! I am come, by Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s desire, to explain to you the changes which again have raised us into hope&#x2014;that he may recover!&#x201D; Then, in the reaction of my fright, I began to cry!! What a fool that man must have thought me! (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18621225-JWC-BB-01">JWC to BB, <date when="1862-12-25">25 Dec. 1862</date></ref>)</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-xvi" n="39:xvi"/>Lord Ashburton was past the moment of crisis and moving slowly toward a year-long period of improvement. TC would see him at the end of <date when="1863-07-00">July 1863</date> and find him to be &#x201C;extremely thin and frail, but looking cheery quiet, and as if he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> daily gather more strength&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630731-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-07-31">31 July</date></ref>). By <date when="1863-08-26">26 August</date>, the Carlyles would find themselves once again at The Grange, where their devotion to both Lord and Lady Ashburton would deepen even further. And in a little more than three years, Quain would be the last physician to attend JWC.</p>
<p>On <date when="1863-02-11">11 February</date>, JWC received an unexpected gift from &#x201C;J. T.,&#x201D; a professed great admirer of her husband&#x2019;s works. The close of JWC&#x2019;s letter thanking &#x201C;J. T.&#x201D; for the shawl provides a rare glimpse at an intimate moment between the Carlyles: &#x201C;We are both equally gratified, and thank you heartily. When the shawl came, as it did at night, Mr. C. himself wrapped it about me, and walked round me admiring it. And what think you he said? He said, &#x2018;I am very glad of that for you, my dear. I think it is the only bit of real good my celebrity ever brought you&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630211-JWC-JT-01">JWC to JT, <date when="1863-02-11">11 Feb.</date>)</ref>. The previous week, TC had suffered a nasty fall from his much-loved horse Fritz, as JWC reports in a letter to Margaret Oliphant: &#x201C;The victim himself looks tolerably composed, is &#x2018;consuming his own smoke,&#x2019; in a manner which rather frightens me by its novelty, as my Mother once, after lecturing me on the impropriety of crying when I hurt myself, nearly fell into fits on hearing me fall down stairs and utter no cry after it. I wish he would growl a bit&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630207-JWC-MO-01">JWC to [MO], <date when="1863-02-07">[7? Feb.]</date></ref>).</p>
<p>With TC beginning to scout out a new horse, hints begin to appear in letters between JWC and Lady Ashburton, who was able to visit Cheyne Row briefly in early May: &#x201C;I must leave off writing anyhow&#x2014;and I had still a good deal to say. especially about the Horse. Oh <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi>, please, prosecute that inquiry so bothering for you&#x2014;so out of your line! I don&#x2019;t like the idea of it&#x2014;and I am sure no more would he&#x2014;if he knew. I was very near telling him that night, after you left, when he asked me &#x2018;what on earth I was making such a whispering about?&#x2019; But I rather pique myself on holding my tongue, when I am told <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>. So I answered pertly that if he had been intended to know; why then I shouldnt have whispered&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630510-JWC-LA-01">JWC to Lady A, [ca. <date when="1863-05-10">10] May</date></ref>). Collusion was clearly afoot, and TC aware of it. He writes to his sister Jean on <date when="1863-05-16">16 May</date>: &#x201C;I have got a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> horse sent me, as if by post!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630516-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1863-05-16">16 May</date></ref>). The same day TC writes to his brother John to report more fully on the appearance of the anonymous gift: &#x201C;I privately (very privately, by Jane&#x2019;s hints lately) c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess <hi rend="italic">Lady Ashburton</hi> as the kind Giver;&#x2014;one of the kindest acts, [considering her o]wn state of harrassment anxiety and tribulation all this while, that I have ever known&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630516-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-05-16">16 May</date></ref>). TC&#x2019;s letter of thanks to Lady Ashburton reflects the depth of his appreciation: &#x201C;I cannot enough wonder at such a thing; and, instead of <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> my thanks, am ready to blush them. That is really true&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630517-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-05-17">17 May</date></ref>). The arrival of &#x201C;Noggs,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-39-xvii" n="39:xvii"/>named for Newman Noggs, the erratic but good-natured clerk in Charles Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nicholas Nickleby,</hi> was one of the shining moments of <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>. With the equine problem solved and Lord Ashburton clearly on the mend, life began to look brighter for both JWC and TC. Even the interminable struggle with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> seemed to be approaching an end. TC writes to Janet Carlyle Hanning on <date when="1863-05-13">13 May</date> and announces triumphantly, &#x201C;I expect to get done with my book in six or eight months. O that I saw the day!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630513-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JCH</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1863-05-13">13 Aug. [May]</date></ref>).</p>
<p>In May, TC wrote a short dialogue that would make public his views on &#x201C;the assertion of authority&#x201D; question in the context of the American Civil War:</p>
<p>ILIAS (<hi rend="small-caps">Americana</hi>) IN NUCE.</p>
<p>P<hi rend="small-caps">eter</hi> <hi rend="italic">of the North</hi> (<hi rend="italic">to</hi> P<hi rend="small-caps">aul</hi> <hi rend="italic">of the South</hi>). &#x201C;Paul, you unaccountable scoundrel, I find you hire your servants for life, not by the month or year as I do! You are going straight to Hell, you &#x2014;!"</p>
<p>P<hi rend="small-caps">aul.</hi> &#x201C;Good words, Peter! The risk is my own; I am willing to take the risk. Hire you your servants by the month or the day, and get straight to Heaven; leave me to my own method."</p>
<p>P<hi rend="small-caps">eter.</hi> &#x201C;No, I won&#x2019;t. I will beat your brains out first!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">And is trying dreadfully ever since, but cannot yet manage it</hi>.)</p>
<p><date when="1863-05-00">May, 1863</date>. T. C.</p>
<p>Following its publication in <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> later that <date when="1863-08-00">August</date> (8:301), a flood of angry, thoughtful, sarcastic, and parodic retorts to TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; appeared throughout Britain and the United States. In the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> (<date when="1863-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, 2; rptd. in the <hi rend="italic">Leeds Mercury</hi>, <date when="1863-08-05">5 Aug.</date>, 6), a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Reader</hi>&#x201D; offered a careful attempt to interpret TC&#x2019;s implied view on slavery in the dialogue: &#x201C;American slavery, instead of being that monstrous plague-spot on the earth towards the wiping out of which all humanity should strive, is an exhibition &#x2026; of a system of social relations to some form or other of which, in spite of the present possession of all men&#x2019;s minds with the ideas of liberty and democracy, the whole world must be brought back, if it will not end in wreck and dissolution.&#x201D; The author goes on to place this stance on slavery within the overall context of TC&#x2019;s works: &#x201C;White slavery, he has proclaimed over and over again, really exists among ourselves and in other countries of Europe&#x2014;only, by not calling it slavery, we lose that sense of our duty to see to its organization which we should perhaps feel if we kept the ugly name; and we allow it, under the empty dignity of liberty, to become more and more ignominious and horrible.&#x201D; The unnamed writer concludes, &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle speaks again in his <pb id="pg-39-xviii" n="39:xviii"/>character as the champion of Authority, rather than of Liberty, as the true principle of human society.&#x201D; In fact, neither the Southern model of authority founded upon chattel slavery nor the Northern version founded upon wage slavery would ever find a champion in TC.</p>
<p>In the context of the &#x201C;Ilias,&#x201D; the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> (<date when="1863-08-06">6 Aug.</date>, 2; rptd. in the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury,</hi> <date when="1863-08-07">7 Aug.</date>, 3) reprinted an essay entitled &#x201C;Proposed Colonization of the Slaveholders,&#x201D; which had been published in the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Slavery Standard</hi> &#x201C;at an early stage of the rebellion.&#x201D; The editors of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> now submitted the essay &#x201C;to the consideration of Mr. Thomas Carlyle, Mr. Spence, and other philosophers.&#x201D; The author suggests that instead of recolonizing the slaves (a plan proposed by President Lincoln on multiple occasions, but opposed vehemently by abolitionists and blacks alike), a &#x201C;Society for the Colonisation of the Slaveholders&#x201D; should be formed to deport slaveholders because through a &#x201C;Darwinian process&#x201D; the &#x201C;steady, law-abiding, work-loving, self-controlled Anglo-American of the North has become the lazy, passionate, law-contemning, tyrannical American of the South.&#x201D; A more direct and angry response came from the Christian socialist F. D. Maurice, who published his own dialogue, &#x201C;An Episode in the Ilias (Americana) in Nuce,&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> (<date when="1863-08-08">8 Aug.</date>). In it &#x201C;S&#x201D; (a Southern agent) explains the <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> of the Civil War to &#x201C;H&#x201D; (an aristocratic Englishman): &#x201C;We affirmed that slavery itself, not the Person who suffered the death of the slave, was the corner-stone of the universe&#x201D; (2348). In a reply to Maurice, the publisher of the &#x201C;Ilias,&#x201D; Alexander Macmillan, wrote and described his &#x201C;retort&#x201D; as &#x201C;merited.&#x201D; But he also questioned the North&#x2019;s motivations in prosecuting the war: &#x201C;God knows I hate &#x26; abominate slavery in every shape with my whole heart, but there are really worse forms of it than the planter form bad as it is. Modern Yankeedom will become old Rome without her dignity, unless in Gods providence something comes to stop her mad career&#x201D; (qtd. in George J. Worth, <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>&#x2013;<date when="1907-00-00">1907</date></hi> [Aldershot, <date when="2003-00-00">2003</date>] 31). Clearly, Macmillan shared TC&#x2019;s skeptical opinion of the Northern &#x201C;cause."</p>
<p>Another Christian Socialist, J. M. Ludlow (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37696"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), also exchanged letters with Macmillan: &#x201C;I did not think your magazine would ever fall so low as to insert that thing signed T. C. in the new no.&#x201D; (qtd. in George J. Worth, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> and the American Civil War: A Reconsideration,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Periodicals Review</hi> 26, no. 4 [<date when="1993-00-00">1993</date>]: 195). In his response Macmillan mildly corrected Ludlow: &#x201C;He is not &#x2018;a bad old man,&#x2019; but a very noble &#x26; useful one, and even his wrong sayings have wisdom and significance in them which are wanting in the rabid vapid utterance of deepest truths&#x201D; (Worth, <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 31). Macmillan encouraged Ludlow to respond, which he did in the 8 September issue of <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s.</hi> His dialogue is a scathing indictment of TC&#x2019;s equation of slavery and servanthood:</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-xix" n="39:xix"/>SERVITUDE FOR LIFE (A BRIEF DIALOGUE).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Frederick Maximus.</hi> Harkee here, Dan, you black nigger rascal. You&#x2019;re no longer a slave, you&#x2019;re a servant hired for life.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">T. C. Niger.</hi> By golly! Wife and chil&#x2019;n servants for life too, massa?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">F. M.</hi> Yes, all you niggers. But you must work all the same, you know. &#x2026;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">T.C.N.</hi> Beg pardon, massa, but what for you call me servant hired for life?</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">F.M.</hi> What for, you rascal? Because a great man, after whom I named you, when he had written a d&#x2014;d good book on the &#x201C;nigger question,&#x201D; says that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all the difference between you and those mean white-livered Yankee working men, who are hired by the month or day.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">T.C.N.</hi> Massa, if him book good book, why&#x2019;s I not priv&#x2019;leged to learn read it? (8:389)</p>
<p>The dialogue concludes with &#x201C;T. C. Niger&#x201D; looking forward to the arrival of the Yankees: &#x201C;Wish dey&#x2019;d gib me a rifle &#x2019;fore I dies.&#x201D; Not all readers, however, thought Ludlow&#x2019;s sarcasm effective. One reviewer of the September issue of <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s</hi> commented in the <hi rend="italic">Derby Mercury,</hi> &#x201C;Contrary to its usual condition <hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> will be found to be flippant rather than heavy. Mr. Ludlow has a very stupid answer to Carlyle&#x2019;s Iliad, which is preceded by a chapter on correspondence equally stupid&#x201D; (<date when="1863-09-09">9 Sept.</date>).</p>
<p>The &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; also brought forth several agonized responses from America. One letter came to TC from Charlotte Taylor, <date when="1863-08-27">27 August</date>, in which she writes: &#x201C;You have pained, wounded, and offended a whole Nation by your careless scoff at our present bitter struggle, &#x2026; Ah, Sir, you can not <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> what Slavery is or you could never speak lightly of it. The important consideration is this&#x2014;where <hi rend="italic">one</hi> man is enslaved <hi rend="italic">no</hi> man is free&#x2014;that is actually true, no mere figure of speech&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630827-CT-TC-01">CT to TC, <date when="1863-08-27">27 Aug.</date></ref> MS: NLS Acc. 11388); another came from Horace Howard Furness,  <date when="1863-08-29">29 August</date>, in which he captions a photograph of a horribly whipped slave covered with welts: &#x201C;Sir, &#x2F; Pray observe an instance of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">hiring</hi> for life.&#x2019; God forgive you for your cruel jest, and blindness!, Philadelphia, [<date when="1863-08-29">29 Aug. 1863</date>]. Photograph enclosed of negro with welts all over his back&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630829-HHF-TC-01">HHF to TC, <date when="1863-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref>; MS: NLS Acc. 11388; see 225). Some of the responses to the &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; were sarcastically humorous; for example, &#x201C;Ill Ass (Anglicus) in a Noose,&#x201D; which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Boston Liberator</hi> ([<date when="1863-09-04">4 Sept. 1863</date>]: 143). Perhaps the most remarkable American response came from Bret Harte (<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>), who published his own dramatic rejoinder to TC in the <hi rend="italic">San Francisco Examiner:</hi></p>
<lg><l><pb id="pg-39-xx" n="39:xx"/>It&#x2019;s true that I hire my servant per day,</l>
<l>&#x02003;&#x02003;Per month, or per year&#x2014;as he chooses;</l>
<l>While &#x201C;Paul of the South&#x201D; takes his bondman for life,</l>
<l>&#x02003;&#x02003;Without asking if he refuses,</l>
<l>&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x02003;T.C.,</l></lg>
<lg><l>Without asking if he refuses!</l>
<l>But if you are judge of the merits alone,</l>
 <l>&#x02003;&#x02003;We surely have right to inquire</l>
<l>The date of your service with &#x201C;Paul of the South,"</l>
 <l>&#x02003;&#x02003;And what is the length of your hire,</l>
 <l>&#x02003;&#x02003;T.C.,</l></lg><lb/>
<lg><l>And what is the length of your hire! (3)</l></lg>
<p>Another of the less outraged responses to the &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Herald.</hi> An editorial of <date when="1863-08-11">11 August 1863</date> coolly agreed that Carlyle had at least obliged the North to define &#x201C;the object of the present war &#x2014;namely, a simple determination to abolish slavery, and compel the South to adopt the free-labour system of the North.&#x201D; TC, in other words, had accurately presented the affair &#x201C;in Nuce&#x201D; and had done so in essential terms, especially in the context of British neutrality. The opportunity to separate the former colonies into two countries as a way to diminish American influence and to promote British dominance offered a compellingly strategic temptation, but it was certain that Britain would never make war to support slavery. As late as <date when="1862-08-00">August 1862</date>, however, President Lincoln himself had continued to deny slavery as the primary cause of the war: &#x201C;If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">New York Herald,</hi> <date when="1862-08-22">22 Aug. 1862</date>). What Lincoln neglected to write in his famous letter to Horace Greeley, of course, was that he had already drafted the Emancipation Proclamation and was waiting to make it public as soon as the Union army could manage a major victory, which came the following month at the battle of Antietam (<date when="1862-09-17">17 Sept.</date>). With his customary perversity&#x2014;and cruelty&#x2014;TC had undercut the moral high ground of both the North and the South by treating an all-out civil war as a simple labor dispute. Lincoln&#x2019;s shift suggests his realization that the purpose of the war would have to be redefined in order to provide the Unionist cause with a distinct moral imperative. But as the commentary surrounding his &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; suggests, TC was not alone in sensing a political and an economic agenda behind the shift from saving the Union to freeing the slaves.</p>
<p>When TC wrote the &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; in <date when="1863-05-00">May 1863</date>, the conditions of the war were sharply different than they were when the dialogue was published in August. <pb id="pg-39-xxi" n="39:xxi"/>The Emancipation Proclamation had gone into legal effect without actually freeing any slaves, but the implication of the executive order was clear&#x2014;the war would be prosecuted to end slavery, and the restoration of the Union was now to be a byproduct of that effort. But after a disastrous defeat at Chancellorsville in May, Vicksburg remained untaken, and the apparently invincible Army of Northern Virginia under the command of Robert E. Lee was marching north to threaten Washington. That neither the Union would be saved nor the slaves freed seemed a real possibility. Then, on <date when="1863-07-04">4 July</date>, Vicksburg fell, and George Meade defeated a curiously overconfident Lee at Gettysburg. Lincoln triumphantly proclaimed that the Mississippi River once again flowed &#x201C;unvexed to the sea.&#x201D; Any chance of Lee&#x2019;s army returning to the offensive had been lost forever. With the death of Lee&#x2019;s best general, Stonewall Jackson, the &#x201C;Cromwell of the South&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reynolds&#x2019;s Newspaper,</hi> <date when="1863-05-31">31 May</date>, 1), the South was in a strategic sense all but finished. But the war was far from over. The casualties in the next year of the conflict would outnumber those inflicted in the first two years combined. Lincoln had presciently recognized that the only way to justify the slaughter was to elevate the cause of the war to the abolishment of slavery. He would confirm this fact for all time by declaring his commitment to &#x201C;a new birth of freedom&#x201D; later that November in his brief but immortal address at Gettysburg. The transformation of <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> was complete, but the British policy of neutrality did not change, nor did TC&#x2019;s stubborn insistence that the human cost of the war would never justify its prosecution, for either side.</p>
<p>TC would spend the rest of the war frustrating various attempts of Unionists and Confederates to win his support. All of them failed. He no doubt talked&#x2014;and assuredly at great length&#x2014;with others about conditions in America, but in his letters he would remain mostly silent, and in print he truly deserved JWC&#x2019;s appellation of him as &#x201C;the Apostle of Silence&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 34:49). In his reading of the &#x201C;Ilias,&#x201D; TC&#x2019;s biographer David Alec Wilson claims that the piece &#x201C;concentrated attention on the slavery question as the real cause of the war. It was plainly intended to have the effect it certainly had of diminishing the danger of the war spreading. England would never think of making war in support of slavery&#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:525). Although Wilson overestimates the influence of the &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; in preventing Britain&#x2019;s entry into the Civil War, his analysis contains at least a partial truth, especially in terms of the significant periodical conversation the &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; provoked. If nothing else, what Emerson had called &#x201C;a most needless squib&#x201D; (qtd. in Len Gougeon, &#x201C;Emerson, Carlyle, and the Civil War,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">New England Quarterly</hi> 62, no. 3 [<date when="1989-00-00">1989</date>]: 418n) served to demonstrate the continuing relevance of TC&#x2019;s voice. When he wrote and spoke, friend and foe alike listened, and when he remained silent, supporters of both sides wondered why.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-xxii" n="39:xxii"/>As the furor over the &#x201C;Ilias&#x201D; rattled noisily around them, the Carlyles&#x2019; lives seemed to be entering a rather positive phase. At the end of August, in spite of JWC suffering from what Dr. Quain diagnosed as &#x201C;neuralgia&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630916-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [(<date when="1863-09-16">16 Sept.]</date></ref>), both Carlyles seemed to have enjoyed the three weeks they spent at The Grange with the Ashburtons. At least in her remarks to Lady Ashburton, even JWC&#x2019;s opinion of Dr. Quain had taken on a brighter tone: &#x201C;Decidedly Quain is very clever&#x2014;very prompt and dexterous! also&#x2014;he writes remarkably pretty and ingenious notes!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630919-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-09-19">19 Sept.</date></ref>). But JWC&#x2019;s painful arm was not improving, as she writes to her former maid Maria Chamberlayne: &#x201C;I will not delay answering your letter until I can &#x2018;tell you that my arm is better.&#x2019; For <hi rend="italic">that</hi> may be a long time off&#x2014;if ever! I sometimes think, this pained half-crippled arm, of now more than three months standing, is added to my Life-burden in <hi rend="italic">permanency!</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630922-JWC-MCH-01">JWC to <sic>MC</sic><corr>MCH</corr>, <date when="1863-09-22">23 [22] Sept.</date></ref>). JWC clearly misdated this letter, for there is little chance that she could have written it on the twenty-third. TC&#x2019;s letter to Lady Ashburton, postmarked <date when="1863-09-23">23 September</date>, explains: &#x201C;My poor wife had an ugly accident yesterday; in some crowded place, while getting into a street vehicle too rapidly, <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> on the curb-stone; hurt her left leg and side, and was brought home to me quite lame. No bones broken, hip-joint <hi rend="italic">not</hi> injured (as I feared); but very great misery of pain ever since;&#x2014;and in short a bad job for us, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we had no need of as things were. In a day or two (the Dr. promises) it will be easier to bear&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630923-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-09-23">[23 Sept.]</date>)</ref>.</p>
<p>Dr. Barnes seemed to be correct in his diagnosis for a quick recovery, at least at first. TC reported to Lady Ashburton late in September: &#x201C;She is very quiet, clear of head, as &#x2018;patient&#x2019; as the Doctor c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prescribe: she bids me tell you &#x2018;she is going on slowly, and&#x2019; Nothing more came from her at that moment!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630929-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-09-29">30 [29] Sept.</date></ref>). The Ashburtons apparently felt somehow responsible for JWC&#x2019;s accident, which elicited responses from both Carlyles. TC&#x2019;s is directed to Lord Ashburton: &#x201C;Relieve your conscience upon one score! It is absolutely certain my Wife got hurt <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on your or My Lady&#x2019;s bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> in any sense, but altogether on her own&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631001-TC-LOA-01">TC to Lord A, <date when="1863-10-01">1 Oct.</date></ref>). JWC, in turn, writes to Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;I shall be able to move in a few days the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> says&#x2014;I get hardly any sleep for the pain and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> grapes are so cooling thro&#x2019; the long nights. My accident had nothing whatever to do with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;I almost wish it had had that pleasant association! as it is, it was one great stupid going to meet trouble&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631002-JWC-LA-01">JWC to Lady A, <date when="1863-10-02">[2 Oct.]</date></ref>). And by <date when="1863-10-09">9 October</date>, as TC reports to his brother John, &#x201C;Jane&#x2019;s hurt here is clearly getting better&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631009-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-10-09">9 Oct.</date></ref>). And clearly, as the month progresses, JWC is moving incrementally toward rehabilitation: &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> daily from my bedroom into the Drawing room Sofa&#x2014;after a fashion! my <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> arm round Marys neck, and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm round my waist. I think there is <hi rend="italic">more nervousness</hi> than <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> in the difficulty with which I make this little journey! For the rest I dont <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> much on my <pb id="pg-39-xxiii" n="39:xxiii"/>sofa&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">sit&#x2014;on end</hi>&#x2014;I cannot however sit up at a table to write with pen and ink&#x2014;I must write with cushions at my back, and with the paper on my knees&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631019-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1863-10-19">[19 Oct.]</date></ref>).</p>
<p>JWC indeed seemed on the path to recovery, and by <date when="1863-11-20">20 November</date>, she was back in the business of receiving much-welcome eggs from her sister-in-law Mary Carlyle Austin: &#x201C;Speediest of dear little women! thanks thanks! The eggs are come and I have just unpacked them &#x2018;with my own hands&#x2019;; and there is not one broken!&#x201D; The letter closes with the encouraging news that JWC has gone out of the house to walk, although she clearly remains disturbingly weak: &#x201C;I am poorly today &#x2026; having listened to <hi rend="italic">the voice of wisdom</hi> [i.e., TC] yesterday, and gone out with a stick, to try walking in the street! I did not stay above ten minutes, &#x2026; and the <hi rend="italic">fatigue</hi> of the thing was very great, and so all my pains were aggravated for the rest of the day&#x2014;and thro&#x2019; the night I was in a fever&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631120-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1863-11-20">20 Nov.</date>]</ref>). But in a letter to Lady Ashburton on <date when="1863-12-04">4 December,</date> Carlyle reports a serious relapse: &#x201C;I am to write you &#x2018;A single word&#x2019; in explant<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my poor Wife&#x2019;s silence. &#x2026; She seemed doing so nicely; able to walk ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with a staff; had been out driving once or twice:&#x2014;but was taken with <hi rend="italic">Influenza;</hi> and has since had the most miserable time. It is &#x2018;only cold,&#x2019; the Doctor [Barnes] says; &#x2018;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has kindled all the rheumatic neuralgia and other injuries and ailments into a violent state&#x2019;:&#x2014;I was really alarmed; and questioned the man today,&#x2014;who reassured me in that manner, and in fact made light of it;&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, I find, he has since ordered <hi rend="italic">morphine</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631204-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-12-04">4 Dec.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>The rest of the year was to be nightmarish for the Carlyles. On <date when="1863-12-06">6 December</date>, TC writes to his brother John: &#x201C;Her <hi rend="italic">first</hi> sleep was two nights ago, by aid of <hi rend="italic">morphine:</hi> I think they are continuing that; but indeed I do not know. She speaks little to me; and does not <hi rend="italic">accept</hi> me as a sicknurse wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> truly I had never any talent to be. We have written for Maggie Welsh&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631206-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-12-06">6 Dec.</date></ref>). By <date when="1863-12-11">11 December</date> it has become clear that JWC&#x2019;s silence is not simply a matter of being angry with her difficult husband: &#x201C;she is so low, one can get little out of her own acc<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> I seldom get above a word or two, hardly audible even with industry, and little elucidation of her state. Never before have I seen her in such misery so long&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-12-11">11 Dec.</date></ref>). At this point, all three of JWC&#x2019;s physicians&#x2014;Barnes, Blakiston, and Quain&#x2014;were in simultaneous attendance and desperately seeking to ease her suffering, with no result. TC writes to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1863-12-21">21 December</date>: &#x201C;We have had a terrible four weeks since you heard last! Rheumatic fever, or I know not what it is, and has been: the Doctors call it mere &#x2018;influenza wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has kindled into a <hi rend="italic">general paroxysm</hi> all the neuralgias, hurts &#x26;c&#x2019;;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> are agreed. &#x2026; [B]ut, alas, it seems very evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> their art can do nothing for her; and indeed all their opiates, morphines, soporifics, produced the very reverse of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> or help,&#x2014;no improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> visible till then were entirely abandoned. I never saw a being in such continuous <pb id="pg-39-xxiv" n="39:xxiv"/>agony!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631221-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-12-21">21 Dec.</date></ref>). If &#x201C;Carlyle was blind,&#x201D; as his biographer James Anthony Froude claimed (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:273), then TC was not alone in his blindness about the truth of his wife&#x2019;s perilously fragile health. On the penultimate day of the year, TC again writes to his brother John: &#x201C;I know not when my poor Jane, worn down to this pitch, is fit for such heroic practice in opiates! But we will consider.&#x2014; She does eat. &#x2026; It is the one good symptom; and it is a good one&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631230-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-12-30">[30 Dec.]</date></ref>). It is the one glimmer of hope for the New Year to come.</p>

<p><bold><date when="1862--00-00">1862</date></bold> <hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-12-00">December</date></hi>. TC writes to congratulate his brother John on solving his stepson&#x2019;s behavior problems by enrolling him in the army, and asks him to take gifts to a childhood school friend Jane Johnston, now Otthenin, who is living in Edinburgh (<date when="1862-12-04">4</date>). He sees John Ruskin, and Sir Walter and Lady Trevelyan. JWC tells Mary Russell of her quarrel with her servant Elizabeth, who is on a month&#x2019;s warning and will leave in a fortnight. &#x201C;I am still &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> servants&#x2019; which is far worse than &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> a Doctor&#x2019;&#x201D; ([<date when="1862-12-10">10</date>]). JWC writes to Mary Austin thanking her for eggs from Scotland; the servant troubles and TC&#x2019;s impatience make housekeeping very difficult ([<date when="1862-12-11">11</date>]). Even so, she seriously considers going to Paris to comfort Lady Ashburton despite dreading the journey, but Lady Ashburton writes to forbid it ([<date when="1862-12-12">12 Dec. 1862</date>]). TC writes to console Lady Ashburton, hope having been lost for Lord Ashburton (<date when="1862-12-20">20</date>). Mary, the new cook, arrives just before Christmas. JWC writes to Betty Braid with Christmas wishes and gifts (<date when="1862-12-25">25</date>) and to John Stodart with New Year wishes ([<date when="1862-12-31">31 Dec.</date>]).</p>
<p><bold><date when="1863-00-00">1863</date></bold> <hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-01-00">January</date></hi>. JWC writes to Jeannie Chrystal thanking her for gifts of a photograph and a kettle-quilt ([<date when="1863-01-03">3</date>]). TC sends his family New Year checks (<date when="1863-01-06">6</date>). JWC sends Dr. James Russell two photographs, of either herself or TC, and asks him to forward one of them to Walter Welsh (<date when="1863-01-06">6</date>). Jane confesses to Mary Austin her initial dissatisfaction with Mary, the new cook, and wishes that she had trusted her own &#x201C;physiognomic instincts&#x201D; rather than an &#x201C;account of the four years excellent character&#x201D; when employing her ([<date when="1863-01-05">5</date>]). In long letters to Lady Stanley ([<date when="1863-01-31">late Jan.</date>]) and Mary Russell ([<date when="1863-01-27">27 Jan.</date> or <date when="1863-02-03">3 Feb.</date>]), JWC writes of her distress at discovering that little &#x201C;Flo,&#x201D; her young housemaid, had caused considerable unrest in the kitchen by making up and passing on complaints (supposedly made by JWC herself) to Mary the cook. Flo is duly dismissed &#x201C;to the bosom of her admiring Family.&#x201D; JWC sends Jane Dods <hi rend="italic">cartes-de-visite,</hi> picturing JWC and TC, as &#x201C;&#x2018;a suitable return&#x2019;&#x201D; for Jane Dods&#x2019;s own photograph received in an earlier letter ([<date when="1863-01-29">29</date>]).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1864-02-00">February</date></hi> TC writes to his brother John telling him that he has decided to part with his horse, Fritz, following the animal&#x2019;s recent fall (<date when="1863-02-13">13</date>). In a letter to Mary Russell, JWC writes that her proposed holiday at St. Leonards was abandoned because she understood that an outbreak of gastric fever had <pb id="pg-39-xxxvi" n="39:xxxvi"/>occurred at that resort ([<date when="1863-02-17">17</date>]). JWC visits and stays with Mrs. Oliphant in Ealing (<date when="1863-02-25">25</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-03-00">March.</date></hi> JWC and TC dine at the Forsters&#x2019; (<date when="1863-03-03">3</date>). JWC offers her laundress&#x2019;s services to Eliza Forster ([<date when="1863-03-05">5</date>]). Fritz is sold cheaply to an apothecary, who rides him occasionally (<date when="1863-03-05">5</date>). Joseph Neuberg has been unwell, which unsettles TC, who still relies on him for research help (<date when="1863-03-06">6</date>). JWC writes most affectionately to Lady Ashburton in France wishing both Ashburtons were back in Britain (<date when="1863-03-07">7</date>). Monckton Milnes warmly invites TC and Jane to visit Fryston Hall, Yorkshire, but TC resists the prospect of the railway journey (19). JWC finds it very difficult to ensure a steady supply of fresh eggs and writes to Scotland for parcels. JWC is intrigued by Princess Alexandra, the new princess of Wales; neither she nor TC attend the public celebrations of the princess&#x2019;s arrival in London, JWC being more interested in her previous poverty ([<date when="1863-03-20">20</date>]). James Aitken visits (<date when="1863-03-20">20</date>); TC, &#x201C;still struggling in the whirlpool,&#x201D; begins to guess he is only a few months away from the end of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1863-03-26">26</date>). JWC is surprised to receive a gift of violets from Charlotte Southam and writes to renew their earlier close friendship (<date when="1863-03-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-04-00">April</date></hi>. JWC writes to Mary Russell and informs her that she has been suffering from influenza for the past two weeks ([<date when="1863-04-12">12</date>]). TC sympathizes with Sir George Sinclair on the recent death of his wife (<date when="1863-04-15">15</date>). TC attends a reading by Dickens at the Hanover Rooms (28) and is impressed with the performance, although the &#x201C;oversetting&#x201D; of his evening &#x201C;habitudes&#x201D; badly affects his &#x201C;spiritual composure&#x201D; (<date when="1863-04-29">29</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-05-00">May.</date></hi> JWC writes another affectionate letter to Lady Ashburton sympathizing with her troubles (<date when="1863-05-01">1</date>).

TC&#x2019;s sister Jean and her family move to their new house, The Hill, Lochmaben Rd., Dumfries (<date when="1863-05-14">14</date>). &#x201C;Noggs,&#x201D; successor to Fritz, is delivered as a gift from Lady Ashburton (<date when="1863-05-16">16</date>). TC writes to Lord Ashburton rejoicing in his recovery from dangerous illness (<date when="1863-05-19">19</date>). Helen Dickinsen, the housemaid from Sunny Bank, visits Chelsea, as does Capt. James Baillie; Charlotte Southam also pays a successful call after JWC&#x2019;s and her estrangement (<date when="1863-05-21">21</date>). TC tells his brother John of the prevalence of smallpox vaccination in London (<date when="1863-05-27">27</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-06-00">June.</date></hi> TC goes to dinner with Erasmus Darwin and then on to hear a lecture by Ruskin at the Royal Institution (<date when="1863-06-05">5</date>). JWC goes to stay with Bessy and her husband, Dr. Blakiston, at St. Leonards (<date when="1863-06-08">8</date>). TC writes to Lady Ashburton commiserating with her over renewed fears regarding Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s health (<date when="1863-06-11">11</date>). JWC returns from St. Leonards (<date when="1863-06-13">13</date>). TC visits James Aitken, who has broken his collar bone in an accident, and is able to reassure James&#x2019;s mother, Jean, that her son is recovering well (<date when="1863-06-14">14</date>). TC writes to John <pb id="pg-39-xxxvii" n="39:xxxvii"/>Forster that JWC has been ill and unable to take food or drink for the last fifty-two hours; the doctor blames the cause of this illness on recent &#x201C;electric weather&#x201D; ([<date when="1863-06-18">18</date>]). TC and JWC spend an evening at home in Chelsea with Ruskin and John William Colenso, bishop of Natal (<date when="1863-06-19">19</date>). John A. Carlyle visits Thomas Erskine in Linlathen, Dundee, late June.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-07-00">July.</date></hi> JWC writes to Mary Russell about her visit to the Blakistons in St. Leonards and her and TC&#x2019;s invitation to visit Lord and Lady Lothian (<date when="1863-07-09">9</date>). TC orders wine from Hutchison &#x26; Co., Edinburgh (<date when="1863-07-20">20</date>). TC writes to his brother John informing him that he visited the ailing Lord Ashburton &#x201C;three or four times&#x201D; during the past week following his return from France (<date when="1863-07-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-08-00">August.</date></hi> TC receives a &#x201C;most magnificent&#x201D; dressing gown as a present from Lord Ashburton and writes to thank him for this gift (<date when="1863-08-02">2</date>). John A. Carlyle visits Chelsea, and he and TC discuss various places they could sail to, but TC decides instead to go to The Grange; the Lothians&#x2019; invitation refused ([<date when="1863-08-19">19</date>]). TC and JWC travel to The Grange to visit the Ashburtons (<date when="1863-08-24">24</date>), leaving TC&#x2019;s brother John at Chelsea until <date when="1863-09-01">1 Sept.</date></p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-09-00">September.</date></hi> TC writes to his sister Jean, informing her of his daily routine while staying at The Grange; four hours of each day, up until 2:00 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>, are spent working on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1863-09-08">8</date>). TC and JWC return from The Grange to Chelsea (<date when="1863-09-14">14</date>). JWC visits Lady William Russell in her London home (<date when="1863-09-18">18</date>). JWC sends two parcels of gifts to Lady Ashburton at The Grange; these gifts include books from TC for Lord Ashburton, a piece of cornice from Livia&#x2019;s excavated villa in Rome for the Ashburtons&#x2019; museum, and a copy of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Hermann und Dorothea,</hi> inscribed by Goethe to JWC, the latter intended as a present for Mary Florence Baring, the Ashburtons&#x2019; daughter ([<date when="1863-09-21">21</date>]). JWC writes a long letter to Lady Ashburton informing her of the results of a search for a lady&#x2019;s maid that she has conducted on her behalf (<date when="1863-09-22">22</date>). Later that day (<date when="1863-09-22">22</date>), after visiting her cousin Mrs. Godby, JWC trips on a curbstone, while trying to avoid a cab on St. Martin&#x2019;s le Grand, and injures her left leg and side.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-10-00">October.</date></hi> TC writes to his brother John, resettled in Edinburgh for the winter; he persuades himself JWC is slowly recovering (<date when="1863-10-09">9</date>). He is glad to have begun book 19 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick;</hi> &#x201C;My slavery &#x2026; will end before very long now,&#x201D; he tells Charles A. Ward (<date when="1863-10-18">18</date>). Meanwhile JWC, out of bed most of the day, moves slowly about indoors, exchanges family news with Grace Welsh, and writes in good spirits to Lord Ashburton (<date when="1863-10-22">22</date>) on the same day TC goes riding with Foxton. TC sends intemperate instructions to his copyist, Mr. Bishop ([<date when="1863-10-20">20</date>]), which Neuberg modifies and sends on. TC introduces Moncure Conway to Neuberg (<date when="1863-10-21">21</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> publishes a hostile reaction to TC&#x2019;s flippant views on the American Civil War and the emancipation of slaves; <pb id="pg-39-xxxviii" n="39:xxxviii"/>JWC sends it to Lord Ashburton ([<date when="1863-10-22">22</date>]) and TC tells John about it (<date when="1863-10-23">23</date>). JWC&#x2019;s cousin Alexander Welsh&#x2019;s son Jackie is ill in Liverpool ([<date when="1863-10-27">27</date>]). TC acknowledges Anne Gilchrist&#x2019;s gift of Alexander Gilchrist&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of William Blake</hi> (<date when="1863-10-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-11-00">November.</date></hi> JWC writes to Lady Airlie about her accident, and in praise of Miss Bromley (<date when="1863-11-02">2</date>), but privately remains very gloomy about the state of her health. Isabella Simmonds asks her to be godmother to her new baby (<date when="1863-11-03">3</date>); JWC is very reluctant to become this or to join in the christening luncheon. She is showered with gifts, especially fruit, by Lady Ashburton and thanks her cordially ([<date when="1863-11-05">5</date>]). JWC acknowledges a photograph sent by Mary Russell and mentions the photograph of Auchtertool Manse sent by her cousins ([<date when="1863-11-05">5</date>]); TC thanks John James Garth Wilkinson for sending his photograph but refuses to be photographed by Wilkinson&#x2019;s photographer (<date when="1863-11-10">10</date>). He begins to suspect, then to realize, that a sixth volume of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> will be needed to finish the job (<date when="1863-11-12">12</date>). Noggs and TC have a fall (<date when="1863-11-14">14</date>). JWC thanks Mary Austin for a present of much-needed fresh eggs ([<date when="1863-11-20">20</date>]) and admits that moving about is still very painful. Late November, JWC suffers a severe setback in health and takes to her bed.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1862-12-00">December.</date></hi> JWC remains very ill and sleepless, TC confirms to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1863-12-04">4</date>). He summons Maggie Welsh as sick nurse (<date when="1863-12-06">6</date>), who comes from Liverpool, where she has been nursing her nephew Jackie. Dr. Quain is added to the two doctors (Barnes and Blakiston) already attending JWC and prescribes quinine (<date when="1863-12-15">15</date>), without much success; Barnes prefers morphine. Christmas is somber, though A. J. Symington sends two ptarmigan (from Iceland) for Christmas dinner; TC thanks him (<date when="1863-12-26">26</date>). There are various visitors, including Forster (<date when="1863-12-29">29</date>). A Catholic sick-nurse is briefly appointed but is dismissed. William M. Thackeray dies (<date when="1863-12-24">24</date>). TC thanks Stephen Spring Rice for his &#x201C;kind words from afar&#x201D; and reports on JWC&#x2019;s continuing &#x201C;great pain and misery&#x201D; (<date when="1863-12-28">28</date>). TC congratulates Monckton Milnes on his elevation to the peerage as Lord Houghton (<date when="1863-12-29">29</date>). Lady Ashburton briefly visits London, and Lord Ashburton is reported to be &#x201C;slowly gathering strength&#x201D; (<date when="1863-12-29">29</date>). JWC ends the year with 25 drops of morphine (<date when="1863-12-29">29</date>) and another 25 drops to be followed by another 10 &#x201C;in case of non-effect&#x201D; (<date when="1863-12-30">30</date>), prescribed by Barnes, father and son. She is too ill to write any of her customary New Year letters.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Darling!</salute> I wish I were beside you! I wish I were at Holme Hill! Shut up with you and the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in that cozy house, and no news from the outer world able to get at me! I think I shall go out of my senses if this sort of thing lasts much longer!</p>
<p>Where was I at, in my life, when I last wrote to you?&#x2014; Maria was gone I think; and I was training little Flo, with no particle of help from the &#x201C;mooncalve&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x2019; servants were Elizabeth from Haddington, referred to as &#x201C;mooncalve,&#x201D; <date when="1862-06-00">June</date>&#x2014; <date when="1862-12-00">Dec. 1862</date>, Maria Chamberlayne, <date when="1861-07-00">July 1861</date>&#x2014; <date when="1862-11-00">Nov. 1862</date>; Florence Morrison,  <date when="1862-11-00">Nov. 1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-01-00">Jan. 1863</date>; for JWC&#x2019;s recent letter to Mary Russell, see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621120-JWC-MR-01"><sic>38:264&#x2013;66</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-11-20">20 Nov. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> and the mooncalve was laying all waste, and sending up M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s dinners &#x201C;as if they had been cooked in the Infernal Regions&#x201D; he said. That was <hi rend="italic">where</hi> I was at; was it not? Well! in addition to &#x201C;the Infernal Regions&#x201D; Cookery. I found it confirmed what I had guessed that Maria had been poisoning the mooncalve&#x2019;s mind, and she again was trying to poison the little girl&#x2019;s. The Mother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Morrison.</note> of little Flo came over one day, and told me she was going down to beg of Elizabeth (mooncalve) that she would give over always trying to make Flo believe the place was dull.  that the girl laughed at it as yet; but, &#x201C;young people being impressionable,&#x201D; it might make Flo uncomfortable at last, to be always having it drummed into her, that she was &#x201C;come to live in a Prison-House, and that Maria&#x2019;s last words to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> (Mooncalve) had been; &#x201C;Take <hi rend="italic">my</hi> advice Lizzy! and get yourself out of this Prison House as fast as you can! <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> have felt a great deal lighter since I knew myself going away!!&#x201D; you will never have an hours happiness in this house&#x201C;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I let M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Morrison (Flo&#x2019;s Mother) go and say her say to Elizabeth  But that was not enough. I called her up, and gave her <hi rend="italic">my</hi> views also of her conduct. &#x201C;Well, she said; it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> Maria&#x2019;s very words.&#x201D; &#x201C;Did you ever, I asked, hear Maria call the house a Prison-house, or complain of not being happy in it, until <hi rend="italic">after</hi> she had offended me beyond forgiveness, and was going away?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;No!&#x201D; said Mooncalve &#x201C;she never spoke that way, till she was going away. <hi rend="italic">I observed that.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh&#x2014;you did? and yet you try to persuade this girl that Maria went away of her own accord; <hi rend="italic">because</hi> the house is &#x201C;too dull for anybody to live in&#x201C;! And when the Child tells you <hi rend="italic">she</hi> doesnt think so, and likes the place very much; you tell her by way of encouragement; &#x201C;oh youll find out soon enough <pb id="pg-39-05" n="39:05"/>that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a prison you are come to&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Well! said Mooncalve, I suppose I said it without thinking.&#x201C;&#x2014; The next day she spoiled a whole weeks bread so that it had to be given to poor people to <hi rend="italic">boil</hi>&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">they could.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Beeton&#x2019;s recipe for &#x201C;Boiled Bread Pudding,&#x201D; probably too rich for &#x201C;the poor,&#x201D; contained milk, bread crumbs, sugar, eggs, butter, currants, and nutmeg; see Beeton, <hi rend="italic">The Book of Household Management</hi> (<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>) 648&#x2013;49.</note> And <hi rend="italic">that</hi> being &#x201C;the last straw that breaks the Camels back&#x201C;; I gave her warning! I had never <hi rend="italic">engaged</hi> to keep her the second six months. And M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Welsh<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Welsh, widow of JWC&#x2019;s uncle George.</note>
 had told me there was a great deal of hiring by the month in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> now. If she did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like to return to Scotland between terms (I told her) I would put her in the way of finding another situation here. &#x201C;Na Na&#x2014;she said Ill gang hame to Scotland. I wish I had never left it. I can get plenty gude places there. I<hi rend="italic">ll please mysell.</hi>&#x201D; So I was relieved of all responsibility with her. That was a fortnight ago&#x2014;so she has now only a fortnight to stay. But it is easier to turn off a bad cook than to turn on a good one. My soul is sickened with investigating this and the other &#x201C;good plain cook&#x201C;&#x2014;without finding <hi rend="italic">one</hi> that could be ventured on. I have had the offer of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> very nice, clever-looking women but these were accustomed to large and expensive establishments, and even if I could have made up my mind to to<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> the exorbitant wages (which I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> had <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> been <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the difference) I could not have calculated on their being content in a house like ours.

<p><salute>Blessings on you Dear!</salute> These eggs have been such a deliverance!</p>
<p>Can you believe it of me? I have been in such worry of mind of late days, that were it asked of me, with a loaded pistol at my breast, whether or not I had written again after receiving your letter, I couldnt tell!! So <hi rend="italic">in case</hi> I did <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> I write tonight, while I have a little breathing time.</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton, whom we had been led to suppose out of danger, made no progress in convalescence, and then began to sink. Lady A who has had the news of her Mother&#x2019;s death since his illness, was <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> to nurse him day and night. Her Sister who had gone to her at Paris was obliged to hurry back to London to attend to her own Husband who is confined to bed. She told me <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was the only other person whom her sister (Lady A) would like to have beside her. <hi rend="italic">Would</hi> I write and ask if I might come. It was a serious undertaking for <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> at this season, who had never crossed the Channel, and suffer so from sailing, and whose household affairs were in such a muddle&#x2014; A servant to go away and no one yet found to replace her; but what else <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I do but go to her if she would have me! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C too thought I could do nothing else.So I wrote and offered to come immediately. and you may think if I have not been perfectly bewildered while waiting her answer &#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Seeing</hi> Servants&#x201D; as the phrase is all the while! This morning I had a few hurried lines from <pb id="pg-39-07" n="39:07"/>Her  No&#x2014; I was not to come &#x201C;it could do <hi rend="italic">her</hi> no good and would knock <hi rend="italic">me</hi> up&#x201C;&#x2014;for the rest she was &#x201C;past all human help&#x201D; she said &#x201C;and past all sympathy.&#x201D; And the poor dear soul had drawn her pen thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> words. So like her! that she mightnt seem unkind! even in her agony of grief and dread, she thought of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi></p>
<p>Their Doctor&#x2019;s last two letters to me were very despondent; and neither today nor yesterday has there been any word from <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> as there would have surely been could he have imparted a grain of hope! We dread now that the next post will bring the news of our dear Lord Ashburtons death. Carlyle will lose in him the <hi rend="italic">only friend</hi> he has left in the world. and the world will lose in him one of the purest hearted, most chivalrous men that it contained.</p>
<p>There are no words for such a misfortune.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later on MS: &#x201C;(2 frag<hi rend="italic">ts,</hi> <date when="1863-11-00">Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-12-00">dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1863</date>, L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ill;&#x2014;this <hi rend="italic">first.</hi>&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>Meanwhile one&#x2019;s own poor little Life struggles on, with its daily petty concerns, as well as its great ones!&#x2014;</p>
<p>About these eggs, which mustnt be neglected if the Solar System were coming to a stand! I do not think Dear it was the fewness of the eggs that kept them safe so much as the plentifulness of the <hi rend="italic">hay!</hi> Depend on it your womans plan of making the eggs all touch each other was a bad one. We have still eggs for a week&#x2014;and then?&#x2014; I know of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> hens in the neighbourhood that have begun to lay but they do it irregularly. So I mustn&#x2019;t trust to <hi rend="italic">them!</hi> I dont think it would be safe to send the butter and eggs in the same box&#x2014;a coarse basket would do as well as a box for the eggs&#x2014;the difficulty of getting them sent doesnt seem to be the carriage so much as things to pack them in&#x2014;if we were but nearer, I might send what the Addiscombe gardner<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles received a weekly hamper of farm produce from the Ashburtons&#x2019; farm at Addiscombe; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600204-TC-LOA-01"><sic>36:59</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1860-02-04">4 Feb. 1860</date></corr></ref>; gardener unidentified further.</note> calls &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Empties</hi>&#x201D; back again at trifling cost. I must inquire what it would cost to send empty baskets, as it is&#x2014;I could take them myself to the office</p>
<p>Oh dear me! what a pleasure it is when one is away from home and has no servants to manage, and no food to provide! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C gets more and more difficult to feed. and more and more impatient of the imperfections of human cooks and human housewives!&#x2014; I sometimes feel as if I should like to&#x2014;run away! But the question always arises; where <hi rend="italic">to?</hi></p>

<p>I know your anxious nature Darling, and that you will be relieved to hear I am not gone, nor going on that wild journey; now that I am free to consider what it would have been for me, at this season, with my tendency to catch cold, my sufferings at sea, my ignorance of foreign travelling; I am thankful it is not required of me to go.</p>
<p>I inclose Lady A&#x2019;s wretched little note, which came yesterday: and I beg you to observe how she has dashed her pen thro&#x2019; the words &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">past all sympathy</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; So like her! kind, unselfish soul that she is! Even in the agony of her grief and dread, she had bethought her, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> expression might seem unkind to one who was offering her sympathy; and so she would not let it stand; bless her!</p>
<p>But tho&#x2019; delivered from all idea of having to go, I was perfectly hopeless about <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> after reading that note.  and all yesterday was expecting from hour to hour a Telegram announcing his death. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C who, for all his outward <hi rend="italic">grim</hi>ness, has far more <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi> in him than I have, or perhaps I should rather say, far less <hi rend="italic">Fear,</hi> thought; &#x201C;better news might come by the night-post&#x201C;! No news of any sort came by the night post. So I&#x2014;took <hi rend="italic">a doze of Morphia</hi> at bed time!

So I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> sleep and get up with some life in me, and go out after them <hi rend="italic">before</hi> eleven; when the French Post comes round; as, if I delayed till <hi rend="italic">after;</hi> the letter expected might make me unfit to go thro&#x2019; such petty business.

And that worrying work over, I called in at my Doctor&#x2019;s daughter,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Simmonds, Dr. Alfred Barnes&#x2019;s da.</note> and sat <pb id="pg-39-09" n="39:09"/>ever so long, because I was afraid to go home, and read the letter I was sure would be waiting&#x2014;</p>
<p>When I did read it, I found Lord A was a shade better&#x2014;and not absolutely despaired of yet! Even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> atom of good news made me so glad that I could hardly help&#x2014;kissing <hi rend="italic">Flo!</hi> the first person I saw after reading it! but I <hi rend="italic">didn&#x2019;t</hi> do anything so preposterous! I have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> opinion of the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain, an Irishman, whom the Ashburtons are infatuated with. and who has been a second time telegraphed for from London. A silly, wheedling, making-himself-generally-useful creature! Of his mercenariness you may judge from this that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther told me&#x2014;Lord A gave him <hi rend="italic">twelve hundred pounds</hi> for his first visit; and after receiving that large sum, he talked of &#x201C;the imme[n]se sacrifices he had made to his friendship for Lord and Lady A in coming!&#x201D; Little Beast! I question if his whole years practice yields him much more! For he is not <hi rend="italic">a great name</hi> at all!

<p>You would see dearest Mary by my last letter, that yours had not come before it was sent to the Post. It came some half hour after. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> letters never do come till the afternoon, which is curious, the letters from Jane<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken, TC&#x2019;s sister.</note> at Dumfries arriving always by the morning post.</p>
<p>The news from Paris continues a little more hopeful. But with the prospect of hard winter weather setting in before He can be got to Nice; one dare not feel too elated about the present slight ammendment.</p>
<p>At all rates I may be thankful, that I was not taken at my word, given in a moment when my sympathy overcame my discretion. for I think <hi rend="italic">now;</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> should most likely have been laid up at a Hotel at <hi rend="italic">Calais!</hi>&#x2014;which would have helped nothing, and been precious bad for myself!</p>
<p>Mooncalve is to go next monday. Whether to get a <hi rend="italic">character,</hi> or from <hi rend="italic">late</hi> shame of herself; she takes more pains now; and fewer things are cooked in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Infernal Regions.</hi>&#x201D; I dont think she can do Flo any harm; she is too great <pb id="pg-39-10" n="39:10"/>a blockhead to be <hi rend="italic">systematically</hi> mischievous; and Flo has too thorough an insight into her <hi rend="italic">mooncalveism</hi> to be influenced by her. She is a very intelligent little Girl, Flo; and, I <hi rend="italic">think,</hi> good. She is quite capable now of going thro&#x2019; her housemaid and parlour maid routine without my prompting; And when all that is become quite <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> to her, I have no fear but she will learn to do such <hi rend="italic">small</hi> jobs of sewing as are needed of her, quite as well as Maria ever did. The only objection to her that reveals itself so far, is the close proximity to her home,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Flo&#x2019;s mother was unwell; Flo had helped her run the house; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621103-JWC-MR-01"><sic>38:254&#x2013;55</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-11-03">3 Nov. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> If I did not give her leave to run in to see her Mother and the rest very often, the temptation to do it <hi rend="italic">without</hi> leave, staying her errands &#x26;c, would be too strong for so a young creature who had never been &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">out</hi>&#x201D; before. And her Mother tho a highly respectable and even refined sort of woman is I am afraid an excessive gossip and encourages Flo to tell her &#x201C;every thing that opens and steeks&#x201D; in this house. And Flo <hi rend="italic">does it,</hi> I perceive, with perfect innocence; telling me again &#x201C;I told Mother about Elizabeth doing this&#x201D; and &#x201C;I told Mother about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle saying that&#x201D; and so on!!&#x2014;and I dont like urging on her too directly, that she mustn&#x2019;t carry tales to her Mother&#x2014; Because so long as her <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi> likes to hear them Flo would carry them of course all the same; and I should only have gained to make her do surreptitiously what she does now with childlike frankness, Besides when one says, &#x201C;you mustn&#x2019;t go telling things out of the house&#x201C;; it sounds to uncultivated ears, as if one was <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> of what might be told. So it is better to just content myself [to]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> live in a glass house for the present of which little Flo is the unconscious show-woman!</p>
<p>I am very anxious as to how my prospective cook<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18621225-JWC-BB-01">JWC to BB, <date when="1862-12-25">25 Dec.</date></ref></note> will turn out. With such a character as I got of her from a Mistress who seemed a sensible trustworthy woman; I should not be at all afraid that after a few weeks she would do well enough&#x2014;if it weren&#x2019;t for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s frightful impatience with <hi rend="italic">any</hi> new servant untrained to his ways; which would drive a new woman out of the house with her hair on end, if allowed to act <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> upon her. So that I have to stand between them, and immitate in a small humble way the Roman soldier who gathered his arms full of the enemies spears and received them all into his own breast!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Oh heavens, the comparison! it was too true&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:143); cf. Horatius, Roman soldier who successfully defended the bridge over the Tiber against the entire Etruscan army, ca. 505 <hi rend="small-caps">bc</hi>.</note> It is this which makes a change of servants, even when for the better, a terror to me in prospect, and an agony in realisation&#x2014;for a time!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle defended TC and attacked JWC (whom he never met) in a lengthy note: &#x201C;This is of course exaggerative language. &#x2026; [T]he servants at Cheyne Row were all very fond of Carlyle, and would have &#x2018;gone thro&#x2019; fire and water&#x2019; to gain his approbation. He was uniformly kind and sympathetic, and never scolded them (unless at the instance of his Wife!) nor needed to scold; for, by a subtle influence, which may be called magnetic, he never failed to bring out a servant&#x2019;s best qualities. &#x2026; [JWC] too often failed, by reason of her inconstant temper, to win and hold their respect and confidence: at one time she over praised and petted them; at another, probably the very next minute, she went to the opposite extreme of censure and rebuke. This want of <hi rend="italic">steady</hi> treatment is generally ruinous to the very best of servants, and was probably the chief cause of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s troubles in housekeeping. It is hardly possible to imagine an easier task than hers was: a small house to keep in order; no children to be cared for; a Husband whose requirements were few and whose way of living was plain and simple. Surely housekeeping under these conditions ought to have been easily reducible to a minimum of trouble!&#x201D; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:276&#x2013;77).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-11" n="39:11"/>You say get a thorough good Cook at any wages! Yes&#x2014;if the <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> were all the difference! But when you have agreed to give sixteen guineas a year and ten pounds more for extras (the cost of a &#x201C;good plain Cook&#x201C;) you find that she requires &#x201C;a servants Hall&#x201D; and &#x201C;a bedroom up stairs&#x201D; and accommodations which your house, not having been built on purpose for so dignified an individual, does not possess. And still worse you find that she objects to making bread, and that with the power of cooking some hundreds of dishes which you dont want she has to be taught to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s little plain things just as an ignorant servant would, and that she disdains to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> taught, and that she thinks her gifts quite wasted on a household unworthy of them&#x2014;as indeed they would be!</p>
<p>I saw one woman of this sort whose appearance pleased me much&#x2014;and I agreed to the sixteen guineas and the ten for extras (!!!) but she was &#x201C;engaged to Lord Clarendon&#x2019;s Coachman<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George William Frederick Villiers (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28297"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 4th earl of Clarendon, statesman; coachman unidentified further.</note> and would like to have leave to receive his visits occasionally&#x2019;! and there was no dress kitchen for such a visitor!&#x2014;and no bedroom upstairs for her &#x201C;great number of trunks&#x201C;! And this was only &#x201C;a good plain Cook&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;a professed woman Cook&#x201D; gets 60 or 70 guineas a year of mere wages&#x2014;no what would suit me best, if good, is what is called &#x201C;a General Servant who is a plain cook&#x201D; the wages of these is from twelve to fourteen pounds and &#x201C;every thing found&#x201C;&#x2014;that is the sort of girl I have engaged with&#x2014;calculating on having to teach her to make bread and most of the things M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C requires but also calculating that she knows enough of roasting and boiling to learn these modifications without giving me too much trouble&#x2014; We shall see!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>The box of eggs came yesterday, another perfect success! Not a single egg broken or cracked! The barrel arrived today; and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has already eaten a quarter of one of the fowls, and found less fault with his dinner than he is in the habit of doing now. In fact I look forward to his dinner-time with a sort of panic, which the event for most part justifies. I wish to God this long weary <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> were done! for his own sake and for everybody&#x2019;s near him. It is like living in a madhouse on the days when he gets on ill with his writing.</p>
<p>Well!&#x2014; The box of eggs this time was charged three shillings and sevenpence&#x2014;not a dear price for them to <hi rend="italic">us;</hi> fresh eggs (if it is <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> possible to get them) at this time of the year being twopence a-piece. But then there is the cost to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> and the box, and the trouble! The heavy barrel was charged three shillings and sixpence&#x2014;a penny less than the light little box! Can <hi rend="italic">you</hi> understand that&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> cant. Nor does it matter!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a new woman coming as cook next Tuesday and intense as has been M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s abhorrence of the present &#x201C;Mooncalve&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Cow&#x201D; &#x201C;Brute Beast&#x201C;&#x2014;I look forward with trepidation, to having to teach the new-comer all M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">things&#x2014;</hi>which every woman who comes has to be <hi rend="italic">taught;</hi> whether she can <hi rend="italic">cook</hi> in a general way or not. If the kitchen were only on the same floor with the room, but I have to go <hi rend="italic">down</hi> three pairs of stairs to it&#x2014;past a garden door kept constantly open in all weathers; and at this season of the year with my dreadful tendency to catch interminable colds, running up and down these stairs, teaching <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> making, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s sort of Soup and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s sort of puddings, cutlets &#x26;c &#x26;c is no joke!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later on MS: &#x201C;(frag<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>?).&#x201C;</note> My one constant terror is lest I should fall ill, and be unable to go down to the kitchen at all!&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> about <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at nights! Really,</p>
<p>&#x201C;If I were dead &#x2F; &#x201C;And a stone at my head &#x2F; &#x201C;I think I should be <hi rend="italic">be</hi>&#x2014;tter&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;[O]ld beggar&#x2019;s rhyme on entering: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m a poor helpless craiture, &#x2F; If I were &#x26;c. &#x2026; . better (baiture!)&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:141); see also 19:215.</note></p>
<p>There is the anxiety about dear Lord Ashburton too! that has been going on now some five weeks! sometimes relieved a little, then again worse than ever.</p>
<p>I have a note in my pocket at this moment which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C does not know of, leaving scarce a hope of his recovery! As it was not from the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> but from Lady <pb id="pg-39-13" n="39:13"/>A&#x2019;s niece,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Annie Nairn Anstruther.</note> who expresses herself very confusedly, and <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have made the case worse than it is, I decided not to unsettle M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C at his writing, with a sight of it; and it has felt burning my pocket all day! And every knock at the door makes my heart jmp into my throat, for it may be news of his death! As this letter won&#x2019;t reach you any sooner for being posted to night I will keep it open till tomorrow in case of another letter from Paris.</p>
<p>And if I have more to say I had better keep that till tomorrow to[o]&#x2014; I write with such a weight on my spirits tonight&#x2014;</p>

So that we couldn&#x2019;t have been kept in greater suspense if we had been in the same house with him! the last three days there has been again talk of &#x201C;a faint hope,&#x201D; &#x201C;a bare <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> of recovery.&#x201D; And their London Physic[i]an<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Richard Quain.</note> who has been <hi rend="italic">five</hi> times telegraphed for to Paris called here today immediately on his return, directed by Lady A to go and tell us his new hopes. When I was told D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain was in the Drawingroom, I went into him with my heart in my mouth; persuaded he had been sent to break the news of Lord A&#x2019;s death. My first words to him (he had never been in the house before) were &#x201C;Oh D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain what has brought you here?&#x201D; a reception so extraordinary, that he stood struck speechless! which confirmed me in my idea. and I said violently; &#x201C;tell me at once!&#x2014;you are come to tell me he is dead?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;My dear Lady, I am come to tell you no such thing; but quite the contrary!

What a fool that man must have thought me! Poor Lady A, who is devotedly attached to her Husband, has nursed him day and night, till she is so worn out that one could hardly recognise her (her Sister writes).

<p>I told you in my last&#x2014;did I not? that I had got a little girl of fifteen in place of my fine-Lady Housemaid&#x2014;and that the East lothian woman, instead of coming out in a better light, when left to her own inspirations, was driving M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C out of his senses with her blockheadisms, and carelessness<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the servant problems, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18621210-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-10">10 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;and that, much as I disliked changes in the dead of winter; there was no help for it but to send that woman back to a part of Gods earth where she had been &#x201C;well thought of&#x201D; (Jackie Welsh,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Amelia &#x201C;Jackie&#x201D; Welsh, JWC&#x2019;s cousin in Haddington.</note> had said) and where she &#x201C;could get plenty of good places&#x201D; (the goose herself said! a sorry account of the style of service now going in East lothian I can only say.</p>
<p>I hope I shall be more comfortable now&#x2014;for a while at least. The little Girl is extremely intelligent&#x2014;and active and willing&#x2014;is a great favourite with her Master thank Heaven! and has never needed a single cross word from me during the six weeks or so that she has been in the house!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for the trouble you have been so kind as take in regard to those Cromwell Documents.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note>
 They are curious to look into as <hi rend="italic">footprints</hi> <pb id="pg-39-22" n="39:22"/>of the actual man;&#x2014;interesting specimens of his punctual correctness in regard to all matters of justice between self and neighbours,&#x2014;very little attended to by many Captains of War, especially of Civil War, while fighting for their life and cause!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our news of Lord Ashburton are later than your own, but, I fear, not better, if perhaps so good;&#x2014;at least the last Newspaper paragraphs go beyond what <hi rend="italic">we</hi> dare believe.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> reported, <date when="1862-12-30">30 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The friends of Lord Ashburton will be happy to learn that there is every prospect of his lordship recovering from his recent dangerous illness. The accounts received from Paris on Saturday and the preceeding day were of a more favourable tenor. The noble lord is staying at the Hotel Bristol, but it will be some weeks before he can be expected to leave for the south of France with Lady Ashburton.&#x201C;</note> We had a Letter yesterday from Dr Christison, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I designed to enclose for My Lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Paulina Trevelyan.</note> and you, but it has fallen aside:&#x2014;and I can only find two others, from Mrs Anstruther, a week earlier in date, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will shew you how very bad things then were. The Dr, who dates Sunday &#x26; Saturday last, reports some improvement of symptoms; and still seems to have a hope,&#x2014;as I too struggle to have, tho&#x2019; both Mrs A. and my Wife seem to have little or none; there being such utter weakness; and signs of dropsical swelling in the hands and feet, a thing wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all Doctors regard as of the worst omen in heart-diseases. These dropsical signs, it appears, for a week past, are rather diminishing than otherwise; and the poor Patient still has appetite, still gets sleep; and is heroically calm, and indeed latterly has not much pain.&#x2014; I myself know not what to think; except that the danger is very great,&#x2014;but that hope surely is still there, and for the last six or seven days appears to have been increasing rather than otherwise. In my ignorance, that of taking daily a due portion of nutritive food (soups, mutton, game, &#x26;c, in fair quantity) seems to me a symptom of high value. But alas, alas&#x2014;! In fact we do not know!&#x2014;</p>
<p>With many regards to her Ladyship &#x26; yourself, I remain <closer><salute>Sincerely yours</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>Accept this little Gift,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s customary New Year gift of money; he noted: &#x201C;<date when="1863-01-06">6 jany 1863</date> &#x2F; to Sister Jean (Dumfries) &#x2F; &#xa3;10..0..0&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).

 That is true in spite of all the sorrows &#x26; the fightings one has.</p>
<p>I may surely now &#x26; then indulge myself with the hope of getting a sight of you again, this year; but I <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> myself nothing,&#x2014;let me only fight along towards doing my own part of the matter, while permitted. Seeing or not seeing, I know the affection you, and all the others, regard me with at all times; and truly it is among my principal possessions still left me. To say and pray, All good be with you, is a very natural thing: it is saying, All good be with <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> too.</p>
<p>We continue both of us in tolerable health; Jane taking always rather better with <hi rend="italic">heat,</hi> almost at any price. I am kept in perpetual &#x201C;worry&#x201D; (as they call <pb id="pg-39-29" n="39:29"/>it here); you have no idea what a herd of <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> I have to drive before me thro&#x2019; the mud!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As you saw the Letter to Jack, it tell<supplied>[s]</supplied> you all I had to say.

<p>Adieu, dear Sister. May all good be with you and what belongs to you. I specially send James my kind regards.

<p>I have the farther pleasure of being able to assure you that I think it very well done, and likely to prove a good Book and extensively acceptable. I read a good way into it last night,&#x2014;in fact, was cut short by my candles going out;&#x2014;and this is the judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I formed, more and more confidently, by degrees. The <pb id="pg-39-32" n="39:32"/>style of delineation (not of language only) is clear and solid; the superfluous has been faithfully hammered away; faithful labour everywhere discloses itself to the initiated; and to all classes of honest readers, the narrative flows on with an agreeable charm, as of candid insight, well-regulated sympathy, brevity,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">truth</hi> in short, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> means everything. I hope well of this Book; and farther that it may be the beginning of still greater from you, in long series thro&#x2019; years to come.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Morison continued to write, producing many articles, reviews, and short works, including <hi rend="italic">Gibbon</hi> (<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Macaulay</hi> (<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>) in the &#x201C;English Men of Letters&#x201D; series, ed.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>You thought I must be <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> that I did not write; and now that three days have brought no answer to your inquiry, I shouldn&#x2019;t wonder if you are thinking I must be <hi rend="italic">dead!</hi></p>
<p>I am only very <hi rend="italic">stupid</hi> Dear! uncommonly stupid! not to have learnt, by this time of day, to write off a few lines, when I am hindered by business, or illness, or anything, from writing a good long letter&#x2014; But there I go on, from day to day, holding my peace, because the <hi rend="italic">season is not convenient</hi> for saying <hi rend="italic">all</hi> I want to say&#x2014;leaving my friend to frighten herself at getting no letter at all, just because nothing would content me but that she should get a good long one!&#x2014; I really must try ammend this stupidity, the result in part of having lived and learnt to write letters, long before the era of Rowland Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rowland Hill (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13299"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), civil servant; postal reformer responsible for introducing the penny post, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.</note>&#x2014;when the postage of a letter from London to Scotland was fourteen pence halfpenny and to be paid by the <hi rend="italic">receiver;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Until the introduction of the penny post, &#x201C;postage on letters &#x2026; varied according to distance and the number of sheets of paper&#x201D; (M. J. Daunton, <hi rend="italic">Royal Mail: The Post Office since <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date></hi> [<date when="1985-00-00">1985</date>] 6).</note> so that nobody with a conscience would have dreamt of dispatching letters of only <hi rend="italic">a few lines!</hi></p>
<p>Yes, Dear, you were quite right in thinking things must be wrong with me; when <hi rend="small-caps">you</hi> were so long of hearing. And if you were to guess far into next week, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wouldn&#x2019;t guess <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the matter has been! The first thing to imagine, in the course of nature, especially in midwinter, is, that I have been ill. And in truth I have been far from well&#x2014;with my old <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> very bad on me, and a weary pain in my back besides; a thing I never had before. But it hasnt been the winter that has hurt me&#x2014;indeed we have had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> winter here yet! only fine spring-like weather, in which even I couldnt manage to be laid up with my usual cold. The illness I have had, and am still having has been caused, palpably enough, by a mental shock which struck me deadly sick at stomach, and struck the pain into my back, in the first moment of it; And tho&#x2019; my mind has recovered its balance, these consequences still remain.</p>
<p>One expects to hear of something sentimental, romantic, at least exciting; when anybody speaks of having had a great mental shock. My Dear! lower <pb id="pg-39-35" n="39:35"/>your expectations, bring them down to the level of the meanest prose!&#x2014; For what I have to tell you is again about&#x2014;my Servants!!! But take up the Servant as a human being&#x2014;a fellow creature&#x2014;and read my paltry tale as a phsycological illustration; and it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> enough to throw one into a fit of misanthropy&#x2014;besides making one sick at stomach and breaking one&#x2019;s spine in two!</p>
<p>When I wrote last, I was looking forward to better times below stairs.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s previous letter may have been <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631215-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-12-15">15 Dec.</date>]</ref>, when she wrote about the engagement of Mary, the new cook.</note>
 The new cook seemed a decent young woman, not bright or quick; but who would, with a little teaching and a good deal of patience be made to <hi rend="italic">do&#x2014;</hi> &#x201C;Flo&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Florence Morrison.</note> was clever, and assiduous, and thoughtful and helpful. the only thing to be guarded against with <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> was the tendency to praise and pet her overmuch, and so&#x2014;spoil her; as I had spoilt Charlotte!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Southam.</note> But I was helped in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> by the want of personal <hi rend="italic">attraction</hi> for me in the Child. There was something dry and hard, something <hi rend="italic">unyouthful</hi> in her manner, and voice, which coupled with her extraordinary cleverness and assiduity, sometimes reminded me of the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Changelings</hi>&#x2019; in Fairy Legends.</p>
<p>Well! As the days went on &#x201C;a change&#x201D; seemed to come over &#x2018;the Spirit of&#x2019; the new Cooks &#x2018;dream.&#x2019;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron, &#x201C;The Dream&#x201D; line 75.</note> She grew more and more gloomy, and sullen, and indifferent; till she grew exactly into her Scotch predecessor <hi rend="italic">translated into English&#x2014;minus</hi> the utter blockheadism!!! I was careful to make no remarks on her before Flo; but Flo was constantly <hi rend="italic">blurting out</hi> aggravating instances of negligence and disagreeableness on the part of the new comer. At last one day my dissatisfaction reached a climax; and I told this Mary, that I perceived she would not suit, and that I thought it best to tell her so in the first month. And again my weary Spirit was wandering thro&#x2019; space in Search of a Cook, beset by far greater difficulties than &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Celebs in search of a Wife</hi>&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hannah More, <hi rend="italic">Coelebs in Search of a Wife</hi> (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>).</note>
 The only person that looked delighted was Flo, as delighted as she had looked when I gave Elizabeth warning.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Elizabeth&#x2019;s dismissal, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18621210-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-10">10 Dec. 1862</date>].</ref></note></p>
<p>Next day I was just putting on my bonnet to go out on this miserable search, when the Cook said to me; she thought it very strange to be <hi rend="italic">going</hi> in this way! that she had &#x201C;never gone out of any place before in less than a year at the least.&#x201D; &#x201C;Whose fault is it?&#x201D; I said&#x2014; &#x201C;Do you consider it <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> for me to keep a woman, who shows no sort of interest in doing or learning the work she has undertaken to do here&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;Well said the woman, with a half sob, I am aware I have made myself very disagreeable; but it wasnt easy, to be good tempered and to try to please; with Flo, every time she came down stairs <pb id="pg-39-36" n="39:36"/>telling me the dreadfulest things that you said of me, and of every thing I did&#x201C;!!! &#x201C;that I was &#x201C;nothing but a stupid dirty maid-of-All work, fit for nothing but a Tradesman&#x2019;s house where I could get tumbling about among a lot of rough workmen&#x201C;&#x2014;and Oh far worse things than that!&#x201C;&#x2014; astonishment took away my speech for a moment; I had not said ;<hi rend="small-caps">one word</hi> of the woman to the Child&#x2014;knowing that she carried every thing to her Mother.</p>
<p>I rung the bell for Flo.&#x2014; &#x201C;What is all this, I asked that you have been telling Mary&#x2014;as said of her by <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;Well Mam said Flo very red, <hi rend="italic">I couldn&#x2019;t help it!</hi> Mary was always asking me what you said about her&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> Mary! (like a viper); and I was <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to tell her <hi rend="italic">something</hi>&#x201C;! &#x201C;You were <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to invent horrible lies, were you?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;If I didn&#x2019;t tell her something, Mam, she wouldnt leave me along&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh you wicked girl!&#x201D; burst in Mary, &#x201C;What was <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> asking you when you tried to set me against the Place and the Mistress from the first night I entered the house&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> said Flo&#x2014;&#x201C;I only repeated what Elizabeth said! &#x201C;And the Mistress would be a little surprised, said Mary, if I were to tell Her what you told <hi rend="italic">Me!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh I will tell her myself,&#x201D; said Flo; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">if you please</hi> Mam, Elizabeth said, a woman that was her fellow-servant in Scotland, told her before she came here that you were a She-devil! And Elizabeth said <hi rend="italic">that</hi> tall chair (pointing to a <hi rend="italic">prie Dieu</hi>) was <hi rend="italic">for strapping you to, when you were mad!!!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; It was at this point that the sickness came into my stomach and the pain into my back! &#x201C;Good God&#x201D; I said, when I could speak, is it possible that you who have lived beside me these two months, who have never got a cross look or harsh word from me who have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> my behavior to that very Elizabeth, could say the like of this?&#x201D; &#x201C;If you please Mam it wasn&#x2019;t me that said it, it was Elizabeth&#x201C;! &#x201C;Oh you lying bad girl&#x201D; broke in Mary. I see it all now! that you were set on driving me out of the place, and I shouldnt wonder if you did the same by Elizabeth.&#x201C;</p>
<p>The same thought had just flashed on myself. It was from the day Maria left and <hi rend="italic">this child</hi> came, that Elizabeth began to grow, from a mere obedient blockhead, into a sullen, disobliging, blockhead, seeming to rather take pleasure in poisoning M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C than not!</p>
<p>In <hi rend="italic">her</hi> case there wasnt even <hi rend="italic">invention</hi> needed. The imp had only to do what I was constantly warning her against viz: to <hi rend="italic">repeat</hi> the strong things M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said of Elizabeths cookery and self generally, to drive the woman to fury, and make her the unbearable creature she became!</p>
<p>&#x2014;Flo seeing herself unmasked began to cry very hard&#x2014;repeating again and again, &#x201C;you will never be able to bear me again, I know! I <hi rend="italic">have been so treacherous!</hi> You were so kind to me! and I was so fond of you! and I have been so very treacherous oooh-oooh oo&#x2014;oh.&#x201C;&#x2014; I didn&#x2019;t know what on earth to do&#x2014; I didn&#x2019;t feel justified in turning her off on the spot&#x2014; And to keep her was like keeping a poisonous viper at large in the House&#x2014; The only thing I was clear about was to withdraw my warning to Mary, whose behaviour had been <pb id="pg-39-37" n="39:37"/>sufficiently excused by the influences acting on her. Flo&#x2019;s Mother, hearing of the row came over to try and shift the blame on Mary&#x2014; I rung the bell and said to Mary, &#x201C;Mr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Morrison has accusations to make against you Mary&#x2014;you had better hear them yourself, and answer her&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know nothing about it.&#x201C;&#x2014; And then ensued an altercation, between the two women, (while I sat with my feet on the finder<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;fender.&#x201C;</note> and my back to them) in which M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Morrison came by the worse; having only drawn out a <hi rend="italic">fuller</hi> statement of Flo&#x2019;s horrid conduct. She went away imploring me to &#x201C;try her (Flo) a little longer&#x2014;it would be a lesson she would never forget &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D; And I said &#x201C;she can stay&#x2014;for the present, till I see what comes of her.&#x201D; But three days after the Child herself said &#x201C;I can never be happy here after having been <hi rend="italic">so</hi> treacherous and I had better go away.&#x201D; I am glad you think so I said so the sooner you go the better today if you like&#x2014;and in an hour she was gone! My paragone little Housemaid! Three days after she came over&#x2014;tears all dried&#x2014;looking hard and bold, to ask me to &#x201C;see a Lady&#x201D; for her. &#x201C;What sort of Character do you think I can give you I asked&#x2014;&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well! said the Child I have <hi rend="italic">told a few lies</hi> and I <hi rend="italic">have been treacherous;</hi> but that is <hi rend="small-caps">all</hi> you can say against me&#x201C;! The dreadful child!</p>
<p>I saw a girl,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lizzy.</note> that I thought would suit me, the same day Flo left; but she couldn&#x2019;t come for a month, and her Aunt<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Winslade; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630217-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-02-17">17 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> who wished me to wait for her, offered to come and help Mary&#x2014;till the girl was free&#x2014; So I have a great jolly clever elderly woman in the kitchen except for the two last days of the week when she is engaged elsewh<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note>&#x2014;and Mary does nicely up stairs&#x2014; This woman is a capital Cook and I almost wish the present arrangement, tho&#x2019; an expensive one, could last&#x2014;now that I have got used to the big woman, who &#x201C;thoroughly understands her business&#x201C;&#x2014; But she has a Husband and couldn&#x2019;t stay with me in permanence</p>
<p>Now; do you wonder I fell ill?&#x2014; (Think of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s impatience as a running accompaniment to all this disgusting worry!)</p>
<p>Marion&#x2019;s announcement<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marion Kirk, Mary Russell&#x2019;s servant, apparently thinking of going to America; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630412-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-04-12">12 April</date>]</ref>; unidentified further.</note> was vexatious enough&#x2014;but there was no &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">treachery</hi>&#x2019; to turn your heart upside down.&#x2014; Still I am very sorry she has taken such a whim in her head; for she saved you a deal of trouble&#x2014;and your establishment was all so <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> looking&#x2014;that I often envied you in my own changings</p>
<p>You have plenty of time before you to look out; that is one comfort; and another is, taking a new servant in the country where she is known is not such a leap in the dark as taking a Town one; and the greatest comfort of all is; <hi rend="italic">your</hi> <pb id="pg-39-38" n="39:38"/>Husband is not so awfully impatient as some people&#x2019;s Husbands, and is a help to you rather than a hindrance in difficulties! But I shall be very glad when you can tell me you have heard of somebody likely to suit&#x2014;</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s convales[c]ence is at a stand&#x2014; I have never been able till lately to feel the hope of him that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and others felt&#x2014;and now the accounts are ominous again&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have written all this at intervals&#x2014;my back aching too bad for sitting straight up long together</p>
<p>Write to me soon&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">need</hi> a letter&#x2014;</p>
<p>I owe your Husband sixpence&#x2014;please give him these six Stamps&#x2014;they were left out of my letter to him<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630106-JWC-DRJR-01">JWC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>DRJR</corr>, <date when="1863-01-06">6 Jan.</date></ref></note> by mistake</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have got two pleasant little Notes from you; you are very good to write with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ans<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> I did intend, last Friday, to ans<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> and had laid all my plans: but on proceeding to <hi rend="italic">act,</hi> and inquiring what day of the month, I found that it was already <hi rend="italic">Saturday!</hi> Such things often enough befal; I am kept in such a hurry and a flurry, not a moment but what is screwed from the press, by force of art! Tonight (Thursday night) I take time by the forelock.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> Will add, can if needful, a word tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are both tolerably well;&#x2014;not quite up to par, Jane,&#x2014;nor I either (broken sleep &#x26;c);&#x2014;but struggling along, not so ill as is often enough one&#x2019;s case. This tepid Winter has suited Jane extremely: she has never had a cold once that fairly lasted; she hopes now we are past the worse.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Latterly the weather has been really beautiful; clear cool west winds, extremely dry and comfortable; more like Spring than January. This evening I rode by Wimbledon, thro&#x2019; the fine solitary roads &#x26; Park; all the woods were clean, the fields dry and bright;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Wimbledon Common, SW London, between Putney and Wimbledon, rather than the smaller Wimbledon Park nearby. Wimbledon Common and the neighboring Putney Common were 1,140 acres (460 hectares).</note> in some of the warm spots there seemed even a colour of <hi rend="italic">new green;</hi> and birds here and there were attempting a slight note or two of song to one another,&#x2014;evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> under the idea that pairing-time was just come.</p>
<p>I had very near decided this week to commence my Two Months <hi rend="italic">now</hi>:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Printing was to stop for a while after TC wrote the section on the battle of Hochkirch, end bk. 18; TC had hoped to pause also for two months; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18621228-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-12-28">28 Dec. 1862</date></ref>.</note> I am thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Leuthen,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the battle of Leuthen, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:309&#x2013;31.</note> and a very great deal of boggy thickets and difficult places: and some fifty pages more lay to be done, <hi rend="italic">more</hi> unmanageable than any. However, I decided, driven by despair, to get thro&#x2019; these also before ending; &#x26; am now fairly <hi rend="italic">in</hi> again (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a comfort in comparison). I shall not get loose therefore till well on in February,&#x2014;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> p. 300, with <hi rend="italic">Hochkirch</hi> ended,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are 76 pages between the battles of Leuthen and Hochkirch in <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> 1st edn.; for the battle of Hochkirch, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:397&#x2013;424.</note> and a new <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> waiting me. The new Book ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 100 pages sh<hi rend="italic">d end</hi> the 7-Years War: it will require all my art of condensation to to<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To&#x201D; repeated on turn of page.</note> pack the <pb id="pg-39-40" n="39:40"/>thing into such compass: but I hope I can do it; I must try my very best!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two more books and 583 pages were required to reach the end of the Seven Years&#x2019; War; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18.</note> There will be no <hi rend="italic">holiday</hi> for me; none;&#x2014;but I shall not have the printers continually on my heels: and hope in the course of &#x201C;two months&#x201D; to have got a good start again, and the hideous bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> a good deal subdued! Till fairly out of <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> there can be no real rest to me.

I have so overshot the point I had in view at starting!, which was simply to excuse my delay in answering your kind letter and thanking you a thousand times for the enclosure; on the ground that I had been waiting till the Photographer had light and leisure to print me some more <hi rend="italic">Cartes</hi> of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and myself, that I might show my scotch breeding in sending you a pair,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably two of the photographs taken by William Jeffrey, <date when="1862-09-00">Sept. 1862</date>.</note> as&#x2014;&#x201C;a suitable return&#x201C;&#x2014; That I should have contrived to spread such a speck of meaning into two pages of writing seems to indicate a talent for writing Three Vol: Novels, which might have made a rich woman of me if I had cultivated it! And if I had become rich, by that, or any other means, wouldn&#x2019;t I have built, immediately a pretty Cottage by the sea shore, somewhere between North Berwick and Dunbar;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Small towns on the East Lothian coast.</note> and gone to it every summer; and set up a pony carriage; and driven all the roads, I used to go with my Father!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 67&#x2013;68.</note> Bless me!

<p>But your photograph looks as if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had no weight to carry. So bright, and elastic!

<p>If you have one of your Husband, like the one you gave me, I wish you would send it, and I would return the former one, which has got a little of the <hi rend="italic">carte</hi> cut off at the top, which gives me the feeling of his being in a room with a painfully low ceiling!

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley</salute>
<p>Another instance of what I was telling your Daughter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Kate Stanley, who lived with her mother at Alderley Park, Cheshire; JWC also corresponded regularly with Lady Airlie, another of Lady Stanley&#x2019;s das.</note>&#x2014;that I had degenerated from a woman into a sort of paper kite, blown wherever the wind of Circumstance listed!&#x2014;a particularly flagrant instance too; considering how pleased I was to receive your letter; and how it somehow went to my heart! (for even in my paper-kite phase I have still some heart &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C;)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430818-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:63</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-18">18 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>There was here and there, in that letter of yours, a soft sad tone, that I never heard come out of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> before, and which gave me the impression of having been struck from your heart-strings by some sharp touch of suffering bodily or spiritual. I wished myself beside you; that I might pray you to tell me where the ache was; and see whether I had perhaps some comfort for it&#x2014;out of my own experience of suffering! And yet I have not so much as thanked you for that letter till now! poor human paper-kite that I am!</p>
<p>The hindrances to letter-writing in these last days have been not a whit more dignified than old-boots to mend! But I begin to think that any woman &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">here down</hi>&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430809-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:33</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-09">[9 Aug. 1843]</date></corr></ref>.

<p>If I were in good spirits I could make an amusing story for you out of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> last troubles. The materials are lying there invitingly. But I am in the worst of <pb id="pg-39-44" n="39:44"/>Spirits &#x2014; I have just been deceived, betrayed, made a fool of! and my present mood is more like that of <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Shakespeare&#x2019;s play, Timon of Athens was a man driven to misanthropy by the false and treacherous behavior of people he had thought were his friends.</note> (!) than anybody I could name! And the individual who has converted me into a M<hi rend="italic">rs Timon of Athens</hi> for the time being is &#x2014; a child!! a small Girl of fourteen,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Florence Morrison.</note> whom I took some three months ago, to train into a housemaid, and <hi rend="italic">attach to us while her heart was impressionable,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that sort of thing!</hi> (Conceive such egregious folly at my age!) This little girl was more like a Sprite than a mortal child; so clever! so assiduous! so thoughtful! so helpful! She learnt far faster than I could teach, and subdued even M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s impatience with new servants, which keeps me in a continual tremor for the first month. Lying awake at nights I sometimes thought it would be advisable to make some sort of <hi rend="italic">Adoption</hi> of this Child&#x2014;at all rates, that I would leave her a small annuity when I died (a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> small one it would need to be!) and my only difficulty with her in the meantime was to keep myself from spoiling her with too much praise and indulgence. In this I was aided by the girl&#x2019;s want of personal attraction. There was something strangely dry, hard, and unyouthful in her manner and voice; tho her face was honest and open as day! In fact she often reminded me of the <hi rend="italic">Changeling</hi> in old Fairy ballads.</p>
<p>But as little &#x201C;Flo&#x201D; grew in favour, the Scotch Cook<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth.</note> grew out of favour. She had always been a Blockhead,&#x2014;A &#x201C;Mooncalve,&#x201D; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said&#x2014;but now she exhibited a sulkiness, a doggedness which coupled with dinners that looked (I quote again from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C) &#x201C;as if they had been cooked in The Infernal Regions&#x201C;&#x2014;(so burnt and blackened every thing was!) became unbearable, and tho&#x2019; horrible the idea to me<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440625-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:83</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-06-25">[25 June 1844]</date></corr></ref>.</note> of changing in winter, I gave <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi> warning next!

When completely unmasked she turned on me a look that suggested arsenic, and said &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Well!</hi> I have told a few lies, and I have been treacherous&#x2014;very treacherous&#x2014;but that is <hi rend="small-caps">all</hi> you have to say against me!!&#x201C;&#x2014; This explosion (with strong smell of sulphur) of my ideotic dream, to attach a servant to me while still a Child, occurred on the same day that I received your letter, and made me so ill,&#x2014;so sick at heart and at stomach,&#x2014;so sleepless,&#x2014;so humiliated in my &#x201C;finer sensibilities,&#x201C;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-carlyle-notebook"><sic>30:167</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Notebook, <date when="1845-04-13">13 April 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> that I could settle to nothing; not even to answering that kind letter of yours; but went mooning about, doing &#x201C;here a little and there a little&#x201C;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Isa. 28:10.</note> in the Housemaid line&#x2014;to cover, so far as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was concerned the deficiency of service produced by the Changeling&#x2019;s sudden restoration to the bosom of her admiring Family. For the rest, the disenchanted Cook works so well and willingly by herself, that I am reminded of Rowland Hill&#x2019;s saying; &#x201C;If you want to be well served keep <hi rend="italic">one</hi> servant; keep <hi rend="italic">two</hi> and you will be half served; keep <hi rend="italic">three</hi> and you may serve yourself&#x201C;!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Welsh wrote to JWC, <date when="1863-01-01">1 Jan.</date>, commenting on her servant situation: &#x201C;The secret of their doing better at first than afterwards is, their willingness to do their work for a while, after going to a new place. I am almost glad we cannot afford to keep more than one. Even that I would dispense with if I could, sometimes. You have probably heard Rowland Hill&#x2019;s opinion of servants, it was this, keep one servant, and you will get your work done, two and you will get it half done, three and you may do it yourself.&#x201D; Rowland Hill&#x2019;s saying otherwise untraced.</note> I often <pb id="pg-39-46" n="39:46"/>wonder how rich people who, like you, keep a whole regiment of servants manage to get their work done! Perhaps with servants as with Lovers, &#x201C;there is safety in numbers&#x201C;!<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Such has been the terrific Tempest (<hi rend="italic">in a Teapot</hi>) which it has required all my strength of body and mind to merely stand up against! Better perhaps to have said in two polite lines; that I had been suffering from a severe bilious attack which had made it impossible for me to write, or do anything with my head&#x2014; Certainly better; had I been writing to a mere fine Lady; but your charm for me, dear Lady Stanley, is your intense <hi rend="italic">humanness!</hi> and it is in virtue of <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> I am giving you these human, tho &#x201C;ungenteel&#x201D; details.</p>

<salute>My dear Elizabeth</salute>
<p>If any one had told me, when I was so glad over your nice, long clever letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Welsh wrote <date when="1863-01-01">1 Jan.</date></note> that I shouldn&#x2019;t answer it till the first day of Spring;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the ancient Celtic calendar, <date when="1863-02-02">2 Feb.</date> was &#x201C;Imbolc,&#x201D; the first day of spring, halfway between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. JWC&#x2019;s last letter, arriving at the Welshes, Wed., <date when="1863-12-31">31 Dec.</date>, was probably written either <date when="1862-12-29">29</date> or <date when="1862-12-30">30 Dec. 1862</date>. She apparently enclosed a copy of vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> as Elizabeth Welsh replied: &#x201C;I received your letter yesterday, with the accompanying Book, for which I return you many thanks. I do not know whether I shall like the Book, or not, but I appreciate the kindness which prompted you to send it. I am glad to hear that your health is pretty good at present, and that your new domestics are installed into Office.&#x201D; Further comments indicated some of the contents of JWC&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;Poor Lord Ashburton, I am afraid his course is nearly run, if not already finished, his death must make a great blank, to you and Mr Carlyle. I was amused with your account of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Alexander&#x2019;s introducing himself to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle he is very eccentric, but withall, has considerable ability.&#x201D; For the Rev. Thomas Alexander, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630302-JWC-GWE-01">JWC to <sic>GW</sic><corr>GWE</corr>, [<date when="1863-03-02">2 March</date></ref>.</note> I should have been tempted to box his, or her ears, for a prediction so improbable, and so discreditable to me, as a niece, and as a human-being!&#x2014; Yet; so it is! And looking at my delay, from the point of view, of one informed of all the facts of the case; I am not so troubled in conscience as you might expect!</p>
<p>But it is difficult, within the compass of a letter, to lay the facts of the case before another; the more; that the facts are rather contemptible in themselves, and can have no interest for another, except thro&#x2019; that others sympathy with my own trouble&#x2014; &#x2014;some share in them. And alas! it is not <hi rend="italic">always,</hi> that others, even <hi rend="italic">Aunts,</hi> are in a sympathetic mood! or that oneself is in a mood to rely on sympathy!&#x2014; But here I had better say, to myself, what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C often says to me; &#x201C;For God&#x2019;s sake my Dear! <hi rend="italic">do</hi> hasten to the Catastrophe!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451001-JWC-TC-02"><sic>20:6</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-10-01">[1 Oct. 1845]</date></corr></ref>; cf. <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> 111 and <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:263.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-48" n="39:48"/>Well my Dears! The roof has been nearly blown off my House! (figuratively speaking) and I have had a severe bilious attack from the shock (<hi rend="italic">without</hi> figure of speech). and am still as far from well as a woman, making no outcry, and sitting upright on a chair, writing a letter to an estimable Aunt, could easily be!</p>
<p>When I last wrote to you, there was no indication of Storm brewing in my household. On the Contrary a blessed Calm had fallen on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s temper, and speech; during dinner-time especially! He seemed to take it for granted no more &#x201C;poison&#x201D; would or could be presented to him, since &#x201C;Mooncalve&#x201D; had taken her departure. The new Cook tho neither an experienced or clever servant, got on, with my instructions quite as well [as]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted by JWC.</note> I had expected, and her attention and willingness gave promise that she would soon be able to get on by herself. As for the little Housemaid, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had been satisfactory from the first hour; learnt faster than I could teach her; was assiduous, thoughtful, helpful!&#x2014; The only danger I foresaw in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> case was the danger of <hi rend="italic">spoiling</hi> her by over-praise and over-indulgence. I found a certain protection against <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">child&#x2019;s</hi> want of personal attraction for me. In spite of her honest open face, and tidy figure; there was something hard, dry, <hi rend="italic">unyouthful</hi> in her appearance and <hi rend="italic">voice,</hi> which often reminded me of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Changelings</hi>&#x201D; in Fairy lore! But I had had enough of &#x201C;the finer sensibilities of the Heart&#x201D; with Maria!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Chamberlayne.</note> I was better pleased that her small successor should be <hi rend="italic">service able</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">loveable,</hi> or loving. Such was the state of my domesticities at the beginning of the year; and such as it was I was thankful for it!</p>
<p>But presently a shadow fell on the new Cook, and darkened day by day; till I found her spiritless, careless, disobliging&#x2014;in fact exactly the Scotch Elizabeth (<hi rend="italic">mooncalve</hi>) <hi rend="italic">translated into English.</hi> Finding no improvement on the woman, after a week of this sort of thing, I decided&#x2014;with horror&#x2014;but still decided to part with her at once&#x2014; So I told her &#x201C;I was sorry to find she would not suit, so she had best know it in the first month.&#x201D; She looked surprised, but made no answer. Of course I got no sleep that night for thinking about having to go forth into the wide world again in search of a Cook; and wondering if I ever <hi rend="italic">would</hi> find one &#x201C;to suit&#x201D; again!&#x2014; And whether the Frost would come first, and lay me on my bed, with the house in this unsettled state! I did not talk to Flo (the Changeling) on the matter, because I knew she had a gossiping Mother who encouraged her to tell every thing out of the house; but the Child showed her sympathy by redoubled attentions, and by blurting out in the most innocent way her indignant feelings towards this fellow servant who &#x201C;wasn&#x2019;t in the least fit for a <hi rend="italic">gentleman&#x2019;s</hi> house.&#x201D; The next day I was getting ready to go out on my irksome business when the Cook came to me, and <pb id="pg-39-49" n="39:49"/>asked in a subdued tone, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I was intending that she should leave? &#x201C;After a months warning of course&#x201C;&#x2014; She still hung about, and then said plaintively; it was the first time she had ever left a situation in less than a year at the least. &#x201C;I ask yourself, I said, was it <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> for me to go on with you; when you neither <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> nor show any wish or intention to do the duties of the Place you had undertaken?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh, said she, with a half sob, I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> I have made myself very disagreeable; but indeed Mam, it wasn&#x2019;t easy to be good tempered, and have any spirit for my work, whenFlo&#x2014;every time she came down stairs, repeated such dreadful things you said about me, and about everything I did! That I was nothing but a dirty Maid-of-All work&#x2014;only fit for a Tradesman&#x2019;s House where lots of rough workmen were tumbling about me&#x2014;and Oh far worse than that!&#x201D; I could only utter, aghast, the one word &#x2018;Flo&#x2019;?&#x2014; But I rung the bell, and when Miss Flo answered, I said, &#x201C;what on earth is all this? What have you been telling Mary, as said of her by <hi rend="italic">me? me</hi> who have never made a single remark on her <hi rend="italic">to</hi> you, or in your presence!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well Mam, said the Changeling flushing scarlet, I <hi rend="italic">couldn&#x2019;t help it!</hi> Mary was always asking me what you said about her&#x2014; You <hi rend="italic">know</hi> you <hi rend="italic">were</hi> Mary!&#x2014; And I had to tell her <hi rend="italic">something</hi> or she wouldn&#x2019;t let me alone&#x201C;! &#x201C;Oh you bad wicked girl! broke in Mary; what was <hi rend="italic">I</hi> asking you, when from the first days I was here, you were always trying to set me against the Mistress and the place. The Mistress would be a little surprised if I were to tell her all you said to me.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh you may tell her said Flo, at bay; I will tell her myself! If you please Mam it wasnt <hi rend="italic">I</hi> that said anything against you; I only repeated what Elizabeth said. She said, <hi rend="italic">if you please</hi> Mam, that a fellow servant she had in Scotland, knew all about you, and told her before she came here&#x2014;that you were a she-Devil!! and known all over Dumfries, where you came from for <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> and Elizabeth said it <hi rend="italic">must be true,</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">because</hi> she had seen plenty of letters come to you with the Dumfries postmark!!! (Elizabethian logic!)&#x2014; I turned deadly sick at this point, and a pain struck into my back; which sickness and pain havn&#x2019;t left me to the present hour! &#x201C;Child Child! I said is it possible that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who have never had a cross look or a harsh word from me, whom I have treated more like a Mother than a Mistress who <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> my behaviour to that very Elizabeth, could speak of me with such disrespect&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;It wasnt <hi rend="italic">me</hi> that said it&#x2014;I only <hi rend="italic">repeated</hi> what Elizabeth said&#x2014;&#x201D; I took no further part in the dialogue; I was too sad and sick; but Mary took it up, and said what had just flashed on myself, &#x201C;Nobody knows <hi rend="italic">what</hi> Elizabeth said or didn&#x2019;t say! I only know you have been trying all along to drive <hi rend="italic">me</hi> out of this place; and I dare say you did the same by Elizabeth! that you made <hi rend="italic">her</hi> bad, with your lies and tale-bearing, just as you were making <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> I have no doubt she <hi rend="italic">did,</hi> the little Imp of Satan! It was <hi rend="italic">after that</hi> Flo came, that Elizabeth from being simply a Blockhead became a <hi rend="italic">sullen, disobliging</hi> Blockhead, to whom I was forced to give warning! The altercation between the two, carried on, in my presence, disclosed depths of deceit and <pb id="pg-39-50" n="39:50"/>falsehood and malevolence in that Child&#x2014;that has made me misanthropical ever since! Finding herself unmasked, and the warning to Mary withdrawn, the Imp took to weeping and shrieking, &#x201C;Oh she had been so treacherous! so very treacherous! And I had been so kind to her&#x2014;so very kind! and she had been so fond of me! and I would never be able to like her again! hoo&#x2014;hooo-hoooo!&#x201D; This sort of thing went on at intervals for two days&#x2014;while I was considering what to do with her. The voice of Nature was for packing her neck and crop out of the house! It was like having a serpent gliding at large about one&#x2019;s room. But her Mother came and whinnered and besought me to &#x201C;think it over&#x201C;&#x2014;and while thinking it over, I was fortunately cut out of my difficulties by the Imp herself, coming to me, all dried up, and defiant, to say she &#x201C;had been so treacherous (odd word for a child) that she could never be happy beside <hi rend="italic">me</hi> again, and so had better go home.&#x201D; &#x201C;You are right I said and the sooner the better&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">today</hi> if you like&#x201C;!&#x2014; And in half an hour after, the paragone of small Housemaids was gone! A few days later she came to ask me to &#x201C;see a Lady&#x201D; for her&#x2014;what sort of character do you expect me to give you&#x201C;? I asked&#x2014; &#x201C;Well! said the Imp with a toss of her head, &#x201C;I have <hi rend="italic">told a few lies,</hi> and I have been <hi rend="italic">treacherous;</hi> but that is really <hi rend="italic">all</hi> you have to say against me!&#x201D; The discomfort of this explosion has been chiefly mental it sickened me to the heart, and still worse to the stomach. But the <hi rend="italic">House</hi> has been going on far better than usual. I engaged a girl of seventeen<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lizzie.</note> the very day of Flo&#x2019;s departure but couldn&#x2019;t have her for a month; and in the meantime the girls Aunt, an elderly married woman<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Winslade.</note> who had been Cook in &#x201C;Gentlemens Family&#x201D; comes every day to officiate in the kitchen while Mary grown altogether pleasant and serviceable is what they call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">up stairs.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; The arrangement is a rather expensive one; but oh! the comfort of it to my body and mind, wearied with such a long spell of running <hi rend="italic">after</hi> and looking <hi rend="italic">after!</hi>&#x2014; For this elderly woman is a servant of the old school, who &#x201C;thoroughly understands her business,&#x201D; hates being a minute idle, has every thing bright as a new pin, and sends up little dinners, which, consist of what they may, are perfect &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">works of art!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>In calculating the cost of her, I should count in capital <hi rend="italic">lessons</hi> in cookery thus given to my own Woman, if she have the sense to attend to them! Besides my own woman is learning meanwhile her new functions under most favourable auspices. The Girl coming in a fortnight is engaged as kitchen-maid&#x2014;to be <hi rend="italic">under</hi> Mary&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> may have as little bother as possible with her; and Mary is to be house-maid, parlour-maid, <hi rend="italic">valet,</hi> Ladys-maid, and needlewoman, as well as head-Cook! She <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> this arrangement; so I look forward to the new girl with less nervousness than new girls and new <pb id="pg-39-51" n="39:51"/>anythings usually inspire me with. But tho&#x2019; the house is going smoothly, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has nothing to drive him wild, (which is easy enough to do); the sickness at stomach and pain in my back, struck into me by the shock of finding &#x201C;that bit wise lassie&#x201D; (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C used to call her) a bit wise <hi rend="italic">serpent;</hi> still hang about me, after all the <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> disturbance of her has passed away!</p>
<p>I have had to write this long <hi rend="italic">screed</hi> at thrice, not being able to sit straight up for half an hour together.</p>
<p>Since I began the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> little sheet, I have received a volunary letter from Grace. So I will devote the remaining white paper to <hi rend="italic">her.</hi></p>

But I wish you could have given me a better account of yourself. I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> what a wearing misery that neuralgia is! I too have had it in my head and face, till I have been nearly, indeed <hi rend="italic">once</hi> altogether <hi rend="italic">delirious.</hi> My long winter illness usually commence in that way&#x2014;an intense <hi rend="italic">toothache</hi> (as it were) all thro&#x2019; my head and face that leaves me no moment&#x2019;s ease, day or night<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth wrote: &#x201C;Grace&#x2019;s complaint is chiefly rheumatism in her head or something of that character. She suspected the root of a decayed Tooth was the cause of her uneasiness, and had it taken out, but it has failed to give the relief she expected.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Sometimes I have had morphia given for it&#x2014;and derived from <hi rend="italic">it</hi> the questionable benifit<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of having <hi rend="italic">that</hi> form of my illness changed into some other form, as ill to bear! Besides where it is, as in your case, a malady of long continuance, Morphia would be unsafe to take for even temporary relief. What my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> recommends is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> nourishing diet in the most concentrated form. No weak broths! or what we used to call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">slaisters</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">soup</hi> strong enough to be called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">essence of beef</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;juicy mutton chops and that sort of thing and two glasses a day of good sherry&#x2014; I dare say <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are, as I used to be, unwilling, and ashamed to be at much expense with <hi rend="italic">yourself.</hi> But every consideration is to be postponed to the duty of keeping ones soul in a healthy body if one <hi rend="italic">can.</hi> Do <hi rend="italic">feed</hi> yourself up&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">milk</hi> agrees with you; there is nothing more nourishing than a tumbler of new milk with a table spoonful of <hi rend="italic">rum</hi> in it&#x2014;twice a day.</p>
<p>I was meaning to give Elizabeth a lecture about <hi rend="italic">her</hi> carelessness in feeding herself&#x2014;with such a bad digestion as she has!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth wrote: &#x201C;There are few things I dare eat, and these I am obliged to take so sparingly, that I have constantly to practice self denial, and yet with all the care I take, I cannot ward off these fits of indigestion. I think fatigue, and cold, are predisposing causes.&#x201C;</note> I am sure if she would take <pb id="pg-39-52" n="39:52"/>her nourishment in a more concentrated shape, she would find a difference! I dont believe M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C could have lived thro this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> if it hadn&#x2019;t been for his horse exercise and his almost daily breakfast cupful of clear <hi rend="italic">essence of beef.</hi> When I told him about Elizabeth&#x2019;s attacks, he said &#x201C;did you tell her to take <hi rend="italic">my</hi> strong gravy soup? write and tell her, that; <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> can match anybody in the British dominions for a bad digestion; and I consider myself to have been kept so long alive, by that one article of food.&#x201C;</p>
<p>If you would like our receipt for making it, tell me&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now my letter has reached a length very incompatible with a backache</p>
<p>You say no word of Ann?<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth wrote: &#x201C;Ann is often ailing, but when she wishes to do any thing, she breaks through all restraint, and goes out.&#x201C;</note> My dear love to you all and severally.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth wrote: &#x201C;I agree with you about the folly of wishing people happy new years. I rather think I go beyond you, for I am persuaded that since <hi rend="italic">Adam fell,</hi> no human being, young or old, has had one day of unbroken satisfaction, much less a year of happiness. We must look to another world than this for happiness. Now for my good wishes, I wish you may have fewer annoyances this year, than the last, a moderate share of bodily health, and as <hi rend="italic">Free</hi> &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Church people would</hi> say&#x2019; that your Soul may be in health and prosper. My Sisters unite with me in love and good wishes to you, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle.&#x201D; The Welsh aunts were evangelical members of the Church of Scotland.</note> <closer><salute>Your affectionate&#x2F;</salute></closer>  <name>Jane W Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your prompt kindness in the matter of Quintus Icilius.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Gottlieb Guichard; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630128-TC-JN-01">TC to [JN], <date when="1863-01-28">28 Jan.</date></ref></note> This is amply all I wanted about him; and it comes perfectly in time;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donne wrote, <date when="1863-02-05">5 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I believe the extracts herewith inclosed contain all you may wish for. But if you would prefer a transcript of all that Gibbon says about Quintus Icilius I will most gladly send you &#x2018;all&#x2019;&#x2014; What follows is an account of the contents of the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9; moires Militaires.</hi> &#x2F; I wish you had set me a more difficult task than this, in order that I might the better prove my esteem and respect for you.&#x201D; Donne enclosed various quotations from Gibbon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of my Life and Writings,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>), including: &#x201C;I diligently read and meditated the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires Militaires</hi> of Quintus Icilius (<hi rend="italic">Mr Guichard</hi>) the only writer who has united the merits of a professor and a veteran&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1768.45; Gibbon 1:97); see also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:29.</note> so that I <pb id="pg-39-54" n="39:54"/><pb id="pg-39-55" n="39:55"/>have him now altogether in hand without farther trouble. His Book is not in the Museum; but ought to be,&#x2014;if there were anybody studying Ancient History with a real desire to understand it. I believe Guichard is the one Writer hitherto who understood <hi rend="italic">both</hi> Greek and the Art of War;&#x2014;a man of real sense, too, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is another singularity.</p>
<p>Since you left N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 12,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donne was chief librarian, London Lib., 12 St. James&#x2019;s Sq., until <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>.</note> I have hardly seen y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> face at all;&#x2014;indeed had you staid, I had been little better off; being constantly sunk to the centre amid sordid Prussian rubbish ever since, and without society except my Horse and the Nightmares. If I were out,&#x2014;as ought to happen now before very long,&#x2014;I will hope to see you sometimes as before. <hi rend="italic">Hear</hi> of you I did, once, a good while ago,&#x2014;thro&#x2019; an excellent Essay on Cowper and his Time;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Cowper (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6513"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet, was a distant cousin of Donne; Donne&#x2019;s essay, &#x201C;Cowper&#x2019;s Poems,&#x201D; was pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 64 (<date when="1861-12-00">Dec. 1861</date>): 700&#x2013;717.</note>

<p><salute>I wish, dear sir,</salute> you could have seen how your letter brightened up the breakfast-time for my husband and me yesterday morning, scattering the misanthropy we are both given to at the beginning of the day, like other nervous people who have &#x2018;bad nights.&#x2019; I wish you could have heard our lyrical recognition of your letter&#x2014;its &#x2018;beautiful modesty,&#x2019; its &#x2018;gentleness,&#x2019; and &#x2018;genuineness;&#x2019; above all I wish you could have heard the tone of real feeling in which my husband said, at last, &#x2018;I do think, my dear, that is the very nicest little bit of good cheer that has come our way for seven years!&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.T. wrote, [<date when="1863-02-09">9 Feb.</date>]: &#x201C;Unwilling to interrupt your husband in his stern task, I take the liberty of addressing you. &#x2026; My obligations to your husband are many and unnameably great, and I just wish to acknowledge them. &#x2026; If high respect, love, and good wishes could comfort him and you, none living command more or deserve more. &#x2026; You can take a fit moment to communicate to your husband my humble admiration of his goodness, attainments, and great gifts to the world.&#x201C;</note> It might have <pb id="pg-39-56" n="39:56"/>been thought Mr. C. was quite unused to expressions of appreciation from strangers, instead of (as is the fact) receiving such almost every day in the year&#x2014;except Sundays, when there is no post. But, oh, the difference between that gracious, graceful little act of faith of yours, and the intrusive, impertinent, presumptuous letters my husband is continually receiving, demanding, in return for so much &#x2018;admiration,&#x2019; an autograph perhaps! or to read and give an opinion on some long, cramped MS. of the writer&#x2019;s; or to&#x2014;find a publisher for it even! or to read some idiotic new book of the writer&#x2019;s (that is a very common form of letter from lady admirers)&#x2014;say a translation from the German (!) and &#x2018;write a review of it in one of the quarterlies!&#x2019; &#x2018;It would be a favour never to be forgotten!&#x2019; I should think so indeed.</p>
<p>Were I to show you the &#x2018;tributes of admiration&#x2019; to Mr. C.&#x2019;s genius, received through the post during one month, you, who have consideration for the time of a man struggling, as for life, with a gigantic task&#x2014;you, who, as my husband says, are &#x2018;beautifully modest,&#x2019; would feel your hair rise on end at such assaults on a man under pretence of admiring him; and would be enabled perhaps, better than I can express it in words, to imagine the pleasure it must have been to us when an approving reader of my husband&#x2019;s books came softly in, and wrapped his wife in a warm, beautiful shawl,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.T. wrote: &#x201C;[I] hope you will accept from me a woollen long shawl. &#x2026; I hope the pattern will please you, and also that it may be of use to you in a cold day.&#x201C;</note> saying simply&#x2014;`There! I don&#x2019;t want to interrupt you, but I want to show you my good-will; and that is how I show it.&#x2019;</p>
<p>We are both equally gratified, and thank you heartily. When the shawl came, as it did at night,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.T. sent the shawl by &#x201C;the Parcel Delivery Co., carriage paid.&#x201C;</note> Mr. C. himself wrapped it about me, and walked round me admiring it. And what think you he said? He said, &#x2018;I am very glad of that for you, my dear. I think it is the only bit of real good my celebrity ever brought you!&#x2019;</p>

Well, till the Marble Arch Hyde-Park we did very well; but <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> wind being right ahead, and mackint<hi rend="italic">h</hi> given to rattle, the old scoundrel determined on a caper; my hat blew off me, <hi rend="italic">hands</hi> under the mackint<hi rend="italic">h</hi> &#x26;c: a labourer picked up the hat, tried to <hi rend="italic">wipe some</hi> of the mud off it, Fritz prancing all the while,&#x2014;I had no copper in my pocket; drew out my purse for sixpence to the man: <hi rend="italic">crushed-</hi>on the hat, and galloped home with the old scoundrel. At night I discovered that I had no purse! In the tempest of rattling &#x26; pracing<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;prancing.&#x201C;</note> &#x26; embarrassed hurrying I had stuck it not <hi rend="italic">into</hi> my pocket ag<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> but past my pocket, and it was gone: 12 or 10 sh<hi rend="italic">gs</hi> in it: that was <hi rend="italic">misshanter</hi> first,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">nichts zu bedeuten</hi> [that means nothing] in comparison.&#x2014; &#x2014; Till friday I daily rode the old scoundrel; on friday, in the Regents&#x2019; Park, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the least warning or cause, he came smash down; lying flat on the ground, lying flat on the ground<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s repetition.</note> like a salmon on its belly (for one quarter of an instant),&#x2014;had done me no mischief at all; sprang up and trotted on half a mile (greatly ashamed of himself I suppose), when looking over his shoulder, I saw the blood streaming over his hoof, drew bridle, dismounted found the knees quite smashed,&#x2014;and, except slowly home, have ridden no more since! <hi rend="italic">One</hi> of his knees will always have a mark, I am told; the other not: both are mending perfectly;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;(2)&#x201D; here, at the top of his 2d page, a separate sheet of paper.</note> and there is no <hi rend="italic">intrinsic</hi> damage, only a fairly <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> liability, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was already (with the 2 years back) too great.

    <salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
    <p>I have very little time; but I must tonight, what I have been meaning for a week past, consult you a little about the care of my worthy tho&#x02019; unfortunate old Horse, who is giving me some trouble at present. About ten days ago, the poor old fellow came slap down with me, for no particular reason at all, and broke both his knees, so that one of them, it appears, will never quite recover the hair;&#x02014;and on the whole, owing in part to Jane&#x02019;s anxieties, I am not to ride him any more. He is but 12 years old, and is very strong and healthy; is considered to have good hoofs, too, tho&#x02019; a little particular ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the <hi rend="italic">shoeing</hi> of the fore feet: but horses, I find, soon ruin their bones on these hard streets and roads: and, in fact, I have found for two years past that my poor old friend made a great difference between hard ground and soft, and was stumbly and numb; and was dangerous for falling,&#x02014;has been <hi rend="italic">down</hi> at least 3 times, tho&#x02019; never badly &#x26; completely till this last. He has carried me above 20,000 miles (when I count up the last 7 years), without fault or failure, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> always rather have hurt him<hi rend="italic">self</hi> than me;&#x02014;and I am truly sorry ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my poor old four-footed still more than ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my own concern in his late misfortune. But the question is now (and I want y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> candid deliverance upon it) What is to be done with him?</p>
    <p>His knees will be mended ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the end of this week; and I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> then send him to the Auction, and at once get rid of him for what he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring,&#x02014;perhaps &#x000A3;10 <pb id="pg-39-59" n="39:59" />or some such sum. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at once do, if I had no regard for <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> and the miseries I see lie ahead for him! He will be put into cabs,&#x02014;will be found not to work (on acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of <hi rend="italic">terror,</hi> not of ill-nature, they tell me); will be flogged, sold again, tormented out of his poor existence, in a way I am shocked to think of after his giving <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the flower of his poor days so faithfully!</p>
    <p>The stable-keeper<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Silvester.</note> here who is a very good skilful and honest old man says he is of opinion the horse w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> work in &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">slow</hi>-harness&#x0201D; (that is, carting, harrowing,&#x02014;I think always I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make him work in a gig too, for he is the willingest and loyallest of animals);&#x02014;and that he might have a chance to be able to make his bread in the country on quieter terms. He is perfect in teeth in stomach, a very strong pretty horse of the riding or carriage type, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 14&#xbd; hands; has been well worth his &#x000E9;50:&#x02014;he is in good condit<hi rend="italic">n, not</hi> clipped; passionate for green &#x26; soft feed: &#x000E9;5 more will bring him to Carlisle; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will cheerfully lay out upon him, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> (upon candidly and vigorously considering the case) can fairly <hi rend="italic">see</hi> a better time and line of industry ahead for him in the scene you are acquainted with. Think of it for two days, then tell me; about Saturday I must decide. John or Jenny will write me your verdict; wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> I know, will be to y<hi rend="italic">r best</hi> judg<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I shall be very apt to follow.&#x02014; No more tonight. All well; &#x26; wishing blessings on you. &#x0002F; <closer>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I wrote the inclosed last night in very great hurry; and now a Stranger man (Neuberg not a stranger to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) has come in; and I have not time or room for one word!</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t think me <hi rend="italic">sentimental</hi> about the poor horse. Consider fairly what w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be likely to be his fate, if I let you try y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hand with him in Annandale. And as soon as you can,&#x2014;answer. I find you will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have two days; that, if you wrote on <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better: they tell me the creature might be ready to travel on Saturday.&#x2014; This day, too, I have heard of an eligible <hi rend="italic">Waggoner</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note>
 that might be got to make trial of him.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get another horse, I think; so soon as I am loose of this. I had not the <pb id="pg-39-60" n="39:60"/>least damage from my tumble; the poor quadruped started up ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at once, seemingly quite ashamed of himself; &#x26; went trotting on better than before for half a mile,&#x2014;till I noticed the blood on his hoofs!&#x2014; <name>T.C.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Inclosed is a lock of my hair&#x2014;or rather the <hi rend="italic">average</hi> of two locks, clipt off by Jane this morning when y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> grey you see; not quite <hi rend="italic">so</hi> grey on the hind head &#x26;c; but a little grayer still (than this) on the <hi rend="italic">halfits</hi> (half-heads or temples!)&#x2014; I wish you joy of it, and your Artist<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> as much.</p>
<p>My very candles are going out; and I must be content to write such a letter as seldom came to you by post! I am horribly bothered and tumbled ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in late days;&#x2014;health well enough, thank Heaven.</p>
<p>My Horse fell with me ten days ago,&#x2014;most complete break-down, not the least ill done to me, but horse quite ruined; has not been ridden since, nor is to be ag<hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p>

<p><salute>Darling!</salute> It is quite unacountable, being the sensible woman I am thought, that I should do this sort of thing over and over again; <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> the stupidity of it!&#x2014; I mean that I should let alone writing altogether when I dont feel equal to writing a good long letter! I have been <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> letters to you for the last two weeks, but putting them on paper needed an impossible exertion&#x2014;or I <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> it an impossible exertion which amounts to the same&#x2014;practically! I have not caught cold, I have not been confined to my sofa or even to the House&#x2014;entirely&#x2014; I go out most days about twelve o&#x2019;clock for a short drive or little <pb id="pg-39-61" n="39:61"/>creeping walk. But all the while I have been feeling myself a <hi rend="italic">Herione</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note>
 unappreciated! that if the people about me had any idea how <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> and weak, and nervous, and all overish I was; they could not but lyrically recognise my struggle to keep my legs and to hold my tongue! Not having the least idea of it, of course there was only virtue&#x2019;s &#x201C;own reward&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note>
 for me&#x2014;and I confess to having always found <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a very insipid business!</p>
<p>Knowing how good in these cases, (and that there is nothing else any good) is a change of air and flinging off ones home worries for even a few days, I tried to bring myself to a short retirement at the sea side somewhere&#x2014;so long as that capital elderly Cook<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Winslade.</note> was here to keep M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C in clover&#x2014;went the length of having lodgings at St Leonards investigated for me, the only place where I could endure to think of going into a lodging <hi rend="italic">alone.</hi> And the reason of my preference was, that at St Leonards I should find Bessy Barnet&#x2014;(M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blackistone you remember?)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bessy Barnett was the Carlyles&#x2019; servant <date when="1834-06-00">June</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-12-00">Dec. 1834</date>; she reappeared, <date when="1862-08-00">Aug. 1862</date>, about to marry Dr. Peyton Blakiston; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620821-TC-PB-01"><sic>38:150&#x2013;51</sic><corr>TC to PB, <date when="1862-08-21">21 Aug. 1862</date></corr></ref>.

<p>Mary, the successor to scotch Elizabeth, goes on moderately well&#x2014;as general Servant&#x2014;which I mean her to be, with the new girl as kitchen maid&#x2014; There is no cleverness or activity of mind or body about <hi rend="italic">her</hi> (Mary) to make one afraid of her coming to mischief!&#x2014; She is slow, she hasn&#x2019;t a notion of <pb id="pg-39-62" n="39:62"/>doing anything out of her own head&#x2014;but she does <hi rend="italic">what she is told</hi> as well as she can&#x2014; She is perfectly honest I think, and doesnt <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> and doesn&#x2019;t want to gad about, and on the whole when once got into a groove she may run on pretty smoothly I think&#x2014;provided she doesn&#x2019;t wreck on the rock of jealousy! She is very <hi rend="italic">sensitive</hi>&#x2014;not to be clever&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Winslade (the present Cook, who has been her own friend for years) tells me she is the most jealous girl she ever saw in her life!&#x2014; Indeed I have seen her turn <hi rend="small-caps">pale</hi> <hi rend="italic">as ashes,</hi> when I happened to praise some dish which M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Winslade had sent up! What is one to do with such a character? I suppose a cleverer Mistress of a house than I am, would fall on some mode of treatment to bring <hi rend="italic">good</hi> out of so much selflove rather than <hi rend="italic">evil!&#x2014;</hi> But for me, I despair of getting anything but the evil out of evil passions!&#x2014; The less I bother myself about their nonsense the better!</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton continues in a most precarious state.

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row &#x2F; Thursday [<date when="1863-02-26">26 February 1863</date>]</dateline>
<p>I promised you a &#x201C;voluntary&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18561210-JWC-IC-01"><sic>32:48</sic><corr>JWC to IC, <date when="1856-12-10">[10 Dec. 1856]</date></corr></ref>.</note> letter, Mary dear; and after all the waiting you are going to get a begging letter, which is nothing like so pleasant for either the writer or the receiver!&#x2014; But those London hens!&#x2014;they are creatures without rule or reason! I had just made an arrangement with a grocer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who <pb id="pg-39-67" n="39:67"/>keeps a lot of them, to let me have at least seven newlaid eggs a-week; and the very day the bargain was concluded, the creatures all struck work again &#x201C;except one bantam&#x201C;! So we are eating away at yours, without any hope of reinforcement from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> neighbourhood. Jane,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC and Mary&#x2019;s sister Jean Aitken.</note> in a letter to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C kindly offered to send a second supply from Dumfries but as <hi rend="italic">She</hi> does not lay them &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">within herself</hi>&#x201D; (as an old Lady<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> at Haddington used to say) it seems more natural that I should apply to you who <hi rend="italic">do!</hi>&#x2014; We have still enough to last about a week.</p>
<p>There! I have done my begging at the beginning of my letter, instead of reserving it for a post script&#x2014;the common dodge which deceives nobody! And now my mind is free to tell any news I may have.&#x2014; You would hear of my incomparable small housemaid<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Florence Morrison.</note> having turned out an incomparable small Demon. People say these wonderfully clever servants whether old or young are always to be suspected. Perhaps!&#x2014; Still a little cleverness is much nicer than stupidity to start with. Any how I don&#x2019;t need to live in vague apprehensions about either of my present Servants<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and Lizzie.</note> on the ground of <hi rend="italic">clever</hi>ness. But I am well enough content with them, as servants go. I have arranged things on a new footing, which I am in hopes (&#x201C;hope springing eternal in the human mind)&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Alexander Pope, <hi rend="italic">An</hi> <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> line 95.</note> may work better than the old one. I have made the Cook<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary.</note> who came in place of the Scotch one,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth.</note> a general, or upper Servant; she does all the work up stairs, the <hi rend="italic">valeting</hi> &#x26;c, <hi rend="italic">besides the cooking;</hi> and the new girl is a sort of kitchen maid under her&#x2014;on this plan, there cannot be the same room for jealousies and squabbles for power, which have tormented me ever since I kept two.</p>
<p>I had a visit the other day which turned me upside down with the surprise of it! I was putting on my bonnet to go out early in the day when Mary<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC previously wrote that it was Flo who introduced the visitor; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630217-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-02-17">17 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> came to say there was &#x201C;a Lady at the door, who would like if I would see her for a few minutes&#x201C;</p>
<p>The hour being unusual for making calls &#x26; the message being over-modest for a caller; I thought it might be some &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">good</hi> Lady&#x201D; with a petition, a sort of people I cannot abide. So I asked; &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">is</hi> she a <hi rend="italic">Lady,</hi> do you think?&#x201D; &#x201C;Well&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">no</hi> Mam&#x2014;I think <hi rend="small-caps">hardly;</hi> said Mary, she wouldn&#x2019;t give her name; but she said she came from <hi rend="italic">fishshire,</hi> or something like <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Fishshire? could it be <pb id="pg-39-68" n="39:68"/>Dumfrieshire?&#x201D; I said with a veritable inspiration of Genius, &#x201C;Show her up!&#x201C;&#x2014; And I heard a heavy body passed into the Drawingroom. I hastened in and saw, standing in the middle of the floor a figure like a hay-stack, with the reddest of large fat faces, the eyes of which were straining towards the door, The woman was dressed in decent country clothes and bore no resemblance to any &#x201C;Lady&#x201D; in the created worl,&#x201D; but looked <hi rend="italic">well to do.</hi> I stared; I didn&#x2019;t know the woman from Adam (as the people here say)! But she spoke&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">eh</hi>!!&#x201D; she said &#x201C;Lord keep <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> Is <hi rend="italic">that</hi> you?&#x201C;&#x2014; And there was something strangely famliar in the voice! I stared again, and said&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Nancy??</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Atweel and its just Nancy&#x201D; answered the haystack! and then followed such shaking of hands, as if we had been the dearest friends!

<p><salute>My dear Grace,</salute> I take up my pen (a very bad one, and <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> can&#x2019;t mend it!) to write to you; without any question of whose turn it is; but simply out of a natural, wholesome human wish to have a little talk with you; altho&#x2019; the &#x201C;reciprocity must be all on one side.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450915-JWC-CGD-01"><sic>19:196</sic><corr>JWC to CGD, <date when="1845-09-15">[15] Sept. [1845]</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 I never sit down at night, beside a good fire, <hi rend="italic">alone,</hi> without feeling a need of talking a little, on paper, to somebody that I like well enough, and that likes <hi rend="italic">me</hi> well enough, to make it of no moment whether I talk sense or nonsense, and with or without regard to the rules of Grammar</p>
<p>But it isn&#x2019;t once in a month that I find myself so situated. There is always a good fire and I am always sitting by it. but so is M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, on the opposite side of the table; correcting proofs, or reading; and tho&#x2019; the fact of his being their hardly makes any difference in the <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> of being alone; as he neither speaks nor lets himself be spoken to; it does, I find, make a material difference in any good one can get out of one&#x2019;s aloneness. He never visits,&#x2014;is at home of an evening from months end to month&#x2019;s end. Only sometimes, as to night, if he have been prevented from getting his hour&#x2019;s sleep <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner, he takes it <hi rend="italic">after&#x2014;</hi>and puts off his tea till after nine o&#x2019;clock. I take my tea when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> dines&#x2014;at 7&#x2013;and am ready for a little porridge and milk at eleven, making the porridge myself on the Drawingroom fire.</p>
<p>&#x2014;In my last letter I remember I was urging on you, the wholesomeness of concentrated nourishment especially of essence of beef.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630202-JWC-EWAGW-01">JWC to <sic>EW and GW</sic><corr>EWAGW</corr>, [<date when="1863-02-02">2 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> Oh my Dears <hi rend="italic">do</hi> try it! After writing that letter, it struck me that I myself had better take the advice I was so liberal of to you; and put away entirely my porridge and broths and favourite <hi rend="italic">messes,</hi> and betake myself to curing my own fit of indigestion with essence of beef! I dined on it and supped on it (in very small quantity) for about a week; and by that time my appetite had come back, and my nights were delivered from positive torment; and I might return to the porridge, my taste for which is always a good symptom with me. Our dear Lady Sandwich who was the weakest human being I ever saw <hi rend="italic">live,</hi> with some appearance of enjoying life in spite of her many ailments, was fed almost entirely in her last years, by D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ferguson&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. Robert Ferguson (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9326"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430720-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:297&#x2013;98</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-20">[20 July 1843]</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490705-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:100</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1849-07-05">5 July 1849</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> orders, on essence of beef, and weak Brandy in <pb id="pg-39-71" n="39:71"/>water. The way Ferguson desired it should be made for her, was to take a pound of juicy beef without any fat, cut it up into little bits put the bits in a bottle&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without any water</hi> or anything; cork the bottle well, and boil it (the bottle) in a panful of water for seven hours. She used to take about a table spoonful at a time&#x2014;sometimes she had the pure essence diluted with an equal quantity of boiling water&#x2014;and about three times a day, she had a teaspoonful of brandy in a wineglassful of water and a <hi rend="italic">tiny</hi> biscuit. We have <hi rend="italic">our</hi> soup made with vegetables of the <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> sort, carrot, celery, herbs and seasonings, boiling for seven hours till the meat is gone to perfect <hi rend="italic">mush</hi> and taking great pains with the skimming. Then it is poured out into a large basin, and the next day the fat which will have risen to the top is taken off. Then it is boiled up and poured into as many basins, of the size to be used each time it is wanted, as it will fill&#x2014;from six pounds of the fleshy part of shin of beef we should have five little basinsful. It was dear miss Jess Donaldson, who had to have a constant supply of soup for her sister,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jess and Jean Donaldson, old Haddington friends of JWC, who both d. <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>.</note> who told me about pouring it at the first into seperate basins or teacups; and I have found it a great improvement on the old plan of pouring it into one large tureen; for the strong jelly which it ought to be when cold, (if the soup is strong enough) when broken into gets watery, and spoils as fast again. Now do please try this receipt and above all <hi rend="italic">make</hi> Elizabeth try it. I am so sure you would both derive the same benefit from it that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and I do.</p>

<p><salute>Oh, my dear Mr. Froude,</salute> I surely couldn&#x2019;t have looked so bored as that. I couldn&#x2019;t because I wasn&#x2019;t. I own to feeling rather antipathetic to that <pb id="pg-39-78" n="39:78"/>anomalous bishop.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bishop Colenso. Froude wrote later: &#x201C;I knew Colenso; we [TC and Froude] met him in one of our walks. He joined us, and talked of what he had done with some slight elation, &#x2018;Poor fellow!&#x2019; said Carlyle, as he went away; &#x2018;he mistakes it for fame. He does not see that it is only an extended pillory that he is standing on.&#x2019; I thought and think this judgment a harsh one. No one had been once more anxious than Carlyle for the &#x2018;Exodus.&#x2019; No one had done more to bring it about than Colenso, or more bravely faced the storm which he had raised, or, I may add, more nobly vindicated, in later life, his general courage and honesty when he stood out to defend the Zulus in South Africa. &#x2026; Partly, I believe, at my instance, Mrs. Carlyle invited Colenso to one of her tea-parties, but it was evident that he suited her no better than her husband. I told her so, and had this note in reply&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:263&#x2013;64). Colenso presumably gave JWC the <hi rend="italic">carte de visite</hi> in her second album; see <sic>opp</sic><corr>above</corr>.</note> A man arrived at the years of discretion wearing an absurd little black silk apron, disturbs my artistic feelings to begin with.<figure><graphic url="volume-39-79-10.gif"/><p>John William Colenso, bishop of Natal, ca. 1863</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>Then consider whom I am descended from, the woman who when King James offered to make her husband a bishop if she would persuade him to return to his country and be a peaceable subject, held up her apron and answered, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">I would rather kepp his head in there.</hi>&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Welsh, b.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I should be glad to hear you were quite done with that cold. I hate to think of your <hi rend="italic">coughing</hi>&#x2014;for in all my life I never heard a cough that had such a <pb id="pg-39-79" n="39:79"/><pb id="pg-39-80" n="39:80"/>sound of tearing the person&#x2019;s inside into twenty pieces! &#x201C;The Doctor&#x201D; says it doesn&#x2019;t do you any harm. but I should need to have been married to you as long as he has been to believe that! We have the finest weather here&#x2014;bracing as well as mild; and my <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> is gone for the present, and I feel stronger.</p>
<p>I went to Ealing the other day to visit M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant and staid all night&#x2014; Even that short absence from Chelsea did me ever so much good! and on the strength of it I went after to a dinner-party at <hi rend="italic">the Rectory&#x2014;</hi>and tomorrow I am going to dine out again, at the Forster&#x2019;s to meet Dickens and nobody else&#x2014; They send their carriage for me and send me home at night; so in this mild weather I trust no harm will come of it.</p>
<p>I was in Swan &#x26; Edgars shop<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Swan &#x26; Edgar&#x2019;s dept. store, corner of Piccadilly and Regent St.; Mr. Swan (d. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), draper, and William Edgar (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), haberdasher, opened their first store at 20 Piccadilly in <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>.</note> the other day, and a nice looking lad<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Corson (b. ca. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>).</note> was serving me with tapes and things, whose speech tho&#x2019; doing its best to be anglified sounded homelike&#x2014; &#x201C;You are Scotch,&#x201D; I said; without consideration for the mortified vanity of a Youth trying to speak <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>; &#x201C;Yes I am;&#x201D; answered he tartly. &#x201C;I should say you come from Dumfrieshire&#x201C;? I went on, with the same inquiring inhumanity, &#x201C;Yes&#x2014;I do&#x201C;; he answered with an almost startled look. &#x201C;Dumfrieshire is partly <hi rend="italic">my</hi> country too&#x2014;you are from Nithsdale&#x2014;from near Thornhill, are you not?&#x201C;&#x2014; The young man stared, quite subdued, and answered meekly that he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> come from near Thornhill!&#x2014;from a place close to Dabton<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dabton, an estate in Morton parish, 1&#xBD; mi. (2.5 km.) N of Thornhill.</note> if I knew where <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was. &#x201C;Oh didn&#x2019;t I!&#x201C;&#x2014; Then I asked him if he knew Holme Hill? And so subdued was he, that he answered in the most unadulterated Scotch &#x201C;Oh fine! D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x2019;s&#x2014;I know it fine! I told him I had been there for three weeks last August&#x2014;and then left him&#x2014;thinking me, I have no doubt, a very odd woman!

<p>I am in my average health again (if I ever was much below it), and have got rid of my <hi rend="italic">Horse,</hi> and of various difficulties;&#x2014;and will surely write to you at greater length before I be much older!

    <p>I felt y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> advice ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Horse to be wise, and faithful; perfectly true: Noprospect of a livelihood for the poor animal in Scotland! What settlement Idid get made, John will have told you. Looking back now, I find it very lucky; <pb id="pg-39-84" n="39:84" />and that my <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> was really one <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be repeated at any price; nor to be risked again (the like of it) at all at all! You never saw a more complete smash-down; in a moment, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> cause assignable, poor Fritz in the mud, nose, one hock and both knees, &#x02014;flat on his belly like a fish (tho&#x02019; he started up, poor fellow, much ashamed of himself);&#x02014;it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be expected that, <hi rend="italic">next</hi> time, he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> keep me quite perpendic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on his back, &#x26; with no damage whatever!&#x02014; &#x02014; I think I can get another horse; and that I shall have to do it. But, at present, <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> is such a delightful change!&#x02014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>A letter was to have been written to go with the Coronet;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the headdress referred to at the end of the letter.</note> but some one interrupted me at the right time&#x2014;and since then I have been in perfect misery with a violent Influenza&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in my mouth!</hi> Positively <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> and in no other part of me; except that pain in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> place tingles thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> ones nervous sy[s]tem, and makes one <hi rend="italic">generally</hi> indisposed. It is just as if I had taken a great <hi rend="italic">bite</hi> of Influenza! and couldn&#x2019;t swallow it, or spit it out or great rid of it anyhow! First my tongue swelled, and got raw on one side, so that when it touched my teeeth in speaking or eating it felt like being sawed into; then the soreness spread down to the roots of my tongue, and my jaws fell to aching and every one of my teeth! And there the cold stopt! It is a little better today, but yesterday I had to restrict my speech to monosyllables. Did you ever hear of such an absurd case? I have been so glad I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go out on Saturday to see the triumphal entry of the young Princess;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For two of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News&#x2019;</hi> series of full page engravings illustrating &#x201C;The Reception of Princess Alexandra (Princess of Wales) in London,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630307-TC-JC-01"><sic>84</sic><corr>TC to JC, <date when="1863-03-07">7 March</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630307-JWC-LLA-01"><sic>opp</sic><corr>JWC to LLA, <date when="1863-03-07">7 March</date></corr></ref>.</note> for it would have made me still more comfortless to have had <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> to blame for this torture. I had cards for the Scaffolding in front of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s House, one of the best sites for <hi rend="italic">seeing,</hi> but even if I had <hi rend="italic">liked</hi> the fuss of the thing; I think I should have felt horribly sad, sitting amongst gay rejoicing people, under the shadow of that empty sorrow-stricken House; thinking that they whose kind consideration had prepared that balcony for <hi rend="italic">others,</hi> were themselves kept away by sickness and trouble. So I staid quietly at home, and wrote to Lady Ashburton instead. Lord A&#x2019;s convalescence has now continued so long, tho&#x2019; at a rate of progress not perceptible from day to day, but only from week to week; that I feel some real hope of his return among us. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christison thinks he will recover, and I have great reliance on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> calm clear judgement, young tho&#x2019; he is. The Ashburtons themselves swear by Quain who flies back and forwards between London &#x26; Paris, like a weaver&#x2019;s shuttle, making a pretty fortune out of this one case; and he too says Lord A will recover; but Quain is a slippery Irishman, and Christison is&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">Scotchman!</hi> I trust <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> and the other I think an entire Humbug.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-39/lt-18621212-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-12-12">12 Dec. 1862</date>]</ref>.</note></p>

    <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
    <p>Several months ago you made me a very pretty and a very welcome Gift, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> excell<hi rend="italic">t Translat</hi>n <hi rend="italic">of Titan;</hi>
      <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Jean Paul Richter, <hi rend="italic">Titan: A Romance,</hi> trans. Charles T. Brooks, 2 vols. (Boston, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>).</note>
      &#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely I ought to have acknowledged sooner: but the truth is, I am frightfully driven ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in these months and years, and have seldom time to write a Note even to friends.</p>
    <p>Finding y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Translat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of such quality, I took steadily to reading it,&#x02014;steadily gave myself ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> an hour of it, the last thing every night, by way of washing down the bitter dusts of the day with a cup of right wine before going to bed! I am sorry it is done long since; for indeed I had not had any such reading for years back&#x02014;and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not but acknowledge, spite of all my criticisms, that here was more of real human stuff than in all the Novels written in my time. The Book is beautifully printed, too; every way an exquisite handful for a good reader.</p>
    <p>You have been wonderfully successful; have caught a good deal of the <hi rend="italic">tune</hi> of Jean Paul, and have unwinded his meaning, in general with perfect accuracy, into comfortable clearness, out of those coils he involves it in. I did not keep the original <hi rend="italic">open</hi> all the way; but had a feeling that I was safe in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>

       hands. One or two little specks I did notice,&#x02014;nothing of any consequence:&#x02014;Bouverot, whom you call &#x0201C;the German Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D; is in reality the <hi rend="italic">Teutsche</hi>

His <hi rend="italic">ehelosigkeit,</hi> I observe (once only), you have read as <hi rend="italic">ehrlosigkeit;</hi>

       &#x0201C;scandal&#x0201D; instead of &#x0201C;celibacy.&#x0201D; Pray correct Bouv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> next edit<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> I once read &#x0201C;fixings,&#x0201D; too, in some Speech: do make it &#x0201C;trimmings,&#x0201D; or any equivalent English word; &#x0201C;fixings&#x0201D; came like a momentary splash of cold water on the skin; painfully reminding one, &#x0201C;Ha, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Jean Paul&#x02019;s self that you are reading, then; it is an American <hi rend="italic">Translat</hi>n of Jean Paul!</p>
    <p>In conclusion I will congratulate you on having added a highly recognisable new item of good reading for the whole English Genealogy of us (now a most extensive Body of People in this world);&#x02014;and with the hope of perhaps seeing a <hi rend="italic">Hesperus</hi>
      <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Brooks replied, <date when="1863-05-20">20 May</date>, thanking TC for his &#x0201C;most <hi rend="italic">cordial</hi> letter,&#x0201D; and giving as partial excuse for his slowness in replying &#x0201C;that your word decided me to take hold of <hi rend="italic">Hesperus,</hi> which has taken hold of me to such an extent that I do not always <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> the flight of time nor the call of friendly obligations.&#x0201D; Brooks pbd. his trans. of Richter&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Hesperus,</hi> 2 vols.

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>Thanks for your letter. I shall be glad to have more, and favourable news of the poor wee Bairn.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Stewart, da. of Jane Austin&#x2019;s sister Margaret; she was apparently born with some kind of growth on her head; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620915-JWC-MCA-01"><sic>38:214</sic><corr>JWC to MCA, [<date when="1862-09-15">15 Sept. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630331-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1863-03-31">31 March</date></ref>.</note> It will be a great mercy to have that lump removed; but it is very sad to think of so wee a creature being subjected to such pain.</p>
<p>The last eggs arived in comparitively good condition. There were just eight broken ones, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were not wasted, being still whole enough for puddings. The carriage was four shillings this time&#x2014;one can never understand the rules of &#x201C;Karag&#x201D; (carriage) as John MacNight used to spell it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John McKnight, letter carrier between Dumfries and Thornhill; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec.

I know at present of only one <hi rend="italic">Bantam</hi> that does &#x201C;what England expects of her&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570807-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:13</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-08-07">[7 Aug. 1857]</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and you may imagine what would be M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s ferocity, if he were [to] sit down to a daily Bantam-egg!</p>
<p>We are very thankful in this house, to have got done with &#x201C;the Royal Marriage&#x201D; Tho neither M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C nor I &#x201C;went out for [to] see&#x201D; any part of the business, we could not get out of the noise and fuss about it. &#x201C;Very curious!

<p>The most interesting part of the Princess Alexandra to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> is not her present splendours but her previous homely, rather <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> life, which makes <pb id="pg-39-94" n="39:94"/>such a curious contrast! Her Parents, &#x201C;royal&#x201D; tho they be, have an income of just from seven hundred to a thousand a year! When she was visiting our Queen after the engagement, she always came to breakfast in a <hi rend="italic">jacket.</hi> &#x201C;My Dear, said the Queen to her one day, you seem very fond of jackets! how is it that you <hi rend="italic">always</hi> wear a jacket?&#x201D; &#x201C;Well, said little Alexandra, I like them, and then you see a jacket is <hi rend="italic">so economical!</hi> you can wear different skirts with it; and I have very few gowns, having to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> them all myself! My Sisters and I have no Lady&#x2019;s maid, and have been brought up to make all our own clothes. I made my own bonnet!&#x201C;&#x2014; Bless her!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C goes on very contentedly without a horse. Did you hear that he sold his beautiful Fritz for nine pounds?! But the Apothecary who bought him was to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> him and better <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should have him for nothing than that he had been sold at ever so much to be lashed into drawing in a waggon, I would rather he had been shot than <hi rend="italic">that.</hi> Meanwhile M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C walks and&#x2014;rides in Omnibuses!! and finds the variety amusing&#x2014; He &#x201C;now meets human beings to speak to!&#x201D; How long he will be able to enjoy walking I cannot predict.

<p><salute>Yes, my dear Dear,</salute> the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> was right; the cold in my mouth was symptomatic of nothing but just <hi rend="italic">cold in the mouth!</hi> I was afraid myself, for some days, it might turn to a regular Influenza: the only time I ever had the same sort of thing <hi rend="italic">as bad</hi> before, being in the course of that dangerous Influenza I had, a good many years ago, when I had first to call in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1859-04-00">April 1859</date>; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590420-TC-JCA-01"><sic>35:81</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1859-04-20">20 April 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> But I have got off with the ten days of sore tongue and faceache, which is almost cured by the west wind we have had for the last two days.</p>
<p>My Aunt Grace has &#x201C;suffered <hi rend="italic">Martyrs</hi>&#x201D; (as a french friend<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; Etienne Paulet (d. <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; see <ref target="volume-25/ed-25-biographical-notes"><sic>25:340</sic><corr>25:biographical notes</corr></ref>), Swiss French businessman.</note> of mine used to express it) from faceache and pains of the head during this last winter; and cured herself (she believes) in a day, by the new-pet-medecine Chlorodyne. She was in an agony that could no longer be born; and invested half-a crown in a small bottle of Chlorodyne; and took ten drops every two hours, till she <pb id="pg-39-95" n="39:95"/>had taken as many as fifty; and then fell into a refreshing sleep and (when she wrote) had had no return of the pain for three weeks! I haven&#x2019;t much faith in medecines that work as by miracle; and am inclined to belive that her pain having reached its height had been ready to subside of itself when the Chlorodyne was taken&#x2014; Still as there might be some temporary relief, more or less, in the thing, I too invested in a small vial and took ten drops when I was going to bed one night; and the only effect traceable in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> case was a very dry, dirty mouth next morning  To the best of my taste it was composed of <hi rend="italic">Chl[o]roform,</hi> Strong peppermint, and some other carminatives. Has the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> used it? The Apothecary<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Quiller.</note> here told me it was not sold much by itself, but that a great deal was used in the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> prescriptions&#x2014; As you seem to have some loyalty towards the new Princess from your wondering I didnt &#x201C;go out for to see&#x201D; the rather stupid Prince and her drive along the street in an open carriage; I will tell you something told me about her, on Court authority, which <hi rend="italic">did</hi> interest me, much more than the accounts of her endless presents of diamonds, and all the rest of her honours and glories.</p>
<p>When she was on her visit to the queen after the engagement, She always appeared during the day in a jacket. One time the queen said to her, &#x201C;My Dear you seem very fond of jackets; how is it that you always wear a jacket?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well, you see, said little Alexandra, a jacket is <hi rend="italic">so</hi> economical! you can wear it with different skirts! and I have very few gowns; having to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> them all myself! My Sisters and I have no Ladysmaid and we have all been brought up to make our own clothes. I made my own bonnet!&#x201C;</p>
<p>In fact her parents are very poor&#x2014;poorer than most of your Gentleman-Farmers. They have from seven hundred to a thousand a year. Imagine how bewildered she must feel in the midst of her present splendours.</p>
<p>Three days after her marriage she wrote to her Mother from Osborne<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Queen Victoria&#x2019;s residence on the Isle of Wight.</note>
 &#x201C;I am so happy!

<p>In late years I have had the pleasure of occasionally conversing with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> J. Downes, as well as of reading some of his Writings in Reviews; and am able to testify that he is a man of good faculties industriously cultivated; altogether intelligent, solid, honest in his ways of thinking, and I believe of acting and living.

The Grange!&#x2014;oh to be going to see you,&#x2014;to be with you all at the Grange&#x2014;again&#x2014;after all these troubles and terrors!

    <salute>My Little Woman</salute>
    <p>Your bits of violet-letters have made me both glad and wae&#x02014; Do you know what &#x0201C;wae&#x0201D; means?&#x02014; It is the Scotch word for <hi rend="italic">sorry;</hi> but it comes from the heart, &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">wae</hi>&#x02019; does, and goes to the heart; whereas &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">sorry,</hi>&#x02019; for most part comes from no further than the lips and goes to no further than the ears!</p>
    <p>You will easily understand why I should be <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> at your letters. You have known me long enough and well enough, to believe in the constancy of my affection where it has once been seriously given. And granted that I care for you always; it is only human nature, that I should be glad of any token that you still care a little for me!&#x02014; The <hi rend="italic">waeness</hi> too will be intelligible for you, being the clever little soul you are! We needn&#x02019;t say more of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>
    </p>
    <p>
      <pb id="pg-39-108" n="39:108" />
      Yes, come and see me. I have no immediate prospect of going from home, tho&#x02019; I much need a change of air and scene. The Influenza I am just recovering from has made me very weak and <hi rend="italic">low.</hi>
    </p>
    <p>But I left M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle alone last summer for five weeks, and I haven&#x02019;t the face to propose doing that sort of thing again, so soon!</p>
    <p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Royston has got the beautifulest Baby,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Isabella, b.

I thought, when I went to see her and it, that I should find her in Paradise. And she <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> in Paradise, lying on her sofa, in the Drawing room with the wax-work-looking baby in a pretty pink and white basket placed on a chair near her&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">her</hi> whose life looked always so lonely and empty! But when I said, &#x0201C;Oh how happy you must be&#x0201D;! she answered in her old wailing tone, &#x0201C;I suppose I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be! But the poor child causes me such unsufferable agony, with this bad breast, that I almost shudder when they bring him near me,&#x0201D;&#x02014; I believe it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a terrible business suckling a child, with a sore breast. Anyhow I couldnt help thinking; how good care is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> taken that nobody should be in <hi rend="italic">Paradise,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Life! Whatever happiness is granted one; there is ever some pain, or some sorrow, or some anxiety, or <hi rend="italic">some</hi>thing, to set off against it, and keep one in mind, that Earth is not Heaven! and that no amount of wishing, and hoping, and striving can ever make a Heaven of it for us!</p>
    <p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Larkin has also a small son,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Alfred Edward Larkin, b. March.</note> and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> breast, so far as I know, is in good order, and she is in every respect, to look at her, as strong as a horse. But doubtless <hi rend="italic">she</hi> too has drawbacks to perfect felicity, tho&#x02019; I am not sufficiently intimate with her to know what they are are! or to care!</p>
    <p>The poor Horse, that you groomed so cleverly and kindly, fell with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C one day in the Park, and cut its knees to the bone, and had to be poulticed and nursed for three weeks and then sold&#x02014;being no longer safe to ride. A chemist in the Kings Road bought him for nine pounds (he had cost fifty guineas and was considered very cheap at that). But we liked better to sell him for next to nothing to a person who would <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> him&#x02014;than for more money to some one who would have thrashed him into a drawing a cab&#x02014;which, you remember, he had an insuferable repugnance to.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630213-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-02-13">13 Feb.</date>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You are very good to write me, never so briefly, when I cannot manage writing to you at all. Owing to what you may naturally think <hi rend="italic">idleness,&#x2014;</hi>wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it is in part, conjoined with weakness, with utter weariness and confusion! Upstairs here, late at night, with my <hi rend="italic">cape</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me (ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> cold), I will send you two articulate words, to keep down anxiety, if nothing more.</p>
<p>There is nothing the matter with me more than usual,&#x2014;except it be a very flutter and <hi rend="italic">pluister</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> actually <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> Book 19, instead of sitting reading for it at all hours, and <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> at it, as has been going on for above 2 weeks past,&#x2014;a paltry burble still lying in the hands of Robson withal, who has been playing truant with me till few days ago. What <hi rend="italic">he</hi> still has will not now detain me many hours; and I shall probably have it this week. <hi rend="italic">Last half</hi> of Vol V: that is what now glares yawningly upon me;&#x2014;and the truth is, I have got so miserable upon it, I actually burst into it today; and meant to write to you the instant I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say &#x201C;I have fairly begun!&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Cosa fata ha capo.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

If my health don&#x2019;t fail altogether, I shall manage; walking seems hitherto to do as well, or nearly so, as riding did; and it is nothing like so dreary, <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> as my poor tabernacle has got for that object.</p>
<p>Last Sunday I met Henry Watt, W<hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the new Wife,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

John wrote to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1863-02-24">24 Feb.</date>, about Henry&#x2019;s engagement to &#x201C;Miss Hunter of Craigcrook. Her father [John Hunter] is an old friend of [John] Gordon&#x2019;s &#x26; mine, &#x26; is Auditor of the Court of Session. The courtship has lasted some three years&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;Miss H. is about 18 months older than Harry, &#x26; is a very well educated clever girl. I was not directly consulted in the matter by either party, &#x26; was rather surprised to hear of the success. It may be the means of giving Harry the quiet sobriety he has had so much need of&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). John Hunter invited John A. Carlyle to the wedding, <date when="1863-03-26">26 March</date>: &#x201C;I need hardly say that Mrs [Helen] Hunter &#x26; I expect that you will give us &#x26; the young Couple the honour &#x26; gratification of your presence &#x26; Countenance on the occasion&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> &#x26; two other <pb id="pg-39-110" n="39:110"/>people<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> escorting, in Kensington Gardens.

<p>We read in the Newspapers, with a lively sympathy, the announcement of what had come upon you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The death of Sir George Sinclair&#x2019;s wife, Lady Camilla, <date when="1863-03-17">17 March</date>, was widely noted in Scottish newspapers and the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> (<date when="1863-04-11">11 April</date>)<hi rend="italic">.</hi></note> It is a heavy loss and a very sorrowful: the parting with a loved soul, who has been y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> companion so long<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They had been married for almost 47 years.</note> thro good and evil; who was such a bright being when you first found her, and has had to fade away, under many sufferings and sorrows<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Camilla had been ill for about 10 years.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you have shared with her and leave you alone for the remainder of the pilgrimage. &#x201C;It is the way of all the earth&#x201C;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Kings 2:2.</note> yes, and has been since man was first made;&#x2014;and yet there is a strange <hi rend="italic">originality</hi> in it to every one of us, when it comes upon him in its course. I grieve to think how sad you are:&#x2014;I myself remember the good Lady and her very great goodness to me while herself so heavy-laden; and the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that I shall never see her again is painful and pathetic to me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC visited the Sinclairs in Thurso Castle <date when="1860-08-00">Aug.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-09-00">Sept. 1860</date>; for TC&#x2019;s comments on Lady Camilla, see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600806-TC-JWC-01"><sic>36:160</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1860-08-16">6 Aug. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> Words are very idle, so are wishes; I will say no more on the subject  <hi rend="italic">Time,</hi> by degrees, smooths away the first asperities; then Death has a kind of blessed aspect, most sad but also most sacred: the one haven of rest appointed for us all.</p>

In some 6 or 8 months,&#x2014;surely not longer than 8!&#x2014;I hope to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> at last done: it will be the gladdest day I have seen for ten years back, pretty much the one glad day!

It was Dickens reading Pickwick&#x2019;s Trial to Thomas Carlyle. I thought Carlyle would split, and Dickens was not much better. Carlyle sat on the front bench and he haw-hawed right out over and over again till he fairly exhausted himself. Dickens would read and then he would stop in order to give Carlyle a chance to stop. &#x2026; The reading consisted of the Trial and the <hi rend="italic">Christmas Carol</hi>. &#x2026; [TC] was dressed in a long snuff-colored frock coat, with a long old-fashioned velvet collar, that looked as if it might have belonged to his grandfather. He had on a thick cloth vest well buttoned up, a high standing collar, and an old-fashioned black stock loosely buckled round his neck. His hat was felt, with a sugar-loaf crown, and he kept it on one knee while his legs were crossed, the top hanging perpendicularly down, showing the shrunken shank. He had a full shock of iron-gray hair and whiskers and moustache with scissors, giving his face an expression approaching the haggard. His shoulders were rounded up and narrow and his joints seemed loosely set. His whole aspect was that of a seedy scholar&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> 164:811).

She thought the Life of Frederick a terrible piece of work, and wished that Frederick had died when a baby. &#x2018;The book is like one of those plants that grow up smoothly and then forms a knot, smoothly again and then forms another knot, and so on; what Carlyle is when one of those knots is being passed must be left to the imagination.&#x2019; Carlyle was a picture of meekness when his wife said this&#x201D; (Conway, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 1:351&#x2013;52).</note> and I will <hi rend="italic">try</hi> (really!) to sit nearly dumb.&#x2014; &#x2014; We have seen J.

How many more such days of <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> should I have?</p>
<p>No more!&#x2014;for after the clock had struck <hi rend="italic">eleven</hi> at night, the right carriage stopt at the door, and the dear Soul rushed into my arms. It was difficult to help crying a meeting her after all these dreadful months she had passed! She staid till <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in the morning! Today she is off to the Grange where she sleeps, and tomorrow she returns to Paris! She is in good hopes now that Lord A will recover, to about the same state of health that he was in before this illness, But there is no chance of his being able to return home for a couple of months yet. He is still so weak, that it is as much as he can do to walk, with support, from his bed to the invalid chair in which he sits up for two or three hours a day</p>

After a while my attention lighted on her <hi rend="italic">dress;</hi> deep mourning; but with extremely expensive furs.

Nothing makes a man look more contemptible than wearing his hair in such a fashion.

<p>There! You have come! and you have gone! and it isn&#x2019;t a dream!&#x2014; You have <hi rend="italic">really</hi> been in this room, with your dear sweet eyes, and musical voice, and adorable ways! But the whole apparition is dream-like, for all its reality! I have dreamt dreams, in my sleep, about you and Lord Ashburton, while you have been away, that felt just as <hi rend="italic">real</hi> at the time, and looked as real in retrospect as your visit the other night.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton visited late Tues. evening, <date when="1863-05-05">5 May</date>; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630506-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-05-06">6 May</date>]</ref>.</note> The waiting for you, with ones heart in ones mouth, till the case looked desperate; and then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C rushing off like a maniac to <hi rend="italic">resume his coat;</hi> and your dark figure in the stairs, so beautiful, in the absurd whirlwind of coat-confusion around you;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">all that</hi> was so like the sort of things that happen in dreaming!&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> I should not see you again. With so many people to see, and so much to do; the wonder was, you found a possible hour to come to Chelsea. I had hard work to keep myself from going up to Bath House on the Friday morning, to wait till you should be up, and get one more look of you before you started; but the dread of being inconvenient, and bothering you restrained me, tho&#x2019; I rose at seven, with the wish!&#x2014; I went at one o&#x2019;clock when sure you would be gone; to hear from Hannah<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hannah Hall, servant at Bath House.</note> if it were all right. And it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> all right she said; you had been near missing the train she said, but &#x201C;the Coachman was a <hi rend="italic">good, clever</hi> man(!) and wouldn&#x2019;t let my Lady be disappointed if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could help it!&#x201D; She also told me with immense glee that there &#x201C;had been <hi rend="italic">five</hi> letters from my Lord&#x2014; And <hi rend="small-caps">that,</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Car-lyle,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC writes the name thus, to indicate pronunciation; see also <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610201-JWC-LLA-01"><sic>37:111</sic><corr>JWC to LLA, [early <date when="1861-02-00">Feb. 1861</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> is more than any of us ever expected, at one time&#x201C;!!

<p>He is getting more reconciled to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chapmans horse &#x201C;It is nothing like so soft a creature to ride as poor Fritz was; and hasn&#x2019;t a tithe of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sense and <hi rend="italic">discrimination</hi>&#x2014;but he has far more <hi rend="italic">go</hi> and shakes him up better.&#x201D; So I dare say as this Brute can also go in harness he will end in buying him.</p>

Finally I bethought me of the Dr. in Edinburgh and he has now got me your little paper into readiness for sending.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For John A.

If, (till you have time to write a long letter of <hi rend="italic">news,</hi> which will be very welcome), you at once address me a Canada newspaper with three strokes, nothing more will be necessary in regard to this little bit of business.</p>
<p>I expect to get done with my book in six or eight months. O that I saw the <pb id="pg-39-127" n="39:127"/>day! I can and have been working thitherward with all the strength that I possess, to the hurt of my health as well, but I calculate when the end have once come I shall begin directly to improve more or less, and perhaps by degrees get very considerably better again. I had an excellent horse who had carried me 7 years and above twenty thousand miles, his hoofs were got spoiled on the stone hard roads. He came plunging down with me one day, (not throwing me nor hurting me in the slightest),&#x2014;a most decided fall for no reason whatever&#x2014;upon which I had to sell him (to a kind master for an old song), and for the last six weeks have been <hi rend="italic">walking,</hi> which was a great enjoyment by way of change. It would not do, however, and since about a week I am mounted again:&#x2014;very swift, very rough (in comparison to my old friend), but good natured, healthy, willing:&#x2014;and must continue adding a dozen miles daily to the twenty-thousand already done.</p>
<p>We have had such a winter for <hi rend="italic">warmth</hi> as was never seen before, not very healthy, I believe, but it has agreed well with Jane:&#x2014;and indeed the kindred, I think, are all well. Poor &#x201C;Wullie Carlyle&#x201D; (if you remember him at all) died lately at Edinburgh,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Carlyle (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) from Ecclefechan (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280203-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:322</sic><corr>TC to MAC, [<date when="1828-02-03">3 Feb. 1828</date>]</corr></ref>), d. <date when="1863-04-27">27 April</date>, 17 Lothian Rd.; apparently a dog dealer because recorded as a &#x201C;keeper of canine repository&#x201D; (<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> Edinburgh Post Office Directory).</note> an old man, as we are all growing hereabouts.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to find, by a Note of y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> to John, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he incloses this morning, that you are fairly <hi rend="italic">in</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new Habitat<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> and have escaped the wildly wet weather in going thro with that Operat<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> Here it was on Thursday, and still is, very muddy, blusterous; heavy plunges latterly; excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> weather for for<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC repeated &#x201C;for&#x201D; at turn of page.</note> <pb id="pg-39-129" n="39:129"/><hi rend="italic">brearding</hi> Corn, but the very worst for flitting furniture!&#x2014; I wish, you with my whole heart, many good days in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new Dwelling, and still better prosperities than in the Old,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; these also have not been <hi rend="italic">bad,</hi> have been good even as things go. One point struck me the name, &#x201C;Mainhill.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mainhill, 2 mi. (3 km.)

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Here are&#x2014;what shall I say,&#x2014;strange doings surely! Yesterday morning, after I had got to my work up here, there came from the street door a mysterious polite message from &#x201C;a young Gent<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> who had a <hi rend="italic">Parcel</hi> for me, if I <pb id="pg-39-130" n="39:130"/>w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> please to step down.&#x201D; I tried to put it on the Wife; but had to step down myself. And there sure enough sat a very civil handsome young gent<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> handsomely mounted; who informed me that the &#x201C;Parcel&#x201D; was this beautiful bay-chestnut <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> he was riding, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had suddenly become <hi rend="italic">mine,</hi> by deed of gift somewhere! From whom? Whence How, what? To none of these questions was the handsome young gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> permitted to make any ans<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> his one request being, That I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> inform him where the stable was;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s horse was kept nearby at Silvester&#x2019;s livery stables, Upper Church St.</note> permit him to deposit the superb little Horse, and then to vanish. All wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had to be done; his terms being peremptory.&#x2014; The wonder of my mind was, of course, great,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I soon guessed (Wife readily confirming) that there was but one person in the world capable of such things</p>
<p>At 3 p.m., the usual hour, I had my new Horse bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> round (grooms full of admirat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>); and tried him in the Park, and up and down, wherever soft roads were discoverable. Beyond question, one of the prettiest little Horses in the world, and far the prettiest I ever had; nothing in him but loyalty, elasticity, dexterity, and the wish to gallop with me, in the most exemplary manner, to the end of the world. Bay-chestnut; of such symmetry, such breadth and depth; only five years by mark of mouth: strong as a little dromedary, swift as a roe;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC conflated several biblical quotations here and in <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630520-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1863-05-20">20 May</date></ref>; cf. &#x201C;swift dromedary,&#x201D; Jer. 2:23, &#x201C;swift as the roes,&#x201D; 1 Chron. 12:8, and &#x201C;as light of foot as the wild roes,&#x201D; 2 Sam. 2:18.

It is very strange: and when I think of all the miserable anxieties you have had to struggle with, of your own, in the late time, and all the tragedies you have been begirt with, I cannot enough wonder at such a thing; and, instead of <hi rend="italic">speaking</hi> my thanks, am ready to blush them. That is really true.</p>
<p>I am now completely <hi rend="italic">mounted</hi> for the latter half of Vol V; my <hi rend="italic">four</hi>-footed support unsurpassable,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a most import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> help on the side of health thro&#x2019; summer. And now if you will bring home that Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton.</note> &#x201C;at the end of july&#x201D; as promised, able to let me see him at The Grange, and look up ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in the world, I will count you a truly Victorious Woman,&#x2014;worthy to have altars, if that were now the fashion.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours most sincerely</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>The sight of your handwriting again is precious to our eyes,&#x2014;more valuable than the signatures of Bank-of-England Notes! It is like the actual break of day, visible to one&#x2019;s own eyes, after a night wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> threatened once to be final! For about a week, at the worst time, I was as good as desperate; my Wife for above three weeks: I believe there seldom was a narrower escape than you, and all that depend on you, have had. I hope we are all thankful;&#x2014;or, as a poor beggar-woman once said to my Mother, who had done something for her, &#x201C;if I&#x2019;m no rightly thankful, I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;m very glad!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210300-TC-MAC-01"><sic>1:334</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1821-03-00">[March 1821]</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; You too, you will be more <hi rend="italic">cautious</hi> and reasonable, won&#x2019;t you? With thoroug[h]ly<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC omits &#x201C;h.&#x201C;</note> <hi rend="italic">good behaviour</hi> on your part, we have now the steady expectation that things will all be well again. That we shall see you again in july; &#x201C;beginning of july,&#x201D; say the sanguine; &#x201C;some time in july,&#x201D; says everybody: a most blessed change of aspects from what there once was! But, for God&#x2019;s sake, do be cautious, and run no risks that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be avoided by human prudence. I hope you won&#x2019;t:&#x2014;it is one of my <hi rend="italic">two hopes,</hi> pretty much all I feel to have in the world at present; <hi rend="italic">first</hi> that I shall see you at The Grange one day soon as I <hi rend="italic">saw you last,</hi> or gradually coming round to that pitch; and <hi rend="italic">second</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> runs into the <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> and is somehow almost one with it), that I may then have my sad work behind me, and be out of this imprisonment, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has really been like a kind of living burial to me for long years past. Life has really nothing in it that is brighter to me than these two outlooks ahead, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> run into one in that way. Poor souls that we are!</p>
<p>Here has been a day worse than December: wild northwind rocking the steeples all night of Monday; deluges of blowing rain towards morning, as if direct from the north pole; wind still piping (11 p.m.);&#x2014;in the afternoon such gusts of it as were like to blow me off my Horse; in Hyde Park two huge old trees flung down.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1863-05-20">20 May</date>, noted that about 3 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>, Tues., <date when="1863-05-18">18 May</date>, &#x201C;a heavy gale burst over London, and continued to blow with unabated fury during the whole of the forenoon. It blew from the E.N.E.&#x201C;</note> I had a wild ride; but a very pretty too, and a wholesome,&#x2014;thanks once more to the <hi rend="italic">skies</hi> for raining down such a Horse to me! Three rides now; fast friendship rising more and more betw<hi rend="italic">n</hi> my excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> little servant and me.</p>
<p>I have still a great deal of stiff labour ahead;&#x2014;hope you will be home long <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I have done; shall be happy to come and finish beside you if you like! <pb id="pg-39-132" n="39:132"/>May God <hi rend="italic">grant</hi> these little bits of wishes of ours: to us they are very considerable, the <hi rend="italic">greatest</hi> now left to us little men.

<p>I am sorry I didn&#x2019;t discover sooner, years and years ago; that one&#x2019;s best chance of getting M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to accept an invitation, is to take for granted that nothing can induce him &#x2018;<hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>&#x2019;; and to refuse for him without giving him time to refuse for himself!

<p>Oh Betty! do you remember the little <hi rend="italic">green thing</hi> that I left in your care, once while I was over in Fife, and when I returned, you had transplanted it into a yellow glass, which I have on my toilet table to this hour, keeping my rings &#x26;c in it? Well! I must surely have told you long ago, that the little thing, with two tiny leaves, from my Fathers grave, had after twelve months in the garden at Chelsea, declared itself a gooseberry bush!

She is &#x201C;third Housemaid at the Marquis of Campden&#x2019;s, and lives in the country; which is good for her. She sent her compliments to &#x201C;Betty&#x201C;</p>
<p>My present pair of Girls go on very peaceably.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary and Lizzie.</note> They are neither of them particularly bright; but they are attentive, and willing and well behaved.

<p>The Horse proves one of the finest little fellows you ever saw; not a better <hi rend="italic">goes</hi> in the world; full of <hi rend="italic">way</hi>gate, of alacrity;&#x2014;quite a pleasure to ride, in comparison; and does me evidently a good deal of benefit. That, therefore, is all right; and in fact my health is not to be complained of,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely is something, and a consid<hi rend="italic">ble</hi> thing!

<p>Jean writes to me this morning; has had a bad time, seemingly, and much confusion with her young folk all in smallpox.

That measure was not, in all respects, satisfactory; but the fault connected with the present spread of smallpox was not so much attributable to the state of the law as to the neglect of the local authorities on whom devolved the working of it. Unfortunately, there was no law on the subject in Scotland. The question of providing a law for Scotland and amending that of England was under careful consideration&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 170:673).</note>&#x2014;not I, who had inoculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> smallpox, and so finished.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Trevelyan,</salute>
<p>It was a lovely thought in you, to write me a letter!&#x2014; I was most agreeably surprised! having been told just a day or two before that you had &#x201C;hidden yourself among the Swiss mountains&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Trevelyans had gone to the Auvergne, central France.</note> I should say however, in strict truth, the surprise became <hi rend="italic">agreeable</hi> only after opening your letter and seeing <hi rend="italic">your</hi> name to it! A first sight, that letter gave me a dreadful fright! brought my heart bang into my mouth; it had such a look of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> letter from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christison, following his last with a rapidity that suggested his own metaphor of &#x201C;Mother Carey&#x2019;s Chickens&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mother Carey&#x2019;s chickens,&#x201D; sailors&#x2019; name for stormy petrels, also often used to mean snowflakes falling with great rapidity.</note> The envelope was the same as <hi rend="italic">his</hi> envelopes, in shape and size! the same postmark &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Paris</hi>&#x2019;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Trevelyans stayed with the Ashburtons in Paris late May; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Reflections</hi> 213&#x2013;14.</note> the same handwriting (positively!) except that it was more <hi rend="italic">easy;</hi> which with a rapid stroke of genius in the imaginative line, I imputed to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C having written this time <hi rend="italic">in haste and agitation!!</hi> Had he not, in his last, expressed disappointment at some hitch in Lord A&#x2019;s progress? Had the slight derangement he spoke of become already serious? Decidedly, it was with my heart in my mouth that I opened your letter! and then I drew myself suddenly up at the first line; and then I looked for the signature; and then I drew a long breath; and then I felt glad&#x2014;and grateful for a letter &#x201C;out of your own head&#x201D; (as the children say) &#x201C;all to myself&#x201C;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411022-JWC-TCH-01"><sic>13:284</sic><corr>JWC to TCH, <date when="1841-10-22">[22 Oct. 1841]</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18581030-JWC-MR-01"><sic>34:233</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1858-10-30">[30 Oct. 1858]</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; It was really very nice of you to write it&#x2014;and I will tell M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ruskin.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter; for I had begun to fear you were ill; or the Doctor ill! You see I have such faith in your constant remembrance of my small self, that I need to fancy extreme reasons for any unusal delay in answering my letters! And this time there had been grave reason enough tho&#x2019;, not exactly physical illness.</p>

Clark (b. ca. <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), m. <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note>&#x2014; I know nobody that seems to me so helpful to his fellow creatures as that <hi rend="italic">D</hi>r of yours! God bless him!</p>
<p>You perhaps saw in the newspaper the death of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Anstruther. Lady Ashburton had just got settled in Paris after her hurried visit to England, when she received the news of his being at the point of death! and back she came, to be with her Sister in her extreme need! He died on the second day after her arrival, and on the following day she returned to Paris! What that woman goes thro in the way of fatigue to body and soul is quite astounding! I said so to Monkton Milnes, and he answered coolly; &#x201C;oh! well! you know she is <hi rend="italic">scotch!</hi> these scotch women have enormous strength! nothing can knock them up!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">For example!</hi>&#x201D; I said, pointing to myself, who am always receiving compliments on the wretchedness of my looks, and who to say the truth havn&#x2019;t the strength of half a sparrow in these scorching East winds!</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> try sea-air for a few days; I know of nothing else that has a chance of doing me good.</p>
<p>I had something to tell you which did not find room in my last letter. The name of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant&#x2019;s Publisher is Blacket, and he has a smart wife,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Blackett (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>), coowner, with Daniel Hurst (ca. <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), of the publishing firm Hurst &#x26; Blackett, 13 Gt. Marlborough St., London; his wife was Ellen Blackett. Margaret Oliphant moved to  Ealing <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>, to be near the Blacketts: &#x201C;I had got very intimate with them somehow. &#x2026; Mrs. Blackett was about my age, and a fine creature, very much more clever than her husband, though treated by him in any serious matter as if she had been a little girl,&#x2014;a thing quite new to me, and which I could not understand&#x201D; (Oliphant, ed. Jay, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 101).</note> who came with him to dinner at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphants when I was there.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC visited Oliphant in Feb.; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630226-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1863-02-26">26 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> They were very (what we called in Scotland) &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">up-making</hi>&#x2019; to me, and pressed me to visit them, at Ealing. Which I hadn&#x2019;t the least thought of doing. Well! some weeks ago, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, was just come in from his ride, very tired, and, to do him justice, very ill humoured, When Mary put her head in a the Drawingroom door and said &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blacket wished to know if she could see me for a few minutes.&#x201D; I went out hurriedly, knowing M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s temper wouldn&#x2019;t be improved by hearing of people, he <hi rend="small-caps">didn&#x2019;t</hi> <hi rend="italic">want,</hi> coming after me! Told Mary to take the Lady into the Diningroom, (where was no fire) and before going down myself, put a shawl about me, chiefly to show her she mustn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">stay!</hi> On entering the room, the Lady&#x2019;s back was to me, and she was standing looking out into the (so <pb id="pg-39-143" n="39:143"/>called) <hi rend="italic">garden,</hi> but I saw at once it wasn&#x2019;t the M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blacket I had seen. This one was very tall, dressed in deep black, and when she turned round, she showed me a pale, beautiful face, that was perfectly strange to me! But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was no stranger to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> seemingly; for she glided swiftly up to me like a Dream, and took my head softly between her hands, and kissed my brow again and again, saying in a low dreamlike voice; &#x201C;Oh you Dear! you Dear! you Dear!&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t you know me?&#x201D; I looked into her eyes, in supreme bewilderment! At last light dawned on me, and I said one word&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bessey?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes! it is Bessey!&#x201C;&#x2014;and then the kissing wasn&#x2019;t all on one side&#x2014;you may fancy! It was, at last, Bessey, not M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blacket, but M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blackiston who stood there, having left her Husband in a cab at the door, till she had seen me first. They were just arrived from Cheshire where they had gone to see one of his sons; who had been dangerously ill<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peyton Blakiston had four sons; it was probably the 2d son, Peyton, who was ill and d. <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>.</note> and were to start by the next train for St Leonards where He is the chief Physician&#x2014;they had only a quarter of an hour to stay. He is a good intelligent looking man; and while he was talking all the time with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, Bessey said beautiful things about him to me, enough to show that if he wasn&#x2019;t her first love<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her first love was John Badams (ca. <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), chemist; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 297&#x2013;300; she was rumored to have been his mistress; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:216&#x2013;17</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> he was at least a very superior being in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> estimation. They pressed me to come to them at St Leonards, and I promised indefinitely that I would.</p>
<p>About a fortnight ago, Bessey walked in one morning after breakfast. She &#x201C;had had no peace for thinking about me, I looked so ill, she was sure I had some disease? had I?&#x201D; I told her; &#x201C;none that I could specify except the disease of <hi rend="italic">old age!</hi> general weakness and discomfort.&#x201C;&#x2014; Reassured on that head she confided to me that I &#x201C;looked just as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blackiston<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Blakiston.</note> had looked when she was dying of cancer;&#x201C;!! and she had come up certain that I had cancer to try and get me away to be nursed by <hi rend="italic">her,</hi> and attended by her Husband! Besides she had heard there was so much smallpox in London &#x201C;and if I took it and <hi rend="italic">died</hi> before she had seen me again she thought she would never have an hours happiness in the world again!&#x201D; Oh, Bessey Bessey! just the old woman; an imagination, morbid almost to insanity!&#x2014; &#x201C;Would I go back with her that night anyhow&#x201C;? &#x201C;Impossible!&#x201D; &#x201C;Then when would I come and she would come up again to fetch me?&#x201C;&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I would not hear of, but I engaged to go so soon as it was a little warmer. and today I have written that I will come for two or three days on Monday next&#x2014;</p>

<p>I got your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Note a couple of hours ago; I meant, at any rate, to write you a longish acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> today,&#x2014;for I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> riding (going to hear Ruskin <hi rend="italic">lecture</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630602-JWC-LT-01">JWC to <sic>Lady T</sic><corr>LT</corr>, <date when="1863-06-02">2 June</date></ref>.</note> tonight);&#x2014;but, alas, alas, my time is all gone to 5 minutes; the whole blessed day spent <hi rend="italic">boring</hi> and bothering over maps and blockhead intricacies: close now upon 5 p.m., <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> to take, in dirty windy rain:&#x2014;&#x26; in fact, and short, I must restrict myself to the needful two words.</p>
<p>Did I ever tell you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Bessy Barnet? Surely I did once? She is now the wife of a Dr Blakiston, once of Birm<hi rend="italic">m</hi> who has been here repeatedly with her; a sonsy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Sonsy,&#x201D; applicable to men and women, has many meanings in Scots, including buxom, cheerful, comely, handsome, hearty, and pleasant.</note>

<p>My horse is very useful to me: I am in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> getting on, a degree <hi rend="italic">faster,&#x2014;</hi>not too fast yet!

<p><salute>All right, Dear!</salute> You would see from the newspaper<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably sent by JWC on arrival at St. Leonards.</note> that I had arrived at the far end. Tho&#x2019; only a journey of two hours it seemed a dreadful long one; from which was to be inferred that I am not even up to the mark of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">my frail ordinar</hi>&#x201D; at the present time. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blackiston was waiting for me with the carriage, and gave me the frankest welcome. I felt quite at my ease with him before I reached his house.</p>
<p>Bessie wasn&#x2019;t allowed to come having a headache, but she met me on the steps of the front door. So well she looks in her own house! and a very suitable Mistress of it; altho&#x2019; it is quite what the auctioneers call a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">large aristocratic Mansion.</hi>&#x201D;  The Situation is first rate; close on the Sea, at right angles to it, in a square of large handsome Houses.</p>
<p>The bedrooms are beautiful and must be very quiet as a general rule; at present there are pipes being laid along the road by the Sea, and the rivetting makes a disturbing noise in the morning&#x2014;but during the night it was as quiet as at Cheyne Row&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;I have been out in the carriage today <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>&#x2014;before dinner and after&#x2014;and I have had a doze of <hi rend="italic">pepsine</hi> administered to me by the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> whom I take to be a very clever D<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> And Bessey is always feeding me with dainties, calves foot jelly &#x26;c &#x26;c as if I were a young Bird! Nothing can exceed their kindness&#x2014; I only fear that I cause a good deal of trouble.</p>
<p>I have not said anything yet about going away, but I shall tomorrow, and tell <pb id="pg-39-146" n="39:146"/>you when to expect me&#x2014; Pray dont sit up till two&#x2014;nor <hi rend="italic">take in</hi> a sixth cup of tea&#x2014;nor comit any indiscretions in your management of yourself&#x2014; The thought of your being &#x201C;left to yoursell&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; variant of &#x201C;mostly work in a place by himsel&#x2019;&#x201C;; cf. <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380121-TC-MAC-01"><sic>10:9</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1838-01-21">21 Jan. 1838</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500806-JWC-TC-01"><sic>25:143</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1850-08-06">6 Aug. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> is the only drawback to my content <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>JWC</name></p>

<p>What a nice packet to be laid on one&#x2019;s bed of a morning, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> would have been, if only the news from Paris had been less anxious! I dont mind Lady A&#x2019;s note very much.

However, as all the unfavourable symptoms <hi rend="italic">may,</hi> he says, be produced by the coming on of gout, I put my hope in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and dont give up the prospect of seeing him home in July. I gave D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christison&#x2019;s note to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blackiston, and he asked if the &#x201C;albumen&#x201D; spoken of was constantly there; when I said no, he <pb id="pg-39-149" n="39:149"/>declared that intermittent albumen was not at all serious&#x2014;and did not see anything alarming in the note.</p>
<p>I suppose that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> taking not dispairing view of the interruption to his improvement is due to the improvement in my own health, effected by these few days of good nursing and good doctoring</p>
<p>I am bringing you some pepsine in the form of pills. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blackiston says he can always tell from a person&#x2019;s complexion when pepsine will agree with him&#x2014;that he had no doubt of it in my case and was pretty sure it would be an unspeakable comfort to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> too.

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of yesterday afternoon, which I broke open (knowing the hand, and Jane being away at Hastings), made me very gloomy in my solitary ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> here. Dr Christison, always clear, candid and cautious, was somewhat reassuring:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christison also wrote and enclosed a note; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630611-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1863-06-11">11 June</date>]</ref>.</note> but my habitual feeling is, &#x201C;we have so very small a stock of strength to depend upon!&#x201C;&#x2014;and I am too much given to prophesy not in the flattering strain to myself just now. This morning, a Note from Miss Davenp<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Bromley, handed in by a groom, gave me great comfort: &#x201C;a comfortable account from Paris has much relieved me this morning&#x201C;;&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning&#x201D; she said, and the groom and Note (intended for my Wife, and to be answered directly) were, sure enough, of <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> morning, 9&#xBD; a.m.; but then, again, the Note itself was dated &#x201C;Wednesday,&#x201C;&#x2014;I have hoped all day, only by mistake;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I could not yet learn for certain. Let us hope, let us hope! It is a bad element to me, also, that you spoke of writing &#x201C;tomorrow,&#x201D; and there has nothing come: but I study to interpret that my own way, as <hi rend="italic">weaker</hi> than the Bromley document, as perhaps not meaning much. Why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I trouble <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with these my calculatings &#x26; forecastings, that go on as an undercurrent, among the sordid botherations and wearisome toils I am always plunged in? Your own troubles are of quite another magnitude and pungency all this while. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Wife is not coming home till Saturday, as probably she has herself told you. Except for her, and my little Horse, I have absolutely no company in these times; often I do not speak to a single creature in the course of my day. Ruskin I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have seen this afternoon; but had not the heart. He staid only an hour in Paris;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote to Lady Trevelyan, <date when="1863-06-17">17 June</date>, explaining why he had not called on her and the Ashburtons in Paris on his way home, <date when="1863-05-30">30 May</date>: &#x201C;I could&#x2019;nt call at Paris at 5 in the morning, I got there &#x2026; about that time &#x2026; breakfasted in a caf&#xE9; &#x2026; and got to Boulogne at one oclock&#x201D; (Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Reflections</hi> 213).</note> and of course had no news to tell us of you, the night he was here.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-151" n="39:151"/>You may well call my Horse a success! He is the finest little fellow in the world; full of taking ways, now that he is getting familiar with me. A very great and visible improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> he produces in my affairs; if it be a luxury to do a fellow fellow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC repeated &#x201C;fellow&#x201D; at turn of page.</note>-creature good, as I think it is, a certain heart may fairly enjoy it amid its many pains &#x26; cares.

<salute>Dear Goody,</salute>
<p>There is nothing whatever to be said; all in <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> as near as necessary; but it seems to me you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have once, by a good chance favouring you, a kind of Note on regular paper at least, before ending y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lucky Tour of 5 days: lucky if I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> you ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on the 6th day, <hi rend="italic">improved</hi> as you describe y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self&#x2014;or indeed if I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> you once, on any terms.

<p>Latterly, after something of writing, I have been vigorously <hi rend="italic">annihilating rubbish;</hi> that done, there are still a few moments for <hi rend="italic">Notes,&#x2014;</hi>for one to you first of all.</p>
<p>Last night I got extensively into work; and then, being filled with remorse for my <hi rend="italic">day</hi> (and having a pill in me to boot), I decided to write Lady A. a Note (not the least word from her, or anybody,&#x2014;unless that enigmatic Notice by Miss Bromley may be taken as later <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news?)&#x2014; But before I got done with all this, to my amaze<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the clock struck <hi rend="italic">one;</hi> and more, on looking out I found plunges of rain: so did not try to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> out; but hurried my milk, and <hi rend="italic">was</hi> in bed not very long after 2. Resolutely quiet; and sleep nothing like so bad as you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have prophesied.

<p>I wish to Heaven I could carry this sea air home with me! it has done me so much good! it, and constant driving in the open air.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I was very sorry to hear from you, yesterday afternoon, about poor James&#x2019;s accid<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s son James Aitken had broken his collarbone; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630709-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1863-07-09">9 July</date></ref>.</note> of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> no whisper had reached me till then. He has been more than usually a stranger for some good while back,&#x2014;only here once I know not how many weeks ago, and seemed to impute it to embarrassment and hurries of his own; changing Lodgings,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James changed lodgings in spring <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610501-TC-JCA-01"><sic>37:161</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1861-05-01">1 May 1861</date></corr></ref>), but had recently moved again, presumably to a suburb in S London.</note> pressure of Office business &#x26;c &#x26;c:&#x2014;ever since I got mounted again, I had been determining on a ride out to his new Quarters; but discovered that I had lost the <hi rend="italic">written</hi> Address, and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have to apply at Finsbury Circus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the address of the mercantile house where James worked.</note> for a new direction to my course,&#x2014;and this, in the perpetual bother I am kept in, I had missed doing for the last 3 fridays (<hi rend="italic">friday</hi> the last <hi rend="italic">post</hi> day of the week, to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> date it had always been put off). In this fine state of darkness y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> note found me yesterday; and to complete the bus<hi rend="italic">ss,</hi> just as I was about flinging <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a word to send me the Address from Dumfries, as the now shortest route, an interloping person came in, and detained me till after post! So goes the course of arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> with me here at this time.</p>
<p>Well, not to preface any further, I set off at a venture, this Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> with such vague light of dim recollections as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> scrape together, I confess with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> much hope of finding the place;&#x2014;but I did, by good <hi rend="italic">spiering</hi> and guessing, actually find it; &#x26; ended, in about an hour and half, all my uncertainties by <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> James in person, sitting at his own open window; rosy-faced, cheerful, and, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> his arm in a sling, all going perfectly well with him. You need not disturb y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> mind ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the poor fellow any farther: I sat ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#xBE;  of an hour with him; smoked two pipes, in one of which he joined; he gave me an acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26; his other affairs; and all was as satisfactory as, in the case, I could have wished. The bone had been wrong <hi rend="italic">bandaged</hi> (apothecary in a hurry) when it first miscarried (some &#x201C;rut&#x201D; in the road he said); &#x26; the <hi rend="italic">first night</hi> he had got no sleep, but been obliged to take off the wrappages himself, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were stopping the circulat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the arm (left arm it is); and send for a proper <pb id="pg-39-155" n="39:155"/>Dr on the morrow; who immediately; and <hi rend="italic">since</hi> that, Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> has had no trouble with it farther, except keeping himself in a quiet posture in a good stuffed chair, at a quiet window with outlook into the silent country and fine summer skies; and entertaining himself with diligent reading of a Certain Person&#x2019;s Works,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s works.</note>&#x2014;a volume of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had in his right hand at the time of our interview. His Hosts seem clean good people; his little sitting room was prettyand in fair order, his bedroom up stairs is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bigger,</hi>&#x201D; he told me, &#x201C;by the breadth of the lobby,&#x201D; and must be big <hi rend="italic">enough,</hi>&#x2014;out from it, opposite &#x26; southward is just one new House (a very decent young Dairyman&#x2019;s, whose own <hi rend="italic">property</hi> &#x201C;freehold&#x201D; it is): the whole street, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> is about the middle, has hardly fifteen houses in it; and between him and the British Channel is nothing,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means that there were no towns between James&#x2019;s suburb and the English (British) Channel, rather than that James could see the Channel.</note> except that one freehold &#x201C;Dairy,&#x201D; but clear green hills and vallies, the beautifullest in the world, except that &#x201C;advancing prosperity&#x201D; has thrown them all into the <hi rend="italic">mortar-tub;</hi> and there is such a higgledy-piggledy of trenchings, railway, build-buildings and dig-diggings, as in all Nature, I believe, the like of does not exist! I had not been in the region at all for perhaps 7 years; and nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> exceed my poor sense of disgust at the defacement made in it.</p>
<p>James is not coming home (on <hi rend="italic">other</hi> acc<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> as well) till begin<hi rend="italic">g</hi> of <hi rend="italic">July.</hi> He spoke of resuming his work ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Wednesday; <hi rend="italic">wh</hi>h I earnestly charged him not to think of doing (for they are in no hurry ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> him; his work at a <hi rend="italic">slack</hi> any way),&#x2014;but to go out and <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> first for a couple of days &#x26;c &#x26;c, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he faithfully promised. I hope you will get this, tomorrow night; and be easier in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> mind on that score. All is doing right. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I remember that this is Friday; and push away my dreary business shut, to fling you half a word before the week close.</p>
<p>I am well enough, nothing special to complain of that way except &#x201C;some of the <hi rend="italic">eff</hi>ecks of heat&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550724-TC-SGS-01"><sic>30:10</sic><corr>TC to SGS, <date when="1855-07-27">27 July 18[5]5</date></corr></ref>; source untraced.</note> Jane too returned much improved by her week of Sea-air, tho&#x2019; alas it will not be very permanent I doubt,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it does still hold out to a visible degree. My Horse is doing his duty as before, no fear of him I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think,&#x2014;useful to me very, tho&#x2019; wearisome &#x26; lonesome very. My work creeping on, at say the 10th part of a reasonable velocity: but faster I cannot drive it than it will go! Undoubtedly a most ungainly thing: requiring <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> trouble in every partic<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> yielding infinite indifference of result (even to myself), but insisting to be honestly done: thank God, it will not endure quite forever! This is really all the news I have, at least that you don&#x2019;t already know.</p>
<p>Craik&#x2019;s correct<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> I spent (not very profitably) a half day in examining. They are exactly what you define them: 7, or so many, <hi rend="italic">errors of the press</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I corrected); the others one and all definable as <hi rend="italic">errors of the Craik,</hi>&#x2014;impossible to do his will in any one of them, tho&#x2019; of course I see he has been read<hi rend="italic">g</hi> accurately, and am pleased with his zeal to help.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1863-06-02">2 June</date>: &#x201C;On Saturday I did go out &#x2026; to meet Craik &#x26; his two daughters. He was very talkative, &#x26; our evening passed away pleasantly. At parting he gave me that list of inaccuracies in your Vol. III. &#x26; he called here yesterday. I defended &#x2018;Heir apparent,&#x2019; &#x26; &#x2018;Pipin of Heristal&#x2019; (though <hi rend="italic">a</hi> &#x2018;Pipin of Heristal&#x2019; undoubtedly was the Grandfather of King Pipin). The &#x2018;Titular of Lorraine&#x2019; also seemed right, so far as I knew; &#x26; the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi> (not once only) disagreed&#x2019; I proved by K&#xF6;hler. The 370 &#x2018;both Honourable Houses,&#x2019; I said was the only rational phrase in such a case, tho&#x2019; House of Lords may be <hi rend="italic">right</hi> hon<hi rend="italic">ble.</hi> I shewed that 346 lets any one doubt that chooses. And I could not concede that there were any other errors than those which I had marked with a stroke before the page&#x2014;seven in all of printer&#x2019;s errors.

<salute>My dear little woman!</salute>
<p>Every day since I got your letter; I have put off answering it, till the morrow; in hope always that the morrow would find me more <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> writing an answer both long and pleasant! But alas! I had best not wait any longer for &#x201C;a more convenient season&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Acts 24:25.</note>
&#x2014;but just write a stupid little note, according to my present disability; as a time when my head will be clearer, and my heart lighter, and my stomach less <hi rend="italic">sick,</hi> is not to be calculated on!</p>
<p>I went some three weeks ago to St Leonards the pleasantest sea-side place I know, and staid from Monday to Saturday, in circumstances the most favourable to health that could be desired! the finest sea-air in the world&#x2014;a large airy quiet house close on the shore&#x2014;a carriage to drive out in <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> a day&#x2014;a clever Physician for host who dieted me on <hi rend="italic">champaign</hi> and the most nourishing delicacies, and for hostess, a gentle graceful, loving woman who besides being full of interest for me as a heroine of Romance has the more personal interest for me of having been my&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">servant!</hi> about thirty years ago! and of having been sincerely mourned by me as&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">dead!</hi></p>
<p>Did you ever hear of Bessey Barnet?&#x2014; It will be a fine story to tell you when we meet&#x2014;if you never did&#x2014;but it is too long for writing.</p>
<p>Well! I returned from that visit quite <hi rend="italic">set up&#x2014;</hi>and the improvement lasted some two or three days&#x2014; Then I turned as sick as a dog one evening, and had to take to bed&#x2014;and the sickness not abating after two days, during which time to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s great dismay, I could <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> nothing at all (nothing in the shape of illness ever alarms M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C but <hi rend="small-caps">that</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not eat</hi>ing <hi rend="italic">ones regular meals!</hi>) M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes was sent for&#x2014;who ordered mustard blisters to my stomach, and unlimited Soda-water, &#x201C;with a little brandy in it&#x201C;&#x2014; In about a week I was on foot again&#x2014;but weak as a dish clout! And that is my condition to the present hour! I dont see much chance of bettering it, <hi rend="italic">here&#x2014;</hi> And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C seems determined to stick to his &#x201C;work&#x201D; all this summer and autumn as he did the last.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell, [late June]: &#x201C;Mrs Carlyle people tell me is lowly wretchedly ill&#x2014;Carlyle has broken the knees of his old beautiful horse &#x26; got another&#x2014;one other vol of Fred G is ready waiting for its fellow&#x201D; (Mantell).</note> It is very bad for him&#x2014;and even bad for the <hi rend="italic">work!</hi> He would get on twice as fast, if he <pb id="pg-39-162" n="39:162"/>would give himself a holyday&#x2014; But there is no persuading him as you know&#x2014;&#x201C;vara obstinate in his own wai&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Cumberland man&#x2019;s account of the Scotch&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:170).</note></p>
<p>And as I was away last autumn a whole month, by myself, I cannot have the face to leave him again this year&#x2014;unless for a few days at a time&#x2014;when I am hardly missed, till I am back again.</p>
<p>Besides; the present Servants are not adapted for being left to their own devices. They do very well, with overlooking and direction: and the week I was at St Leonards, nothing went wrong. But for <hi rend="italic">that long,</hi> they could have their orders for every day&#x2014;and as I did not tell them for certain what day I should be back there was a constant wholesome expectation of my return.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has got his tent up in the back area,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a photograph of TC under his awning in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>, see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570709-TC-JWC-01"><sic>32:176</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-07-09">9 July 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> and writes away there, without much inconvenience as yet from the heat. He has changed his dinner hour to half past three, instead of seven; then he sleeps for an hour and then goes for his ride in the cool of the evening  The horse Lady Ashburton sent him is a pretty, swift little creature, and very sure-footed, which is the first quality for a horse, whose rider always goes at a gallop! But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C draws many plaintive comparisons between <hi rend="italic">this</hi> horse and poor old &#x201C;Friz,&#x201D; as to <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> qualities. This one &#x201C;shows no desire to please <hi rend="italic">him</hi> whatever!&#x2014;only goes at its best pace when its head is turned towards its own stable! Friz was always endeavouring to ascertain <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wishes and to gain <hi rend="italic">his</hi> approbation! it was a horse of very superior sense and sensibility! and had a profound regard for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I must not let the week close again with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> some little word from me, as it tends to do. We are struggling along pretty much on the old terms; so you need not be uneasy. Poor Jane is rather below par, since the weather grew so hot; but she is better than she was a week ago, and fights a vigorous battle; goes out driving, &#x26;c, and does not yield to her many impediments. Perhaps a turn of Country or even sea-side may occur again, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> aways improves matters. I am now <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> under canvas; that is, down in the flagged area, under the shadow of the House, and with an awning overhead: it embarrasses my working concerns; but it is much wholesomer; and indeed there was no alternative, the top story having become plainly uninhabitable. I have a great fight, not always successful to get even a small day&#x2019;s work done. But I do advance: about the end of this month, I hope to have the <hi rend="italic">Seven-Years War</hi> all on paper,&#x2014;the last <hi rend="italic">Battle</hi> (Torgau) comes on tomorrow; but there are two more <hi rend="italic">Campaigns;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick&#x2019;s sixth campaign, <date when="1761-00-00">1761</date> (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:361&#x2013;407), and seventh campaign, <date when="1762-00-00">1762</date> (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:448&#x2013;81).</note> with wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I mean to be brief. Brevity, brevity, after that; on all acc<hi rend="italic">ts!</hi> I ought to be <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> again, surely, some time in September? There will be a sore struggle to <hi rend="italic">close</hi> so wide a stocking in any feasible way: but it must, it surely can and shall be done.</p>
<p>Sometimes I judge (indeed generally of late) that we actually ought to have a pause in August, say two whole weeks, in the silent country somewhere, by <pb id="pg-39-165" n="39:165"/>the sea-shore if that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> offer itself as feasible. There are plenty of <hi rend="italic">chances;</hi> in fact rather too many, but none yet quite certainly eligible: Froude wants us in Devonshire (some old <hi rend="italic">Schloss am Meer</hi> [castle by the sea],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude was renting Ringrone House, built <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s, on the edge of Salcombe, S Devon coast (Herbert Paul, <hi rend="italic">Life of Froude</hi> [<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>] 127).</note>
&#x2014;but it is 200 miles off!)&#x2014;that has some likelihood, as other offers have; but the first thing to be attended to, and followed so far as possible, is the return of the Ashburtons,&#x2014;Lord A. actually to be here at Bath House on Thursday night next; so his Doctor, one Quain, stopped me yesterday on the street to say: almost a miracle; and far beyond our hope at one time. We shall see what that produces. In the mean time, let me be busy, <hi rend="italic">busy.</hi></p>
<p>You ought to get away into the Country without delay.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1863-06-26">26 June</date>, from Linlathen, where he was visiting Thomas Erskine, 24&#x2013;ca. <date when="1863-06-30">30 June</date>: &#x201C;Linlathen is looking very beautiful this year, the foliage being richer than usual, &#x26; the weather most favourable for everything. Mrs Stirling is considerably stronger than she was before leaving Edinburgh. She cannot yet walk very much, but gets out for a long drive every good day. Erskine too is also looking better than usual. Both desire me to send their kindest remembrance to you &#x26; also to Jane. &#x2026; First night I slept very badly, but slept well last night for a reasonable number of hours, &#x26; feel refreshed today. Perhaps I have been poring too much over my Danish, Islandic &#x26;c. &#x26; shall be better for a little rest.&#x201C;</note> Yes, surely!&#x2014; I am sorry to to<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated at turn of page.</note> hear of J.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I had been fancying it was <hi rend="italic">your</hi> turn to write, and so, not feeling any qualms of conscience at my own silence; but your letter comes with such an air of having nothing to be ashamed or apologetic for, that I begin to fear I had made a mistake and was myself the indebted <hi rend="italic">Party!</hi></p>
<p>At all events it would seem you have not heard from me since I went to St Leonards. I stayed there from Monday till Saturday, and liked my visit much. It is a beautiful place and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston&#x2019;s house is situated within a stonecast of the Sea&#x2014;and is a fine airy lofty House&#x2014;handsomely but plainly furnished and Bessey looked very natural gliding about as mistress of it! D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston is a clever, energetic, kind hearted man&#x2014;very vain, rather egotistic and as excitable and impatient as my grandfather Walter!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter Welsh (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), JWC&#x2019;s maternal grandfather (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 122&#x2013;30).</note> But Bessey understands him entirely, seems to admire his faults as much as his virtues, and has the completest silken dominion over him! They live the quietest life, except for his practice&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">She</hi> will visit nowhere&#x2014;&#x201C;does not choose to be patronized&#x201C;&#x2014; She is always occupied about her house and his comforts. His practice is not very laborious (being a Physician) considering how lucrative it is!&#x2014; He told me he made about two thousand a year</p>
<p>They were both as kind as kind could be&#x2014; Bessey would not be hindered from bringing up my hot water and waiting on me as a Ladys maid&#x2014; And she was never so pleased as when we talked of the things that happened when she was my servant&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blackiston too talked of all that so frankly that there was no awkwardness in my changed position towards her. I seemed to improve every day. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> B gave me&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">pepsine</hi>&#x2014;which agreed wonderfully with me&#x2014;and Bessey was always &#x201C;nourishing&#x201D; me with jellies champagne &#x26;c and always <hi rend="italic">making of me,</hi> and that divine sea air! and I did not fatigue myself with walking, but had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> drives in the carriage every day. never woman had a better chance at getting well! And I did come home a different creature from what I went away. And the difference lasted two or three days&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> two or three days tho&#x2019; I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> continue the <hi rend="italic">pepsine</hi>&#x2014;gradually I ceased to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> again, and got <hi rend="italic">sicker</hi> and sicker till I had to take to bed and lie there several days, unable to hold up my head for nausea!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes whom M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C sent for; (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C never being alarmed at any form of <pb id="pg-39-167" n="39:167"/>illness but <hi rend="italic">the incapacity of taking one&#x2019;s regular meals!</hi>) put mustard blisters to my stomach and dieted me on Soda water &#x201C;with a little brandy in it&#x201C;&#x2014;and said &#x201C;the heat had upset me&#x201C;&#x2014; I have not been feeling the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> at all disagreeable&#x2014;but of course D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> know best! After a week I was &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">about</hi>&#x2019; again after a sort</p>
<p>But very thankful should I be to get away from this noisy, dusty place&#x2014;into some quiet green place for a while and if I had my <hi rend="italic">choice,</hi> independent of all other considerations, it is to Holme Hill I should like best to go. But I cannot <hi rend="italic">run away this</hi> year again, as I did the last, and leave M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to his own devices, especially as he is likely to take a short Holyday himself after all, provided I keep him up to it, and go with him. The Ashburtons are at last coming home&#x2014;this day week. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain is going to Paris in a few days to superintend the journey and hopes that when he (Lord A) gets home to The Grange he will make more rapid progress in gaining strength than he has done hit[h]erto. They are sure to want us at the Grange and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C will not <hi rend="italic">refuse him,</hi> in his present circumstances. Then there was a promise when M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C refused Lord Lothian&#x2019;s invitation last summer<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Lothians invited the Carlyles to visit the previous summer; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620721-JWC-LLO-01"><sic>38:121, 122</sic><corr>JWC to LLO, [<date when="1862-07-00">July 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> that we would go the next year&#x2014;when <hi rend="italic">The Book</hi> was to be done! The Book alas is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> done!&#x2014;nor within six months of being done! But Lord Lothian asks us again, and I think M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C will hardly find in his heart to refuse. That poor young man is so fond of him! and has such a sad life! Miss Baring wants <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to go to her in Hampshire<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sister, lived at 23 Princes Gate, London, and had a house at Alverstoke, Hampshire, which JWC visited <date when="1858-08-00">Aug. 1858</date>.</note> on the 22<hi rend="italic">d&#x2014;</hi> And I could do <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> which is a short journey, and would not require me to be long away  But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said today I had to keep in mind, that I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have to go to the Grange and afterwards to Blickingham<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blickling Park, 15 mi. (24 km.) N of Norwich.</note> (the Lothians&#x2019; place in Norfolk)&#x2014;so I must postpone my own <hi rend="italic">will</hi> to his &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">mights</hi>.&#x2019;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During July JWC visited Geraldine Jewsbury; Jewsbury wrote to Mantell, <date when="1863-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle came to see me one day &#x26; I go there again&#x2014;she looks <hi rend="italic">terribly ill</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">weak.</hi> <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is always in the depths of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>&#x201D; (Mantell).</note></p>
<p>It isnt a very comfortable idea to me our both leaving the House with these two young maids in it&#x2014; The one aged six and twenty is just as young in sense as the one at eighteen. They do very well with looking after and constant direction; but left to themselves I forsee they will make acquaintance with all the idle people round about. and that when we take them up again I shall probably find them spoiled: not to say that they may have people <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the house who are not safe. These apprehensions are excited in me by what I have observed of their readiness to strike up conversation with all the lounging passers by over the area railing! Since the weather was hot they keep the kitchen windows open and <hi rend="italic">sit in them</hi> and sometimes go out altogether into <pb id="pg-39-168" n="39:168"/>the area&#x2014;and attract the notice of men women and children who address them, and then they answer&#x2014; I have two or three times forebidden this; but still it goes on&#x2014;when they think me out of hearing. They are not lightheaded girls at all, only indiscreet and underbred&#x2014;and it is very difficult to repress a habit which you cannot make them <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the impropriety of. I am very glad your cook is answering.&#x2014; Is little Mary<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Mary Russell&#x2019;s servants.</note> as good as ever? give her my kind remembrance.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>The minutes I had set apart for you, this day, were stolen by an accidental Yankee from N. York,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The New Yorker is unidentified.</note>
&#x2014;worse luck to him!&#x2014;&#x26; tomorrow there will be no post.</p>
<p>I can only say therefore that you have, in effect, put on my unworthy back one of the most magnificent Dressing-gowns ever made by man or tailor;&#x2014;and that I am reduced to <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> by this and other gifts, and miraculous remembrances of me, at such a time! The wife is enchanted; and declares this new garment actually makes me &#x201C;look <hi rend="italic">well.</hi>&#x201D; It has an admirable simplicity fit for the <hi rend="italic">modest</hi> mind (she says); &#x26; an opulence &#x26; grace, of Colour, material and design, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> render it quasi-royal quasi-pontifical, &#x26;c &#x26;c. My own notion is that, if I be ever (what is not likely) waited on by a Deputat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of Mankind announcing that I am appointed, say &#x201C;King of the Romans&#x201D; (with a view to being &#x201C;Kaiser of the Future&#x201C;), &#x26; find myself, as is likely, ill dressed at the time,&#x2014;I need only fling on this vesture, and (if I have a clean shirt) stride downstairs, in a majestically appropriate manner.&#x2014; &#x2014; Really, really, in sober sadness, I am ashamed; and very grateful to my Lady and you.</p>
<p>Christison came last night with the Parcel;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christison wrote to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1863-08-01">1 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I spent yesterday evening with the Carlyles and took the dressing gown with me. First M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle put it on to show it off to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, and then he put it on to show it to her. It was unanimously voted the ne plus ultra of dressing gowns, and she said that he had never looked so well in anything else before. Miss Bromley &#x26; a Miss Dewsbury [Jewsbury] were there. I was more charmed than ever with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x26; spent a very pleasant evening.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I find you are gone to Scotsbrig today: I had sent Jean a <hi rend="italic">Fraser,</hi> in the notion that it might perhaps find you at Dumfries and be a sign from me; this having failed I will write you a few words. After a toilsome enough and rather futile day, I escape up to my garret here, after tea, for that object;&#x2014;one small duty I may still accomplish tho&#x2019; my poor day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">work</hi> was rather a failure, and my ride a labour rather than a pleasure to me in the solitary evening. A beautiful ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> too, and indeed a beautiful bright day, under one&#x2019;s Awning (had the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> gone right, as it did <hi rend="italic">not</hi>): but both day and ev<hi rend="italic">g solitary</hi> oherwise, and not only so but <hi rend="italic">noisy</hi> as well, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an ill combinat<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> I had to take a <hi rend="italic">blue-pill</hi> too last week; you know what that means with me! Were my nerves clear, and my spirits good, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> now dash off my work and finish at a good rate: but that is a condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as impossible as growing young again; I must finish without that,&#x2014;namely by sheer compulsion, and at such rate as I can!</p>
<p>I cannot tell you yet anything about our motions. It seemed to be settled, when the Ashburtons went away, that we were to follow almost directly; &#x201C;in a week or ten days,&#x201D; was what I agreed to, and we expected to have heard before now some farther news ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it: but none comes, and we begin to think there may have obstacles arisen (poor Lord A. too weak to be troubled with <pb id="pg-39-172" n="39:172"/>any guest, even the most familiar; poor Lady A. got into a burble, as she is apt to do, with her enthusiastic plans &#x26;c &#x26;c); and that the thing is shoved away into the vague more or less. There was another pressing invitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> too, &#x201C;for Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sometime,&#x201D; to a place called Blickling (very ancient Anne-Boleyn Mansion,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blickling Hall, once lived in by Thomas Boleyn (<date when="1476-00-00">1476</date> or <date when="1477-00-00">1477</date>&#x2013;<date when="1539-00-00">1539</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2795"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and his wife Elizabeth (d. <date when="1538-00-00">1538</date>); their da.

And so are quite at sea in regard to all that. Proverbially &#x201C;at sea&#x201C;;&#x2014;if it were only <hi rend="italic">literally,</hi> nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better; for a week of <hi rend="italic">sea-bathing</hi> is what I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> covet more than anything, and will yet try for: as to the rest, really London, in its empty state, with one&#x2019;s own bed and home, is to me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as good as any other place whatever. Jane does get very weakly in the heat here; her I must send away into some country recreation (Scotland perhaps still?); but for myself I can do very well <hi rend="italic">without.</hi> My Paper is done;&#x2014;and I have a Note to write to <hi rend="italic">Irma,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irma Otthenin; for her photograph, see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above</corr>; it may have been taken at the same time as her mother&#x2019;s (see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630429-TC-JAC-01"><sic>115</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1863-04-29">29 April</date></corr></ref>).</note> as you see by the inclosed!</p>

<salute>Dearest Lady Ashburton</salute>
<p>In receiving a letter in D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christison&#x2019;s handwriting this morning, I was not so surprised, as frightened; for I had some notion of his being at the Grange; tho&#x2019; in taking leave of me he had asked my &#x201C;messages for <hi rend="italic">Edin</hi>r.&#x201D; But I had gone up to Bath House some three days ago, to ask Hanah<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hannah Hall; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630510-JWC-LA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, [ca. <date when="1863-05-10">10 May</date>]</ref>.</note> if she knew how Lord Ashburton was; and she had told me, along with the most favourable accounts of &#x201C;my Lord,&#x201D; that &#x201C;it was a good thing in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> opinion D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christison was gone back to him; for he was a discreet well disposed Gentleman, D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christison, <hi rend="italic">not like some that had been there.</hi>&#x201D; So I supposed he was at the Grange; but as he had latterly only written when there was some hitch in Lord A&#x2019;s progress, it was like my foolishness to open the letter in fear and trembling! But it was a nice comfortable letter. I think I will inclose it to you, <pb id="pg-39-173" n="39:173"/><pb id="pg-39-174" n="39:174"/>that you may read the pretty things he says of Baby!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Baring.</note> Pretty things said of oneself or one&#x2019;s Baby give more pleasure when said &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">behind one&#x2019;s back</hi>&#x2019;!&#x2014; I am not benevolent enough to get excited, in a general way, over the <hi rend="italic">happiness</hi> of &#x201C;others&#x201C;! When told of any one being very &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">happy</hi>&#x201C;; the response of my secret heart is apt to be, just; &#x201C;Very Good, <hi rend="italic">It is more than I am!</hi>&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Happiness</hi> can do very well without sympathy; and having only a limited amount of sympathy in me, I keep it, generally speaking for the miserable. But either, because you have come thro&#x2019; so much misery before reaching the present happiness; or because I love you in a quite exceptional way; or for both these reasons together; it is a fact that it makes my heart <hi rend="italic">all warm</hi> to think of you in these bright days of peace and hope!</p>
<p>Oh yes! you must be very careful! must let nobody come,&#x2014;must let nothing that human will can avert interfere with <hi rend="italic">His</hi> progress!</p>
<p>I heard of the Linlathen people the other day, from Miss Dundas,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Miss Hamilton Dundas, 8 St. Bernard&#x2019;s Crescent, Edinburgh; she might have been a relative of the Mr. Dundas present at a dinner in Edinburgh, <date when="1863-04-22">22 April</date>, with John A.

John wrote: &#x201C;[W]e had rather pleasant talk and entertainment.&#x201C;</note> who was staying there, and who wrote to me, under the absurd impression that I &#x201C;was benevolent and active in doing good in my neighbourhood&#x201D; (fancy!) to &#x201C;find out the circumstances of a young woman<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> from Scotland who had written to her that she and her children were actually starving&#x201C;!&#x2014;I found the woman, who did not <hi rend="italic">look starved</hi> the least in the world! and her two children were the merriest, <hi rend="italic">fattest</hi> infants I ever saw in my life! But there was sufficient evidence of <hi rend="italic">poverty</hi> in <hi rend="italic">the house</hi> to justify me in advising Miss Dundas to aid the Husband into the carreer of hawking vegetables in the streets! in which &#x201C;a very good living could be made,&#x201D; the woman said, &#x201C;Many brought up large families comfortably in that way!!&#x201C;&#x2014; I wrote a long account of all the outs and ins of the case, so far as I could make them out by <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> and questioning.

<salute>Dearest Lady Ashburton</salute>
<p>You have seen children building card-houses; as eagerly as if it were houses to live in? and you have seen, at some push against the table, the <hi rend="italic">Houses</hi> become a shower of cards? With just such an absurd suddenness and completeness, did your letter yesterday morning sweep down the schemes of travel, which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and his Doctor-Brother had been building up and hithering and thithering amongst, for the two preceding days&#x2014;to say nothing of my own separate schemes (the fullest liberty to dispose of myself, in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s projected absence, having been accorded me, in the offer of &#x201C;a draft to any amount you choose to specify&#x201C;)!</p>
<p>We were sitting at breakfast, which, to judge from the look of the table, consisted mainly of pocket maps and Bradshaws,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bradshaw&#x2019;s Monthly General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide</hi>.</note> with a supply of which my Brother in law <hi rend="italic">always</hi> surrounds himself; and for the twentieth time D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had just urged on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C that, &#x201C;say what he liked, to sail to <hi rend="italic">Jersey</hi> would be the most feasable thing, <hi rend="small-caps">or</hi> to&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Denmark!</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

I tell you we are going to The Grange&#x201C;! I could <pb id="pg-39-176" n="39:176"/>hardly help laughing, as the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> swept together, in an indignant manner, his aids to locomotion!</p>
<p>&#x201C;And will you afterwards go to Blickling on the 10<hi rend="italic">th?</hi>&#x201D; I asked. &#x201C;Certainly not! how am I to leave my work again on the tenth?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Then what am I to say to Lady Lothian?&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">promised,</hi> you know! and I must answer her letter today&#x201D; &#x201C;Say?&#x2014;Oh!&#x2014;just say every thing that is most courteous!! only making it perfectly clear that we are not coming&#x201C;!!</p>
<p>A pretty difficult problem, that combination! And I had to <hi rend="italic">tell,</hi> we were going to the Grange! And the Lady had politely written to me that if the tenth did not suit us we might choose our own time earlier!&#x2014; I spent a whole hour in poising and wriggling over the note to her! and felt ashamed of it when written!</p>
<p>For the rest, the important rest; we will come on Monday, if we hear nothing to the contrary. And I am sure M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <hi rend="italic">means</hi> to be very <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> and not excite Lord Ashburton with too much or too loud talk, or in any other way! And if he <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> in spite of his intentions; I will take him away on the instant; and I will take your orders in every particular.</p>
<p>Oh dear! how glad I am to be going to the Grange again after all! At <hi rend="italic">one time</hi> I felt to <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> the dear old place in spite of all the good days I had spent at it, and all the kindness I had received there! You know when that time was!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC probably refers to Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s recent illness at The Grange, rather than her earlier distress when TC was overly devoted to Harriet, the previous Lady Ashburton.</note></p>

It was settled, and began to be put in practice this morning, that I breakfast by myself at 9 precise, then to work and do not shew face till 2, or even &#xBD; past 3 (if I <hi rend="italic">decline</hi> lunch<hi rend="italic">n</hi>):&#x2014;in short, I have a fair chance; and all is going right.

I stript instantly &#x26;c &#x26;c, and it did me no ill at all. Today I had a small snatch of walking ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> breakfast time; intending another ride at 3.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am just returned from a long walk, longer than <hi rend="italic">my</hi> choice w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been; and doubt I have hardly a minute of time now available for post!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-179" n="39:179"/>I got all your three Notes,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> two together; the last unit this morning.

Carlyle replied, <date when="1863-08-31">31 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Thanks for your kind note of last night. &#x2026; I have gone too far to recede, &#x26; so I must start tomorrow morning, Let us hope that we may soon meet again, though there is no immediate prospect of meeting. I feel rather melancholy here in the solitude &#x26; with the new servants, &#x26; have nothing more to do in London.&#x201D; He wrote again later in the day: &#x201C;I start tomorrow at 11.20 a.m. &#x26; expect to get to Northwich a little before 5 p.m. &#x2026; then go on to Bury to stay over Friday. I also have an invitation to York from a Lady &#x2026; whom I knew long ago in Italy; but I have not decidedly accepted it, for I rather feel afraid of going into strange houses. So I may perhaps go on to Dumfries by some of the Saturday trains, &#x26; get done with moving for a time. Had I felt sure of your returning to Chelsea within any reasonable time I might have waited, as I have plenty to do with my Icelandic &#x26;c. But it is clearly necessary for you to get as much of the country air &#x26; quiet as possible after your long struggles; &#x26; there must be something to strengthen you in the very presence of such kind &#x26; good people as you are with.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; This Wen[c]kstern Pamphlet is still not the right one!

We have a <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> such as cannot be surpassed; and everybody is as <hi rend="italic">good</hi> as gold!&#x2014; I will write no more at present, for good reasons.

<p><salute>My dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>I will not disappoint myself this day again, but actually write you a little word of news from my rustication, instead of mere intending and ever anew intending to do it. Strange how one&#x2019;s day is <hi rend="italic">condemned</hi> even here; just as in Chelsea, always filled with one poor demand or another! Indeed you are to understand that I am &#x201C;working&#x201D; here (what is called <hi rend="italic">working,</hi> tho&#x2019; alas too flatteringly); and that I do continue absolutely private till 2 p.m. every day; &#x26; by dint of great exertion and care continual, save to myself some 4 clear hours out of the 24,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, alas, in the foreign element, the &#x201C;work&#x201D; got done is of course still more <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> than in my own garret, where it is bad enough for most part.</p>
<p>We are a very small party; no stranger here but one pleasant Lady of our <pb id="pg-39-181" n="39:181"/>acquaintance,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Caroline Davenport Bromley.</note> and ourselves two: Lord A. keeps mainly in his own room; comes out for ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 hours in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (when I am set to read,&#x2014;from <hi rend="italic">vol IV of Friedrich,</hi> in late times): I generally go in and pay him a little visit between 2 and 3 in the afternoon before going out to ride. He is very weak, hardly able to walk at all, but is wonderfully cheerful, &#x26; seems to have some fund of vitality wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is really singular: the Doctor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Quain.</note> who attends is confident of good results if care be taken. Jane has set them upon a scheme of her Father&#x2019;s (a &#x201C;spring-deal,&#x201D; long plank upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Patient is seated in a chair, and gently shaken for a couple of hours,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 120&#x2013;21. Closing parenthesis omitted.</note> when the weather does not permit out-of-doors driving.&#x2014; To us everybody is <hi rend="italic">extreme</hi> in kindness; not too little of it, but, if there be a fault, too <hi rend="italic">much.</hi></p>
<p>The best circumstance for me is that I get a beautiful and swift ride every afternoon; ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 hours of it or more, thro&#x2019; green lanes, green downs, in quiet pleasant places; a great contrast to the roaring jumble of London &#x26; its stony thoroughfares. I sleep rather well;&#x2014;and I wish poor Jane did so too; but she does not seem to reap any profit in the health way, as I am pretty confid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I do.&#x2014; We think of setting off for <hi rend="italic">home</hi> next Monday: 3 weeks good; the very <hi rend="italic">interruption</hi> to old ways for so long will have a tendency to benefit.</p>
<p>John staid in Chelsea only a week behind us. I was very sorry to leave him; sorry to hear that he was gone. He wrote from Cheshire or thereab<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> more than once; I did send a <hi rend="italic">Newspaper;</hi> but he is now gone somewhere ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> York, &#x26; I do not know the Address. He expected to be back with you very shortly; perhaps <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there by this time? A word from him, or from you (if I had any right to ask such a thing) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> be welcome. To Chelsea, if <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Saturday. <closer><salute>God bless you, dear Sister. Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

But there have always been bright intervals; and the <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> itself has been something quasi-divine to me, after such a dose of uproars.</p>
<p>I have almost daily tried a little working, too; but cannot boast to have made much of that. What makes me write today is to give you warning that the <hi rend="italic">Un</hi>copied Ms. wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I wanted, and want earnestly to see soon <hi rend="italic">copied,</hi> is lying all in a state for being started with in case I had heard of you <hi rend="italic">before</hi> this: Copier&#x2019;s Address,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Bishop; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631020-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, [<date when="1863-10-20">20 Oct.</date>]</ref> (both letters of that date); unidentified further.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c everything is lying wrapt in a Parcel to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Address; but it is, of course, useless to stir in that or anything cognate till after <hi rend="italic">Monday Evg</hi> at soonest.</p>
<p>I want several things, I mean the <hi rend="italic">disinterment</hi> of sev<hi rend="italic">l</hi> things, from the Catacombs of distracted Preuss;&#x2014;e.g. these three:</p>
<p>1<hi rend="italic">&#xB0;.</hi> That story of the <hi rend="italic">Parson</hi> admitted to break Fr<hi rend="italic">h&#x2019;s</hi> rest when he was expecting news of some vital milit<hi rend="italic">y</hi> operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in the distance.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC asked Neuberg previously to find this anecdote; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600207-TC-JN-01"><sic>36:62</sic><corr>TC to JN, [<date when="1860-02-07">7 Feb. 1860</date>]</corr></ref>; presumably untraced as it did not appear in <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note></p>

For the anecdote, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:32&#x2013;33.</note></p>
<p>3&#xB0; The incid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Fr<hi rend="italic">h&#x2019;s</hi> ordering his Page, in a street crowd assembled to read some Placard ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> him, &#x201C;The thing is far too <hi rend="italic">high;</hi> bring it down to a level with the people&#x2019;s eyesight!&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:30.</note>
 Not one of these can I extort from that chaotic blockhead, tho&#x2019; I have had them 3 or 4 times before now.</p>
<p>In fact, this last portion of my Task, with Larkin and everybody falling away, and my own poor strength on the edge of doing the like, is generally horrible and frightful to me;&#x2014;and I very much need a shove from one who has never yet wearied of helping me. <hi rend="italic">On</hi> Monday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (not likely!)&#x2014;or the sooner after it, the <hi rend="italic">better.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter, this morning; two of Jean&#x2019;s in succession; for wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> as for yours of this day and of former days, my thanks to the respective Authors. I followed you, with at least a newspaper, to the last distinct address on your progress northward; after that I had to wait till your anchorage at Dumfries, where I am glad to find you arrived, and hope you may rest y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self a while. The Notes you sent to The Grange were abundantly welcome; that written in pencil from the Euston-square Station was quite interesting: I read the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Think and Smoke Tobacco</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

Many varied theories were put forward as to its origins, and alternate wordings given. The version given by John Carlyle is closest to the one given by Ralph Erskine (<date when="1686-00-00">1686</date>&#x2013;<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8871"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), minister and poet, entitled &#x201C;Smoking Spiritualized,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Gospel Sonnets; or Spiritual Songs,</hi> 9th edn. (Glasgow <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>) xxii&#x2014;xxiv, where he calls it &#x201C;an old Meditation upon smoking Tobacco.&#x201D; The poem&#x2019;s first recorded appearance was in Thomas Jenner&#x2019;s collection, <hi rend="italic">The Soules Solace, or Thirtie and One Spirituall Emblems</hi> (<date when="1626-00-00">1626</date>); as each stanza ended &#x201C;Thus thinke, then drinke <hi rend="italic">Tobacco,</hi>&#x201D; the poem was followed by a riposte: &#x201C;answered by G.W. thus &#x2F; Thus thinke, drink no <hi rend="italic">Tobacco.</hi>&#x201D; G.W. is presumed to be George Wither (<date when="1588-00-00">1588</date>&#x2013;<date when="1667-00-00">1667</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29804"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and satirist; some attributed the poem to Wither, although it is untraced in his published works.</note> (or Chorley would, if I had time to tell him); and then <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> who the Author was?&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-184" n="39:184"/>We got home on Monday night; all right,&#x2014;except that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> room was <hi rend="italic">empty,</hi> and instead of &#x201C;The Doctor&#x201D; in my peculiar garret there was nothing but a very nice old pair of <hi rend="italic">Surgeon&#x2019;s Scissors</hi> said to be his:&#x2014;tell me if I can send them by post or how. <hi rend="small-caps">And,</hi> <hi rend="italic">&#xE0; propos</hi> of sending, please tell Jean to do as she says with the <hi rend="italic">clart</hi> of <hi rend="italic">cranberries;</hi> nothing else is feasible: and not to bother ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sending them unless a chance occur.</p>
<p>For the last 3 or 4 days I had quite given up &#x201C;working&#x201D; as I was pleased to call it; and employed myself in lounging ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the woody solitudes, and sauntering up and down on horseback or afoot, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I supposed might be at least a not <hi rend="italic">more</hi> imaginary investment of time than the other! I know not whether I am anything improved in health or not: but at least it is a break; and I suppose will prove to have been a <hi rend="italic">rest,</hi> or the nearest we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to that. Lord A. is as weak as water for any muscular exertion; but he has a great deal of vitality in various other forms; perfectly alert in mind for one thing: his Doctors sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hope well of him. Christison, I rather think, will come back thro&#x2019; the winter. Jane (and the Farm carpenter) mounted up a beautiful &#x201C;Spring Deal&#x201D; (plank 20 feet long, resting on cylinders, with a chair fixed on it; has a motion soft as air,&#x2014;and old contrivance of her <hi rend="small-caps">f</hi>ather&#x2019;s) for the sick man: we all trust The Grange may prove a far better lodging thro&#x2019; this winter than Paris, on failure of Nice, did last!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons were on their way to Nice when Lord Ashburton fell ill, and they remained in Paris.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> hard to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> in earnest ag<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> but am <hi rend="italic">sweer;</hi> oh nobody can say how <hi rend="italic">sweer,</hi> how utterly done out and lazy! I shall be happier &#x26; livelier, when I do get into the journey pace ag<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> &#x26; <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> my old spavined bones!

<p>How absurd of you, my dearest Mary, to make so many apologies about a trifling request like that! Why; if you had asked for twenty autographs; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <pb id="pg-39-186" n="39:186"/>could have written them in twenty minutes, and would have written them for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with pleasure. Certainly, my Dear, as I have often said before, <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> is not your strong point!</p>
<p>Well, we have done our &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">outing</hi>&#x201D; (as the people here call going into the country); and it is all the &#x201C;outing&#x201D; we are likely to do till next summer (if we live to see next summer) unless Lord Ashburton should be well enough, and myself well enough to make another expedition to The Grange during the Winter. I had some idea of going to Folkstone, where Miss Davenport Bromley has a house at present, and pressed me to come and take some tepid seawater baths&#x2014;but my experience of the wretchedness of being from home, with this devilry in my arm, has decided me to remain stationary, for the present. In spite of the fine air and beauty of The Grange, and Lady Ashburtons superhuman kindness, I had no enjoyment of anything, all the three weeks we staid; being in constant pain, day and night; and not able to comb my own hair, or do anything in which a <hi rend="italic">left</hi> arm is needed as well as a right one! I think I told you I had had pain more or less in my left arm for two months before I left London. It was trifling in the beginning; indeed nothing to speak of, when I did not move it <hi rend="italic">backwards</hi> or <hi rend="italic">upwards.</hi> I did not think it worth sending for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes about at first, and latterly, he was away at the seaside for some weeks, having been ill himself. There was nobody else I liked to consult. Besides I always flatter myself that anything that ails me more than usual is sure to be removed by change of scene; so I <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> on, in hope that so soon as I got to The Grange the arm would come all right. It did quite the reverse however, for it became worse and worse, and I was driven at last to consult D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain, when he came down to see Lord A. He told me, before I had spoken a dozen words, that it wasn&#x2019;t rheumatism I had got but neuralgia (if any good Christian would explain to me the difference between these two things I should feel edified and grateful!)  It had been produced he said by extreme weakness; and that I must be stronger before any impression could be made on it. Could I take quinine? I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;I would try&#x2014;so he sent me quinine pills from London to be taken twice a day if they gave me no headache, which they dont do&#x2014;and an embrocation of opium, aconite, camphor, and chloroform (I tell you all this that you may ask <hi rend="italic">your</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> if he thinks it right, or can suggest anything else) moreover, I was to take castor oil every two or three days. I have been following these directions for a fortnight; and there is certainly an improvement in my general health. I feel less cowardly and less fanciful, and feel less disgust at human food; but tho&#x2019; the embrocation relieves the pain while I am applying it and for a few minutes after, it is as stiff and painful as ever when left to itself.

    <salute>Dear Maria</salute>
    <p>I will not delay answering your letter until I can &#x0201C;tell you that my arm is better.&#x0201D; For <hi rend="italic">that</hi> may be a long time off&#x02014;if ever!

That&#x02019;s all!</p>
    <p>I was glad of your letter&#x02014;very glad, at this distance of Time and Space, as I used to be, when living in the same House together, you would, after quarrel with me, longer or shorter, valiantly shake &#x0201C;the Black Dog&#x0201D; off your Back, and &#x0201C;come to me and be <hi rend="italic">good.</hi>&#x0201D;</p>
    <p>When a Person, I have once loved and thought loved me, has turned against me in unkindness or seemed to do so; I cannot, as I see some wiser people do, just be done with that person and think no more about it! Years may pass, and still the old liking, the old disappointment and regret will turn up in my mind from time to time; with the same feeling of smart, and the same hurt to my faith in human nature! and so Maria, Dear, I am very glad that my latest remembrance of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> is, that, after all, you &#x0201C;came to me and were <hi rend="italic">good!</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">For the recent visit of Maria and Ann Chamberlayne to see JWC while she was staying at The Grange, see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630916-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-09-16">16 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> (as we say to Children!)</p>

<salute>Dearest Lady</salute>
<p>When I wrote yesterday I was expecting a Lady&#x2019;s maid who had called at ten in the morning, from the Coram Street Office,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No Servants&#x2019; Registry listed in either Great Coram St. or Little Coram St.; the nearest was the Central Servants&#x2019; Home &#x26; Register Office, 51 Southampton Row, nr. Russell Sq.</note> to return in the evening; as she had engaged to do, of her own accord. As she did not come, I infer she engaged herself elsewhere, and did not think it worth while to keep her word; tho she had <hi rend="italic">insisted</hi> on coming back to tell me, whether she accepted another situation she was then going after or not.&#x2014; She was not particularly prepossessing in appearance&#x2014;still she was a feasable looking woman enough. and as she had been, at one time with Lady Charlotte Howard, the Sister of Lady Arabella Baring<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Howard (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>); her sister, Arabella Georgina, b.

And then she volunteered to return, and tell me whether she had engaged herself or not.

<p>Yesterday afternoon came an Upper-Housemaid from Bond Street.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Household Servants&#x2019; Institution and Select Registry, 44 New Bond St.</note> There could be no objections to this one on the score of want of <hi rend="italic">weight&#x2014;physical</hi> at least!

<p>afternoon</p>
<p>A letter from the misgiven Lady&#x2019;s-Maid of yesterday. which would disgrace a third house-maid! Best that the writer of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> note &#x201C;engaged&#x201D; elsewhere without giving more bother!</p>
<p>There has just been here, bringing your note to her, a Swiss Lady&#x2019;s-Maid, called Mary Guignard.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Marie Julie Guignard (b. <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>), Marie Louise Guignard (b. <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>), or Marie Zelie Guignard (b. <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note> She has been in England ten or eleven years, speaks good English, is <hi rend="italic">six feet high!</hi> has good written characters to show from several Ladies she has lived with&#x2014;two years&#x2014;three years&#x2014;eighteen months. &#x2014; her last situation she left in six-months, &#x201C;it was <hi rend="italic">impossible,</hi> tho&#x2019; they gave higher wages than she had ever had, to stay in such a House! such quarrelling day and night, and drinking!&#x201D; It was with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bingham who was a nice gentleman himself, but had married strangely.&#x201C;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both unidentified further.</note> If you don&#x2019;t mind being <hi rend="italic">towered over</hi> by a <hi rend="italic">Giantess,</hi> you had better <hi rend="italic">see</hi> this woman. She much wishes for a personal interview. Her recommendations are very high&#x2014;if authentic (one never feels to trust implicitely in <hi rend="italic">written</hi> characters). Tho&#x2019; so large she is not unpleasant looking. It is a strong, shrewd, <hi rend="italic">essentially</hi> goodnatured face, tho&#x2019; with a superficial <hi rend="italic">hardness</hi> in it. At least <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is how she strikes <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> She was wearing some Lady&#x2019;s cast off dress which tho black was not in the best taste&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for the streets!</hi> But, on the whole, I doubt if you will find, except thro&#x2019; private recommendation, a person more promising than this Swiss Giantess!&#x2014; Lord A saw her (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">two years ago</hi>&#x201C;; I think she said two or three was it?). She was &#x201C;looked at by him at Bath House and asked a great many questions,&#x201D; and he told her to come back the following week when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would be there; (so he must have considered her not impossible) but before next week she had accepted another situation&#x2014; Does he remember a tall swiss woman? What a pity but you could come up, and see both the large women, and any others  <pb id="pg-39-201" n="39:201"/><pb id="pg-39-202" n="39:202"/>recommended all at once! They could come here to you. and I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> give you some dinner&#x2014;out of the chill, and muddle at Bath House, which is &#x201C;all upset&#x201D; Hanah said yesterday, by the Photographers &#x201C;and, worst of all M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hal?&#x201C;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> (some name I forget.&#x201C;)&#x2014;when the gate was opened a little, I saw a photograph Apparatus and a Statue! and a good deal of what Hanah calls &#x201C;mess&#x201C;</p>
<p>The Swiss said she had been recommended to you at <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dewsbury;<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Thomas Dousbery (b. <date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>), sec. of the New Bond St. Servants&#x2019; Office.</note> and that you took no notice for ten days; and meanwhile she was living at a French Lodging House in Knightsbridge, at considerable expence; and she could not keep herself disengaged beyond a few days&#x2014;if an opportunity of a situation offered.</p>
<p>Do you know anything of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Watson Taylor?<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Hannah Charlotte, b. Hay (d. <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>), m., <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, Simon Watson-Taylor (d. <date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>), of Erlestoke Park, Wiltshire.</note> There is a highly <hi rend="italic">appreciative</hi> letter from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in the Woman&#x2019;s budget<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., the woman&#x2019;s collection of references in her bag.</note>&#x2014;she has with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> three years. The wages she has been used to are twenty four pounds&#x2014;with washing, tea beer &#x26;c or the money for all that. Then she would expect the Lady&#x2019;s left off things which I told her was an arrangement that I (as an <hi rend="italic">individual</hi>) would much dislike. That it would give me the feeling of having an <hi rend="italic">Heir</hi> always at my elbow, waiting eagerly for my diseace! She smiled a rugged smile, and said &#x201C;she was not so greedy as some Lady&#x2019;s Maids were, always telling their Lady, it was time this and the other piece of dress should be left off!&#x201C;</p>
<p>You will get this letter tomorrow morning. <hi rend="italic">Could</hi> you answer by return of Post? either to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> or to the Giantess herself. you have her address? &#x2F; M<hi rend="italic">me</hi> Guignard &#x2F; 6 Park Row &#x2F; Knightsbridge</p>

<p>My poor wife had an ugly accident yesterday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC began his long note about JWC&#x2019;s accident (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:174&#x2013;81), with a summary of JWC&#x2019;s previous suffering and his struggles with <hi rend="italic">Frederick:</hi> &#x201C;Of all these dreary sufferings and miseries, which had been steadily increasing for years past, I perceive now, with pain and remorse, I had never had the least of a clear notion; such her invincible spirit in bearing them, such her constant effort to hide them from me altogether. My own poor existence, as she also well knew, was laden to the utmost pitch of strength, and sunk in perpetual muddy darkness, by a task too heavy for me&#x2014;task which seemed impossible, and as if it would end me instead of I it. I saw no company, had no companion but my horse (fourteen miles a day, winter time, mainly in the dark), rode in all, as I have sometimes counted, above 30,000 miles for health&#x2019;s sake, while writing that unutterable book. The one bright point in my day was from half an hour to twenty minutes&#x2019; talking with her, after my return from those thrice dismal rides, while I sat smoking (on the hearthrug, with my back to the jamb, puffing firewards&#x2014;a rare invention!) and sipping a spoonful of brandy in water, preparatory to the hour of sleep I had before dinner. She, too, the dear and noble soul, seemed to feel that this was the eye of her day, the flower of all her daily endeavour in the world. I found her oftenest stretched on the sofa (close at my right hand, I between her and the fire), her drawing-room and self all in the gracefullest and most perfect order, and waiting with such a welcome; ah, me! ah, me! She was weak, weak, far weaker than I understood; but to me was bright always as stars and diamonds; nay, I should say a kind of cheery sunshine in those otherwise Egyptian days. She had always something cheerful to tell me of (especially if she had been out, or had had visitors): generally something quite pretty to report (in her sprightly, quiet, and ever-genial way). At lowest, nothing of unpleasant was ever heard from her; all that was gloomy she was silent upon, and had strictly hidden away. Once, I remember, years before this, while she suffered under one of her bad influenzas (little known to me how bad), I came in for three successive evenings, full of the &#x2018;Battle of Molwitz&#x2019; (which I had at last got to understand, much to my inward triumph), and talked to her all my half-hour about nothing else. She answered little (&#x2018;speaking not good for me,&#x2019; perhaps); but gave no sign of want of interest&#x2014;nay, perhaps did not quite want it, and yet confessed to me, several years afterwards, her principal thought was, &#x2018;Alas, I shall never see this come to print; I am hastening towards death instead!&#x2019; These were, indeed, dark days for us both, and still darker unknown to us were at hand&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:174&#x2013;75).

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>We have been in trouble here; and still rather are, tho&#x2019; happily it is much abated now. On Tuesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> last, poor Jane, who had been ill-plagued for two months past with a violent pain (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> they call <hi rend="italic">neuralgia</hi>) in her left arm, was just beginning to feel something of improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there, determined heroically to go out and make a visit to a Cousin she has in the City (one Mrs Godby,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Godby.</note> at the big Post-Office Establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> here), &#x26; have at least a ride to and <pb id="pg-39-205" n="39:205"/>from. The ride <hi rend="italic">to,</hi> and the visit, went all well; but on getting into the omnibus for home ag<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> the place being crowded, tumultuous with open excavations &#x26;c, and the maid sent with her being very stupid, Jane had a spring to make out of the way of some cab; the curbstone was slippery;&#x2014;and in short she fell on the flags, full length, on the lame arm too; and got herself terribly flurried, as well as altogether lamed for the time being.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;One evening &#x2026; on my return from riding, I learned rather with satisfaction for her sake that she had ventured on a drive to the General Post Office to see her cousin, Mrs. Godby, &#x2018;matron&#x2019; of that establishment; and would take tea there. After sleep and dinner, I was still without her; &#x2018;Well, well, I thought, what a nice little story will she have to tell me soon!&#x2019; and lay quietly down on the sofa, and comfortably waited&#x2014;still comfortably, though the time (an hour or more) was longer than I had expected. At length came the welcome sound of her wheels; I started up&#x2014;she rather lingered in appearing,&#x2014;I rang, got no clear answer, rushed down, and, oh, what a sight awaited me! She was still in the cab, Larkin speaking to her (Larkin lived next door, and for him she had sent, carefully saving me!) Oh, Heavens! and, alas! Both Larkin and I were needed. She had had a frightful street-accident in St. Martin&#x2019;s, and was now lamed and in agony! This was the account I got by degrees. &#x2F;&#x2F; Mrs. Godby sent a maid-servant out with her to catch an omnibus; maid was stupid, unhelpful, and there happened to be some excavation on the street which did not permit the omnibus to come close. Just as my poor little darling was stepping from the kerbstone to run over (maid merely looking on), a furious cab rushed through the interval; she had to stop spasmodically, then still more spasmodically try to keep from falling flat on the other side, and ruining her poor neuralgic arm. In vain, this latter effort; she did fall, lame arm useless for help, and in the desperate effort she had torn the sinews of the thigh-bone, and was powerless to move or stand, and in pain unspeakable. Larkin and I lifted her into a chair, carried her with all our steadiness (for every shake was misery) up to her bed, where, in a few minutes, the good Barnes, luckily found at home, made appearance with what help there was&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:175&#x2013;77). See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 164&#x2013;67.</note> I have never seen her so beaten as she was for two days following; the pain altogether horrible, not the least movement possible, no sleep, &#x26; all the sad concomitants!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin also gave a detailed description of the episode: &#x201C;On the evening in question, I was sitting quietly at home, when I heard a gentle rap at the door; and was informed that Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s servant wished to speak to me. She told me that Mrs. Carlyle had just been brought home in a cab, seriously hurt by a fall, and begged I would come in at once. I went instantly, and found her on a chair in the back room of the ground floor, evidently in great pain. As soon as she saw me, she said, &#x2018;Oh, Mr. Larkin, do get me up into my own room before Mr. Carlyle knows anything about it. He&#x2019;ll drive me mad if he comes in now!&#x2019; We at once consulted as to how we could best carry her up; when, just as we were about to do it, he entered &#x2026; looking terribly shocked and even angry. I saw he was annoyed at my being there, instead of him; so I said as little as possible, helped him to carry her upstairs, and then left. On the following morning I called to inquire how she was, and found she had given word that I was to be asked to go up and see her. She was full of thanks, and told me it would be a great comfort to her if I would come up every morning for five minutes, as she knew she should often be wanting some little thing done; and pleasantly added, &#x2018;It will be something to look forward to&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 76&#x2013;77).</note> Happily there seems to be no bone broken, nothing wrong to the hip-joint (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I was <pb id="pg-39-206" n="39:206"/>much afraid of): she is now ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> altogether free from pain (in the <hi rend="italic">newly</hi> hurt limb, not at all in the old <hi rend="italic">arm</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than before); and, on condition of lying absolutely still, has the prospect (her Doctor seems to say) of soon being about again,&#x2014;perhaps in a <hi rend="italic">hitching</hi> way for some time longer. She is very content with the immense relief there already is (from unendurable <hi rend="italic">pain</hi>); and we flatter ourselves things will come round to the old pass in a little while, and a great fright and hurly-burly be over.&#x2014; Perhaps James<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son James.</note> told you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this; he was here the other night: you have now, at any rate, the correct particulars.</p>
<p>Tell the Dr I got his Note. He will understand I have not been making brill<hi rend="italic">t progress,</hi> in this sad interim! In fact I am terribly <hi rend="italic">bested</hi> for &#x201C;getting forward&#x201D; here, what with one thing, what with another. Say however that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> getting really under way; and the<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS ends here.</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>I fear you are still unwell; I was on the road to you today, but c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not make it out; such my hurry.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs C. had an ugly accident, Tuesday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> last; <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> on the curbstone, getting into some street-vehicle in a crowded place; and hurt herself very much.

<p><salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,&#x2014;</salute>My Bulletin today again is favourable; things going on well, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> well as we c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> expect. There is nothing of <hi rend="italic">contusion,</hi> nothing of breakage or dislocation, wholly a <hi rend="italic">strain</hi> of the muscles, or sinews (I suppose) in making the violent effort to avoid falling. Will take <hi rend="italic">time,</hi> the Dr says, will take patience;&#x2014;too likely! She has nothing of pain in the limb; and can even lift it with her two hands without the least pain; but let her try to make it lift <hi rend="italic">itself</hi>&#x2014;!&#x2014;She gets daily to the sofa a little while,&#x2014;the great difficulty is in getting <hi rend="italic">in</hi> again. The <hi rend="italic">neuralgia</hi> even was worse for some days; is now ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the old rate; and suffers &#x26; causes much trouble. She <hi rend="italic">eats</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as well or better <pb id="pg-39-208" n="39:208"/>than you saw her do; sleep has never yet reached 4 hours, oftenest ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3,&#x2014;all broken into patches. She is very quiet, clear of head, as &#x201C;patient&#x201D; as the Doctor c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prescribe:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude reported an incident from the first days after the accident, apparently told him by JWC: &#x201C;Carlyle was not allowed to know how seriously she had been injured. The doctor and she both agreed to conceal it from him, and during those first days a small incident happened, which she herself described to me, showing the distracting want of perception which sometimes characterized him&#x2014;a want of perception, not a want of feeling, for no one could have felt more tenderly. The nerves and muscles were completely disabled on the side on which she had fallen, and one effect was that the under jaw had dropped, and that she could not close it. Carlyle always disliked an open mouth; he thought it a sign of foolishness. One morning, when the pain was at its worst, he came into her room, and stood looking at her, leaning on the mantel-piece. &#x2018;Jane,&#x2019; he said presently, &#x2018;ye had better shut your mouth.&#x2019; She tried to tell him that she could not. &#x2018;Jane,&#x2019; he began again, &#x2018;ye&#x2019;ll find yourself in a more compact and pious frame of mind, if ye shut your mouth.&#x2019; In old-fashioned and, in him, perfectly sincere phraseology he told her that she ought to be thankful that the accident was no worse. Mrs. Carlyle hated cant as heartily as he, and to her, in her sore state of mind and body, such words had a flavour of cant in them. True herself as steel, she would not bear it. &#x2018;Thankful!&#x2019; she said to him; &#x2018;thankful for what? for having been thrown down in the street when I had gone on an errand of charity? for being disabled, crushed, made to suffer in this way? I am not thankful, and I will not say that I am.&#x2019; He left her, saying he was sorry to see her so rebellious&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:271&#x2013;73).</note>
 she bids me tell you &#x201C;she is going on slowly, and&#x201C;&#x2014; Nothing more came from her at that moment!</p>
<p>I supposed, when I wrote last, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were out of bed, and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sore-throat quite conquered. Tell us soon that it is so;&#x2014;and that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> patient<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton.</note> too is doing well</p>
<p>Twisleton is waiting for me; Neuberg has interrupted me for five minutes: I am in paper-clippings and confusions to the chin. Ever <closer><salute>y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ladyship&#x2019;s&#x2F;</salute></closer>  <name>T.C.</name></p>

It was wonderful what she had made of that room, by carpenter and housemaid, in a few hours&#x2014;all done in her own image, as I said. On a little table at her right hand, among books and other useful furniture, she gaily pointed out to me a dainty little bottle of champagne, from which, by some leaden article screwed through the cork, and needing only a touch, she could take a spoonful or teaspoonful at any time, without injuring the rest: &#x2018;Is not that pretty? Excellent champagne (Miss Bromley&#x2019;s kind gift), and does me good, I can tell you.&#x2019; I remember this scene well, and that, in the love of gentle and assiduous friends, and their kind little interviews and ministrations, added to the hope she had, her sick room had comparatively an almost happy air, so elegant and beautiful it all was, and her own behaviour in it always was&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:177).</note> &#x201C;Longs for the first blink of daylight&#x201C;&#x2014;ah me!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for these pleasant fruits of the Earth; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are doubly and trebly valuable as proof of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friendly remembrance, kind and unabating tho&#x2019; silent.</p>

<p>I forget if you know German; or have made any real face-to-face acquaintance with Goethe? If not, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seriously recommend you to learn German, for that object, were there no other. Among European Writers or Speakers for the last 200 years, you will find this one, in several import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> respects, to be unique.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This shall salute you on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> first Saturday morning of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Winter, &#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I only heard of from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self yesterday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, Jean not having written. It made me somehow sad: that you too had done with your visitings and bit of rusticat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and recreat<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and home ag<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> to such home as there was.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle had returned to his lodgings at 67 Hanover St., Edinburgh, for the winter.</note> Well, well; it is intrinsically the way with all living men: not <hi rend="italic">opulence</hi> of felicity, but poverty,&#x2014;a poor acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of empty (<hi rend="italic">Pandora</hi>) Boxes, and only <hi rend="italic">work</hi> lying solid at the bottom!&#x2014; I am sorry to hear of Jamie&#x2019;s disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and bafflings with the elements.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably their brother James was having difficulties with the harvest because of weather conditions. The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> reported, <date when="1863-09-29">29 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;[M]uch of the cut grain has been damaged by long exposure; this was evident on Saturday last, and what was not when Sunday&#x2019;s rain came must have suffered severely. Few stooks could stand such a wind, and the sheaves must have been thoroughly redrenched.&#x201C;</note> I suppose he does not need our <hi rend="italic">help:</hi> otherwise&#x2014;?</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s hurt here is clearly getting better. The injury was not to bone or to joint; &#x201C;lacerated sinews,&#x201D; the people call it; and can do nothing for it but leave it absolutely in peace till its own time. The pain is quite gone <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you let it lie; nor is the pain anything like so bad as once on its getting stirred:&#x2014;I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not well think how &#x201C;sinews&#x201D; had got &#x201C;torn&#x201D; by the kind of fall it was, but Jane remembers making an &#x201C;awful effort to save her sore arm&#x201C;; effort wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> failed, and has done most of the mischief. She can now get <hi rend="italic">into</hi> bed as well as <hi rend="italic">out,</hi> by herself with her maids, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a considerable relief: all day she sits on the sofa in her bedroom (often enough &#x201C;receiving&#x201D; there,&#x2014;you never saw such a neat <pb id="pg-39-213" n="39:213"/>place of the size);&#x2014;she has not seen the drawingroom since &#x201C;Tuesday gone a fortnight&#x201C;; nor can I yet guess when she will, I wish we c<hi rend="italic">d!</hi></p>

<p>Be <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to the not too happy Otthenins; patient, what you can: if they are not wise, the more are you bound to be wise for two! My kind regards at any rate; that is always a standing fact.</p>

Wasn&#x2019;t I often thinking of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> all the time? &#x201C;My&#x201D; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> came immediately; and found neither breakage of the leg nor dislocation&#x2014;but the agony of pain he said would have been <hi rend="italic">less</hi> had the bone broken&#x2014; I thought of Elizabeth, and doubted <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> Still for three days and three sleepless nights it was such agony as I had never known before&#x2014; After that the pain went gradually out of the leg unless when I moved it&#x2014;when the bedpan was pushed under me &#x26;c &#x26;c! But the arm with its complication of sprain and neuralgia has given me a sad time&#x2014;till these last two days that it has returned almost to the state it was in before the fall. a week ago M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes made me get out of bed for fear of &#x201C;a bad back&#x201D; and sit <hi rend="italic">on end</hi> on a sofa in my bedroom. like <hi rend="italic">Miss Biffin&#x2014;</hi>(the little egg-shaped woman that used to be <hi rend="italic">shown</hi>)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Biffin or Beffin (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-39/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2368"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), painter of miniatures; born without limbs, she painted with her mouth; she was &#x201C;shown&#x201D; as part of a traveling circus; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570906-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:72&#x2013;74</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-09-06">[6 Sept. 1857]</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and two days ago he compelled me to <hi rend="italic">walk a few steps,</hi> supported with his arms&#x2014;and to do the same thing at least twice a day  It has been a case of what they call &#x201C;lacerated sinews,&#x201D; and he said the tendency of the muscles was to contract themselves after such a thing, and if I did not force myself to put down my foot now and then, I should never be able to walk at all! Such a threat and his determined manner enables me to make the effort which <hi rend="small-caps">costs</hi>! I can tell you  But at whatever cost of pain and nervousness, I have today passed thro&#x2019; the door of my bedroom (which opens into the Drawing room luckily), using one of the maids as a crutch. So you see I am already a good way towards recovery&#x2014;for which I feel every moment deep thankfulness to God&#x2014; To have experienced such agony and to be delivered from it comparatively&#x2014;makes one feel one&#x2019;s dependence as nothing else does!</p>
<p>For the rest as dear Betty<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> is always saying &#x201C;I have mony mercies&#x201C;&#x2014; My Servants have been most kind and unwearied in their attentions&#x2014;my Friends more like Sisters or Mothers than commonplace <hi rend="italic">friends&#x2014;</hi> Oh I shall have such wonderful kindnesses to tell you of when I can write freely&#x2014;my third cousin M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Godby and several others wished to stay with me&#x2014;but the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">nursing</hi>&#x201D; I <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> was of quite a menial sort&#x2014; I should still have sought it from my <hi rend="italic">servants,</hi> and a Lady nurse would only have given <hi rend="italic">them</hi> more to do, and been  <pb id="pg-39-215" n="39:215"/>dreadfully in the way of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;my great object, after getting what <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi> on I absolutely needed has been that the usual quiet routine of the house should not be disturbed around M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;who thinks, I am sure, that <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> has been victimised <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> in having to answer occasional letters of enquiry about me!! And now I must conclude&#x2014;for the present</p>
<p>I am so sorry for poor Robert&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further; possibly a servant rather than a relative; Mary May Craven&#x2019;s father and husband were both named Robert.</note> fingers&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I still write to you in pencil, I have <hi rend="italic">progressed</hi> out of my Bedroom into the Drawing room for most part of the day. A door opens from the one room into the other,&#x2014;luckily for my present disabilities,&#x2014;and as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes told me, I <hi rend="italic">must walk</hi> a few steps every day whether painful or not; otherwise the muscles of my leg would contract and I should never walk at all; I <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> daily from my bedroom into the Drawing room Sofa&#x2014;after a fashion! my <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> arm round Marys neck, and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> arm round my waist. I think there is <hi rend="italic">more nervousness</hi> than <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> in the difficulty with which I make this little journey! For the rest I dont <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> much on my sofa&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">sit&#x2014;on end</hi>&#x2014; I cannot however sit up at a table to write with pen and ink&#x2014;I must write with cushions at my back, and with the paper on my knees&#x2014;in which circumstances a pencil is less fatiguing than pen and ink, as well as less <hi rend="italic">destructive</hi> to my clothes!</p>
<p>The unlucky <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> will in a week or two, I hope, be all right&#x2014; I have no pain whatever in it now, except when I try to use it; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> the pain is not great, and gets daily a trifle less. But my <hi rend="italic">arm</hi> is still a bad business; especially at night, I suffer much from it. It spoils my sleep, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> again reacts upon <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> and makes it worse, I cannot satisfy myself how much of the pain I am now suffering is the effect of the fall, how much [that of]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s addition.</note> the old neuralgia&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes can throw no light on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> for me, or suggest any remedy&#x2014;at least he <hi rend="italic">doesn&#x2019;t!&#x2014;</hi> It seems to me he regards my <hi rend="italic">leg</hi> as <hi rend="italic">his</hi> patient, and my <hi rend="italic">arm</hi> as D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain&#x2019;s patient, which <hi rend="small-caps">He</hi> has nothing to do with! and is rather glad to be irresponsible for; <hi rend="italic">seeing nothing to be done!</hi> He <hi rend="italic">did</hi> once say in a careless way, that <hi rend="italic">plain bark and soda</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cinchona bark, often called Peruvian bark, from which quinine is made, but taken in powdered form with soda water, rather than the purified quinine JWC was already taking. Peruvian bark contains other active substances as well as quinine.</note> &#x201C;one of the most nauseous mixtures he knew of in this world&#x201D; was better than &#x201C;my <hi rend="italic">quinine</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;but when I asked would it have as good an effect on my spirits as the quinine had had, he said &#x201C;Oh I cant <pb id="pg-39-220" n="39:220"/>promise you <hi rend="italic">that!&#x2014;</hi>it would probably make you <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> and <hi rend="italic">low</hi>&#x2014;better keep to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">ladylike</hi> <hi rend="italic">quinine!!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>Ask the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x2019;s husband, Dr. James Russell.</note> if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> sees any superiority in plain bark and soda? I dont care how nauseous a medicine is, if it do me good&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Bishop has been here, with a Sheaf of sparse <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> (poor fellow, a very nice lad, pray <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> him handsomely when he has done&#x2014;i.e. tell me <hi rend="italic">what</hi> to pay him; I really like him well):&#x2014; But, Good Heaven! I find a Sheet (the <hi rend="italic">Larkin</hi> sheet, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you took as specimen) completely wanting; and cannot stir at all till I get it!</p>
<p>For God&#x2019;s sake, get it sent at once; I cannot afford to lose another day. And pardon all the botheration I give you; for really <hi rend="italic">es wird zu arg</hi> [it will be bad]&#x2014;for both of us.</p>

TC&#x2019;s reduction of the causes of the American Civil War to a difference of opinion as to whether labor should be hired by the month, year, or for life, infuriated Wasson, who described himself as a former disciple of TC: &#x201C;&#x2018;Sartor Resartus&#x2019; I read twenty years ago afoot and on horseback, sleeping with it under my pillow and wearing it in my pocket till pocket and it were worn out&#x201D; (502) Wasson angrily condemned TC for his flippant attitudes to slavery: &#x201C;[B]e assured that this is the American Iliad in no other nutshell than your private one,&#x2014;in those too contracted cerebral quarters to which &#x2026; your powerful intelligence, under such prolonged and pitiless extremes of dogmatic compression, has at last got reduced (497) &#x2026; .

<p>The sufferings of a <hi rend="italic">child</hi> are always more painful for me to think of than a grown person&#x2019;s&#x2014;and &#x201C;rheumatic fever&#x201D; must be terrible suffering.

<p>I will tell you all about myself when your mind is relieved from this more pressing anxiety&#x2014;and when my own mind is relieved from it. Enough to say for the moment, that I am going on as well could be expected</p>

<p>Your letter was bit of very <hi rend="italic">real</hi> gladness for me; tho&#x2019; at the same time there was something <hi rend="italic">curiously faraway</hi> about it; like a letter one gets in a dream&#x2014;(if you have any experience of dream-letters)!&#x2014; Here, you see, was a woman whom I dearly care for (<hi rend="italic">Lady&#x2014;</hi>if you prefer it!) and who, I try to believe (with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> success latterly,) cares for <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> writing to me from <hi rend="italic">only</hi> the other end of the same kingdom, in utter ignorance that there had been any <hi rend="italic">solution</hi> of <hi rend="italic">continuity</hi> in my Life between the present time and the time when we had the Cab-meeting in Piccadilly!&#x2014;in utter ignorance of my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">accident</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;whereas all the letters I had received for the last six weeks (except <hi rend="italic">one</hi> the other day, from your Sister, Miss Stanley)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Maude Stanley.</note> had been full of my &#x201C;accident,&#x201D; questions about it, condolences about it, fears and hopes about it!&#x2014;so that I <pb id="pg-39-230" n="39:230"/>have &#x201C;lived and moved (no! there has been no <hi rend="italic">moving!</hi>) and had my being&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>Well! and what was it, the accident? you would like to know. I feel the less reluctance to &#x201C;renew grief&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18611101-JWC-LAI-01"><sic>38:3</sic><corr>JWC to LAI, [<date when="1862-11-01">1 Nov. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note>
 in telling you; as I am now so far recovered that I am past needing to be <hi rend="italic">condoled</hi> with, and the knowledge will entail on you none of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> bother!</p>
<p>Just two or three days after I had that lucky glimpse of you in Piccadilly. I had occasion to be at the <hi rend="italic">General Post Office</hi> &#x201C;There is no such dangerous thoroughfare as <hi rend="italic">St Martin le Grand</hi> in all London,&#x201D; my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> says; so I may be excused for having been flurried in crossing, to get to a Cab; and in such a hurry to find myself safe on the Pavement, that I struck the side of my foot violently against the curb-stone, and was plashed down on my left side on the pavement. I tried to gather myself up, but the agony I was in wouldnt let me. So I had to resign myself to become the Centre of Attraction to a small crowd and to be lifted by two <hi rend="italic">Roughs</hi> and a Policeman, and put into a cab. Then there was five miles of jolting over the stones. not knowing whether my leg and arm were <hi rend="italic">broken</hi>, or what I had done to myself; only that I was in such agony as I had never known before! Then there was the getting me into the House, and up to my bed, which was accomplished by the ingenuity of the Gentleman next door,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Larkin.</note> impeded rather than assisted by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, who was too nervous for anything! Then there was the Doctor&#x2014;who found no bones broken&#x2014;considered it a case of &#x201C;lacerated sinews.&#x201D; Then there were days and nights when I couldnt move so much as an inch on my bed, and couldnt sleep a wink for the terrible pain! and was decidedly very ill off indeed!</p>
<p>After a fortnight I was lifted out of bed and set <hi rend="italic">on end</hi> on a sofa in my bedroom, reminding myself of Miss Biffin!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Biffin; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631013-JWC-GWE-01">JWC to <sic>GW</sic><corr>GWE</corr>, [<date when="1863-10-13">13 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> After another fortnight I was half-carried half-<hi rend="italic">walked</hi> into the Drawing-room. And now, at the end of six weeks since the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Accident,</hi>&#x201D; I can walk accross the floor, by myself, with a stick.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;I was sitting solitary over my dreary Prussian books, as usual, in the drawing-room, perhaps about 10 <hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>, room perhaps (without my knowledge) made trimmer than usual, when suddenly, without warning given, the double door from her bedroom went wide open, and my little darling, all radiant in graceful evening dress, followed by a maid with new lights, came gliding in to me, gently stooping, leaning on a fine Malacca cane, saying <hi rend="italic">silently</hi> but so eloquently, &#x2018;Here am I come back to you, dear!&#x2019; It was among the bright moments of my life&#x2014;the picture of it still vivid with me, and will always be. Till now I had not seen her in the drawing-room, had only heard of those tentative pilgrimings thither with her maid for support. But now I considered the victory as good as won, and everything fallen into its old course again or a better. Blind that we were! This was but a gleam of sunlight, and ended swiftly in a far blacker storm of miseries than ever before&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:177&#x2013;78).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-231" n="39:231"/>But I cannot sit up at a table to write with pen and ink. I write with the paper on my knees, and cushions at my back&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">ergo&#x2014;</hi>in pencil. For while the leg has been gradually mending&#x2014;faster than could have been hoped; the sprained arm has been tormented by rheumatism (<hi rend="italic">neuralgia</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain called it. but no Doctor nor &#x201C;plain human cretur&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511222-JWC-KS-01"><sic>26:278&#x2013;79</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1851-12-22">[22 Dec. 1851]</date></corr></ref>. Closing parenthesis omitted.</note> ever explained yet to my satisfaction the difference between <hi rend="italic">Rheumatism</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Neuralgia. That</hi> is now my worst grievance  But I have got a new prescription for it, which I really think is doing it good.</p>
<p>Have you gone to sleep yet over this long story? Don&#x2019;t please till I have told you further that nothing could exceed the kindness of my friends! My servants too have been most kind and attentive.</p>
<p>You once said to me of Miss Davenport Bromley you couldnt understand my liking for her. I will tell you one thing to show you what sort of a <hi rend="italic">Friend</hi> she can be. Shortly before my accident I had had a letter from her pressing me to come to her at Folkestone where she had a house for two months. This letter being still unanswered I begged M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to write and tell her what had befallen me. This was some five days after I had been put to bed.</p>
<p>The day after his letter, she appeared at my bedside! looking so agitated and so kind! I shall never forget her look: she &#x201C;couldnt sleep after getting the letter, she said, for thinking about me; and just came up by the first Train in the morning! When I said; &#x201C;came all that way on purpose to see <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>&#x201D; she answered with tears in her eyes; &#x201C;Oh! if it had been twice the distance, dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, I should have come all the same; I was so unhappy about you!&#x201D; She hadn&#x2019;t even her own house in Town<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Davenport Bromleys&#x2019; London house was 32 Grosvenor St.; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630501-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-05-01">1 May</date></ref>.</note> to go to, It was all being painted. So she had bespoken a bed at M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Vivian&#x2019;s<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mrs. Vivian, 14 Devonshire Ter., Bayswater, or Mrs. Sarah Vivian, 7 Belgrave Sq.</note> on her way here. Next morning she was here again soon after ten, and staid till just time to return by the one o&#x2019;clock train to Folkestone, <hi rend="italic">where she had left visitors in her House!</hi> Will you ever ask me again why I like <hi rend="italic">Her?</hi> And Lady William Russell&#x2014;such adorably kind little letters she has written me&#x2014;and sent Arthur or Odo<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady William Russell&#x2019;s two younger sons, Arthur John Edward and Odo Leopold William Russell.</note> every two or three days to ask about me&#x2014; And Lady Ashburton! such endless flowers and grapes and things she has showe[r]ed about me! And she too offered &#x201C;to <pb id="pg-39-232" n="39:232"/>come up&#x201D; if it would be any comfort to have her beside me&#x201C;! and E[v]erybody!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC omitted &#x201C;r&#x201D; in &#x201C;showe[r]ed&#x201D; and &#x201C;v&#x201D; in &#x201C;E[v]erybody.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; I declare it makes me <hi rend="italic">like to cry</hi> to think over it all.</p>
<p>There! I never wrote you such an egoistic letter before. and I wont do it again.</p>
<p>What on earth is the meaning of this absurd scandal about Lord Palmerston? Surely it must be either a political conspiracy or an attempt to extort money!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Palmerston was named, <date when="1863-10-19">19 Oct. 1863</date>, as corespondent in a divorce case brought by Timothy Joseph O&#x2019;Kane (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>), an Irish radical journalist.

<p>The very <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of your letter was a relief to me; for I knew that unless dear Jackie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John (Jackie) Welsh; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631027-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, [<date when="1863-10-27">27 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> had been a little better you couldn&#x2019;t have written as much!</p>
<p>Next time <hi rend="italic">do</hi> write a mere bulletin, or I cant press you to &#x201C;be quick&#x201C;!</p>
<p>From the account you give, I draw far better hope about him than I dare <pb id="pg-39-233" n="39:233"/>say you meant to give in writing it. But there seems to be so much <hi rend="italic">vitality</hi> in the poor little fellow&#x2014;his caring to be read to&#x2014;his little speech&#x2014;all that sounds as if there were a good basis of Life at the bottom of all this illness. God grant he may soon be pronounced convalescent! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> convalescent! I can move about the room, with a stick&#x2014;and the pain in my arm has been considerably less for the past few days&#x2014;when I make no attempt to <hi rend="italic">move</hi> it more than it likes. I attribute the improvement to a new medecine recommended to me by C&#x2019;s friend M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Foxton,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick J. Foxton.</note> who had been cured by it. Before taking it I asked the advice of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston at St Leonards (Bessey&#x2019;s Husband&#x2014;a man of real ability) and he sent me a proper prescription and directions about using it. It is called <hi rend="italic">Iodite of Potash</hi> and is taken with quantities of fluid&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">along with it</hi> have to be taken pills of <hi rend="italic">Valeriate of Quinine If it cures me,</hi> and you ever need curing you shall have the prescription</p>
<p>In the beginning of this arm-business&#x2014;some <hi rend="italic">four months</hi> ago now, I fancied I had given my arm an unconscious sprain; as the pain in attempting to move it <hi rend="italic">preceded</hi> any aching or <hi rend="italic">shooting,</hi> independent of attempting to move it&#x2014; The Doctor persuaded me &#x201C;it was all neuralgia&#x201C;&#x2014; Since my accident that <hi rend="italic">sprained</hi> feeling has been <hi rend="italic">dreadful,</hi> till within the last few days&#x2014;and tho M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes always declared &#x201C;it was all rheumatism,&#x201D; it has been impossible to persuade <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> that the same blow received on my shoulder and hipjoint at the same time, and damaging the sinews in my <hi rend="italic">thigh</hi> would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> damage the sinews in my <hi rend="italic">arm</hi> also&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">That</hi> stands to reason&#x201D; (as old Helen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell, the Carlyles&#x2019; maid <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date> and <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>.</note> used to say) Of course if rheumatism is <hi rend="italic">about</hi> in one it will gather to any strained part&#x2014;and so there <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been plenty of rheumatic pain besides the pain from the hurt&#x2014; But I am certain it is <hi rend="small-caps">more</hi> than Rheumatism that hinders me from lifting my arm&#x2014;and having a faculty of remembering things long after date&#x2014;I remembered the other day that I took to using the <hi rend="italic">dumbbells</hi> for two or three days, to make myself stronger <hi rend="italic">par vive force</hi> [by main force], when I was feeling so weak and ill early in summer (It must have been just before I noticed the stiffness of my arm)&#x2014;and that I left them off because my arms felt too weak to use them and ached after&#x2014; It would be a comfort to my weak mind to be assured that I there and then <hi rend="italic">sprained some sinew in my arm&#x2014;</hi>and all the rest would then have followed in the course of nature&#x2014;and I might give up vague terrors about <hi rend="italic">angina pectoris paralysis</hi> disease of the spine &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c!!!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC omitted commas between &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">angina pectoris,</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">paralysis,</hi>&#x201D; and &#x201C;disease of the spine, &#x26;c.&#x201C;</note> Best stop <closer><salute>Yours affectionately</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Darling!</salute>
<p>I am so thankful that you are all right! And to think of you writing on the third day after your confinement the most legible&#x2014;indeed the only <hi rend="italic">legible</hi> note I ever had from you in my life!!</p>
<p>Now, about this compliment offered me, which you are pleased to call a &#x2018;favour&#x2019; (to you)&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t know what to say! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wish I could go and talk it over, but even if [I]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted by JWC.</note> <hi rend="italic">could</hi> go in a cab one of these next dry days I couldnt drive up your stairs in a cab!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I should be greatly pleased that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> baby bore a name of mine<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Simmondses wanted to call their da. Jane; she was named Ethel Jane Carlyle Simmonds.</note>&#x2014;But the &#x2018;godmother&#x2019;hood?? There seems to me <hi rend="italic">one</hi> objection to <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> which is a fatal one&#x2014;I dont belong to the English Church and the Scotch Church which I do belong to recognises no Godfathers and Godmothers! The <hi rend="italic">Father</hi> takes all the obligations on himself&#x2014;(serves him right!) I was present at a Church of England Christening for <hi rend="italic">the first time</hi> when the Blunts took me to see <hi rend="italic">their</hi> Baby christened<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gerald and Frances Blunt and Elaine Mary Blunt, b. <date when="1862-04-07">7 April 1862</date>.</note>&#x2014;and it looked to me a very solemn piece of work!&#x2014;and that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Maurice<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev.

A mere <hi rend="italic">form?</hi> that is, a piece of humbug!&#x2014; How could I in cold blood go thro with a ceremony, in a <hi rend="italic">Church,</hi> to which neither the others nor myself attach a grain of veracity? If you can say anything to the purpose, I am very <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> to be proved mistaken&#x2014;and in that case very willing to stand Godmother to a Baby that on the third day is not at all <hi rend="italic">red!!!</hi></p>

<p>As all I am up to yet, in the way of locomotion, is limping thro&#x2019; my bedroom door into the Drawingroom, with help of a stick; I cannot <hi rend="italic">run away</hi> from any troubles or anxieties I may happen to have, or <hi rend="italic">walk them down</hi> as I used to do&#x2014; So in these last days my anxieties about yourself and Baby have tormented me not a little: the more, that I didn&#x2019;t even know <hi rend="italic">where</hi> to address to you or M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie a request for news. Thanks to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Christisons prompt answer to all my questions, and some more, I now know that you are all safe at the Grange again, and that altho neither you nor Baby have derived the benifit from your change of air which one had hoped for you; neither of you are absolutely laid up; and that Lord Ashburton is wonderfully improved. God be thanked for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> anyhow! I am so glad M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie is with you again; she looks as if she would be such a kind and energetic Helper under trouble. And that she has capital sense about Babies&#x2014;at least about a Baby whom she has at heart, is proved by the condition in which she brought your Darling back to you from Nice.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630323-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1863-03-23">23 March</date></ref>.</note></p>

<p>My recollection of that time of <hi rend="italic">looking at</hi> Servants, from which I was so suddenly and painfully cut off, haunts me now in my seclusion with unabated curiosity like the first numbers of a <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;serial&#x201D; Tale</hi> to which I cannot get the conclusion! Bid M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie tell me the conclusion, please! Did the hay-stacky Housemaid&#x2019;s character suit?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Galbraith; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630922-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, [<date when="1863-09-22">22 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> and is she installed at the Grange? and does she please you? Have you got a satisfactory Footman? and what of a <pb id="pg-39-236" n="39:236"/><pb id="pg-39-237" n="39:237"/>Lady&#x2019;s-maid?&#x2014; Among your other vexations at Brighton, you &#x201C;had no nurse&#x201D; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie said, and &#x201C;Jeanie was ill.&#x201D; Is she better? and what did &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no nurse</hi>&#x201D; mean? What had happened to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Corbet?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Bean (b. ca. <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), nursery maid, and Mrs. Corbett, nurse; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621103-JWC-MR-01"><sic>38:256</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-11-03">3 Nov. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>, and Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 91.</note>
 So much of ones comfort depends on one&#x2019;s servants (the more&#x2019;s the pity!) that if I followed the dictates of <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> my next question to anyone dear to me, after asking, &#x201C;how are you?&#x201D; would be what sort of servants have you got&#x201C;?</p>
<p>I inclose a letter which came to me soon after my &#x201C;accident,&#x201D; when I was too bad to think of forwarding it: that you may see what a surprising <hi rend="italic">Gardener</hi> you possess at Melchet!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The gardener (unidentified further) presumably sent a note together with the weekly delivery of fruit from Melchet Court.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh such a <hi rend="italic">consolation</hi> these <hi rend="italic">grapes</hi> have been to me! In the long nights when I couldn&#x2019;t sleep, or was always waking up with the pain, and finding my tongue sticking to the roof of my mouth, then I put out my hand to the little table at my bedside and took a grape or two, and was relieved.</p>
<p>If kindness and help to others could keep any one healthy and happy in this world, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would never have a pain or a sorrow! But the fact is very different from <hi rend="italic">that!</hi></p>
<closer><salute>God keep you and all dear to you! is the constant prayer of your grateful and affectionate</salute></closer>

<p>Oh yes, there it is! I knew it instantly; tho I did not recognise the handwriting of the direction! Thanks Darling! You have given me a pleasant surprise, and a welcome present! tho&#x2019; I cant say I am contented with the photograph <hi rend="italic">as a photograph;</hi> or I should say rather as a <hi rend="italic">picture.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s request for a photograph of Holmhill, and a later photograph of Holmhill, see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610201-JWC-MR-01"><sic>37:109&#x2013;10</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1861-02-00">Feb. 1861</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> The little water-coloured sketch, that is framed and hung up opposite my bed, is much the better <hi rend="italic">picture,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> having the <hi rend="italic">alterations</hi> and more details, and more life-likeness in some of them; as for example the windows, which one almost expects to see your face or the D<hi rend="italic">rs,</hi> looking out of; makes an agreeable supplement to the Sketch. The fault of it is, that it has been taken from a bad point of view,&#x2014;from the under side of the sunk fence and right opposite; which shows the garden or shrubbery as a mere stripe, and almost bare of flowers, and throws a full glare on the white walls that makes them look like paste-board. I wish I had been at the doing of it! When I come&#x2014;if I am spared to come again&#x2014;we must have another view taken! with the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and you in the garden.</p>
<p>They sent me such a wonderful Photograph of Auchtertool Manse<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the photograph of Auchtertool Manse, see 39:frontispiece, available in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the table of contents page for volume 39.</note>&#x2014;exactly like a wood engraving&#x2014;and Walter is leaning back in a garden-chair and Maggie and Mary standing near the outer door&#x2014;the one bare-headed, the other with a hat and feather.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <sic>opp</sic><corr>above</corr>.</note> (That&#x2019;s Mary of course!).<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Welsh, on the left in the photograph, was known for her love of finery; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620605-JWC-MR-01"><sic>38:99</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-06-05">5 June 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> the <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> are scarcely more than half an inch and yet to be recognised at a glance!<figure><graphic url="volume-39-239-25.gif"/><p>Mary, Maggie, and Walter Welsh, Auchtertool Manse (detail)</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>&#x2014; Poor little Jackie in Liverpool has been again at Deaths door from Rheumatic fever. He returned from Fife so well seemingly and in a week or two was taken with this malady for the second time. From the accounts I receive from Maggie who was sent for to Liverpool to help nurse him, I have no fear but he will get round this time. but he appears to be a very delicate boy, and his Parents who idolize him as their <hi rend="italic">only</hi> Boy have much anxiety before them!</p>
<p>Mary Welsh was prospering at the Manse, as Mistress&#x2014; She always becomes a new creature in point of activity and good humour when Maggie is from home!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620907-JWC-TC-01"><sic>38:197</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-09-07">7 Sept. 1862</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> Pity one of them hadn&#x2019;t been married, and set up in a house of her own!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-39-239" n="39:239"/>I began this letter on Thursday&#x2014;as you may see at the top of the sheet&#x2014; But I have only a short time when writing is manageable&#x2014;between my getting settled down on the Drawing-room Sofa and my two o&#x2019;clock dinner. It is between eleven and twelve, before I have had my breakfast (in bed still) and got myself combed and dressed&#x2014; What I used to do in a quarter of an hour when I had the free use of my two arms and two legs, takes me, now that I have to be assisted, nearer an hour and half!! So the morning slips away. Till two o&#x2019;clock, after I have come into the Drawingroom I may write for most part without interruption. But by the time I have finished dinner or before I have finished people come to call&#x2014;and there is no more peace till long after the general Post hour (half past four)&#x2014;on Thursday I was interrupted by a note from Miss Anstruther begging me in her Mothers name<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Frances Anstruther, and her da. Annie Nairn Anstruther.</note>
 to take the use of <hi rend="italic">their Brougham</hi> instead of driving out in a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fly</hi>&#x201D; as I had spoken of doing. The answer was waited for and was bothering to <hi rend="italic">compose.</hi> How to express myself sufficiently grateful for the offer, and at the same time sufficiently decided to have nothing to do with <hi rend="italic">their</hi> or anybody&#x2019;s Brougham, so long as <hi rend="italic">a Fly</hi> could be hired with my own money?&#x2014; By the time I had satisfied myself with an answer; a Lady who has been very good to me all thro my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">accident</hi>&#x201D; <pb id="pg-39-240" n="39:240"/>came,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mary Godby; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631013-JWC-GWE-01">JWC to <sic>GW</sic><corr>GWE</corr>, [<date when="1863-10-13">13 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> and that was the end of my writing for that day!&#x2014; Next day (Friday) I had a headache&#x2014;not a <hi rend="italic">usual</hi> form of illness with me <hi rend="italic">now&#x2014;</hi>and on Saturday it flashed on me to my dismay that thanks to the outrageous <hi rend="italic">piety</hi> of Thornhill, no letters were allowed to enter there on Sunday&#x2014;and none leaving London on Sunday&#x2014;my thanks must necessarily be delayed till Tuesday morning&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh my Heavens I have been interrupted again. A Lady<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> is here!</p>

I hoped to have written today with more deliberat<hi rend="italic">n,&#x2014;</hi>for I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> at last <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the horrible <hi rend="italic">pluister</hi> of that poor blubber of a young man&#x2019;s &#x201C;Copy&#x201D; so-called, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he made <pb id="pg-39-243" n="39:243"/>under the eye of (perfidious) Neuberg! N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> keeps out of my way ever since: but I have asked him for Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> a poor <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> dog, and capable of infinite service with the wild Hill-<hi rend="italic">sheep;</hi> tho&#x2019; occasionally napping; his &#x201C;brain&#x201D; threat<hi rend="italic">g</hi> &#x201C;to soften&#x201D; (shocking to consider!):&#x2014;and indeed he is quite preoccupied with his &#x201C;new House&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had recently moved to Roslyn Park in Hampstead.</note> at pres<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> &#x26; the shrubberies &#x26; the &#x26;c&#x2019;s there!&#x2014; By degrees, one <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be independ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of such Officials, Oh Heaven&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">blind unwilling</hi> Horses to be driven over Bridges with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> parapet!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are in tolerable health here; Jane, who has now been pris<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 7 weeks, actually seems to thrive <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than when she was forcing herself out every day: &#x201C;Returned so utterly done out; joints like to fall in pieces, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and meat or drink a mere disgust&#x201C;&#x2014;she actually sleeps better, eats better, &#x26; is cheerfuller than formerly. For perhaps 3 weeks past she has been hitching ab<hi rend="italic">t;&#x2014;</hi>walks with your <hi rend="italic">Nithsdale nibbie</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had become fond of, and taken to, but gave up to her <hi rend="italic">pro temp</hi>e [protempore: for the time being]), she can walk too, but slowly, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stick: in short, she is doing well enough. As indeed am I;&#x2014;and have need to be, as you shall now hear!</p>
<p>For months back I have been revolving the Quest<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> but within the last few days (while winding up that &#x201C;Copy&#x201C;), it has become frightfully probable that in &#x201C;vol <hi rend="italic">V</hi>&#x201D; (with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> making it a <hi rend="italic">monster</hi>) there actually will not be any room for my &#x201C;Book 21&#xB0;,&#x201D; suming<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Line over <hi rend="italic">m</hi> indicating <hi rend="italic">doubled letter.</hi></note> up 23 years of Fr<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> Life!&#x2014; So I believe it will at last turn out. Robson is <hi rend="italic">counting all</hi> that I have of any available kind: I will let it swell out as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> likes;&#x2014;I believe it will move easily heavier to the size of a Vol. than be <hi rend="italic">squeezed down</hi> to that of &#x201C;a Book.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Ay de mi;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> but Courage!</p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>I have no time to write you a nice long letter today&#x2014;neither time nor composure of mind (you shall hear why)&#x2014;yet it is better not to wait till tomorrow to set your mind at rest as to the safety of your &#x201C;tub.&#x201D; I was very much puzzled to <pb id="pg-39-246" n="39:246"/>guess what it could mean, when Mary rushed up with a look of importance to say &#x201C;if you please mam there&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">a tub!!</hi>&#x201D; It was a very welcome solution to find the &#x2018;tub&#x2019; was not an empty one but contained both butter and fowls&#x2014; Thank you heartily dear little Woman! It is no novelty to receive a kindness from <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> but no amount of use and wont makes the kindness less thought of!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said when I told him, &#x201C;are there any eggs?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Would you have had anybody in their senses pack eggs with a can of butter, and fowls&#x201C;? I asked,&#x2014;&#x201C;Ah! well! butter and fowls are excellent things in their way! but it is a devil of a pity that in all London a man can&#x2019;t command a fresh egg at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> price!&#x201C;&#x2014; Ill used individual! He has not been without a new-laid egg to his breakfast for the last eight months!&#x2014;only a week ago the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> laying hen in the neighbourhood struck work&#x2014;and he prefered going upon <hi rend="italic">bacon</hi> to risking the shop eggs!&#x2014; I said I would ask you to send some&#x2014;tho&#x2019; upon my life I am ashamed to look so greedy!&#x2014; But I am not able in my present lamed condition to make a crusade after fresh eggs in my own person&#x2014;and servants never can <hi rend="italic">find</hi> anything!&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I come to the reason why I am hurried and flurried today&#x2014; You would hear all about my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">accident</hi>&#x201D; of course&#x2014;but possible you may not know that I never since have got beyond my bedroom and the Drawingroom which it opens into. <hi rend="italic">Two months</hi> past yesterday has this imprisonment lasted! I have not felt it grievous, I was so thankful when the terrible agony I was in at the begin[ning]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote &#x201C;begin.&#x201C;</note> subsided into bearable and fitful pain&#x2014;and the weather being very cold latterly, when I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have gone out <hi rend="italic">in a carriage,</hi> had there been anything to gain by it, besides an increase of rheumatism; I have made no exertion to <hi rend="italic">go out,</hi> and none has been forced on me&#x2014; But just now it is a summer temperature,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1863-11-25">25 Nov.</date>, that during the previous week the &#x201C;mean daily temperature was considerably above the average.&#x201C;</note> and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, with his life-long fixed idea about &#x201C;out-of-doors <hi rend="italic">exercise,</hi>&#x201D; will leave me no rest till I have &#x201C;taken a ride in a <hi rend="italic">Fly</hi>&#x201D; (a Fly being the name of a close hired carriage here)&#x2014;and the Fly is coming in half an hour! and I am to get down the stairs! and the door-steps! and into it! I dont well know how! and I am so nervous! Oh <hi rend="italic">so</hi> nervous as nobody that hasnt been smashed down on the pavement, and had their &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sinews lacerated</hi>&#x201D; can form a notion of!&#x2014;</p>
<p>When I come back I shall have to lie down, I know&#x2014;and as the post leaves at half after 4, there will be no chance of adding to my letter&#x2014;so take this &#x201C;small contribution&#x201D; in good part&#x2014;</p>
<p>My kind regards to Jamie and the &#x201C;worl-like bairns, poor things&#x201C;!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC may mean &#x201C;warl-like,&#x201D; i.e., healthily normal.</note></p>

I did not stay above ten minutes, and the sun was shining; but I could not get along fast enough with my stick, to prevent me suffering from the change of temperature from my warm Drawingroom to the open air, and the <hi rend="italic">fatigue</hi> of the thing was very great, and so all my pains were aggravated for the rest of the day&#x2014;and thro&#x2019; the night I was in a fever. But when I do nothing to hurt myself, I am better than I had the least expectation of being, in the first days after my accident, in so short a period as two months! and the recollection of all the agony I suffered is still as vivid; that to have one leg and one arm still partially lamed seems a very small hardship indeed&#x2014;and the quiet, shut up life <hi rend="italic">that</hi> involves seems to be a thing to be thankful rather than otherwise. So you needn&#x2019;t pity me unless you like!</p>

<salute>My dearest Lady Airlie</salute>
<p>Your letter took away my breath, and gave me a pain in my back! In spite of your kind consideration; prefacing the terrible narrative with assurance that nothing terrible had come of it! It is enough to make one believe in Predestination to mark the different results of falls! I too was once pitched out of a carriage, thro&#x2019; the air, right over the horse, and the whole mischief done to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> individually, was the breakage of a&#x2014;bracelet-clasp!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For accounts of JWC&#x2019;s fall, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470822-TC-RMM-01"><sic>22:41&#x2013;42</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1847-08-22">22 Aug. 1847</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470827-TC-JAC-01"><sic>44</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1847-08-27">27 Aug. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note>

<p>There is no use saying anything about the rashness of your travelling to Alderley and back again with a knee so badly bruised as yours, it seems, has been!

      <salute>My dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>
      Thanks for your pleasant little Note; I do not deserve a long one. All this week and last I have been in <hi rend="italic">quagmire</hi> up to the throat,&#x02014;with that beautiful Book, as usual. Struggling as if for dear life:&#x02014;thank Heaven, I did my foot on the hard again, this afternoon before the Horse came: I am not <pb id="pg-39-250" n="39:250" />yet quite <hi rend="italic">out;</hi> alas, no; but I hope to be, tomorrow before Post goes: and you ought to be apprised of so agreeable a small fact. Every one of these <hi rend="italic">plunges</hi> into mud, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there have been many, has seemed the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> very bad one: but I begin now to doubt there will be more. It is on the whole an affair of stomach, of nervous vivacity, of being in what we call good spirits. <hi rend="italic">Good</hi> spirits are, alas, very far from me usually, these many years back: it is some <pb id="pg-39-251" n="39:251" />little dexterity of hand, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I find to have <hi rend="italic">deserted</hi> me, that mainly creates those miserable stoppages of progress. I must endeavour to <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> diligently, to &#x0201C;be very regular,&#x0201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: in fine, I must endeavour to <hi rend="italic">get done;</hi> that is pressingly necessary to me!

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I am to write you &#x201C;A single word&#x201D; in explanat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of my poor Wife&#x2019;s silence;&#x2014;and truly I have not means for many &#x201C;words,&#x201D; as it is striking 11 p.m., and they are about to turn me out of this room for <hi rend="italic">sick-nurse purposes.</hi></p>
<p>The poor Wife has been extremely ill for a fortnight past,&#x2014;constant to <hi rend="italic">bed,</hi> poor soul, since Monday gone a week.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC apparently overestimated the time JWC was confined to bed.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I must be almost as brief as yourself; but it is necessary I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send you a word tonight.</p>
<p>Since you heard last poor Jane has fallen into a sad state of suffering,&#x2014;indeed I believe it had secretly begun at the time I wrote; tho&#x2019; it did not develope itself for a day or two after. Monday night gone a week (gone a <hi rend="italic">fortnight,</hi> where you read this), Froude &#x26; his Wife<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henrietta Froude.</note> were here: Jane sat talking to Mrs F. till that was done; then glided into her own bed, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> telling me how ill she was; &#x26; that is the last I have seen of her in this room. Great pain, restlessness, wretchedness,&#x2014;feverish, sick, and all the muscular parts, head, back &#x26;c in continual suffering; next to no sleep, next to no food; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Barnes assures me it is nothing but &#x201C;Influenza wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has stirred up all the other ailments into a state of violence&#x201C;: at first, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gather, he had been afraid of lungs, kidneys or something serious of <hi rend="italic">in</hi>ternal; but he finds nothing of that &#x201C;a mere cold,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;&#x26; no cause for alarm.&#x201D; It is horrible suffering at any rate;&#x2014;and I cannot but wish with all my soul it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> abate &#x26; go away!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;&#x2018;Monday evening, <date when="1863-11-23">November 23</date>&#x2019; (as I laboriously make out the date); &#x2018;the F&#x2014;s&#x2019; [Froudes], F&#x2014;and his wife, the pleasantest, indeed almost the only pleasant evening company we now used to have; intelligent, cheerful, kindly, courteous, sincere (they had come to live near us, and we hoped for a larger share of such evenings, of which probably this was the first? Alas, to me, too surely it was in effect the last!) Cheerful enough this evening was; my darling sat latterly on the sofa, talking chiefly to Mrs. F&#x2014;; the F&#x2014;s gone, she silently at once withdrew to her bed, saying nothing to me of the state she was in, which I found next morning to have been alarmingly miserable, the prophecy of one of the worst of nights, wholly without sleep and full of strange and horrible pain. And the nights and days that followed continued steadily to <hi rend="italic">worsen,</hi> day after day, and month after month, no end visible. It was some ten months now before I saw her sit with me again in this drawing-room&#x2014;in body weak as a child, but again composed into quiet, and in soul beautiful as ever, or more beautiful than ever, for the rest of her appointed time with me, which indeed was brief, but is now blessed to look back upon, and an unspeakable favour of Heaven. I often think of that last evening with the F&#x2014;s, which we hoped to be the first of a marked increase of such, but which to me was essentially the last of all; the F&#x2014;s have been here since, but with her as hostess (in my presence) never more, and the reflex of that bright evening, now all pale and sad, shines, privately incessant, into every meeting we have. &#x2F;&#x2F; Barnes, for some time, said the disease was &#x2018;influenza, merely accidental cold, kindling up all the old injuries and maladies,&#x2019; and promised speedy amendment; but week after week gave dismally contrary evidence&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:178&#x2013;79).</note> Her <hi rend="italic">first</hi> <pb id="pg-39-255" n="39:255"/>sleep was two nights ago, by aid of <hi rend="italic">morphine:</hi> I think they are continuing that; but indeed I do not know. She speaks little to me; and does not <hi rend="italic">accept</hi> me as a sicknurse, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> truly I had never any talent to be. We have written for Maggie Welsh: I hope much she will come at once,&#x2014;but there is some engage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the kind already with her Brother Alick&#x2019;s Boy at Liverpool, and things are not <hi rend="italic">done</hi> there, tho&#x2019; mending.</p>
<p>L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton is always reported to us as doing well; and I believe it is so, tho&#x2019; he gathers strength at a most <hi rend="italic">slow</hi> rate. Thursday last, we heard of some whiff of cold or of <hi rend="italic">gout,</hi> but they made light of it. Christison himself wrote lately in a hopeful strain altogether. Jamie my Brother <hi rend="italic">was here,</hi> for 22 hours, Tuesday-Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tues., <date when="1863-12-01">1 Dec.</date>, and Wed., <date when="1863-12-02">2 Dec.</date>; James Carlyle, also John A.

We did very well; &#x26; I had much pleasant talk till he went. &#x201C;Sight of St Paul&#x2019;s&#x201C;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral.</note> he cared for nothing more.</p>

<p>Your sudden appearance <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> and the bright little visit you made us, is <pb id="pg-39-256" n="39:256"/>very strange and interesting to think of, ever since you went away! Poor Jane was very sorry she c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take no better charge of you.</p>
<p>Her case, I am sorry to say, is not improved since you were here; on the <hi rend="italic">contrary,</hi> if anything. Her suffering is very great: nothing but pains and restless misery; no sleep (except by opiates), no food hardly except what the Doctor peremptorily orders. The day before yesterday I felt so uneasy about he[r] weak way I specially questioned the Doctor: he is a rational honest kind of man; he assured me it was nothing but a Cold, &#x201C;mere Influenza wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had stirred up all the old pains and ailments into a violent state of activity,&#x201C;&#x2014;and there was &#x201C;no cause for alarm.&#x201D; I was considerably relieved to hear him talk so. In the mean while it is very miserable; and I heartily wish it were over! We have sent for a Cousin of hers from Auchtertool (properly <hi rend="italic">Liverpool</hi> where she now is), &#x201C;Maggie Welsh,&#x201D; a nice discreet creature; and we hope she will come directly (tho&#x2019; it is not quite certain), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a great comfort &#x26; help.&#x2014; I will write to you again,&#x2014;at once if anything particular occur.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are in considerable distress and confusion here; but since today &#x26; yesterday I strive to be in hopes it is diminishing. Yesterday Dr Blakiston<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Peyton Blakiston.</note> from Hastings (who is skilful &#x26; full of kindness to Jane, but noisy &#x26; loquacious) came up, with Bessy (a most kind semi-<hi rend="italic">volunteer</hi> move<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x2014;for the purpose of seeing her, and holding a consultat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with Barnes. He confirms Barnes in every partic<hi rend="italic">r:</hi> indeed the case seems medically plain,&#x2014;nothing wrong internally, but the irritation, restlessness, pain and nervous weakness very great. I send you B.&#x2019;s &#x201C;Diagnosis,&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had written for me, and came stumping up to my garret with, after his consultat<hi rend="italic">n.</hi> Send the Paper back, after you have read it. <hi rend="italic">Before</hi> he came (by the aid of opiates or otherwise) poor Jane was considerably easier, and I think evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> continues so today: but she is so low, one can get little out of her own acc<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> I seldom get above a word or two, <pb id="pg-39-257" n="39:257"/>hardly audible even with industry, and little elucidation of her state. Never before have I have seen her in such misery so long. She does, I believe, sleep a little latterly; she also eats <hi rend="italic">better</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is still very <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>),&#x2014;is to try a fract<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of minced mutton today; seems to affect nothing, but lemonades, small bits of <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> (a bundle of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> lies always in the back-area, under hay), soda-water &#x26; milk &#x26;c. A sick-nurse (Irish &#x201C;sister-of-mercy,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;A year or &#x2026; two before this time, she had gone with some acquaintance who was in quest of sick-nurses to an establishment under Catholic auspices, in Brompton somewhere (the acquaintance, a Protestant herself, expressing her &#x2018;certain knowledge&#x2019; that this Catholic was the one good kind);&#x2014;where accordingly the aspect of matters, and especially the manner of the old French lady who was Matron and Manager, produced such a favourable impression, that I recollect my little Woman saying, &#x2018;If I need a sick-nurse, that is the place I will apply at&#x2019;&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 170).

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I meant writing to you yesterday; but people invaded my garret, and I could not. This morn<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> comes y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter.</p>
<p>We have had a terrible four weeks since you heard last! Rheumatic fever, or I know not what it is, and has been: the Doctors call it mere &#x201C;influenza wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has kindled into <hi rend="italic">a general paroxysm</hi> all the neuralgias, hurts &#x26;c&#x201C;;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> are agreed, all Three of them,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drs. Barnes, Blakiston, and Quain.</note> on this definition; and to my own mind, so far I can form any judg<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> this does seem probably the nature of the case. The Drs are all agreed;&#x2014;but, alas, it seems very evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> their art can do nothing for her; and indeed all their opiates, morphines, soporifics, produced the very reverse of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> or help,&#x2014;no improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> visible till then were entirely abandoned. I never saw a being in such continuous agony!&#x2014; Since yesterday week, we have tried to flatter ourselves that there was a perceptible change for the better. And she does sleep a little more, eat a little more (all <hi rend="italic">drugs</hi> being withdrawn); and certainly, one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a little better;&#x2014;&#x201C;round the corner,&#x201D; as we fond[ly] hoped, and hope;&#x2014;but there is such a depression of spirits, so very <hi rend="italic">little</hi> sleep or eating, and such capricious returns of the ancient miseries and universal <hi rend="italic">pains</hi> (from no visible cause), as keeps us in continual fluctuat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and anxiety.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;&#x2018;Neuralgia!&#x2019; the doctors then all said, by which they mean they know not in the least what; in this case, such a deluge of intolerable pain, indescribable, unaidable pain, as I had never seen or dreamt of, and which drowned six or eight months of my poor darling&#x2019;s life as in the blackness of very death; her recovery at last, and the manner of it, an unexpected miracle to me. There seemed to be pain in every muscle, misery in every nerve, no sleep by night or day, no rest from struggle and desperate suffering. Nobody ever known to me could more nobly and silently endure pain; but here for the first time I saw her vanquished, driven hopeless, as it were looking into a wild chaotic universe of boundless woe&#x2014;on the horizon, only death or worse. Oh, I have seen such expressions in those dear and beautiful eyes as exceeded all tragedy! (one night in particular, when she rushed desperately out to me, without speech; got laid and wrapped by me on the sofa, and gazed silently on all the old familiar objects and me). Her pain she would seldom speak of, but when she did, it was in terms as if there were no language for it; &#x2018;any honest pain, mere pain, if it were of cutting my flesh with knives, or sawing my bones, I could hail that as a luxury in comparison!&#x2019; &#x2F;&#x2F; And the doctors, so far as I could privately judge, effected approximately to double the disease. We had many doctors, skilful men of their sort, and some of them (Dr. Quain, especially, who absolutely would accept no pay, and was unwearied in attendance and invention) were surely among the friendliest possible; but each of them&#x2014;most of all each new one&#x2014;was sure to effect only harm, tried some new form of his opiums and narcotic poisons without effect; on the whole I computed, &#x2018;Had there been no doctors, it had been only about half as miserable.&#x2019; Honest Barnes admitted in the end, &#x2018;We have been able to do nothing&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:179&#x2013;80).</note>&#x2014; We have had good &#x201C;Maggie Welsh&#x201D; for the last two weeks; who is <pb id="pg-39-259" n="39:259"/>the staff of life to us all! From her or from me you shall hear ag<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> before long. Take care of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Patients; <hi rend="italic">self</hi> included, who seem to be one! I am unspeakably hurried ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;seldom been in such a whirlpool. <closer><salute>Adieu, with blessings.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Your two birds arrived safe&#x2014;excellent birds, of new foreign flavour<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Symington wrote later: &#x201C;Having in December received some ptarmigan from Iceland, I forwarded a brace to Chelsea&#x201D; (Symington, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 61). Symington visited in May and talked with TC about John A.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>It does seem absurd that I cannot get two minutes to write a word to <hi rend="italic">you:</hi> but such is the sad fact; nor will I take up time explaining it.</p>
<p>We are in great trouble, anxiety, confusion: poor Jane&#x2019;s state such as to fill one with the saddest thoughts. She does not gather strength: how can she? There has been, since that good night, next to no sleep, oftenest none whatever. She is quieter in regard to pain, the neuralgia and other torments have sensibly abated (not ceased); she also eats daily a little,&#x2014;that is the one clearly good symptom. But her state is one of weakness, utter restlessness, depression and misery: such a scene as I never was in before. If she c<hi rend="italic">d only</hi> get a little sleep:&#x2014;but she cannot hitherto. Tonight by Barnes&#x2019;s advice and her own reluctant consent, she is to try morphine again; God of his mercy grant that it may prosper! There has been for ten days a complete cessation of all druggings and opiate abominations: they did her a great deal of mischief, instead of any good.&#x2014; One of our servants took sore throat;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary or Lizzie.</note> and went away: it is to be regarded as a blessing that we have got one in her stead, <hi rend="italic">talem qualem</hi> [of whatever kind], who comes home tomorrow. We have had &#x201C;Sisters of Mercy&#x201D; (so-called),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;We had sick-nurses, a varying miscellany, Catholic &#x2018;Sisters of Mercy&#x2019; (ignominiously dismissed by her third or fourth night, the instant she found they were in real substance Papist propagandists. Oh, that &#x2018;3 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>,&#x2019; when her bell awoke me too, as well as Maggie Welsh, and the French nun had to disappear at once, under rugs on a sofa elsewhere, and vanish altogether when daylight came!) Maggie Welsh had come in the second week of December, and continued, I think, at St. Leonards latterly, till April ended&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:180). See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 170&#x2013;71.</note> Charwomen &#x26;c &#x26;c. Friends are really kind in intention;&#x2014;the result of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is endless <hi rend="italic">Notes</hi> to write; yesternight I did four;&#x2014;tonight I have at least Milnes to answer (see Inclosure)!&#x2014; I still try to hope, and believe that my poor little Woman <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> better; &#x26; Barnes keeps up his heart: but it is miserable to see how low and wretched she is; and under what wearing pain she passes her sleepless nights and days.&#x2014; In health I am myself as well as usual (which surely is a blessing): I keep busy too, in all available moments: <hi rend="italic">work</hi> done is the one consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> left me. Fuz<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster.</note> came in tonight; his kindness cost me my after-ride nap of sleep, and give me a headache for the night.&#x2014; Tomorrow, before post, I will write another word. Enough of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> kind of thing. Good night.</p>

</note>&#x02014;I hoped to have made my congratulations on the new grace of Fortune last time you wrote, but when I called at Brook Street you had gone out. Speaking of it or not, it is a thing we are all glad of, and wish well to.

The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> reported, <date when="1863-08-01">1 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;When a Commoner is raised to the Peerage it is the custom of the Press to hold an Inquest on his remains, to find out how he came to his end, or, in other words, to his title. In the case of Richard Monckton Milnes, the verdict delivered most emphatically and cordially is Honestly and Meritoriously. A Devil&#x02019;s Advocate would be at a loss to ascribe Mr. Milnes promotion to any unworthy cause, his political conduct having been so thoroughly independent as occasionally to wear the appearance of waywardness. &#x02026; Few men are better informed, few have read more extensively and profitably, and he has written well, and would have done better if he had not given to politics what his inclinations would rather have bestowed on literature. He was a poet early, but a politician by descent, his position would not allow of his making a business of a pleasure.&#x0201D;</note>

    <p>My poor wife is in great pain and distress; general neuralgia, the doctors call it&#x02014;pain of that hurt limb, all manner of latent hurts and injuries, kindled into a flaming paroxysm by some fit of influenza: such a tempest of misery, as fills us with pain even to witness it; for about two weeks since the doctors, who were all agreed, but could do no good whatever, gave up the opiate abominations, and left matters alone. We have struggled to hope, and do still hope there was an improvement; but it is sadly slow&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> in particular, almost refusing to return as yet, and the progress towards better hardly discernible amid many interruptions. God help us, and send us better days again! I can find no consolation, except in struggling to get a little work done in spite of the dire element, which in every atom of it is saying, &#x0201C;No, you shan&#x02019;t!&#x0201D; The doctors confidently call it a superficial &#x0201C;merely nervous&#x0201D; torment of pain, and assert that, &#x0201C;except by failure of strength,&#x0201D; it is not dangerous&#x02014;&#x0201C;except,&#x0201D; indeed! But let us be silent&#x02014;let us hope in this place of hope.</p>
    <p>Poor Thackeray!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thackeray d. Christmas Eve.</note> I saw him not ten days ago.

He had many fine qualities, no guile or malice against any mortal; a big mass of a soul, but not strong in proportion; a beautiful vein of genius lay struggling about in him. Nobody in our day wrote, I should say, with such perfection of style. I predict of his books very much as you do.

<p><hi rend="italic">Wedny 4 p.m.&#x2014;</hi> <salute>Dear Brother,</salute> The <hi rend="italic">Morphine</hi> of last night (25 drops) proved a total failure:&#x2014;you may fancy what a day my poor Woman has!

But we will consider.&#x2014; She does eat,&#x2014;morsels of sole, cups of brown soup, a new egg &#x26;c: I saw her &#x201C;dining&#x201D; today; really almost, you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have said, with an appetite or semblance of one. It is the one good symptom; and it is a good one.</p>
<p>I have had to stay in from riding; to clear off wreck no longer endurable. Done now, or on the edge of done.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;December was hardly out till there began to be speech among the doctors of sea-side and change of air: the one hope they continued more and more to say; and we also thinking of St. Leonards and our Dr. B&#x2014; and bountiful resources there, waited only for spring weather, and the possibility of flight thither. How, in all this tearing whirlpool of miseries, anxieties, and sorrows, I contrived to go on with my work is still an astonishment to me. For one thing, I did not believe in these doctors, nor that she (if let alone of them) had not yet strength left. Secondly, I always counted &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019; itself to be the prime source of all her sorrows as well as my own; that to end it was the condition of new life to us both, of which there was a strange dull hope in me. Not above thrice can I recollect when, on stepping out in the morning, the thought struck me, cold and sharp, &#x2018;She will die, and leave thee here!&#x2019; and always before next day I had got it cast out of me again. And, indeed, in all points except one I was as if stupefied more or less, and flying on like those migrative swallows of Professor Owen, after my strength was done and coma or dream had supervened, till the Mediterranean Sea was crossed! But the time altogether looks to me like a dim nightmare, on which it is still miserable to dwell, and of which I will after this endeavour only to give the dates&#x201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:180&#x2013;81).
