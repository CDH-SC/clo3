<p>For help in producing the present volume the editors wish to thank the librarians and staff of the Bodleian Library; the British Library; Edinburgh University Library (particularly the staff of the Special Collections Department and Miss Brenda Moon); the Jagiellonian Library; the National Library of Scotland (particularly Dr. Ian Cunningham and the staff of the Manuscript Department and Dr. Iain Brown); the Library of the Trinity College, Cambridge; the librarian and local reference staff of the Ewart Library, Dumfries; Perkins Library, Duke University (especially Interlibrary Loan Service); and the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library (particularly its curator, Dr. Vincent Giroud), Yale University. We also wish to express our gratitude to the British Academy for invaluable financial support; Professor David Daiches; the University of Edinburgh Faculty of Arts, its dean, Professor J. Richardson, and the Department of English Literature for their steady support; the late Professor N. Furness; Professors Peter Burian and Lawrence Richardson of the Classics Department, Duke University; the Lorimer Trust; Christopher Strachan for help with classical questions; the National Trust and the National Trust for Scotland, in particular the curators of Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea, and Carlyle&#x2019;s Birthplace, Ecclefechan; Dr. Owen Dudley Edwards; Peter Scott and the staff of Computer Support, University of Edinburgh; Irmgard Burns; and Sheila McIntosh. We are also grateful to the staff of the Duke University Press who constantly seek to make our volumes as readable and attractive as possible.</p>
<p>Finally we would like to acknowledge with esteem and fondness our colleague Hilary J. Smith, whose name appears for the last time in the series on the title page of this volume. It is quite possible that she knows as much about the domestic lives of the Carlyles as anyone now living, and it is certain that she is matchless in reading their handwriting. Having worked with the letters in this edition for more than twenty-five years, she has recently retired from the project. We honor her and will forever remember her enormous help with the letters already printed and the many more to be published hereafter.</p>

<p>An analysis of the letters of this volume once again shows how much is fresh in the study of the Carlyles, but now with a slight difference. This volume contains a total of 247 letters, of which 47 percent have not been previously published, approximately 12 percent previously quoted, 13 percent printed in incomplete form, and 25 percent published elsewhere for the most part in full form. Although proportionately few of their letters of <date when="1850">1850</date> have been easily available in print, as the headnotes dutifully set out, fewer of Jane Carlyle&#x2019;s letters than usual (only 22 percent) have been previously unpublished, probably because they are generally fewer in number and of more personal interest.</p>
<p>With slight exceptions, one in particular, the correspondence of the Carlyles in <date when="1850">1850</date> is tender and affectionate. Left on her own in Cheyne Row in <date when="1850-08">August</date> and struggling with decorators and the servant problem, Jane wrote to Thomas to thank him for his long letters:</p>
<q>Today&#x2019;s did not come by the mornings post, not till twelve. &#x2026; It is sad and wrong to be so dependant for the life of my life on any human being as I am on you: but I cannot by any force of logic cure myself of the habit at this date, when it is become &#x201C;a second nature.&#x201C; If I have to lead another life in any of the planets I shall take precious good care not to hang myself round any man&#x2019;s neck either as a locket or a millstone!</q>
<p>Having survived Thomas&#x2019;s frustrated anger against &#x201C;things in general&#x201C; in the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> and having remained at home while he was away on his usual summer vacation, Jane seemed to recognize that many of her problems arose from her health. Yet Thomas took much for granted, though he wrote to her, on <date when="1850-09-06">6 September</date>, after more than a month&#x2019;s absence:</p>
<q>it is at once a duty and an undeniable pleasure to me, in this sabbath stillness of my days, to open my closed pack to you and talk a little. Nothing so like a &#x201C;sabbath&#x201C; has been vouchsafed to me for many heavy months as these last ten days at poor Scotsbrig are. Let me be thankful for them! They were very necessary to me, they will open my heart to sad and affectionate thoughts which the intolerable burden of my own mean sufferings have stifled for a long time.</q>
<p>He saw that in his aggressive concern about his relation to society he often lost touch with those closest to him, as was to happen in his rough response to his wife&#x2019;s anxiety after her accident at home early in <date when="1850-12">December</date>.</p>
<p><pb id="lastpage-25-x" n="25:x"/>Perhaps Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s often hidden concern and love for his wife can be seen in an incident noted by Amalie B&#xF6;lte, the German governess and writer working in England who regularly called at Cheyne Row. The German artist Carl Hartmann painted a portrait of Jane (the frontispiece to the present volume) for B&#xF6;lte that was completed by <date when="1849-07">July 1849</date> (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490703-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:91</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1849-07-03">3 July 1849</date></corr></ref>). B&#xF6;lte apparently took it with her to Germany later in the year and brought it back to London in <date when="1850">1850</date>. Thomas pounced on it and impounded it, giving as an excuse, so she says, her having taken some autographs by Caussidi&#xE8;re for Varnhagen von Ense, a renowned collector. She wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1850-04-03">3 April</date>, after a visit to Cheyne Row:</p>
<q>	Yesterday I was at the Carlyles where, as ever, the hours flew like minutes. He is still ruminating on the treachery committed by me on Caussidi&#xE8;re, as if it were an amazing deed. I on the other hand consider the theft committed against me far more amazing and say that he puts the principle <foreign>&#x201C;la propri&#xE9;t&#xE9; c&#x2019;est le vol&#x201C;</foreign> into practice. When I yesterday tried to take possession of the picture, I learnt that he had locked it into his room. That really was too much! Saturday he is going into the country to Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s, then I will see if I can&#x2019;t get hold of it. Just for the fun of it. At the same time I believe that this very picture has had the most wonderful effect. His pleasure in it, the infinite value attached to it, has shown the original once for all what is really in his heart, and how she lives there and will continue to live there.</q>
<p>B&#xF6;lte concluded that Jane &#x201C;has while living seen herself treated as dead, and has since then [since the incident] become mellower and gentler. How glad I am to have brought this about&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, trans. 78).</p>
<p>The importance of <date when="1850">1850</date> otherwise lies in the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, which mark a turning point in Carlyle&#x2019;s career and reputation. Emerson and Trollope can be seen in the notes to the letters as recognizing his integrity and also his hatred of falsehood, but many of his old associates fell away. Yet both his and Jane&#x2019;s skill and attraction as letter writers remain unaffected. Both retain their intimate, spontaneous, and adaptable style, especially in her case for writing about her pet dog, Nero, and in his accounts of his meetings with Sir Robert Peel and Peel&#x2019;s subsequent death.</p>
<p>Our basic editorial procedures remain much the same for this volume except that we now shall begin publishing a single volume at a time. In addition, in the hope that it will be for the readers&#x2019; convenience, we will place almost all the biographical notes (mainly those of the Carlyles&#x2019; contemporaries) in alphabetical order at the end of the volume before the index. These notes will hereafter be carried over, with suitable modification, to later volumes.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note this morning was abundantly welcome, with such good news of our Mother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret A. Carlyle, who lived at Scotsbrig with her son James and his wife, Isabella, who had long been unwell. John Carlyle was visiting them.</note> &#x26;c as it brought. Often do I think of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and how she is standing the bitter weather! It appears she does wonderfully;&#x2014;and indeed you seem to have fully a better edition of the weather than we here; for the Sun rarely visits us, and we alternate between frost and abominable <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> under the shadow of a firmament generally lead-coloured. Today we are falling a powdering of sleet, which <hi rend="italic">glazes</hi> all manner of paths and roads; while towards Charingcross and farther inward, it will be all soft mud:&#x2014;and as for <hi rend="italic">light</hi>, I had to get candles about noon today, and have them burning again now a little after 3 p.m.&#x2014; We have to <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> on under considerable disadvantages of weather. However, &#x201C;we are all afoot still, and that is a favour.&#x201C; A week or two more, and there will be improvement in the weather.</p>
<p>Today I send two Books; one which is <hi rend="italic">Emerson&#x2019;s Lectures</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Representative Men</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>).</note> a Book of yours, which may perhaps amuse you in a dark ev<hi rend="italic">g:</hi> it came here, with a Copy for myself, two nights ago. The other is <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> for my Mother; some better reading in it than usual. An attack on my <hi rend="italic">Negro Question</hi> is of very slender structure,&#x2014;I do not in the least know by whom.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[John Stuart Mill], &#x201C;The Negro Question,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 41 (<date when="1850-01">Jan. 1850</date>):25&#x2013;31.

Mill&#x2019;s reply to TC, signed &#x201C;D,&#x201C; is brief but not slight. He argues against slavery on the grounds of justice, not sentiment, calls it &#x201C;damnable,&#x201C; attacks the cult of &#x201C;work,&#x201C; and deplores TC&#x2019;s influence on readers in the U.S. and his support of this &#x201C;true work of the devil.&#x201C; John Carlyle replied from Scotsbrig, <date when="1850-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, acknowledging receipt of the two books, giving good news about their mother&#x2019;s health, and saying: &#x201C;I hope you will not overwork yourself with those projected Tracts, nor send them forth without due deliberation. They are much wanted at present, only one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wish to have them do full justice to the subjects, &#x26; stand as a permanent &#x26; unexaggerated protest against various forms of folly that have deep roots in the country. I entirely went along with the spirit of that &#x2018;Occasional Speech,&#x2019; but think the good effect of it is considerably weakened by the violence of its tone, &#x26; by its personalities against poor Exeter Hall [see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451111-TC-RWE-01"><sic>20:53</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1845-11-11">11 Nov. 1845</date></corr></ref>] which hardly deserves notice among thinking men. My belief is that you will get through the work most skilfully &#x26; successfully, if you can only keep labouring at it in moderation. You have already said the hardest things, to quacks of all kinds, that have been said, for some centuries past; &#x26; that without coming to single combat or collision with any special quack, or losing time with any of them.&#x201C;</note> By some &#x201C;man of mark,&#x201C; Forster says the Newspapers say; by some poor hidebound dunce, I have no <pb id="pg-25-2" n="25:2"/>hesitation in replying.&#x2014; Alas, this is but the first <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> of the storm I shall have to raise among that class of cattle, when I do fairly open my pack, and make known to them what my mind is;&#x2014;as really now must soon be done!</p>
<p>I have been quite overwhelmed with rubbishy labour for two weeks or more; and only got a place of <hi rend="italic">stopping</hi>, the day before yesterday; very much worn out indeed. Chapman is for a &#x201C;Series of Pamphlets&#x201C;&#x2014;kind of Carlylese &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Tracts for the Times</hi>&#x201C;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman, partner of Chapman &#x26; Hall, pbd. the series as <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> in the coming seven mos. At first, TC intended twelve pamphlets, but pbd. eight: (1) &#x201C;The Present Time,&#x201C; <date when="1850-02-01">1 Feb.</date>; (2) &#x201C;Model Prisons,&#x201C; <date when="1850-03-01">1 March</date>; (3) &#x201C;Downing Street,&#x201C; <date when="1850-04-01">1 April</date>; (4) &#x201C;The New Downing Street,&#x201C; <date when="1850-04-15">15 April</date>; (5) &#x201C;Stump&#x2014;Orator,&#x201C; <date when="1850-05-01">1 May</date>; (6) &#x201C;Parliaments,&#x201C; <date when="1850-06-01">1 June</date>; (7) &#x201C;Hudson&#x2019;s Statue,&#x201C; <date when="1850-07-01">1 July</date>; (8) &#x201C;Jesuitism,&#x201C; <date when="1850-08-01">1 Aug.</date> First collected edn., <date when="1850-08">Aug. 1850</date>.

Probably after <date when="1849-12">December</date>, on which day Nigger Question (in &#x2018;Fraser&#x2019;) had come out with execrative shrieks from several people&#x2014;J. S. Mill for one; who indeed had personally quite parted from me, a year or two before, I knew not and to this day know not why; nor in fact ever much inquired, since it was his silly pleasure, poor Mill!&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:99). In his Journal TC wrote, <date when="1850-02-07">7 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Among other very poor attacks on it and me was one in &#x2018;Fraser&#x2019;; most shrill, thin, poor and insignificant, which I was surprised to learn proceeded from John Mill. Poor Mill; he wrote also an Article ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my Examiner article on Irish Repeal. &#x2026; Neither in that or in this has he told me or reminded me of anything that I did not very well know beforehand: no <hi rend="italic">use</hi> in writing that kind of criticism! For some years back Mill, who once volunteered a close constant intimacy for a long while, has volunteered a complete withdrawal of himself:&#x2014;and now, instead of rev<hi rend="italic">t</hi> discipleship; which he aspired to, seems to have taken the function of getting up to contradict whatsoever I say. Curious enough: but poor Mill&#x2019;s fate, in various ways, has been very tragic; his misery, when I chance to see him in the street or so, otherwise (for we never had word of quarrel), appeals to my pity, if any anger was rising. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lass ihn gew&#xE4;hren</hi></foreign> [Let him do as he wishes]: he gets these Pamphlets, as he had done my other Books, and no words said.&#x201C; Cf. <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500207-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1850-02-07">7 Feb.</date></ref></note> Terribly ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;voting,&#x201C; philanthropy &#x26;c &#x26;c.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>There is no improvement here! Alas, I am still overwhelmed with printers and their litter, and in the worst case for dealing with it:&#x2014;this morning, for example, not being able to sleep, I was out walking soon after six; enjoying my meditations such as they might be in the cold fog. Hyde-Park looked grey and respectable;&#x2014;Stanhope Street did not now know me at all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >12 Gt. Stanhope St. had been the Barings&#x2019; home before they moved to Bath House, 82 Piccadilly. The year began quietly, though Thackeray wrote to Anne Procter to accept an invitation &#x201C;on Sunday: and I should like to have Carlyle and [Henry] Reeve over again only I know it&#x2019;s wrong &#x26; impossible&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">The Letters and Private Papers of William Makepeace Thackeray</hi>, ed. E. F. Harden [New York, <date when="1994">1994</date>] 1:337). Thackeray wrote to James Spedding, <date when="1850-01-05">5 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;Tom Carlyle &#x2026; was here the other day and very kind. I wish you could have heard him though, in a different mood, at Procter&#x2019;s. He fell foul of Reeve, who had a stiff white neckcloth, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> probably offended the Seer. He tossed Reeve and gored yea as a bull he chased him and horned him: for an hour or more he pitched him about ripping open his bowels and plunging his muzzle into Reeves smoking entrails. Reeve had to appear perfectly good-humoured all the time of the operation, and indeed bore it with wonderful face &#x26; patience&#x201C; (Ray 2:628). The dinner, at which Harriet Martineau and Alexander Kinglake were also present, took place <date when="1849-12-19">19 Dec. 1849</date>. Reeve wrote in his diary under this date: &#x201C;Carlyle was so offensive I never made it up with him&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memories and Correspondence of Henry Reeve</hi>, ed. J. K. Laughton [<date when="1898">1898</date>] 1:217). For Dickens&#x2019;s account of the evening, see Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:236. Henry Reeve (<date when="1813">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895">95</date>; <ref target="volume-25/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23296"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320727-TC-JPE-01"><sic>6:190</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1832-07-27">27 July 1832</date></corr></ref>), journalist.</note> It is a waste chaos of a world!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-4" n="25:4"/>After much counsel it seems now to be actually settled that these <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> are to go forth; the first of them at the beginning of <date when="1850-02">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>, I suppose: terrible stuff, alas, alas! About a dozen perhaps lie in my poor inner man; it will be a great relief to get quit of them,&#x2014;that is the one good I can count upon in regard to them. Bad, bad; sure to shock and enrage great quantities of people, for I really cannot manage to dress my talk at present, and besides there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no dressing of it on such a set of topics! Pity me:&#x2014;at any rate the thing is now no secret, and you may speak of it as you like.</p>
<p>Shall I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get to The Grange,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; great Greek Revival home in Hampshire, which the Carlyles occasionally visited.</note> then? I am still cherishing the thought, as about the only pleasant one I have, this long while; but I dare not yet say certainly that it shall be! Cut me off, if you must do it.&#x2014; But in the course of next week, I shall really have quite done with the First of these Pamphlets;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Present Time,&#x201C; to be pbd. in <date when="1850-02">Feb.</date></note>&#x2014;if I could get away? But you have no idea how ill I am; what obstacles there are without and within! I fancy a week of your Park might do me good too:&#x2014;I will still hope, and try my very best: what other can I do?</p>
<p>Your Laurances came yesterday, I suppose.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drawings by Samuel Laurence.</note> There is a new small Book of Emerson&#x2019;s,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Representative Men</hi>.</note> which I meant to send you; but Jane unexpectedly began reading it,&#x2014;she gets along very slowly. It will keep for your behoof, and be pleasant reading for you some day or other.</p>
<p>We are nearly all frozen to death; I seldom saw such vile weather. Bitter tempest of North wind it was for two days: now there is wet snow, and mud <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi></foreign>. I walked to Fulham one of these tempestuous days; had the whole country to myself, which was one comfort: the Bishop&#x2019;s place<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fulham Palace, principal residence of the bishops of London. Fulham lies on the bend of the Thames SW of Chelsea.</note> looked very tattery; the iron sky, and Old Father Thames tumbling along with his ice-cargo, in the howl of the winds, were goodish company for a fellow like me. I am inexpressibly solitary sometimes; but in general have &#x2018;company&#x2019; enough when left well alone.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-5" n="25:5"/>Oh Lady, dear Lady, <foreign>adieu</foreign>. I am due out of doors, some time ago; I must get waterproofs, my big stick, and say <foreign>Adieu</foreign>. God bless you evermore. You will perhaps write to me, what you are doing, how you are. But if I hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, I shall think you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> cut me off, but can still let me come if <hi rend="italic">I</hi>can. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> then; and unless you are very strong, keep out of this rude weather.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I have felt that I owed you a Letter this good while; but I have been terribly <foreign><hi rend="italic">tuffled</hi></foreign> about, kept as busy as a bee;&#x2014;and even now I have hardly a few moments, and must write as if I were driven all the time.</p>
<p>I hope somebody apprised Isabella how excellent the Butter was; we daily eat of it with due acknowledgement, and wish &#x201C;Long life and whole hands to the maker of it,&#x201C; and success,&#x2014;better success than in late times always,&#x2014;to her <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kye!</hi></foreign> The Oatmeal too is an unsurpassable article: I sometimes take a small spell of porridge from it, tho&#x2019; that is contrary to my usual practice now.&#x2014; We had some very sound and respectable <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi>, from Captain Stirling&#x2019;s farm;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Coningham Sterling, capt. in 73d Foot on half-pay; his farm was at Headley, nr. Betchworth, Surrey.</note> which, however, were a great favour: then Mr Fergus of Kirkcaldy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fergus, the Carlyles&#x2019; Kirkcaldy friend.</note> sent us two Barrels,&#x2014;the first of which I broke up yesterday; but these are decidedly a coarse article; the ugly <hi rend="italic">disease</hi> traceable in every one of them; so that if these are &#x201C;the best in Fife,&#x201C; poor Fife must have dreadfully fallen off in regard to potatoes, in which it once so excelled! Indeed I believe such is the case; and that the potatoe business will not speedily be of much service to us again.</p>
<p>Our weather has been very harsh for a month past; an uncommonly severe winter, they say, all over the Continent; we seem to have got a hearty thaw these two days; but whether it will last or not? For we have continually fluctuated in that respect; and sometimes have had hard frost with loud wind, which makes very bad weather indeed.&#x2014; Often have I thought of my poor Mother; and thankfully wondered that she kept up so well as she seems to have done. On me the cold weather has no good effect: but Jane, I think, stands this winter better than usual; she is still afoot, and has all along been.&#x2014; For my own share I have been terribly hurried, moreover; especially since <pb id="pg-25-6" n="25:6"/>the Doctor last got a word from me. You can tell him they are actually going on with these &#x201C;Pamphlets&#x201C; I spoke about, the &#x201C;Latter-Day Pamphlets&#x201C; they are to be called: the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of them is now quite out of my hands, and will sally forth on <date when="1850-02-01">February 1st</date>,&#x2014;and awaken a terrible <hi rend="italic">barking</hi>, &#x201C;Whaf-thaf? Bow-wow!&#x201C; as seems probable. The <hi rend="italic">Nigger</hi> story has never got to sleep yet; all and sundry are astonished, enraged &#x26;c, which really is the only thing one could expect or even wish;&#x2014;and this new affair, I believe, which lets the people see a little <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> into me, will probably be worse, not better.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to her friend Varnhagen von Ense in Berlin, <date when="1850-01-19">19 Jan.</date>, that TC wanted to expel the whole parliament and put a Cromwell at its head, &#x201C;like a God on his heavenly throne.&#x201C; She had found JWC &#x201C;sick in bed and him alone, at home to no one. But I did not think of myself as nobody, drank tea with him, listened to an impassioned speech on the subject, and then he confided in me that he was brooding over a monthly publication in which he wished to enlighten the world on the subject.&#x201C; All that was five weeks ago, when he showed that he did not understand &#x201C;what one could have left to wish for in a state like Prussia. &#x2026; I am near to losing my patience! Just as well that you are not here. You would not get on with him. I told him that the recognition of merit was not as great as he imagined, the proof being a Bunsen holding court here, while you are left alone. At this he became quite enraged, and complained of his own fate in terms that left me without a word of sympathy, especially as I don&#x2019;t know what the state could have done for such an impractical individual. All in all, though, we are good friends. I always go in a cheerful spirit, because he can do with it. &#x2026; His wife has adopted me as her physician, an appointment which I think honors me considerably when I think how many of life&#x2019;s wounds I have had to heal in myself. And, really, what do I have compared to her?&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, trans. 74&#x2013;75).</note> I calculate there is perhaps no man in all her Majesty&#x2019;s dominions, who can so well afford to take such things quietly as even <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>,&#x2014;thanks to my <hi rend="italic">bad stomach</hi> among various other things! So I mean the dogs shall hear a bit of my real mind, now when my hand is in, if I can manage! This <hi rend="italic">First</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> is on &#x201C;The Present Time,&#x201C; or <hi rend="italic">New Era</hi> so-called: a copy shall go to Scotsbrig, so soon as I get one. N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 also is not far from ready; N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3 I do not yet know. Wish me good speed,&#x2014;I know you all do!</p>
<p>Will you get that Draft cashed, and take your own 8 / 6 off it: John, I think, will then want some 2 / or 3 / 6 from me, if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> paid Garthwaite; please to settle with</p>

The prospectus explained that the assoc. aimed to replace by paid productive work &#x201C;useless tests with gratuitous &#x2018;relief&#x2019;&#x201C; in poor law unions. It wanted the unemployed to cultivate &#x201C;allotments of land&#x201C; or do other productive work; and it wished to make the support and education of the poor entirely depend on their own labor, &#x201C;thereby encouraging to the utmost, industry, intelligence, forethought, and self-dependence amongst the mass of the people.&#x201C; Herford also asked John Stuart Mill, who refused, <date when="1850-01-22">22 Jan.</date> and <date when="1850-02-01">1 Feb.</date>; see Mineka 14:43&#x2013;46.</note> For many years, especially for the last three or four, the question of Pauperism has haunted me as the most alarming of all Social Questions: indeed it is properly the summary and essence of everything that is alarming in Society; for <hi rend="italic">Pauperism</hi> is the practical issue that all Error or Injustice among us comes to. I describe it to myself as the general drippings of the poison from all the curses that lie upon: nothing is rotten any where in our Public or Private ways of Existence but it is sure to yield Pauperism in the long run, and to testify at last in that way, to the blindest of us, that there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> rottenness. Or by an opposite figure, we may describe Pauperism as the general leakage which oozes in upon the Ship by every joint that is not tight. Alas, the number of feet we have in the hold just now, and the way the water is rising in spite of all efforts,&#x2014;these are phenomena that fill every thinking man with anxiety!&#x2014; You are very welcome to my name, if it can do you any good in your Enterprise; and I return you thanks for the honour you do me.</p>
<p>Curious enough: in these very days I have sent out of my hand a kind of Discourse or Pamphlet,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >First of the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, &#x201C;The Present Time.&#x201C;</note> in which are various considerations on this very subject, and several ideas strongly confirmatory of your own. You will probably see it in print about the beginning of next month,&#x2014;and will not find it very difficult to peruse.</p>
<p>The only notion of mine which could have much chance to be at all new to you is, That in providing employment for Paupers, or the class now called Paupers, it will be necessary to introduce the most rigorous discipline; and to put an end altogether to what I call the <hi rend="italic">nomadic</hi> scheme of procedure, whereby a Pauper comes to you today demanding work, and in a week hence can walk off again, with a few shillings in his pocket, to begin a new course of vagrancy. This, I think, whatever &#x201C;British Liberty&#x201C; may say to it, will require to be peremptorily put an end to.</p>
<p>You say in one place, The State cannot be trusted to employ Labour.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;State interference with labour and capital all must admit to be undesirable&#x201C; (2).</note> <pb id="pg-25-8" n="25:8"/>Doubtless you do wisely to start with that declaration: and I suppose, with the kind of State and Statesmen we have just now, there is no calling it in question. But I believe well withal, the State, in these extraordinary new times, will actually have to set about that strange function, and by degrees <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it, and do innumerable other things that in the rear of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> extend thro&#x2019; Society altogether; that such is becoming in hard reality the task of the thing called &#x201C;State&#x201C;; and that if we cannot get some kind of &#x201C;State&#x201C; which will make an attempt upon this, there will by and by be no State at all possible among us,&#x2014;more than there is in France or some other countries just now.&#x2014; &#x2014; But these are considerations which, of course, lie quite out of your way in the present undertaking, and which I need not farther insist on here. Indeed you will gather my ideas sufficiently from the Pamphlet alluded to, or from others that may follow it;&#x2014;and of my good wishes, of all kinds, to the Society now in birth I very emphatically assure you.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This was evidently the start of the Poor Law Reform Assoc., founded <date when="1852">1852</date>.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We last night got sight of your Letter to my Mother; which, you need not be told, gave us great pleasure. You are fighting manfully along, far over the Sea yonder, in a manful manner, with your work in this world. There is on the whole no other &#x201C;happiness&#x201C; (tho&#x2019; so much is talked about that word) conceivable, or to be expected, for a human being in this world. May we all so stand to our work; let us all so stand to it, each in the place where he is cast! There is a <hi rend="italic">meeting</hi> for us all,&#x2014;yes, beyond what it is given us to compute or imagine in the present dim sphere, we will hope,&#x2014;when our <hi rend="italic">Day&#x2019;s work</hi> is once well done! Courage, courage! I often feel myself situated very like as you are in that stranger country: very <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi>, I here too, in spite of all my talking acquaintances: a stranger and a pilgrim, emphatically so; striving hard to keep my head above the mud, and get my rough miles of journey finished. We shall then be <hi rend="italic">at rest;</hi> rest is none till then.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack orders me to write a few lines to you, as the Letter goes by;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to his brother Alexander, <date when="1850-01-23">23 Jan.</date>, had been sent to TC and was to be forwarded in TC&#x2019;s letter. John Carlyle said: &#x201C;Your letter to our mother has come this morning; &#x26; it is just the kind of letter she likes to receive&#x2014;long &#x26; filled with the personal details of your own household &#x26; their immediate practical concerns. &#x2026; [S]he duly appreciates the labour you &#x26; Tom have had with those sixty-six acres of wheat &#x26; twenty of rye&#x201C; (MS: NLS 1775B.93).</note> which I <pb id="pg-25-9" n="25:9"/>very willingly do, dear Brother,&#x2014;and could wish only that I had a little leisure to do it more deliberately. For I often think of you; often, almost daily; and have many, many things which I could wish to talk to you about: but the break-neck express-train <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> at which all tumbles along in this world of mine generally reduces me to silence;&#x2014;I often feel as if my <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> were a kind of talk with you. Today especially, and for some weeks past indeed, I am especially hard driven;&#x2014;getting into the <hi rend="italic">Printer&#x2019;s</hi> hands again! He has me by the collar even now. After long haggling, and much sorrowful toil and consideration, I have decided to venture out with a set of <hi rend="italic">Reform</hi> Discourses, &#x201C;Latter-Day Pamphlets&#x201C; I call them, upon the frightful aspects of human affairs, here on our side of the Ocean,&#x2014;which, especially since I was in Ireland, has lain like a millstone on me. I am minded, perilous as it looks, to tell the people somewhat of my real mind about it;&#x2014;that is the one service I can do in regard to it. <hi rend="italic">First</hi> Pamphlet is just coming out, on the first of <date when="1850-02">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi>;</date> there may be about a dozen in all, following month after month,&#x2014;if my strength will hold out: but I am grown very feckless in this bad weather, in these bad times; and shall have my own struggles with this job!&#x2014; If I knew how to send you these &#x201C;Pamphlets,&#x201C; I would send them punctually with right pleasure; but I do not. Has the Post-Office, think you, any feasibility for sending such things? I greatly doubt it. At any rate, I suppose they will be reprinted directly in the <hi rend="italic">United States;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Printed as individual pamphlets from <date when="1850-03">March</date> and collected in book form by Phillips, Sampson, and Co., Boston.</note> perhaps by your ordering them of some Bookseller in Brantford or Hamilton, you could get them for a few cents each? Try; and, on the whole, tell me what to do, if I can do anything in regard to that matter.</p>
<p>Jack sends flourishing accounts always from Scotsbrig; our good old Mother is really wonderfully strong, and as brisk as ever in her mind especially. Jack is busy with the continuation of his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> there:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had pbd. his trans. of Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> (<date when="1849">1849</date>) and was working on the <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi>.</note> a much better shop than <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, I should say, for such a job.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane has kept pretty well on foot all winter, tho&#x2019; the winter here, and indeed all over Europe, has been excessively severe. I, as above-said, have been very gloomy, heavy-laden, but sprawling along too, as I best might.&#x2014; Nothing that I have read this long while so pleased me as that sketch you give of the Boys and Girls. Poor things, they will come up to be useful <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> they could never have had that outlook here, as times are and were. <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> all grows blacker and blacker; ripening <pb id="pg-25-10" n="25:10"/>towards&#x2014;no good!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter come from Alick which has been immediately sent us from Scotsbrig: I contributed a bit of answer to it yesterday; and will now send you the Letter itself for perusal in your Dumfries quarter. Alick, you will be gratified to see, is labouring away, and doing seemingly very well among his young folks,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; a little involved, as his use from of old was, in the finance department. His old fault, poor fellow, of grasping <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than an armful of whatever he is at!</p>
<p>It is a good while since we heard anything direct from you here: Jack writes often from Scotsbrig, and puts in a bit of Dumfries tidings when he has any, but that is not always or often. We always try to fancy you as tolerably well, and &#x201C;struggling along in the old way,&#x201C; when we hear nothing. But a specific word of intelligence, now that penny-stamps are in vogue, is much preferable!</p>
<p>I have myself been in the most entirely <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> of humours; in fact, overwhelmed with all manner of private confusions; kept a little s<supplied>[ick]</supplied>lier than usual by the grim frozen weather;&#x2014;and abo<supplied>[ve]</supplied> all, busily concerned with <hi rend="italic">Printers</hi> again! That is my remedy for all misery, and that unfortunately is itself a misery, always making me worse in health for one thing. Alas, there is nobody that can much <hi rend="italic">help</hi> another! Each of us has to sprawl along with his own burden on his back; not unlike <hi rend="italic">foundering</hi>, at times; and the kindest friend can only help by speaking a word of comfort, or bre<supplied>[at]</supplied>hing a silent wish when there is nothing spoken. That <supplied>[is]</supplied> a great help too; of which I am not destitute more than another.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-11" n="25:11"/>After long tumbling and wrestling about with a mass of confused written-stuff here, which has been oppressing me for months and years past,&#x2014;I have decided at last to give vent to myself in a Series of Pamphlets; &#x201C;Latter-Day Pamphlets&#x201C; is the name I have given them, as significant of the ruinous overwhelmed and almost dying condition in which the world paints itself to me. The <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, about what they call the &#x201C;New Era&#x201C; (the absurd blockheads) <supplied>[i]</supplied>s to come out at the beginning of <date when="1850-02">February</date> now instant: it is quite gone from <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> they are printing the <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> even (which is for <date when="1850-03">March</date>); and I have begun this day to turn the <hi rend="italic">Third</hi> over in my mind. A questionable enterprise; but I could not help it! I think there will be perhaps a Dozen Pamphlets in all,&#x2014;two Volumes when completed;&#x2014;and it is to be expected they will occasion loud astonishment condemnation, and a universal barking of &#x201C;Whaf-thaf? Bow-wow!&#x201C; from all the dogs of the Parish.&#x2014; A Paper I published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> about <hi rend="italic">Niggers</hi> has raised no-end of clamour; poor scraggy critics, of the &#x201C;benevolent&#x201C; school, giving vent to their amazement, and uttering their &#x201C;Whaf-thaf? Bow-wow!&#x201C; in a great variety of dialects up and down all the country, as I am informed.&#x2014; That will be neither chaff nor sand to what they will hear in these &#x201C;Latter-Day&#x201C; Discourses, poor souls! All the twaddling <hi rend="italic">sects</hi> of the country, from Swedenborgians<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s first contact was in <date when="1838">1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380727-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:136</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-07-27">27 July 1838</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380802-TC-JJGW-01"><sic>141&#x2013;42</sic><corr>TC to JJGW, <date when="1838-08-02">2 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> to Jesuits, have for the last t<supplied>[en y]</supplied>ears been laying claim to &#x201C;T. Carlyle&#x201C; each for itself <supplied>[a]</supplied>nd now they will all find that the said &#x201C;T.&#x201C; belongs to a sect of his own, which is worthy of instant damnation. All which is precisely as it must be, and as it should be. Nay we have a considerable amusement over it here; being, I do suppose, about as well situated for speaking what is our own mind on occasion as perhaps any &#x201C;free King&#x201C; of these parts, or these times! A much more question<supplied>[ab]</supplied>le consideration is that of one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">bodily health</hi> holding ou<supplied>[t]</supplied> thro&#x2019; the job:&#x2014;but that too we must risk; trying t<supplied>[o]</supplied> take all precautions as we go. These &#x201C;Pamphlets,&#x201C; I will manage some way that you regularly get to read, as they come out. And so wish me well thro&#x2019; them.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Jane continues pretty hearty; and now our frost seems <hi rend="italic">gone.</hi> How are you all?

<salute>My dear Jeannie,</salute>
<p>I got along yesterday without accident; was in time, and not much more, at all my stations; and arrived here, conducted by the big Humbug Coachman, <pb id="pg-25-13" n="25:13"/>safely, soon after 2 o&#x2019;clock. I found the Austins, Mr &#x26; Mrs,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Sarah Austin lived at Weybridge, Surrey. She had just trans. Guizot&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">On the Causes of the Success of the English Revolution of <date when="1640">1640</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688">1688</date></hi>.</note> just about going,&#x2014;very kind, both man and <foreign><hi rend="italic">frau</hi></foreign> asking after you, inviting me to take Weybridge on the road; talking about German revolutions &#x26;c &#x26;c:&#x2014;I think we must really go out thither some day. Cockerell too was here, with one of his sons grown a big gawky conceited lad;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Robert Cockerell and possibly his second son, Frederick Pepys, who also became an architect.</note> they went in the evening: and after them there remained, and remains, no stranger except Milnes, and myself. Milnes had a tumble from a horse about a week ago, and has gone about in dressing-gown, with arm in sling, ever since; and could not leave at the time he counted on.&#x2014; I had an excellent gallop, with the Cock<hi rend="italic">ls</hi> and Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ashburton.</note> yesterday afternoon; a quiet enough evening;&#x2014;slept terribly <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> (in my <hi rend="italic">old</hi>room up stairs, which had been appointed me as the warmest); and am here, at present (12&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock) quite solitary in this big drawing room; waiting, over French Reviews &#x26;c, to do another bit of riding, dine at 5, and so accomplish another quite idle day.

Pamphlet 1st was read by both the Lady A&#x2014;&#x2014; and Milnes next day in the railway as we all journeyed up; remarks few or none. I was to be very busy thenceforth till the chaos of the MSS. was all got spun out into distinct webs&#x2014;and after that till I tired, which was soon after, essential impulse being spent there&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:99). In Greek mythology Boreas was god of the north wind.</note> on which day you will have me at dinner I hope: the Ashburtons are to return in some two days, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is to go and come; but without more visitors here.

<salute>Dear Master</salute>
<p>I take the liberty to write to you myself, my Mistress being out of the way of writing to you she says, that you may know Columbine and I are quite well and play about as usual. There was no dinner yesterday to speak of; I had for my share only a piece of biscuit that might have been round the World, and if Columbine got anything at all, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> didn&#x2019;t see it. I made a grab at one of two &#x2018;small beings&#x2019; on my Mistress&#x2019;s plate, she called them Heralds of the Morn; but my Mistress said &#x201C;don&#x2019;t you wish you may get it?&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> and boxed my ears. I wasn&#x2019;t taken to walk on account of its being wet, and nobody came but a man for &#x2018;burial rate,&#x2019; and my Mistress gave him a rowing because she wasn&#x2019;t going to be buried here at all&#x2014; Columbine and I don&#x2019;t mind <hi rend="italic">where</hi> we are buried.</p>
<p>This is a fine day for a run, and I hope I may be taken to see <hi rend="italic">Mohe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dumm</hi>&#x2014;They are both, nice well bred dogs and always so glad to see me, and the parrot is great fun when I spring at her, and Mrs Lindsay has always such a lot of bones, and doesn&#x2019;t mind Mohe and Dumm and me eating them on the carpet; I like Mrs Lindsay very much!</p>

<salute>Dear Master</salute>
<p>My Mistress brought my chain, and said &#x201C;come along with me,&#x201C; while it shined, and I could finish after&#x2014; But she kept me so long in the London <pb id="pg-25-15" n="25:15"/>Library<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. James Square.</note> and other places that I had to miss the post. An old Gentleman in the Omnibus took <hi rend="italic">such</hi> notice of me! he looked at me a long time and then turned to my Mistress and said &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sharp;</hi> isn&#x2019;t He?&#x201C;&#x2014;And my Mistress was so good as say; &#x201C;Oh yes!&#x201C; and then the old Gentleman said again, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> knew it!&#x2014;easy to see <hi rend="italic">that!</hi>&#x201C; And he put his hand in his hind pocket and took out a whole biscuit&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi> one&#x2014;and gave it me in bits&#x2014;I was quite sorry to part from him; he was such a good judge of Dogs.

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>I feel as if it behooved me to write to you this morning to congratulate you on a narrow escape. I dreamt over night that you were on the point of being <hi rend="italic">married</hi>&#x2014;to a Miss Crawford from about Darlington<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. Darlington is in N England, 50 mi. N of Leeds.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Not being good for anything at <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> today, and having fiddled away all the morning painfully to no purpose whatever, I decide before going out to at least write you a little Note, and try to get some news about my Mother and the rest of you. I am very busy, and alas very feckless;&#x2014;and John Greg (Canadaigua) and his Brother<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> came to <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> yesterday, which has quite put out the eye of this day, my sleep having been ruined!</p>
<p>I am busy with Pamphlet N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3; which promises to be by far the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of the Lot hitherto. N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2, about the Prisons and the &#x201C;benevolent dodge,&#x201C; is done, and looks pretty fairish, or will look when they have fairly printed it:&#x2014;a piece with some fire in its belly, I do suppose! N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1, of which you rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> your Copy I hope, is going its muddy way; universal censure (at least so far as I hear),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1850-02-02">2 Feb.</date>, for example, complained that he had nothing new to say, &#x201C;nothing original in itself,&#x201C; and &#x201C;scorns the idea of any sort of emancipation&#x2014;especially of the West Indian blacks. &#x2026; We cannot deal seriously&#x2014;and are almost ashamed to deal at all&#x2014;with a book like this.&#x201C;</note> and &#x201C;vigorous sale,&#x201C; reports Chapman. I can unfortunately look for nothing else but censure; and must not stay screwing my words so as to escape that, for that is not escapable, do how I may: I shall be too happy if I can but get my say <hi rend="italic">said</hi>, and so leave it. There will perhaps be more agreement upon it 20 years hence than can be now.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have been terribly weak all this while; and think sometimes I shall have to get a horse again while this affair goes on. Or perhaps the Spring weather will itself set me up considerably. That sad concern, <foreign><hi rend="italic">prolapsus</hi></foreign> [hernia] as your faculty names it, has plagued me incessantly all winter thro&#x2019;; but I have now contrived a <hi rend="italic">truss</hi>, and by aid of poor Jane&#x2019;s needle got it put in active order, whereby the misery is very greatly helped, indeed is almost abolished so far as the outward suffering goes. Which is a real deliverance to me. My very <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> have been threatening to fail me; and I have got a <hi rend="italic">pair of specs</hi> this winter for the first time,&#x2014;&#x201C;an epoch in a man&#x2019;s life,&#x201C; and I said, &#x201C;this of getting his first <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi>, almost as marked as that of <pb id="pg-25-19" n="25:19"/>getting his first <hi rend="italic">razor</hi>, and not nearly so joyful!&#x201C;&#x2014; But as to the <hi rend="italic">feet</hi>, whether it were the cold weather or what, I know not; but they have behaved very ill, in the way of corns, all this while; and one of the little toes, by <hi rend="italic">un</hi>successful attempt to help it with a pair of patched old shoes, lodged itself exactly in the crack or gap below the patch, and has been a ruinous toe ever since! There is one thing therefore, you must do for me if you can: look out for that pair of shoes I <hi rend="italic">left</hi> last at Scotsbrig,&#x2014;a pair cracked on the sides but <hi rend="italic">perfectly</hi> easy for me;&#x2014;send them to a <hi rend="italic">gutta percha</hi> cobler; have the cracks thoroughly patched (on the outside), and oh let him take care to bring the <hi rend="italic">lips</hi> of the crack close together before he put on his patch!&#x2014;finish all with a pair of <hi rend="italic">gutta</hi> soles and heels; and let me have the &#x201C;old friends&#x201C; sent up hither by the first chance there is! That is all at present; and I will say nothing more about myself and my wonderful sufferings and exertions whatever for some time!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Neuberg wrote to his sister in Germany, <date when="1850-02-05">5 Feb.</date>, that TC had visited him in Hampstead, a village NW of London, the day before and &#x201C;poured out lamentations over the wretchedness of human life. &#x2026; &#x2018;Indeed a man can do very well without happiness. When I go to bed of a night, it matters not whether I have been happy or not during the day; it matters only whether I have done some useful thing. The unhappiness of a man lies around him as so much work to do&#x2014;so many devils to be subdued, and order and beauty to be created out of it. &#x2026;&#x2019; I accompanied him home in the evening, and proposed to him to go to Germany with me.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I had the pleasure of receiving your new Volume<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">National Evils and Practical Remedies</hi> (<date when="1849">1849</date>), in which Buckingham proposed model towns with a strict regime as a remedy for social ills. The first was to be called Victoria and built on 10,000 acres in the New Forest, Hampshire, where there was enough uncultivated land on which to build more model towns. He suggested iron as a building material because of its successful use for both steamships and cathedrals.</note> and also your obliging Letter; for both of which I beg to return you many thanks. I expect to have much entertainment, and instruction as to various important things, in reading the new Book, of which I have yet only had time to go into the Preface and the Introduction. I wish you could persuade certain monied people to <hi rend="italic">build</hi> that Iron Town in the New Forest<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 93,000 acres of land in SW corner of Hampshire.</note> and fairly try it! They would find whether their present notions, on Government, Society &#x26;c &#x26;c would hold water yea or not!&#x2014; The agitation of such topics, the discussion of them everywhere by so acceptable a Speaker as you, will itself do a great deal of good.</p>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>As you seem to take an interest in the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, I have directed the Publisher to send you a Copy of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 and the others that follow: I also gave him your admonition about speed on the Irish side of his affairs. The &#x201C;edited&#x201C; is a mere figure of speech, I am afraid. Alone under the stars, with nothing but all the dogs of the parish barking for accompaniment: this is once more like to be my history, in the present ugly feat of walking against time! I should be infinitely gratified, and delivered at once from a variety of very <hi rend="italic">ghastly</hi> emotions, if any true brother out of Adam&#x2019;s general Posterity could join himself to me, and write a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Pamphlet</hi>&#x201C; in the orthodox vein; but there is nowhere, that I know of, any prospect or probability of such; so we must try to do without him, as in former cases. In myself I seem to see some dozen or so of Pamphlets; which if I can get fairly uttered (a doubtful point in the state of health, state of &#x26;c &#x26;c I am in), it will be an extraordinary relief to my own inner man; and the dogs of the parish, and even the <hi rend="italic">parish</hi> itself, and <pb id="pg-25-22" n="25:22"/>the universe to boot, shall be right welcome to do whatever is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> part in the concert, according to their own judgement of that. Pray for me therefore, and wish me well thro&#x2019; this adventure: I mean to speak more plainly than is usual upon a good many things The world, I think, had better be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> than stand as it at present does.

<p><salute>Dear Redwood,&#x2014;</salute>Many thanks for your kind Note. I did not think the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> would get so far westward in their flying condition; but hoped perhaps you might like them a little when bound into a volume. A <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> is all I with clear certainty intend: the confused elements of it, encumbering my mind and desk-drawers, could on the whole be endured no longer; so in some way or other they were to be emptied out upon a discerning public. To make them into a <hi rend="italic">Book;</hi> this with painful intense distillation might perhaps have been done,&#x2014;perhaps should have been?&#x2014;but in my poor heart there remained no longer patience enough for that feat on such a subject: so a Book of <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi> is what you get; some dozen or so of Sermons; and only one sermon to be done at a time, this is a much easier way of harnessing oneself. That is the whole secret of this new phenomenon. I hope,&#x2014;if my health will at all stand out,&#x2014;to get my mind rather plainly declared upon a number of <pb id="pg-25-24" n="25:24"/>subjects; after which I shall be much more at ease for a time: this is all the advantage I can clearly calculate upon,&#x2014;if I can but get this; but alas it seems rather doubtful sometimes when I measure the strength that is in me! We must try, we must try. In black humours I have a very ghastly feeling of <hi rend="italic">loneliness</hi>, no mortal creature to follow my flag on the forlorn hope; nothing but an inarticulate yelping of the poor parish dogs, &#x201C;Whaf-thaf? Bow-wow!&#x201C;&#x2014;but at other times I take it more cheerfully, and know that there are many brave souls listening to me too.</p>
<p>My good old Mother is still spared me; full of clear activity intelligence and curiosity in her mind still (a most ardent <hi rend="italic">Reader</hi> always), and in wonderful bodily health for one approaching her eightieth year. Thank God!&#x2014; My Brother is there at present; works at his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> there all last winter.&#x2014; Mrs C. here continues also as well as usual; has gone out into the Spring sun just now,&#x2014;with a little dog she has lately got and is greatly taken with! I myself am a little <hi rend="italic">more</hi> bilious this winter, not otherwise worse in health than of old.&#x2014; &#x2014; Often, often do I think of Boverton, and the Cave of Refuge, and Rock Rimmon<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Refuge for the Benjamites after their defeat by the Israelites (Judg. 20:45). In <date when="1843-07">July 1843</date> TC had visited Redwood, now at Boverton (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461229-TC-CR-01"><sic>21:121</sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1846-12-29">29 Dec. 1846</date></corr></ref>).</note> that remains to me there! Wait a little; I will not be killed here with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> running to you!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, in haste.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Your <hi rend="italic">gigantic</hi> present came to hand,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A ham.</note> and is hanging by its nail in the back-kitchen (none but I could hook it up, and truly a heavy lift it was for me too): dear Kind Mother, a thousand thanks to you!

<p>Our weather here is sometimes very <hi rend="italic">loud</hi>, very wet and muddy, but occasionally too (as today) is beautiful brightness; and on the whole it is an immense improvement from the stern frost we had so long. My very <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> are thankful for the change. Thank Jack for sending the shoes. The cobbler here has them, and I shall soon be secure ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi>a muddy day. Nay the soft-leather shoes are quite easy themselves now that the poisonous frost is gone off one&#x2019;s skin.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is out &#x201C;with Nero.&#x201C; I have done my task, and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be out too, for my head begins to ache. <closer><salute>Good be with you, dear mother, with you and all!</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>A friendly man<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (whose name I must not mention, nor must you if you even knew it) called on me today with a Letter he had written last week to the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> upon some rubbish which it seems they have been emitting about me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review of &#x201C;The Present Time&#x201C; in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1850-02-02">2 Feb.</date>, began: &#x201C;Though tricked out in the usual style of the modern prophets, Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s prolusions on the &#x2018;present time&#x2019; are a trifle more explicit than any of his former outpourings.

<salute>Dear Mrs Austin,</salute>
<p>There was left for me, the other morning, a Parcel containing M. Guizot&#x2019;s new Work and your Translation of it,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500129-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1850-01-29">29 Jan.</date></ref> TC&#x2019;s copy of the trans. is at Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea.</note>&#x2014;which I computed to be due to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> kind remembrance of me, and accepted accordingly with all thankfulness, begging now to express the same in words by the first leisure I have. M. Guizot&#x2019;s notions on the English Revolution are not quite mine, in several important respects; but so serious, well-instructed and prominent a man is emphatically worth hearing on any subject that is so vital to him. I have read his Book, with respectful estimation and assent in many places, with respectful dissent in many others. A grave earnest man, full of iron resolution, and of a kind of cold stoical dignity which I am not insensible to, seeking his way thro&#x2019; the Chaos that has come upon us and overset all paths and pavements: this is interesting to see. But it seems to me he looks at our English Affairs, after all his study, with unalterably French eyes;&#x2014;I even detect <hi rend="italic">Louis-Philippe</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >King of France, <date when="1830">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">48</date>. Guizot was premier of France, <date when="1840">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848">48</date>. TC told Milnes: &#x201C;Poor Guizot! There he sat in his garret, full of high thought and fine theories, and visited sometimes by divine lights, and then comes the devil and tempts him with Secretaryships of State and Presidency of the Council, and such like, and leads him on and on into lies, and filth, and darkness, and then all at once lets him go, and down he falls into infinite night&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:436).</note> <hi rend="italic">spectacles</hi> here and there! On the whole, our English Puritans did believe in God and Jesus Christ and Eternal Justice, not merely in the <hi rend="italic">Tradition of</hi> God and in Jean-Jacques<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rousseau, who believed in equality and the natural goodness of man.</note> and Progress of the Species and finally in <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Majorities;</hi> which really makes all the difference in the world. So that often I could say, with all my admiration of M. Guizot&#x2019;s clear precise insight and felicitous deliverance of the same, &#x201C;Alas, here again is the Tragedy of Hamlet with the part of H<hi rend="italic">t</hi> omitted by particular desire!&#x201C; M. Guizot&#x2019;s former Book on the Civil Wars,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Histoire de Charles I</hi>er (Paris, <date when="1826">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827">27</date>); see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390629-TC-JF-01"><sic>11:148</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1839-06-29">29 June 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> as I once told himself and still believe, is considerably the best narrative we yet have on those matters: but in the <pb id="pg-25-27" n="25:27"/>Second Part, if we are to have a second Part,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Guizot completed his <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la r&#xE9;volution d&#x2019;Angleterre: Histoire de la r&#xE9;publique d&#x2019;Angleterre et de Cromwell (<date when="1649">1649</date>&#x2013;<date when="1658">1658</date>)</hi> (Paris, <date when="1854">1854</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Histoire du protectorat de Richard Cromwell et du r&#xE9;tablissement des Stuarts (<date when="1658">1658</date>&#x2013;<date when="1660">1660</date>)</hi> (Paris, <date when="1856">1856</date>).</note> he must actually learn to conceive a man, various men, to whom all the &#x2018;successes&#x2019; and Parliamentary majorities in Nature w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem as <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> compared with any violation of the will of Him who made Nature;&#x2014;a kind of man that leads us into spheres of History very unusual indeed in these poor times! Thanks to the Author, however, to you especially, for all your gifts and goodnesses, many kind thanks.</p>
<p>I could not get out, that Thursday;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500129-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1850-01-29">29 Jan.</date></ref></note> we were all packed into a heap,&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> too, by a &#x2018;prevenient&#x2019; ride in the rain; and feeling like a cannon-ball fairly shot off, and incapable of pausing till it got <hi rend="italic">home.</hi> But I do surely determine to come out expressly to Weybridge, and spend a day there till the last Train that will leave me at Wandsworth:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A borough S of the Thames.</note> and so soon as the Sun has got any steady mastery (about a fortnight hence perhaps), I will practically study the Railway Book, and see whether in fact it cannot be done, there and then.</p>

Many thanks to you for it: a substantial massive Book, both in figure and contents; carefully got up; from which I intend to get a great deal of pictorial information, as the calls into that field of inquiry shall from time to time turn up for me.&#x2014; I observe, as a patriotic Scotchman, some neglect of that department by your last Editor: it does not contain much, but it does a little, and <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of that is all he gives. There is one Engraver, <hi rend="italic">Deuchar</hi>, an Engraver or Etcher (died about the beginning of this Century I think) whose works are in high request;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Deuchar.</note> his name is not given at all.

His power of <hi rend="italic">drawing</hi> is extremely insignificant; but he generally catches a very recogniseable Likeness, and he overflows with a kind of plebeian and quietly Scotch-backguard <hi rend="italic">fun:</hi> not a high man, yet a kind of real one!

(<date when="1886">1886</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889">89</date>).</note> whom I have seen in Edinburgh: he died about twenty years ago, leaving no adequate memorial of himself in the way of painting, tho&#x2019; some of his Portraits that I have seen seem to me the very best I ever saw of these generations:&#x2014;in fact, the poor old fellow had been imprisoned by Buonaparte in Italy, almost shot as a spy &#x26;c; was moreover of a fiery indignant nature, the implacable foe of every kind of cant; and had, in his rage against the ways of the world, very much withdrawn himself from it, and passed for having a kind of <hi rend="italic">crack</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; his only crack, I rather fancy, was what I describe, immeasurable indignation against the genus <hi rend="italic">Humbug</hi>, and a kind of imperial pride-and-poverty, and divine defiance, to which this had reduced him. He chose faces <hi rend="italic">himself;</hi> could not be <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> to paint faces he disliked; to a Lady of rank who pressed him and again pressed him with questions, &#x201C;Why won&#x2019;t you paint me?&#x201C; he answers, &#x201C;Good God, Madam, is it nothing to <hi rend="italic">raise the price of yellow-ochre</hi>, think you?&#x201C;&#x2014; Poor old fellow, I remember him well, tho&#x2019; I only once saw him, and that on the street, one summer morning early: lean as wood, brown as a berry, with the cleanest skin and linen, the sharpest eagle-face and the fiercest eye. He was an <hi rend="italic">original</hi>, and came of such.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>A thousand thanks for this gracious Assyrian Tobacco, which has agreeably astonished my mind;&#x2014;of which I will straightway smoke a pipe, in honour of you, before going out into the Sun!

Your story will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> get itself told so that men can understand it, you poor wretch!&#x201C;&#x2014; We must try, we must try.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to you last night about some triviality in the Polemical-Press line; Rowland Hill will bring it you before dinner.&#x2014; &#x2014; Again I ask, is there no hope of you this night at the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Noble Heart</hi>&#x201C;?</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>Many thanks for your little Note; which I was right glad to read this morning. I am very glad to hear you express your adherence to the painful doctrine I set forth; it is really a terrible job,&#x2014;so <hi rend="italic">lonely</hi> as I am, no man sharing my adventure, only all men looking at me in it as they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do at a man walking perilously on the roof-ridges,&#x2014;asking themselves, &#x201C;When will the dog <hi rend="italic">fall?</hi>&#x201C; He won&#x2019;t if he can help it, friends; and he has a bit farther to go!&#x2014; Almost 30 years back, I can recollect the poor little <foreign><hi rend="italic">craw</hi></foreign> <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi> running tripping about my feet, eager to catch what I said, when Jack and Alick were with me; and I have always respected her rugged veracity and strength of natural judgement, and been very glad to be approved by her.</p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>Your announcement very much surprises me, not surely in an unpleasant way; and I beg in the mean time to thank you very cordially, you and my other young Friends in Aberdeen, for the honour you are doing me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proposing him as rector of Marischal Coll. and Univ., Aberdeen. The two divinity students were from a rival group (Anderson 359). One of TC&#x2019;s supporters, James Donaldson, later said that &#x201C;from the first&#x201C; they meant to propose TC but to &#x201C;elect him first and then ask him to accept.&#x201C; Hugh Miller and Dickens had refused to stand in <date when="1849">1849</date> against the same opponent, John Thomason Gordon, advocate. TC told Espinasse: &#x201C;&#x2018;I suppose &#x2026; the young fellows look on me as an embodiment of German neology.&#x2019; Of the rectorship, he said: &#x2018;It has nothing in itself, but it is thought to be something here&#x2019;&#x201C; (181). James Donaldson (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1915">1915</date>; <ref target="volume-25/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32856"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), later educationist, classical and patristic scholar; principal of St. Andrews Univ., <date when="1889">1889</date>&#x2013;<date when="1915">1915</date>; knighted, <date when="1907">1907</date>.</note> The Election to a merely formal Office, I suppose, may go this way or that, without momentous consequences but the fact that ingenuous young souls in your University, in poor old Scotland far away, are loyally disposed to me, and willing to testify that feeling by such methods as they have,&#x2014;this is already a possession, of a valuable and to me almost of an affecting nature, which I shall not have to part with.</p>
<p>With the Election itself I must not in the least interfere, for or against. In respect of personally visiting Aberdeen, too, I am constrained to say that travelling is at all times very untowardly to me, and that at present there are some special causes rather detaining me here;&#x2014;on the whole, that if there be no real duty, but only a formal or ceremonial one, to be done in Aberdeen, I had much better not come; but that if there do appear some real fraction of duty to be done, in the event of my Election, I will certainly make an effort to come. More I cannot say at present.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so, with many thanks and kind regards, I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>To Mrss. Thomson &#x26; Harper / &#x26;c Aberdeen University&#x2014;</p>
<p>I calculate you will beat down that money-account, too, and vanquish it yourself, which will be best any way. But if you cannot, if you find it beating <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, you know always where there is help.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>We got your Letter this morning, after long wearying for it; thanks to you. Jane says you are still in her debt. We concluded you were got sunk into your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi></foreign> task, and did not care to interrupt yourself. A brief Note very frequently, to mark where you are, and where the outer world about you is, will do no ill,&#x2014;none to you, and good to us.</p>
<p>I am glad indeed to hear of the goings on at Scotsbrig, and that all is still pretty well there,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; my Mother&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi>, and the interruption they bring to her reading, are a bad item. You did well to send for Garthwaite and get that Carpet despatched. I delight to think of my good old Mother having a comfortable Carpet to step on; and you may very confidently assure her, such a pleasure would have been cheap to me at ten times the &#x201C;expense&#x201C;!&#x2014; There is a good little Book here for her, which I myself will finish tonight,&#x2014;Vertot&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Revolut</hi>ns <hi rend="italic">of Sweden</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An English trans. of Abb&#xE9; Ren&#xE9; Aubert de Vertot, <hi rend="italic">Histoire des r&#xE9;volutions de Su&#xE8;de</hi> (Paris, <date when="1695">1695</date>).</note> really good reading,&#x2014;so soon as her eyes are better. I suppose you direct her in the mean time to give her eyes holiday rather, however she may weary. I wish you had some of our fine <date when="--02">February</date> days for her: occasionally quite beautiful days, tho&#x2019; we have a share of mud and tempest still: but we are about a fortnight ahead of you by the Almanac; wait a fortnight and you will be up to us.</p>
<p>The enclosed Letters are not good for much: but I wished my Mother to see the Aberdeen one, and to get your explanation of &#x201C;the Lord Rectorship,&#x201C; and what kind of wonderful Heroico-farcical Bacon&#x2019;s-play it is!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently referring to the magic wonders reputedly performed by Roger Bacon (<date when="1214">1214</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1294">94</date>), philosopher, scientist, and alchemist. In Scottish univs. the rectors presided over univ. courts, were elected by students, and were often absent.</note> Masson and Bain had called, the night before, and told me about such a thing they had seen in the Newspapers;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Masson and Bain had been Marischal College undergraduates. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1850-02-23">23 Feb.</date>, reported: &#x201C;The students of Marischal College, Aberdeen, are already astir regarding the election of Lord Rector.

To think of running a candidatecy,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> in such a ploy, along with his small redheaded Grace, and indeed of the thing altogether, <pb id="pg-25-33" n="25:33"/>tickles one a little not in a disagreeable way.

<p>Here is the Note for Hickson;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. E. Hickson, ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review.</hi></note> you will find him, according to general report, a hard man in regard to money matters,&#x2014;indeed I believe his poor <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> cannot stand generosity on that side:&#x2014;but he is a man of some shrewdness too; and I am not quite without hopes you may find him turn to some advantage for you in this or other instances.</p>
<p>I have written to Lewes too about you, and your project in reference to his Newspaper.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. H. Lewes was co-ed. with Thornton Leigh Hunt of the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, a weekly, the first number of which was to appear <date when="1850-03-30">30 March</date>.</note> He will perhaps call upon you; but I left that at his own option, so we will give him time as to that, having set the matter fairly before him.</p>
<p>We yesterday heard, with real sorrow, of the death of poor Miss Macready: poor girl, she had been bending visibly towards that still Mansion, for several months past,&#x2014;a pathetic sight to see. Thither, soon or late, we are all bound.&#x2014;</p>

So I must not spend much time in writing&#x2014;but I cannot send the order without a few lines that you may not think the hard winter has killed me or taken away my memory.

<p>&#x2026; This last Chapter is a great improvement on the three or four previous ones. I cannot understand what Geraldine means by showing up Seaforth in this way. Mrs. P.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth (Betsey) Paulet, Jewsbury&#x2019;s friend and then JWC&#x2019;s. After a close friendship with the Carlyles, both of whom visited her at Seaforth House, nr. Liverpool, she and Jewsbury had a deep disagreement toward the end of <date when="1849">1849</date>, when TC also told JWC to &#x201C;keep away&#x201C; from &#x201C;Pauletdom&#x201C; and &#x201C;pass it in silence,&#x2014;holding thy nostrils if needful!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490919-TC-JWC-01"><sic>24:240</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1849-09-19">19 Sept. 1849</date></corr></ref>). JWC refers to the current serialization of Jewsbury&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Marian Withers</hi>, in which she satirized the Paulets in Mr. and Mrs. Arls of Carrisford, he being of foreign extraction (as was &#xc6;tienne Paulet) and she with exaggerated social pretensions. It is not easy to make out the exact reason for the former friends&#x2019; differences, as original letters are lost. Jewsbury wrote to JWC, [<date when="1850-03-09">9 March</date>]: &#x201C;I send you a letter I have just received from&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;. I am going to see [Betsey] this afternoon; I am very sorry for her, and it is not now that I can recollect all the discrepancies in her conduct. I shall not get mixed up again in a Seaforth quicksand, but this is a case where, even if it were certain pain, I must run the risk. I am very, very unwell, sick, and ill, and good for nothing; and this letter has upset me more than I can tell you; there is nothing but trouble going on&#x201C; (Ireland 362). This probably refers to &#xc6;tienne Paulet&#x2019;s illness, followed by his sudden death, apparently in <date when="1850-04">April</date> or <date when="1850-05">May</date>; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500528-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1850-05-28">28 May</date>]</ref>.</note> and she are not such friends as they have been I think&#x2014;still anything like a coldness between them would have as little <hi rend="italic">tempted</hi> her as <pb id="pg-25-37" n="25:37"/><hi rend="italic">justified</hi> her for publishing anything that would annoy the Paulets&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ergo</hi></foreign> she must either be perfectly unconscious that she is drawing these flagrant likenesses or perfectly satisfied that Mrs. P. will take no more of it to herself than will be <hi rend="italic">pleasing</hi> to her. To do Geraldine justice she is extremely <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> in her <hi rend="italic">quarrels</hi>&#x2014;and would be more <hi rend="italic">tied up</hi> with a friend she had quarrelled with than one she was on the best terms with. What makes me think she can have no intention to <hi rend="italic">show up</hi> Mrs. P. nor fear of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> fancying <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, is that long ago&#x2014;Geraldine and Mrs. P. and I were to write <hi rend="italic">a book</hi> among us in the form of letters.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421221-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:246</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-12-21">21 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I told them to start it and I would take it up when I saw their scheme&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">did</hi> send me a screed of MS. which I augured no good of, it was so <hi rend="italic">stormy</hi>&#x2014;and so I backed out of my engagement, and then Mrs. P. gave up out of indolence&#x2014;and Geraldine went on&#x2014;and that beginning after all sorts of manipulating and <hi rend="italic">repairing</hi> in the Highlandman&#x2019;s gun fashion,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning that both had altered and corrected everything so much that the original work was nearly new.</note> turned into <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi>&#x2014;but I remember much of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> tale that seems bare-faced painting of Seaforth was in these pages <hi rend="italic">they</hi> wrote between them!!</p>
<p>&#x2026; My little dog continues to be the chief comforter of my life&#x2014;night and day he never leaves me, and it is something, I can tell you, to have such a bit of live cheerfulness always beside one.</p>
<p>Elizabeth<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sprague, the maid.</note> has been to Exeter for a fortnight visiting her Parents and her sister Maria has been here in her stead. For the rest, Mr. C. is very busy with his pamphlets all the forenoons and in the evenings is generally at Bath House or elsewhere. I have got to-day some slips of the sweet briar and some others from Templand which I wrote to Mrs. Russell for&#x2014;the slips I got from the garden at Haddington having taken root. <closer><salute>Love to all.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>The Pamphlet N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3, &#x201C;Downing Street,&#x201C; has so swollen, it has been obliged to break itself into two; N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4 will be &#x201C;The New Downing Street&#x201C;&#x2014;both of them big enough, or too big. I have just ended N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3; Robson may have it at press, if he like, in two days. N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4 also, both on <hi rend="italic">Robson&#x2019;s</hi> part and on mine (especially on his, for I have to patch and pick and <hi rend="italic">shift</hi>) is pretty well forward,&#x2014;indeed almost done too, on R&#x2019;s part.</p>
<p>Now what I want you to consider is, whether N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4 might not be announced for <date when="1850-04-15">April 15</date>&#x2014;with N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5, which is called &#x201C;Stump Orator&#x201C; (all about Parliamentary balderdash &#x26;c), to follow on the <date when="1850-05-11">11th of May</date>? I should get sooner thro&#x2019; my Dozen, for one thing!&#x2014; Both the <hi rend="italic">Downing Streets</hi> treat essentially of the same subject; have allusions to Peel &#x26;c;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had greatly changed his mind about Sir Robert Peel since caricaturing him as Sir Jabesh Windbag in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present.</hi> In &#x201C;Downing Street&#x201C; Peel is regarded as the Hercules needed to cleanse the Augean stables of Downing St. &#x201C;high-piled with the droppings of two-hundred years.&#x201C; In &#x201C;The New Downing Street&#x201C; he is said to be the one man &#x201C;authentically called to a post of difficulty &#x2026; . He has but to lift his finger in this enterprise, and whatsoever is wise and manful in England will rally round him&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:91, 169).</note> and might be more in their place <pb id="pg-25-41" n="25:41"/>and time just now while the Ministry<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Lord John Russell, in office since <date when="1846">1846</date>.</note> is staggering, than farther on.

Those are all <hi rend="italic">my</hi> considerations; now give me yours, or in brief the decision you arrive at on your side.</p>

The discordant <hi rend="italic">noise</hi> raised about these publications is immense,&#x2014;mostly in the way of <hi rend="italic">censure</hi> (I believe) from the poor fry of people that write reviews; but here and there I catch too some valuable quiet vote in the other direction; and believe it is all right not the less.&#x2014; N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3 is done, after a hard fight; it is much inferior to N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2, but we couldn&#x2019;t help it.

<p>I do not recollect your young Lady out of the group I saw once at Rugby,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Arnold was headmaster of Rugby School <date when="1826">1826</date>&#x02013;<date when="1842">42</date>; TC visited him there <date when="1867-06">6</date>&#x02013;<date when="1842-05-07">7 May 1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420506-TC-MAC-01"><sic>14:180</sic><corr>TC to MAC, [<date when="1842-05-06">6 May 1842</date>]</corr></ref>; the Arnolds had nine surviving children.</note> but they were all fine young creatures, pleasant to look upon outwardly and inwardly; and this one, I will say, must little resemble either Father or Mother, if your omens are not <hi rend="italic">good</hi> of their kind.

<salute>My good young friend,</salute>
<p>I am much obliged by the regard you entertain for me; and do not blame your enthusiasm, which well enough beseems your young years.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >White says that he was much influenced by TC and wrote to assure him at this time of uproar over the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> that &#x201C;there was at least one person who believed in him.&#x201C; Visiting TC in <date when="1868">1868</date>, White showed him this letter. TC had forgotten it but said that &#x201C;it is undoubtedly mine. It is what I have always believed. &#x2026; [It] has been so ever since I was at college. I do not mean to say I was not loved there as warmly by noble friends as ever man could be, but the world tumbled on me, and has ever since then been tumbling on me rubbish, huge wagon-loads of rubbish, thinking to smother me, and was surprised it did not smother me&#x2014;turned round with amazement and said, &#x2018;What, you alive yet?&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Pages from a Journal</hi> 2, 4).</note> If my Books teach you anything, don&#x2019;t mind in the least whether other people believe it or not; but do you for your own behoof lay it to heart as a real acquisition you</p>
<p>have made,&#x2014;more properly, as a real message left with you, which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must</p>
<p>set about fulfilling, whatsoever others do! This is really all the counsel I can give you about what you read in my Books or those of others: <hi rend="italic">practise</hi> what you learn there; instantly, and in all ways, begin turning the belief into a fact, and continue at that,&#x2014;till you get more and ever more beliefs, with which also do the like. It is idle work otherwise, to write Books or to read them.</p>
<p>And be not surprised that &#x201C;people have no sympathy with you&#x201C;; that is an <pb id="pg-25-44" n="25:44"/>accompaniment that will attend you all your days if you mean to lead an earnest life. The &#x201C;people&#x201C; could not save you with their &#x201C;sympathy,&#x201C; if they had never so much of it to give: a man can and must save himself, with or or without their sympathy, as it may chance.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And may all good be with you, my kind young friend;&#x2014;and a heart stout enough for this adventure you are upon: that is the best &#x201C;good&#x201C; of all.&#x2014; I remain</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother&#x2014;</salute>I have sent the nice little Letter of Canada <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> forward to Dumfries; and I here return the other. A Note <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Dumfries came along with it, which is also here. I sent Jean a Pamphlet by <hi rend="italic">post</hi> last night, she seemed so impatient. I also started some speculation to her about getting a better House for Jenny in the Troquier suburbs or some &#x201C;nice place,&#x201C; where one might have a furnished room, and run away to write &#x201C;Latter-Day Pamph<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">without</hi> some of the very sad accompaniments that attend them here! Which speculation I already perceive, this morning, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be likely to hold water. However, Jean was instructed to take it only as a <hi rend="italic">dream</hi>, and to do nothing practical without consulting me.&#x2014; Out of this sad wearing whirlpool, if my health do not considerably mend, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get: but the place whitherward&#x2014;is very difficult to fix on, and will hardly be in Dumfries I doubt.</p>

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>The Spirit moves me to write you a letter this morning; if I impose it on myself to begin with <hi rend="italic">excuses</hi>, the impulse will get overlaid by the difficulty of the thing, and stick short in a mere &#x2018;good intention&#x2019;; so here goes &#x201C;quite promiscuously.&#x201C;</p>
<p>I have little to tell you worth even a penny stamp&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">oneself</hi>&#x2014;at least <hi rend="italic">my</hi>self is a sort of irish-bog-subject in which one is in danger of sinking overhead&#x2014;common prudence commands therefore to &#x2018;keep out of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>,&#x2019; whatever else&#x2014;and my days do not pass amidst people and things so interesting in themselves, as to be worth writing about to one safe and sound on the outside of <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> as you are.</p>
<p>What good would it do you for example to have even the &#x2018;most graphic&#x2019; description of the great &#x2018;flare up&#x2019; we had at the Wedgewoods yesterday&#x2014;where all the Notabilities Mrs W had ever got a catch at, were hauled in, &#x201C;at one fell swoop,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 4.3.</note> making a sort of Tower of Babel concern of it; that has left nothing behind for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> &#x201C;as one solitary individual&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370811-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:278</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-11">11 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> but a ringing in my ears, and a dull headach?&#x2014; What a tenacity there must be in human nature, that people can go on to the oldest age with that sort of thing!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter and Pamphlet;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either <hi rend="italic">Killing No Murder, or the Effects of Separate Confinement</hi> (<date when="1846">1846</date>) or <hi rend="italic">A Letter on the Disadvantages and Extravagances of the Separate System of Prison Discipline for County Gaols</hi> (<date when="1848">1848</date>).</note> I am much gratified by your approval of the thing I say,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About model prisons; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500314-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1850-03-14">14 March</date></ref>. TC later recalled that when &#x201C;Model Prisons&#x201C; came out Laurie &#x201C;wrote me &#x2026; a knowing, approving, kindly and civil Letter; to which I willingly responded by a kindly and civil&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 246).</note>&#x2014;by your kind remembrance of me after such a lapse of time. Twenty-five years ago, I think: I can recollect as yesterday the day I met you in the Louvre, and went to dine with you in the Palais Royal;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In autumn <date when="1824">1824</date>; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241107-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:187</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-11-07">7 Nov. 1824</date></corr></ref>, where TC dines at the Palais Royal but Laurie not named. In his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> TC mentions his visits to the Louvre, &#x201C;alone or accompanied,&#x201C; where Laurie came on him and took him &#x201C;to dinner, and plenty of hard-headed London talk&#x201C; (270).</note>&#x2014;and much has come and gone since then!</p>
<p>My testimony in regard to Prisons may be considered as in some sort a voice of Nature; for I have never had the least concern with Prison-management; but the babble I have been obliged to read and hear upon it, for a long time past, has been extremely disgusting to me. If I could run a redhot poker thro&#x2019; the belly of all that scandalous nonsense, I would gladly do it!</p>
<p>I have read your Pamphlet; find it grounded upon the plainest common sense, and the conclusion it advocates (with many other conclusions which will grow out of that) to be <hi rend="italic">unavoidable.</hi> A certain Major Smith,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly William James Smythe, stationed in Nova Scotia, <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date>, currently at Woolwich.</note> a clever kind of man, called on me yesterday with magnificent plans he has of profitably <hi rend="italic">employing</hi> all manner of Criminals in making railways in N. America,&#x2014;one big railway from Halifax across to Vancouver&#x2019;s Island,&#x2014;which would indeed &#x201C;employ&#x201C; all the Criminals in Nature for many years to come, if he could get them fastened to it! He would put them under military law; get Officers from the Clubs to command them; &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014; In fact I often think it will come to this, That the State sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seize on every Criminal on his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> conviction of crime, and say to him, &#x201C;You are no longer <hi rend="italic">free;</hi> you are my Captive, bond-servant, soldier or even slave; and shall go with me, till I either drill you a little, or finding you <hi rend="italic">un</hi>drillable put a conclusion to the mischief of you in <pb id="pg-25-48" n="25:48"/>some good way!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; However this may be it is a clear case that the &#x201C;benevolent dodge&#x201C; is now nearly <hi rend="italic">out;</hi> and this will be a kind of deliverance, whatever come next.</p>

The Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations was to open, <date when="1851-05-01">1 May 1851</date>, under the patronage of Prince Albert.

A royal commission was issued on <date when="1850-01-03">3 Jan. 1850</date>, with Albert as chairman and a distinguished group of public men as members, including the prime minister; Cole was the executive committee&#x2019;s most active member. A building committee was appointed, which met in <date when="1850-02">Feb.</date>, considered the space and structure, chose a site in Hyde Pk., and announced an open competition for the design of the building but reserving the right to make its own plans if none of the entries proved satisfactory.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have hardly time at present to write the smallest answer; time to read a <pb id="pg-25-50" n="25:50"/>Manuscript (if I had faculty for such a thing, which I have not) does not lie before me for many months to come. Nor would it much avail in reference to your question, if I rightly understand the bearings of that. You do not, I presume, think of publishing on your own account; of sending, after your five-years trouble in writing, a good deal of money to follow it in printing?&#x2014; Such being the case, not my opinion but that of some practical Publisher and Seller of Books, is the only one that can avail you.</p>
<p>The enclosed Note to Mr Chapman will engage him in it to the due length, and I am sorry to confess my inability for more at present.</p>

<p>I hope to have done with the <hi rend="italic">rewrite</hi> of No 4 on Thursday or else Friday, and will bring it with me, being bound for the City directly after. I suppose you will be at your post, either afternoon?

<p>If you ever go to the British Museum, here is an enquiry for Mr. Watts<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Watts, on the staff of the museum.</note> and you. In one of Byron&#x2019;s works, I think the Age of Bronze, at its first appearance about twenty-five years ago, I read, among some bitter abuse of Lord Castlereagh and Company (how Castlereagh had &#x201C;opened his carotid artery,&#x201C; not cut his throat, &#x201C;bless their learning,&#x201C; with more of the like sort), a decided eulogy on Peel, B.&#x2019;s old schoolfellow.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cabinet minister Robert Stewart, styled Viscount Castlereagh before succeeding as 2d marquess of Londonderry, committed suicide. &#x201C;[T]he Minister was an elegant lunatic&#x2014;a sentimental Suicide&#x2014;he merely cut the &#x2018;carotid artery&#x2019; (blessings on their learning) &#x2026; &#x201C; (Pref. to cantos 6&#x2013;8, <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi> [<date when="1823">1823</date>]). Byron and Sir Robert Peel were at Harrow together, but there is no overt reference to Peel in any of Byron&#x2019;s poems. TC may have confused it with section 13 of <hi rend="italic">The Age of Bronze; or, Carmen Seculare et Annus Mirabilis</hi> (<date when="1823">1823</date>), where Byron followed his lines on &#x201C;lamented Castlereagh / Whose pen-knife slit a goose-quill t&#x2019;other day&#x201C; (538&#x2013;39), with lines on George Canning: &#x201C;Our last, our best, our only orator / Even I can praise thee&#x2014;Tories do no more&#x201C; (552&#x2013;53). See also &#x201C;There were always great hopes of Peel, amongst us all &#x2026; and he has not disappointed them&#x201C; (Thomas Moore, <hi rend="italic">Letters and Journals of Lord Byron</hi> [<date when="1830">1830</date>] 1:41).</note> Byron testified to this effect:&#x2014; &#x201C;There is but one man of real talent among them, and I never will believe but <hi rend="italic">he</hi> one day will see through all that d&#x2014;d nonsense, and come out of their squad.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Now I want a copy of these words: they are not given in Murray&#x2019;s late edition of the works;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The most recent of John Murray&#x2019;s editions of Byron&#x2019;s works was in 17 vols. (<date when="1845">1845</date>).</note> nor perhaps anywhere except in the first or early editions? I am very sure of having read said words about the time I mention. &#x2026;</p>

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>I came back from Addiscombe on Thursday afternoon and ever since have <pb id="pg-25-55" n="25:55"/>been spending half my time in bed. of course I caught a bad cold. that house being <hi rend="italic">incapable</hi> of getting itself heated in cold weather&#x2014; Fortunately the mischief lying in me did not <hi rend="italic">explode</hi> until the day after my return&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">there</hi>,I kept up appearances well enough, and <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I can get my bed kept without annoyance to anybody, except perhaps poor little Nero, who feels it his duty to remain there while I do, and has nobody to take him out for a run&#x2014;besides missing various lumps of sugar and occasional windfalls of that sort which make life more of a pleasure to him when I am on foot&#x2014;</p>
<p>He has had another wonderful escape that dog! I begin to think he &#x201C;bears a charmed Life.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 5.7.</note> This time the danger was entirely of his own seeking. Imagine his taking it into his head that he could <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>&#x2014;like the birds&#x2014;if he tried! and actually trying it&#x2014;out at the Library window! For a first attempt his success was not so bad; for he fairly cleared the area spikes&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> plash down on the pavement at the feet of an astonished Boy he broke no bones, was only quite <hi rend="italic">stunned.</hi> He gave us a horrid fright however&#x2014; It was after breakfast, and he had been standing at the open window, watching the birds&#x2014;one of his chief delights&#x2014;while Elizabeth was &#x2018;dusting out&#x2019; for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;Lying in my bed, I heard thro the deal partition Elizabeth scream; &#x201C;Oh God! Oh Nero!&#x201C; and rush down stairs like a strong wind out at the street door&#x2014; I sat up in my bed aghast&#x2014;waiting with a feeling as of the Heavens falling till I heard her re ascending the stairs and then I sprang to meet her in my night shift. She was white as a sheet, ready to faint&#x2014;could just say; &#x201C;Oh <hi rend="italic">take</hi> him!&#x201C; the dogs <hi rend="italic">body</hi> lay on her arm! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Is</hi> he killed?&#x201C; I asked with <hi rend="italic">terrible selfpossession</hi>&#x2014; &#x201C;Not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi>,&#x2014;I think,&#x2014;all <hi rend="small-caps">but</hi>!&#x201C; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C came down from his bed-room with his chin all over soap and asked; &#x201C;has anything happened to Nero?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh Sir he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have broken <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his legs, he leapt out at <hi rend="italic">your</hi> window!&#x201C; &#x201C;God bless me!&#x201C; said M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and returned to finish his shaving&#x2014; I sat down on the floor and laid my insensible dog over my knees, but could see no <hi rend="italic">breakage</hi>&#x2014;only a stun&#x2014; So I took him to bed with me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">under</hi> the clothes&#x2014;and in an hours time he was as brisk and active as ever. I wonder if he intends to persevere in learning to fly&#x2014;for I dont think either my own or my maids nerves can stand it.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Nobody can well be <hi rend="italic">busier</hi> than I at present: but here is a little message for you. I am just about fairly <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> my N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4 (which comes out on the <date when="1850-04-15">15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of April</date>); and I mean to have <hi rend="italic">one</hi> silent day, walking out among the heaths, <pb id="pg-25-57" n="25:57"/>before I begin N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5. This is fine sunny weather (tho&#x2019; with frost still), and most agreeably <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, today being what they call &#x201C;Good Friday,&#x201C;&#x2014;an old festival of the Church, now chiefly employed by the mass of the English population in taking jaunts into the country, comforting their souls with beer, and eating a kind of puffy butter-<hi rend="italic">scons</hi> called &#x201C;cross-buns,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">cookies</hi> with a cross stamped on them,&#x2014;sacred to this good day! Not sleeping well, I went out for a walk this morning; all was grey, dim, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">snell</hi></foreign> as winter: but at the &#x201C;Original Chelsea Bunhouse&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Old Original Chelsea Bun House,&#x201C; est. <date from="1601" to="1700">17th cent.</date>, taken down in <date when="1839">1839</date>. The new bakery took the name of the old.</note> (for we pique ourselves on our fame for buns), there was a gathering as of people about the drawing a lottery; I stept near, it was poor souls crowding forward for their <hi rend="italic">buns</hi>, and Baker and Wife serving them eagerly out of door and window: all <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> too,&#x2014;an affair of real business, and no mistake. At richer doors, as I walked along, Baker&#x2019;s men were delivering the same sacred very edible article; at one particular door, it seemed to me as if the maid were taking about five dozen or so;&#x2014;many children, and their bits of appetites good! &#x201C;Got your <hi rend="italic">buns</hi>, old boy?&#x201C; the workmen said to one another as they hurriedly saluted. A fine <hi rend="italic">well-living</hi> people this,&#x2014;after all!</p>
<p>The noise about these Pamphlets is very great, and not very <hi rend="italic">musical</hi>,&#x2014;but indeed I take care <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to hear it, so don&#x2019;t care. Chapman is about printing the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> thousand of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1, which he thinks naturally is good work. What he means to give <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, I do not yet ascertain; but have decided that he shall let me know accurately in black on white within a week,&#x2014;while I have the hank in my own hand!&#x2014; &#x2014; Meanwhile, dear Mother, here is a little fraction of actual money come to me for them from America! A certain <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Chapman<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman.</note> here (John knows him) called the other morning with an offer of &#xa3;4&#x201C;10 for a copy of each N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">one steamer</hi> before it was published.&#x201C; I instantly said, &#x201C;Done!&#x201C; He has got the first accordingly, and paid me for it; the second he will get in about a week, and pay me for it;&#x2014;and I decide to give these two American first windfalls, one of them to Jane, and the other to my good old Mother by way of gratification to myself. Jane has got hers; and here is yours dear Mother,&#x2014;buy yourself something you may like with it, or make some loved soul a gift out of it,&#x2014;in short do yourself a little fraction of good with it, let me have that little pleasure to myself in secret! I have marked the Draught in John&#x2019;s name, who will give you cash for it on the spot (if he can), or easily get it for you.&#x2014; &#x2014; And so take care of the weather, dear Mother, and keep yourself snug till the <date when="--04">April</date> flowers come;&#x2014;and let me now go and <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> my sad <foreign>burble</foreign> of a job, and then get away out from these paper-clippings into the free air.</p>
<p>My affectionate regards to Jamie and Isabella: will somebody tell me if the <pb id="pg-25-58" n="25:58"/>Boys are at school, and how they are doing?&#x2014; Poor Jane has caught a kind of real <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> at last; but it seems fast going again, tho&#x2019; she is still a prisoner.</p>

Some days I go out in utter despair, and walk four hours over the heaths on the Surrey side,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S of the Thames.</note> rushing to and fro, all alone, in a very rabid humour;&#x2014;getting little good, however, by the operation after all!</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, I am at home and alone almost every evening; and shall be very glad, indeed, if you will come to me. From Friday eve till Thursday next,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Wed.</note> there is some dubiety about my being home, as a speculation of the country is in the wind; but after or on Thursday of next week I have no engagement at all, and am very apt, indeed, to be discoverable here any evening about seven o&#x2019;clock, with a cup of tea and some silly book before me. The new Downing Street, <foreign><hi rend="italic">talis qualis</hi></foreign> [such as it is], is gone to press.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You favoured me with a Copy of Frances Cromwell&#x2019;s Petition about her <pb id="pg-25-60" n="25:60"/>Father&#x2019;s Body;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Cromwell (<date when="1638">1638</date>&#x2013;<date when="1721">1721</date>), Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s youngest child. At the Restoration, Cromwell&#x2019;s body was exhumed from Westminster Abbey, hung from a gibbet, and then buried at Tyburn; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440530-TC-AJS-01"><sic>18:53</sic><corr>TC to AJS, <date when="1844-05-30">30 May 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> a pathetic and interesting composition which I was glad to see.</p>
<p>Here among my old Papers, demanding to be burnt if it cannot somewhere be better disposed of, is a Memorandum which has long lain beside me concerning the Portrait of Oliver; involving also, I think, some notices of your relationship to him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Cromwell m., 2dly, Sir John Russell of Chippenham.

I decide to send you the Paper; that at least you, and not I, may take the charge of putting it into the fire. It has lain here many weeks, waiting some chance of meeting you; and now I will leave it at the London Library to see whether it can there fall in with you</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Nothing has gone wrong here; only we are terribly busy! Jane was to write to you today, I literally having not a moment; but, poor thing, she has got a headache, and proves not to have been able; so, not to alarm your imagination with a longer silence, I just before running out write you this word myself.</p>
<p>The change of weather from fierce dry frost to soft wet heat, I suppose has acted on the <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> of this and other households, a little; but surely we shall all profit by the change of weather, so soon as we get used to it. I am so worried and worked just now, I could not be well at any rate. The Pamphlet N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4 comes out on Monday; and then in a <hi rend="italic">fortnight</hi> more is another due (&#x201C;Stump Orator,&#x201C; I call that), with which I am now over head and ears! Never mind: in about a week I shall have it done; and then there will be some repose for us.</p>
<p>Tell Jack <hi rend="italic">the Leader</hi> shall be sent duly; I have ordered it &#x201C;till farther directions&#x201C;: it seems not a bad article hitherto; but I have my doubts about its going on well, nay some have doubts about its going on at all,&#x2014;the money funds are said to be short, among other things.</p>
<p>John Chorley is off for a sail to Gibraltar and a little walk in the south of <pb id="pg-25-63" n="25:63"/>Spain. Poor Chorley has been terribly off with his nerves, head &#x26;c this long while; and now he will try it a little, by &#x201C;throwing <foreign><hi rend="italic">a&#x2019; bye</hi></foreign>,&#x201C; which I think is a good plan. He used sometimes to be my company for half an hour, as I walked out of an evening: but he was never very first-rate company poor fellow, tho&#x2019; very friendly always; and is a kind of loss to me till he return.</p>
<p>Craik is here, home from Belfast, you can tell the Doctor; stands up, hot, for &#x201C;the Pamphlets,&#x201C; whenever I see him, which is rarely. Spedding<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Spedding, who lived in London, but possibly his brother, Thomas Storey Spedding, of Greta Bank, nr. Keswick.</note> too is come to Town, after a long absence; I expect to fall in with him soon. Other company we have but little that even <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> to be interesting. I, for my own part, generally prefer a walk along the dim pavements, which indeed is almost a nightly practice with me.&#x2014; We were out for some days, Jane for about a week, I for the concluding three days at Croydon with the Ashburtons; nobody there but a certain Miss Farrar and themselves; the Spring all looking beautiful in wood and field; much mirth also going on, on the chief Lady&#x2019;s part: but I felt unable altogether to taste those useful gifts; and indeed was much weaker than here at home, and right glad to get back again (as we did on Thursday): however, I suppose, it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> now turn to some account, and we shall feel a little fresher for the jaunt, when the old harness warms on us again.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Letter lay waiting me: I will send it for you if I can lay hand on it just now.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> is one of the best ever eaten.&#x2014; Farewell for this day, my dear old Mother. Tell John to write directly and assure us that you are well if he can. <closer><salute>Love and blessings to all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dearest Babbie</hi>,</salute>
<p>This is the only sheet of paper I have in the world, and I dare not interrupt Mr. C. at his <hi rend="italic">pamphlet</hi>, to borrow some, so I must write close and to the purpose. When I wrote last I was in the thick of a cold caught at Addiscombe&#x2014;that wound itself up with a little fit of <hi rend="italic">cholera</hi>, and then I went back to Addiscombe to get up my strength!! Mr. C. going this time for three days out of the six I stayed. Nobody else was there but Miss Farrar whom I like well enough in other people&#x2019;s houses&#x2014;in my own she is too riotous. Lady A. was <hi rend="italic">well</hi> this time and in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">tearing</hi> spirits&#x201C; very kind and somehow I felt more <pb id="pg-25-64" n="25:64"/><hi rend="italic">comfortable</hi> than usual in most respects, but there was one grand drawback quite fatal to my enjoyment&#x2014;in consequence of my cholera I suppose, there commenced the very day I left home an outrageous pimple on the very top of my nose, making me really &#x201C;too ugly for anything&#x201C; and so painful that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not get it forgotten if I had had philosophy enough to forget it for a moment. Could there be a more unsuitable position for transacting such a thing? it only reached its &#x201C;culminating point&#x201C; the day I came away&#x2014;and has since been gradually subsiding, but there is still a <hi rend="italic">redness</hi> very distressing to my own sense of the beautiful as well as to other people&#x2019;s. The only person who put me at ease about it was Anthony S.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling.</note> who when I told him how it had annoyed me at Addiscombe exclaimed cordially&#x2014;&#x201C;Damn your nose! for a sensible woman you have really the <hi rend="italic">oddest</hi> ideas! as if anybody <hi rend="italic">really attached</hi> to you could love you an atom less if you were all covered over with small-pox!!!&#x201C; I should not like however to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> human love with permanent small-pox.</p>
<p>I wrote a scolding letter to Helen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> the other day&#x2014;I had not got a word from Maryland Street and can see that she is letting herself get <hi rend="italic">imprisoned</hi> in the details of her own sick body. She had not written to Miss Sketchley either&#x2014;very wrong to neglect the letters of a person fallen into poverty, and consequently more sensitive to attentions! If anybody has a right to remonstrate with another for <hi rend="italic">giving up</hi> to the egoistic temptations of long-continued ailment it is surely I who have felt them so strongly and have for so many years <hi rend="italic">kept them under</hi> by efforts like to tear the life out of me. If Helen could just <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> for an hour the bodily sensation and consequent mental depression with which I go to most parties and do most of the things my hand finds to do, she would know that she is not entitled to occupy herself exclusively with the cares for herself. She <hi rend="italic">had</hi> written however a nice long letter which crossed mine&#x2014;and the next day came a good-natured note, really she had taken my hard sayings extremely well! My paper is getting filled. I send you <hi rend="italic">a royal invitation</hi>&#x2014;as a curiosity in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Provinces</hi>&#x201C; and to make you <hi rend="italic">great</hi> in the eyes of Mr. Liddle!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the family of the Welshes&#x2019; Liverpool friends; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440707-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:112</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-07-07">7 July 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> I should not wonder if he would like to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> it of you!&#x2014;I will also send one of these days a vol. of sermons to Walter <hi rend="italic">as a model!</hi> they are considered wonderfully fine, and were recommended to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by Thomas Erskine<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine of Linlathen, nr.

<p><salute>Dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>You seem to me evidently a brave, sincere, clear-sighted man; but I grieve to perceive also that you are labouring under a sad delusion.</p>
<p>These Papers, as I turn them over, painfully shew me an earnest soul of a man passionately endeavouring to solve problems which <hi rend="italic">transcend the human intellect</hi>,&#x2014;and which every healthy human intellect, I think, will do well to keep clear of, and leave lying quiet. Alas, I cannot buy your Papers; to me they are not worth anything; and I fear even among Publishers, whose trade it is to buy such things, there will not any be found to whom they are worth money. Forgive me if I say again, the sight of a man like you, capable of so many manful things as your life already has given proof of, engaged in labyrinths of metaphysical theologies and teleologies, is positively distressing to me. I can have no doubt but that &#x201C;sign&#x201C; you talk of was solely the product of excited feelings and diseased or overwrought nerves:&#x2014;and my clear and anxious advice to you would be, To sweep all that <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi> concern into the corner; to forget the Quakers and their &#x201C;Peace&#x201C; moonshine, and all that you have written or meant to write,&#x2014;and to return resolutely and at once into some concrete practical pursuit again. Your old manful business of seaman for example? That is a trade where a man&#x2019;s thoughts, brought into hourly contact with the great <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> of Nature, compose themselves into <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> utterances, or wise silences and actions, which are better for a man than all the Books that can be written for him by himself or others. Fly to practice again, I advise you! Fly to Nature and her facts, and gather health there, as a sick child from the bosom of its mother!</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi> is left with the servant here, to be called for at your pleasure. I have spoken with all sincerity, the rather because I find much that is estimable in you, and heartily wish you well.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>After a very hard tussle I got done, or as good as done, with the &#x201C;Stump Orators,&#x201C; yesterday towards six p.m.,&#x2014;a most wearied but greatly alleviated man. Today I have a mass of twiddle-twaddle Notes to answer,&#x2014;alas, I have the Commercialities of Chapman to overhaul, and pin firmly down, before starting to write again;&#x2014;not to speak of a little recreation, a day or two of &#x201C;walking&#x201C; which I mean to give myself, too. Here therefore extreme <hi rend="italic">brevity</hi> behoves.</p>
<p>We are well enough,&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">us.</hi> I especially complain of nothing but sickly irritations all over, my beautiful <hi rend="italic">local</hi> disorder (of course) in great vigour, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Jane, too, can go long walks with Nero, and stir about:&#x2014;in fact we fight along, very much as usual, with such adjuncts as you see.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Thom</hi> letter has lain till today unanswered. The poor soul&#x2019;s &#x201C;Copyright&#x201C; is of course as unsaleable, as a cartload of wet Breckonbeds<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marshy land in Annan parish at Breckonbeds steading, or farm.</note> bog w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> <pb id="pg-25-67" n="25:67"/>be in a Newcastle overwhelmed with <hi rend="italic">coals:</hi> but a glance at the poor Book teaches me that there must be <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> in that poor fellow, and that he must have played a stubborn stick in the fight hitherto. Perhaps in America, if he will be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> and give up scribbling, some help might be given him? I have afar off indicated that:&#x2014;and I now want that Jamie w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell me candidly thro&#x2019; you (having first made due practical inquiry) what Thom&#x2019;s character and life has hitherto been. Bid Jamie ask <hi rend="italic">practically</hi>, and communicate.&#x2014; My Mother shall have <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> on monday again, I hope, and a Letter soon!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Having now got rid of <hi rend="italic">Stump-Orator</hi>, I find that it will be good, before going farther, to get to some definite arrangement about the finance question; and have one&#x2019;s head no longer bothered with that poor ambiguity,&#x2014;when there are so many weightier continually demanding to be settled.</p>
<p>The scheme of &#x201C;Half-profits&#x201C; I consider to be entirely inapplicable to the case; inasmuch as the &#x201C;risk&#x201C; was evidently from the first <hi rend="italic">nothing;</hi> and I could myself, with perfect freedom, have ventured all the outlay upon the thing, certain that at least that was sure enough to be repaid. Nor do I wish to enter upon Printer&#x2019;s Accounts &#x26;c &#x26;c; which would carry me far beyond my depth before I got to clear satisfaction in them.</p>
<p>Judging by analogy of Books, and such light as I can get on this matter from the outside; and being withal very desirous to have it off my hands, and be at liberty to work without that extraneous coil to obstruct me,&#x2014;I propose in brief this arrangement as at once clear and fair:</p>
<p>1. That I shall be bound to go on to the length of at least <hi rend="italic">Twelve Pamphlets</hi>, whereby the Enterprise will <hi rend="italic">spontaneously</hi> advertise itself to the due pitch, more and more, and the cost of <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> advertisements will be more and more spared to you.</p>
<p>2. That for each Pamphlet which reaches a sale of 2000 or more (or rather I should say, in business language, &#x201C;of which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> see good to <hi rend="italic">print</hi> 2000 or more,&#x201C; for that is the meaning), I shall be paid (due at the time of publication) <hi rend="italic">Ten Pounds per Thousand:</hi> &#xa3;30 if you print 3 thousand, &#xa3;20, if you print 2; &#xa3;40 if 4,&#x2014;&#xa3;45 if 4500 &#x26; so on in the like proportion</p>
<p>This is a very clear arrangement; and so far as I can judge, ought to be satisfactory to both parties. It will not cost one word of talk when the hour of settlement comes; and if you agree to it now, this is the last time it will require to be spoken of at all.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I think it was but the day before yesterday that I wrote to John, considerably at length, along with the Pamphlet; so I have not much to say today,&#x2014;in fact, properly nothing at all. But here is a Yankee Newspaper that came yesterday, with a dud of a criticism in it; which, rather than burn it in the fire, I may as well send you to read and then to light your pipe with.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly &#x201C;The Scoffer and the Servile,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Boston Liberator</hi>, <date when="1850-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, on the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>.</note> This is getting a very unruly world; and people speak in a loud irreverent voice now everywhere!</p>
<p>Thank John, and Jamie too, for the pains they have taken about Thom. The poor slut has never written to me again; from which I partly infer that he does not share my great indifference to his &#x201C;Literature,&#x201C; but has still some view of trying to work with that in America. However, if he do write again, I shall now know, by Ferguson&#x2019;s testimony and Miss Little&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Ferguson and the Littles not further identified, but see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220923-TC-MAC-01"><sic>2:163</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1822-09-23">23 Sept. 1822</date></corr></ref> for other Littles of Cressfield.</note> pretty well how I am to construe him.</p>
<p>I am very glad you have got into a new Bed, dear Mother! That was an excellent advice of the Doctor&#x2019;s: you will be much snugger there, I hope&#x2014; That is one good we have got out of the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets;</hi> and if that should be the only one, it is still something!&#x2014; &#x2014; Jean writes today that she is quite afoot again; she described herself as writing to you to the same effect just then.</p>
<p>We went yesterday to dine with Neuberg at Hampstead (a small party, Scott, Wilkinson &#x26;c,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. J. Scott and Dr. James John Garth Wilkinson.</note> no great shakes of a party), at a Tavern called &#x201C;Jack Straw&#x2019;s Castle,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An old inn at Whitestone Pond and Spaniards Rd., Hampstead Heath.</note>&#x2014;and got home with less damage than usual. It was the &#x201C;Golden-marriage day&#x201C; (Jack will explain that) of Neuberg&#x2019;s father and mother in Germany.&#x2014; &#x2014; Oh dear good mother, how thankful sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> we be, how &#x201C;glad&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">are</hi> we, to hear still that you are well!&#x2014; <closer><salute>My affection to all of them at Scotsbrig.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Surely you have not laid out a penny to greater advantage this long while; many thanks to you for it! Jenny told us merely the historical fact; but that was grave enough to us; and I have had a continual secret anxiety about you,&#x2014;and still have, tho&#x2019; matters are reported well hitherto. For all sakes take care of yourself still; keep out of noise and excitation, to the utmost possible extent be quiet and careful for a week or two! I resist much ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> those well-meaning Callers &#x26;c tho&#x2019; it cannot be helped; I wish you had been screened against the Wednesday&#x2019;s tumult. And poor Jenny,&#x2014;it would have been much better, could she have staid with you, and seen her duty to be there rather than in the Kirk, which has turned out so ill with her.&#x2014; On the whole the weather is hard and bad, a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> your adventure is not a good one: I pray you use all care to get handsomely out of it;&#x2014;and let us hear, in a day or two again (sooner if anything go <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>), how you get on, till all (please Heaven) be well again.</p>
<p>I am still full of business; struggling now with N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6, which is to be calle<supplied>[d]</supplied> &#x201C;Parliaments,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To be pbd. <date when="1850-06-01">1 June</date>.

The &#x201C;New Downing Street,&#x201C; I fancy has not yet reached Dumfries; but it will surely come,&#x2014;and be welcome, as <hi rend="italic">new</hi> potatoes always are, however late the season. I could have sent it too by post, very easily; but I judged there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be little delay,&#x2014;and that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be like buying new vegetables (as they do here just now at extravagant rates) <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the due season for th<supplied>[em.]</supplied> &#x201C;Stump Orator&#x201C; (a command to all men to hold their tongues more) is lying ready ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Wednesday first:&#x2014;I begin now to look <hi rend="italic">down-hill</hi>, or almost downhill, over my contemplated Dozen; and can hope I shall get wrestled thro&#x2019; them,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the outlook farther on is very dim yet.

<p>I stopped your Newspaper, as ordered: the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> is a very good Paper hitherto; indeed I take it out as the best I can get here for my own use. Jack gets it all Tuesdays: if you bid him, I suppose, he could send it on to you after Mother &#x26; he have done with it. The Paper has a <hi rend="italic">socialist</hi> tendency (it is understood), but they keep that under hatches pretty well.

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>It was full time you should write! I had just settled it in my own mind that you were fallen ill, and <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not write&#x2014;and had romantic little ideas about setting off to help to nurse you!&#x2014; It is &#x201C;all right&#x201C; however, and the rightest part of it is that you are coming back&#x2014; I assure you your absence made a great blank in my existence, such as it is, and I have never even <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> to fill it up&#x2014;expecting from month to month that you would return to occupy my vacant &#x2018;first floor&#x2019; (<hi rend="italic">morally</hi> understood) It is amazing how much good one fancies one might get of an absent friend compared with the good one <hi rend="italic">takes</hi> of him when he is <hi rend="italic">there!</hi> So many things one says to him <hi rend="italic">mentally</hi> at a distance, which face to face one would never utter a word of!&#x2014; I hope you will find Nero all you could wish in a dog connected with the family; I shall take care that he be well washed to receive you&#x2014;and not over-full; when he is apt to be, I will not say less affectionate, but less demonstrative than one likes&#x2014;in a dog. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said he wrote that the upstairs room was or would be <hi rend="italic">in <pb id="pg-25-74" n="25:74"/>great beauty</hi> I have indeed been doing a little Martha-tidying<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like that of Martha, sister of Lazarus; see Luke 10:40&#x2013;41.</note> there, the results of which promise to be &#x201C;rather exquisite.&#x201C; God defend me from ever coming to a fortune! (a prayer more likely to be answered than most of my prayers!) for then the only occupation that affords me the slightest self-satisfaction would be gone! and there would remain for me only (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said of the Swiss Giantess who drowned herself) &#x201C;to summon up all the virtue left in me, to rid the world of such a beggarly existence.&#x201C; Speaking of suicide&#x2014;a woman came to me the other morning from <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell. The &#x201C;Swiss Giantess&#x201C; is unidentified.</note>&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">decent</hi> enough looking person <hi rend="italic">respectably</hi> dressed and the only suspicious looking feature in whose appearance was the <hi rend="italic">character</hi> she <hi rend="italic">gave herself</hi> for sobriety, charity, piety and all the virtues, Her business was to ask me to give the said Helen <hi rend="italic">a character</hi> that she might seek another place.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is no question of &#x201C;advances&#x201C; in this matter: what payment I get out of the Pamphlets, and whether I get it tomorrow, or this time twelve month, or this time ten years, is happily not a vital point with me at all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman wrote to TC, <date when="1850-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x201C;I was much disappointed with your letter of the 23<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> because I thought the principle on which the Pamphlets were to be published was a settled thing. / I have always been anxious to do what would be agreeable to you &#x26; make which concessions I could, as I have done on many occasions to my own detriment. For I find on looking into the matter that on all the books of yours I have printed I am actually out of pocket &#x2026; &#xa3;2 to &#xa3;300 &#x2026; without taking into account interest on capital returns &#x2026; a fact you will I daresay with difficulty believe, but the melancholy truth nevertheless. / Any plan that can be adopted to make the accounts easy to you, or to supersede the necessity of accounts, upon an equitable principle, I shall be most happy to adopt, but the plan you propose would be ruinous to me and injurious to the work for it would obviously be to my interest not to reprint the numbers after the first issue&#x2014;a thousand would not pay. I have looked again into the matter very carefully and find that the cost stands thus. / There have been printed of Nos 1 to 4 14,250 and sold<lb/><lb/>
       10,174 which produce        346<lb/>
       from which deduct cost      254<lb/>
                           ----<lb/>
                                    &#xa3;92<lb/>
        half of which is             46<lb/><lb/>
little enough certainly; but that I can&#x2019;t contrive.<lb/>
Now put it the other way&#x2014;<lb/><lb/>
                 cost                    254<lb/>
        &#xa3;10 p1000 to author     142.10<lb/>
                                 ------<lb/>
        deduct produce to present time   346.&#x2014;<lb/>
         E.C. out of pocket               50.10.0<lb/><lb/>
When all are sold they will produce about &#xa3;120 more from which take 50.10 &#x26; there remains to the publisher &#xa3;49.10 which after paying travel expenses &#x26; possibly a bad debt or two, would I submit leave me a loss. But all the stock would not sell off clear. From the irregular nature of the sale there <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be reprints and an irregular stock on hand much of which in the end will have to be sacrificed. A book published in this way, in pieces, is a very different thing from one published complete &#x2026; / I have no doubt but that in the end, if the expenses are kept down, the work will bring you as much as you wish, but I cannot afford it all at once in advance. I hope you will reconsider this matter &#x26; let things go on as they are going very smoothly and I need not say should you desire it that I shall be willing to make any reasonable advance.&#x201C;</note> The one indispensable thing is, that I have a fair, and above all a <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> bargain as to the matter; that so my imagination be no longer annoyed and confused by the prospect of an ugly pecuniary evil to unravel, at the end of all this hard work <pb id="pg-25-76" n="25:76"/>of another kind. Such a bargain, which we ought to have made before ever starting at all, will now require to be made before going farther.</p>
<p>I cannot go into that kind of accounts: five and twenty years ago, I learned that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were a quite bottomless uncertain affair for the like of me; I declined at that time <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted in MS. TC is presumably thinking of William &#x26; Charles Tait&#x2019;s publication of his <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, <date when="1827">1827</date>; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450624-TC-WT-01"><sic>19:85</sic><corr>TC to WT, <date when="1845-06-24">24 June 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> make any bargain on the &#x201C;half profit&#x201C; scheme; and certainly I shall not think of doing so now.</p>
<p>Pray let me know therefore, in some definite shape, what you can do that there be no doubt, or bother about it whatever, in time coming. Long ago at Forster&#x2019;s, I remember, you spoke about &#xa3;20 per Pamphlet if the sale reached 2,000; this is precisely the sum I now fix on, now when the sale extends into the <hi rend="italic">fours</hi> or towards them. What is <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> put into a <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> shape, is the thing I want;&#x2014;and this, so far as I can see into such matters, seems to me to be it.</p>
<p>If upon consideration you find that you have still nothing but &#x201C;half profit&#x201C; to offer me, or some lower sum than this I mention,&#x2014;the question will arise whether our Enterprise, in its current shape, ought not immediately to terminate? At the end of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6, then might a dart be drawn across the page,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the first edn. the division is made by a blank line before the last paragraph.</note> and some kind of conclusion, whether as pause or finale, be attained: what remains for me to say, I could manage to be said in other ways, perhaps less laborious to me, and certainly definite in their pecuniary issues at least.</p>
<p>The money you have &#x201C;lost&#x201C; by me I take as a piece of sad news,&#x2014;all the sadder as I am not the least conscious of its having come my way in the shape of &#x201C;gain.&#x201C; The fact is, I cannot understand it at all. Nor would I advise or wish that such a process on your part or any person&#x2019;s part should continue on my behalf!&#x2014; But I conclude you are only bantering me, and do not mean much by those doleful tidings.</p>
<p>All this is a sad method of furtherance for poor N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6, which is now on the anvil, and very rebellious there! But in fact he cannot help it, as things are. Better to front the ugly coil at this its early stage, and sort it now and here, than to let it go farther and grow bigger and more ravelled.</p>

<p>Here is the <hi rend="italic">Stump-Orator;</hi> I might have sent it on Saturday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Mon.</note> had I staid a little longer in, for the <hi rend="italic">Parcels-Company</hi> left it that day still in time for post,&#x2014;why published that day, I cannot tell:&#x2014;however, here it is, soon enough &#x201C;for all practical purposes&#x201C; I do imagine.</p>
<p>Chapman and I have exchanged missives (his, after long delay, came this morning) upon the subject of finance;&#x2014;and can, I am sorry to say, do nothing satisfactory on that matter hitherto. I demand &#xa3;10 per thousand Pamphlets; it was, if I remember, his own offer once long ago: he now shrieks at the idea of it,&#x2014;his letter, this morning, is really the letter of a beaver or badger, doing business in the publishing line;&#x2014;he grumbles and mumbles; dies away into &#x201C;Half-profits,&#x201C; or some other beautiful invisibility, which I have decided that I will by no means put up with.&#x2014; I have written him, accordingly, something to tickle his guns<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, perhaps for &#x201C;gums.&#x201C;</note> in the cold weather. Nay a prospect (welcome to <hi rend="italic">flesh and blood</hi>, in my weary cowardly state) rises of <hi rend="italic">closing</hi> the Pamphlets adventure with N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6; and writing what else I have to say in another form, and perhaps publishing it with another man! This, I think, will hardly be the way of it either; but so much, I have let Chapman see, may lie in the cards for us. We will wait how it turns out.&#x2014; I was deep in N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6, and shall finish that at any rate: alas, it is a hopelessly flat affair, and will never turn to much, let me hammer it as I will. The barking babble of the world continues in regard to these Pamphlets; hardly any wise word at all reaching me in reference to them: but I must say out my say in one shape or other,&#x2014;and will, if Heaven help me,&#x2014;not minding that at all. The world is not here for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> objects; the world is here for its own: let me too be here for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">my</hi> own&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Our weather is cold north-easterly: I hope my poor Mother does not suffer from it too much. It is good neither for skin nor heart. I feel my liver suffer from it; nay my very <hi rend="italic">corns</hi> get an additional poignancy. We must wait, and expect the West wind again.&#x2014; Chorley, I suppose, is at Gibraltar; his people,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother, Jane; his sister, Mary Ann (Phoebe); and his brother, Henry.</note> a week ago, had heard nothing direct from him. Craik is here; bustling about buying Belfast-Library Books; eating dinners; his manner more solidly official; his honest nose and countenance a shad<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> broader and more purply than heretofore. Alfred Tennyson came down with Fitzgerald one evening: <pb id="pg-25-78" n="25:78"/>very mouldery and dilapidated A. looks;&#x2014;does nothing but travel in railways and dine; his &#x201C;work-arm&#x201C; seemingly as good as broken.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson was readying <hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi> for publication, <date when="1850-06-01">1 June</date>, and was to marry Emily Sellwood, <date when="1850-06-13">13 June</date>. FitzGerald had gone to London, <date when="1850-04-17">17 April</date>, for ten days. &#x201C;Do you see Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2018;Latter-Day Pamphlets&#x2019;?&#x201C; he wrote to a friend the day he arrived. &#x201C;They make the world laugh, and his friends rather sorry for him. But that is because people will still look for practical measures from him: one must be content with him as a great satirist who can make us feel when we are wrong though he cannot set us right. There is a bottom of truth in Carlyle&#x2019;s wildest rhapsodies&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:668).</note> Spedding too I saw one day, he walked with me from Piccadilly down past this door; mild but unproductive:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The most pleasurable remembrance I had of my stay in town,&#x201C; FitzGerald wrote, &#x201C;was the last day I spent there&#x2014;having a long ramble in the streets with Spedding &#x2026; : then a walk with him and Carlyle across the Park to Chelsea, where we dropped that Latter Day Prophet at his house&#x201C; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:676).</note> Aubrey de Vere too one day, ditto ditto. No <hi rend="italic">human</hi> word, or hardly any, once in the month, is uttered to me by any fellow mortal: a state of things I have long bewailed, but learn ever better to endure, and silently draw inferences from.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Gentlemen</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>In reference to Mr. J. A. Scott, now a candidate for one of your Professorships, and for the Presidency of your new Institution, may I take the liberty to testify what long acquaintance has given me the means of knowing, that he is certainly a man of strong original intellect; of an ardent, earnest, and laborious character, at once zealous and discreet, who has made many fine acquirements both as a scholar and as a man; who possesses, for one thing, a distinguished talent for lecturing; and, I should expect, would excel much as a teacher, wherever that method came in play.</p>
<p>The scheme of your new College, or your plan of further developing it, is <pb id="pg-25-79" n="25:79"/>not known to me; but certainly, for such enterprises, this seems to be the kind of man. A man who, along with his remarkable faculties and energies, exhibits a depth of composure no less remarkable; who knows the means to ends, and can be reticent and patient as well as ardent: whatsoever such a man will deliberately undertake, he is likely to push it towards completion with great stedfastness, prudence and dexterity.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have now done N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6; and hasten to answer that the terms you have at last hit upon seem to me perfectly fair and clear, and are all that I require.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman wrote to TC, <date when="1850-05-07">7 May</date>. &#x201C;I am &#x2026; as desirous as you &#x2026; to have a <supplied>[fixed?]</supplied> payment for the Pamphlets; for many reasons, not the least of which are that you will be saved the trouble of investigating accounts and I shall be saved the thankless affair of rendering them. / No doubt you will remember when the project was discussed originally that the estimate was taken upon two sheets, or 32 pages, with occasional extensions of a few pages&#x2014;on which estimate the difference between the cost of sale of 2000 copies was taken at about &#xa3;30&#x2014;but the actual difference between the cost of sale of 2000 copies of No 1 is not &#xa3;15. This arises from the pamphlets extending much beyond the then supposed limits, and from their seeing many changes for corrections as shown by the enclosed memorandum. These profits are upon the sale of the entire impress of 2000 copies without making any provision for work cost of stock to such future sales. / &#x2026; / As I am however very desirous of meeting your wishes whenever I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do so I shall be willing to pay you &#xa3;10 for every 1000 copies sold (although it leaves me far too little profit) upon two other conditions which I am quite sure you will see the justice of &#x2026; . / Each pamphlet consists of 48 pages&#x2014; The cost of any pages beyond that number and the cost for correction beyond &#xa3;3 to be charged to you. / From time to time I am to print such numbers as I may deem necessary, and in the months <date when="--01">January</date>, <date when="--04">April</date>, <date when="--07">July</date> &#x26; <date when="--10">October</date> of each year to render to you a statement of the copies I have printed and sold since the last account and to pay you &#xa3;10 for every 1000 copies sold &#x26; in the same proportion for parts of thousands. / You misunderstood me respecting the deficiency on your books up to this time. I did not mean that I had lost between &#xa3;2 &#x26; &#xa3;300, but that faster than the money had been made it had been again sunk in new editions &#x26; and that that balance of cash is now against the works, in fact that in all your books printed since <supplied>[words illegible]</supplied> there is so much cash out of pocket. Of course I expect it will come back again with a profit &#x26; I only mentioned it to counteract the feeling that I know is entertained by most authors that the publishers get the profit to an enormous amount&#x2014;and the authors all the losses. / Surely it is not unreasonable that after a large outlay of capital for 8 or 9 years a successful series of books should leave the publisher with a balance of <hi rend="italic">metal</hi> in his pocket instead of it being all in paper at his warehouse.&#x201C;</note> So let us stand by them, and no more said.&#x2014;I find it an excellent condition (for me too) that <hi rend="italic">brevity</hi> is prescribed me under penalties! The sum you assign for corrections, I hope is sufficient&#x2014;doubtless you suppose and judge it to be so; and clearly, for your own safety, you are entitled to fix a limit. Let that stand also; let all stand,&#x2014;and now hands to work again!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote a receipt: &#x201C;Chelsea, <date when="1850-05-14">14 May, 1850</date>&#x2014; / received from Mr Chapman, for <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6 [&#x201C;Parliaments&#x201C;], Four pounds ten shillings on the part of the American publisher. / T. Carlyle / John Chapman Esq, Publisher. / 142 Strand.&#x201C; The American publisher was Phillips, Sampson, &#x26; Co., which printed all eight of the pamphlets; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500322-TC-CRO-01">TC-<sic>[CR?]</sic> <corr>[CRO]</corr>, <date when="1850-03-22">22 March</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>There is a <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> to Waterford by your first Irish Packet: if I cannot hit Robson&#x2019;s Boy with it (I always forget when he is <supplied>[here]</supplied>), will you send for it <pb id="pg-25-81" n="25:81"/><hi rend="italic">before</hi> any other Irish despatch leave you.&#x2014; The enclosed is one of the Notes that came thro&#x2019; you the other day. I conclude that the Irish <supplied>[illegible word]</supplied> in general is not very penetrable to you,&#x2014;from Belfast I heard there are no Pamphlets offered or to be had. Perhaps said <supplied>[illegible word]</supplied> is not much worth penetrating and permeating?</p>

At tea, talked to us, readily on slight hint from me, about Byron (<hi rend="italic">Birron</hi> he called him), and their old school-days&#x2014;kindly reminiscences, agreeable to hear at first hand, tho&#x2019; nothing new in them to us.&#x2014;&#x201C; TC&#x2019;s first dinner with Peel was <date when="1848-03-27">27 March 1848</date>; see Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:433&#x2013;34.</note> for Peel, I will surely come.</p>

<p>For the rest there is no harm done&#x2014;the clever honest head remaining on your shoulders all the same, to do work with some other instrument, if not with this one first tried.

There he saw a spider try six times to fix his web on a beam, succeeding on the seventh. Taking example from this, Bruce returned and became master of almost all Scotland. James Blomfield Rush was executed for murder, <date when="1849-04-21">21 April 1849</date>.</note> and of hundreds of other historical characters who have made even more than <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> trials before they got their thread to take hold.

It is absurd to hear a man of your years talk of people&#x2019;s good wishes for you having proved &#x201C;unavailing.&#x201C; There has not been time yet for their availing. I suppose <hi rend="italic">no</hi> man of talent&#x2014;real talent, I mean&#x2014;ever jumped into the right place for him until after a terrible deal of trying and struggling, if even then; but, if he has the talent, he may still &#x201C;thank God and write to his friends&#x201C; (as we used to say at Haddington).

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>Your Letter was very welcome to me; as any friendly, I may almost say as any human word, amid this barking of dogs deserves to be.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding wrote, <date when="1850-05-22">22 May</date>: &#x201C;I was going to write to you without knowing very well about what (only generally about No<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 1, 2, 3, &#x26; 4) when the Stump Orator arrived and pulled me up sharp&#x2014;for I could no longer commit the sin of inane speech and say I did it ignorantly. &#x2026; / If I apologize for any of the world&#x2019;s ways, it is not from sympathy &#x2026; , and I may the more freely state what perplexes me in your philosophy, seeing I agree with you in thinking that men are mostly blockheads. / But 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> with respect to the world, if it is God&#x2019;s world and not the Devil&#x2019;s, why should it be thought to be going always towards the Devil? / And 2<hi rend="italic">dly</hi>, with respect to Government, why should the government of the wisest be held indispensable in the world, when throughout the world&#x2019;s history it has in point of fact never been the rule, but only the exception? / It seems always to me that if the Supreme had intended the wisest to bear rule, he would have raised a succession of them constantly to the seat of authority. &#x2026; The <foreign>quam parv&#xe2; sapient&#xe2;</foreign> [with what little wisdom] was surely founded upon an extensive survey of human annals. / I therefore find a sort of comfort in believing that what we call Government <hi rend="italic">is</hi> really no more than Police&#x2014;and that Moral Guidance comes from other sources. The influence of wise men is doubtless as indispensable as salt in the Earth, but a people who could choose their wisest and place them always at the helm, would surely be already independent of governors. / &#x2026; / I do however seem &#x2026; to hope more things and to believe more things of the world than you do, and whether the difference is in the head or the stomach I cannot decide&#x201C; (pbd. K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle and the Speddings&#x2014;New Letters II,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Newsletter</hi> 8 [<date when="1987">1987</date>]:55&#x2013;56).</note> I perceive you still stand on the <hi rend="italic">doubting</hi> side, and have hopes in &#x201C;toleration,&#x201C; in things mending of their own accord, &#x26;c. &#x26;c. But you do not <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> the Devil to take me in this dangerous solitary course of mine; and that, as matters go, is something considerable.&#x2014; I am very sick and very busy; and cannot write except to say, Thanks and good luck to you. The day your Letter came, I snatched first one bit of paper (unfortunately not blank on both sides), then another bit; and splashed down some words in response to your objections: here they are, if you can read them;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1850-05-23">23 May</date>, following this letter.</note>&#x2014;they are then fit for the fire; and I ready for another Note when the good fit takes you.</p>
<p>It is uncertain whether there will, in all, be eight or twelve or even ten of these <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets:</hi> one thing is certain, I am bound by every consideration, human and divine to get <hi rend="italic">done</hi> as soon as possible; and seek some quiet place of refuge, should I go across the sea to find it. I am truly very ill;&#x2014;and not likely soon to be better, I am afraid.</p>
<p>It is written, &#x201C;Woe to them that are <hi rend="italic">at ease</hi> in Zion&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amos 6:1.</note> certainly that woe for one is not mine! I find Zion, this Zion of ours, a most delectable Devil&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-25-88" n="25:88"/>Dungheap built as high as the very stars over all of us, which calls on every son of Heaven to fire redhot shot thro&#x2019; it, according to ability! With or without shot, I see it shaking towards rapid destruction now, and believe the <hi rend="italic">Abyss</hi> will get it in one form or other before many years,&#x2014;and carry Russell along with it: that is my comfort.</p>

<p>1. The Devil doesn&#x2019;t quite get possession of this world <hi rend="italic">because</hi> certain souls live in continual horror and terror of his doing so;&#x2014;thus too, the thrifty labourer does not die of bankruptcy or starvation, because he sees continually the imminency of it, and by thrift and toil continually staves it off. The Souls that live in continual vigilant survey of the Advent of the Devil are not a kind of souls much to be envied in their generation; and if making life, for the moment, comfortable to oneself and neighbours were the end of living, these poor souls might be defined as undoubted <hi rend="italic">failures.</hi> In fact, they are an unhandy set of fellows, often spoiling pleasant company; and have provoked eupeptic persons many a time to start up suddenly, and hang them, or crucify them, or in some way <hi rend="italic">end</hi> them out of one&#x2019;s road. Nevertheless, if the number of such sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> unfortunately <hi rend="italic">diminish</hi> below par,&#x2014;it were like the Labourer&#x2019;s thrift and daily toil diminishing; and rapid destruction w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ensue.</p>

The peculiarity of certain times is that they <hi rend="italic">lose the very Ideal</hi>, and consider it moonshine or a dream of the speculative mind; and wise men, like T.S., express themselves content with a stuffed sack for chief governor, and declare that he and a street constable will do! These latter seem to me very peculiar, and also very alarming times&#x2014;quite diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from any that Oxenstiern ever dreamt of; and, indeed, unexampled under the Sun, except in England since the &#x201C;Nell-Gwynn Defender of the Faith&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eleanor (Nell) Gwyn (<date when="1650">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687">87</date>), mistress of Charles II.

Said extraordinary &#x201C;Defender&#x201C; (O God, Almighty Maker, how can any of us <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> at such a thing!) has introduced <hi rend="italic">new</hi> products and manifold elements not dreamt of in English or human History <pb id="pg-25-89" n="25:89"/>before.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I sent you a German Literary Gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> called Hartmann,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moritz Hartmann arrived in London at the beginning of <date when="1850-04">April</date>. Amalie B&#xF6;lte introduced him to TC at Cheyne Row, <date when="1850-04-05">5 April</date>, and reported that &#x201C;he proved so generally knowledgeable that I was really proud of him. &#x2026; Mrs. Carlyle was ill, looked like a shadow, and spoke hardly a word. Hartmann could only judge her by her appearance which he did not like at all.&#x201C; He was invited to return, and he and TC were to meet again at Milnes&#x2019;s breakfast, <date when="1850-06-11">11 June</date>, when TC was said to be in a bad mood because of the <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets.</hi> By that time Hartmann had called only once more. TC &#x201C;received him amicably,&#x201C; but &#x201C;afterwards complain[ed] bitterly that he speaks such bad English and tortures him&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, trans. 79, 82).</note> some time ago; of whose objects, or qualities (except that he was an amiable intelligent man, and could speak little English), I did not then know much.</p>
<p>I have since read a Prose Book of his; which is really very clever: I have again seen the man himself too; and learn that, among other things, he has long had a popular <hi rend="italic">Life of Huss</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Huss (<date when="1373">1373</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1415">1415</date>), Bohemian religious reformer. B&#xF6;lte said that Hartmann was thinking of writing the biography with Sarah Austin (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 82).</note> (the Bohemian Reformer) in view;&#x2014;and comparing <hi rend="italic">him</hi> with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, I really find it likely he might make a pleasant and valuable Book of it. He is himself a Bohemian, a Scholar, Poet, and man of sense and humanity; knows the <hi rend="italic">Czech</hi> language (Huss&#x2019;s mother-tongue), has rummaged the Prague Archives, &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;in short, I wish you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give him half <pb id="pg-25-90" n="25:90"/>an hour to speak to you about this. He wants an English Publisher; he knows (or can know) Mrs Austin; has the resources and likelihoods I mention:&#x2014;it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a real charity in you to tell him, if such is the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, that English Bibliopoly <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> listen to his proposal. He leaves this country in a fortnight. He has already learned to talk a good deal of English; his French and all his other speech is highly transparent: you will have no difficulty as to a medium of communication.</p>
<p>Hartmann was Member of the Frankfort Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The national assembly or parliament, <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date>; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480802-TC-JPE-01"><sic>23:84</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1848-08-02">2 Aug. 1848</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490105-TC-JPE-01"><sic>195</sic><corr>TC to JPE, <date when="1849-01-05">5 Jan. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> member of &#x26;c &#x26;c; but he is nothing of the truculent revolu<supplied>[tion]</supplied>ist;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> far from it! He is one of the mildest, clearest of young German celebrities; actually a man of natural intelligence; qualified as I describe to write a Life of Huss;&#x2014;and has the beautifullest beard in nature!</p>
<p>Half an hour to him if you can afford it. His Address is:</p>
<p><person>Moritz Hartmann Esq</person><lb/>
<place>25. Winchester row, New Road</place>.</p>
<p>But he will himself call again.</p>

<p>I am glad I am so soon to have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with you, and I sincerely hope we may suit one another, better than my other cousin John<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John May Welsh.

<p>My Husband, very <hi rend="italic">bothered</hi> as well as busy, with his <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> just now, has desired me to say, in answer to your letter, that he thinks you are quite right in coming to London to look at its resources with your own eyes&#x2014;for even if you find <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to be done here, it will at least be a gain for you to have satisfied yourself that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> nothing to be done&#x2014;and so have your thoughts freer to turn them in some other direction&#x2014; He will willingly give you his opinion about anything you may propose to him&#x2014; Only he fears that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> acquaintance is of a sort that cannot be of any use to you&#x2014; He was trying <pb id="pg-25-91" n="25:91"/>this morning to recollect a single <hi rend="italic">scientific</hi> man that he knew personally&#x2014;and could not name <hi rend="italic">one</hi>!!&#x2014; However when we know <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> you would like to see; it is possible we may find means of getting at them.</p>
<p>I suppose you are <hi rend="italic">quite old enough</hi> and have sense enough now to be trusted anywhere <hi rend="italic">on your own basis</hi>&#x2014;even in London&#x2014; Still I should have liked to offer you a bed on your first coming, in case of your &#x2018;falling (<hi rend="italic">not</hi>) amongst thieves&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 10:30.</note> but amongst&#x2014;bugs! which is fully as bad tho less irretrievable&#x2014; But I have no room at present and am not likely to have for an indefinite time&#x2014;my Brother-in-law D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle having arrived a week ago&#x2014;with no plan in his head&#x2014;to occupy all our available Accommodation&#x2014;</p>
<p>Whenever you like to come during the day, however you will be welcome&#x2014;and if you are to see as many <hi rend="italic">sights</hi>, at <hi rend="italic">midnight</hi> (!) as your cousin did; it will be more desirable for yourself that you should be fixed in a more accessible locality than Chelsea&#x2014; But I fancy <hi rend="italic">your</hi> midnight spectacles are chiefly the Stars&#x2014;all the better for <hi rend="italic">you!</hi></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I have thought of you often at Buxton during the fine days of last week. It is a great &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">aid to reflection</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. S. T. Coleridge, <hi rend="italic">Aids to Reflection</hi> (<date when="1825">1825</date>).</note> on your subject that three years ago I spent a day and night at Buxton myself and went all that walk you describe, and left part of my black <foreign><hi rend="italic">barege</hi></foreign> flounces on the bushes&#x2014;perhaps you may have observed it still fluttering! We went too&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;W Forster and I&#x2014;to visit an old woman who had lived eighty two years&#x2014;in fact from the day of her birth&#x2014;inside a lime-heap! and a tidy little domicile she had made of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470817-TC-MAC-01"><sic>22:38</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1847-08-17">17 Aug. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> Pray don&#x2019;t come away without seeing that establishment&#x2014;if the old creature be still extant&#x2014;</p>
<p>You say nothing in your last letter about your health&#x2014;pray never fail to be explicit on that subject.</p>
<p>John Carlyle is <hi rend="italic">here</hi> at present staying in this house&#x2014;somewhat of an <pb id="pg-25-92" n="25:92"/>uncombined element as yet. for he seems to have no scheme in his head&#x2014;is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> going into Lodgings&#x201C; he thinks,&#x2014;is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to be here very long,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">is</hi> &#x201C;going to be here for some time,&#x201C; he dare says&#x2014;and meanwhile he goes out and in and in and out in the most desultory manner&#x2014;till I feel as if I were trying to carry on my usual occupations alongside a flight of crows&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C keeps very much &#x201C;in a place by himsell&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but the comfort for me is that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not responsible he is not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Brother nor invited by <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; and that makes all the difference imaginable&#x2014;</p>
<p>Geraldine comes to the Galenges<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antonio C. N. Gallenga. Jewsbury had interrupted her stay in London and gone to Seaforth to be with Elizabeth Paulet after the death of her husband.</note> tomorrow&#x2014;if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet do not insist on keeping her at Seaforth longer than she meant to stay&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> P and Julia arrived at home the beginning of the week. I saw a letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> P to Geraldine, very <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> sorrowful&#x2014;pretending to no <hi rend="italic">sensibility</hi> about the matter which one could not have believed; but, expressing honest affectionate sadness, and&#x2014;regretting the opportunities she had lost of &#x201C;making <hi rend="italic">him</hi> happier&#x2014;with little things&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;he was so <hi rend="italic">easily</hi> made happy, and she often showed such impatience with him&#x201C;</p>
<p>She will have her hands full with Julia now or I am much mistaken&#x2014;the practical sense of the family lay all with poor Paulet &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">bore</hi>&#x2019; as they found him</p>
<p>I was immensely glad the other day to receive&#x2014;Mazzini!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giuseppe Mazzini had come to London, ca. <date when="1850-05-26">26 May</date> (see <hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 42:294) from the Continent, where he had been in hiding after the defeat of the Roman republic and uprisings in Italy, <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849">49</date>. Moritz Hartmann describes Mazzini&#x2019;s welcome: &#x201C;We were all sitting by the fire in the drawing-room, &#x2026; and after some talk about the German Parliament Carlyle fell into one of his monologues, full of wit and feeling; to listen to him was like sitting by a rushing torrent and watching the waves roll one after the other. Suddenly Mrs. Carlyle started: a voice in the hall had reached her ear, stirring her like an electric shock. Her eyes sparkled, and opening the door she grasped the hands of the visitor in such a transport of joy that it seemed almost an embrace. Carlyle ceased talking, and with his stork-like legs in one long stride reached his guest, who was not less moved than those who had welcomed him with so much delight. I, who did not know him, shared the sentiments so vividly depicted on the faces of all three. The few words spoken by the unknown, the ineffable harmony of his voice, would have moved the hardest heart. It was Joseph Mazzini, and his friends had not seen him since he had left them in <date when="1848">1848</date>. Mrs. Carlyle, caressing his beard with her hand, exclaimed with tears in her eyes: &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ahi!</hi></foreign> &#x2026; how white it has grown! &#x2026; &#x2019; The woman&#x2019;s faltering voice showed that she realised at that moment all the toil and travail, the sorrow and suffering, that had blanched the hair of the Roman Triumvir. For those who know Carlyle and his opinions, this welcome to the great agitator and liberator who returned vanquished, this warm friendship for the man at whose sole name millions of &#x2018;Philistines&#x2019; made the sign of the cross, may seem surprising. &#x2026; Yet, this formidable Carlyle was profoundly moved at the sight of his friend, and at the thought of the perils and pains he had gone through during these two years of separation. The truth is that great men are attracted to and understand each other&#x201C; (quoted from Jessie White Mario, <hi rend="italic">The Birth of Modern Italy</hi>, ed. the Duke of Litta-Visconti-Arese [<date when="1909">1909</date>] 219&#x2013;20).</note>&#x2014; I did not think <pb id="pg-25-93" n="25:93"/>I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have felt so very glad&#x2014; He looks much better than I expected and is in excellent spirits he has a greyish <hi rend="italic">beard</hi>&#x2014;which is altogether a new feature&#x2014;as before he wore only black mustachios&#x2014;but this beard he &#x201C;begged me to believe was no <hi rend="italic">efflorescence of Republicanism</hi> but <hi rend="italic">necessitated</hi> in the first instance and then persevered in because found so convenient&#x2014;&#x201C;for you must recollect, my Dear, that in the old times I needed always to have a barber to shave me&#x2014;and in the camp with Garibaldi,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No doubt Giuseppe Garibaldi, who had led the defense of Rome when Mazzini was its political leader, before they were forced to leave, <date when="1849-07">July 1849</date>, and Mazzini sailed to Marseilles and went on to Switzerland.</note> and flying for my life, I could not of course take everywhere with me a barber!&#x2014;and so my beard had to grow and now and then be cut with <hi rend="italic">a scissor</hi>.&#x201C; For the rest he looks much as he did&#x2014;and is the same affectionat simple hearted, high souled creature&#x2014;but immensely more <hi rend="italic">agreeable</hi>&#x2014;talks now as one who had the habit of being listened to&#x2014;and has so much of interesting matter to tell&#x2014; Imagine his going to live in a <hi rend="italic">madhouse</hi> at Marseilles! while waiting for a false passport&#x2014;he &#x201C;thought they would not seek him amongst <hi rend="italic">Mads</hi>, decidedly&#x201C;&#x2014;and another time at Geneva he lodged in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> house with the Magistrate who was empowered to discover him&#x2014;sure that the magistrate would look for him in every house before his <hi rend="italic">own</hi>&#x2014;and they lived under the same roof for fifty days</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am afraid you got yourself a little frightened yesterday by the Newspapers not coming! I was much vexed to find, at night, that Jack too had neglected to send a Paper or any message to you, which I hoped he would have done. Well, there was <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> wrong here; and I decide to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> the day this time with a little word to you explanatory of that and other things.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after a hard tussle for three weeks, I had got my next <hi rend="italic">Pamphlet</hi> finished; and being very useless, weak and weary, and the day looking delightful, if one could get away from this dusty noisy baker&#x2019;s-oven of a place, I proposed to Jane that we should run out into the country a few miles by the nearest railway. She very willingly consented: the newspapers &#x26;c were all lying done up and ready here; but in the hurry of departure I forgot to put them in my pocket for the post-office, or to tell anybody about them, and here accordingly, along with a letter or two which also should not have waited, they still are! That is all.&#x2014; We had a beautiful little quiet excursion, Jane and I, not above ten miles away: to Richmond<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Thames, 10 mi. WSW of London.</note> by rail, then thro&#x2019; the beautiful woody grassy <hi rend="italic">holm</hi>-region of the Thames, by omnibus, a few miles farther, to a place called Ham Common,&#x2014;which we had wholly to ourselves for a while; strolling about, under shady trees, upon clear green sward with <foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddies</hi></foreign> and cattle grazing,&#x2014;nay tracts of honest <foreign><hi rend="italic">whins</hi></foreign> we had, and the clear sky and the rich woods and earth all to ourselves for a while. One <hi rend="italic">bottle of soda-water</hi> was all the demand we made of the natives; a few cigars and fire I myself had in my pocket. We were home in good time for a <hi rend="italic">ham</hi> tea, in which the Waterbeck<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NE of Ecclefechan.</note> &#x201C;father of hams,&#x201C; an excellent fellow not so weighty now as he has been, did excellent service!&#x2014; I got a capital sleep last night, the best for many nights past, and feel a great deal fresher today. We are to have hot weather I perceive now; this is the hottest day there has yet been: but the summer weather is hitherto quite pleasant to us, and indeed excellent for all purposes.</p>
<p>My last Pamphlet got on very badly,&#x2014;there was so much bustling &#x26;c, and my own poor nerves and liver were so put about. I do not yet know for certain how many more I shall have to write I think sometimes of making out the dozen; but <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> seem likelier for the present; nay something (a <hi rend="italic">cowardly</hi> something) whispers occasionally, &#x201C;If the thing grow <hi rend="italic">too</hi> hot, you may finish with <hi rend="italic">eight</hi>,&#x201C; which is only one more now!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eventually eight.</note> What I have farther to say must <pb id="pg-25-95" n="25:95"/>grow into a <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> in that case. But I think <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> is the likelier. We must try to do and choose what is wisest for us!</p>
<p>Jack goes rolling about here at a jolly rate and seems to enjoy himself tolerably. He reads a while in the forenoons and evenings; is &#x201C;calling&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c all over the Town in day-time, and often enough seeks his own dinner, at a chophouse, to be more free. Miss Jewsbury is here, staying with some friends hard by; she comes a good deal over, and talks or flies about with Jane. Tonight there is a Prussian Jewess (very Jewish-looking) and an Edinburgh &#x201C;lady of celebrity&#x201C; (one Mrs Crowe) coming here.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fanny Lewald and Catherine Crowe. Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1850-06-12">12 June</date>, that Lewald, who admired TC, had reached London from Germany three weeks earlier and that Milnes had given a breakfast for her, <date when="1850-06-07">7 June</date>, where she met Jewsbury, JWC, and Thackeray among others. She called on the Carlyles one morning and was at Cheyne Row, <date when="1850-06-11">11 June</date>, when she met Lewes and Crowe (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 81). Lewald&#x2019;s English was poor and she had to suffer in silence while TC abused German democracy; but JWC, &#x201C;a figure as witty as high-minded,&#x201C; took pity on her and induced Lewes, who spoke excellent German, to talk to her in her own language. On a second visit she felt less intimidated as she listened to TC speak of Cromwell and admired his profile and satiric laugh (Lewald, <hi rend="italic">England und Schottland. Ein Reisetagebuch</hi>, 2 vols. [Berlin, <date when="1864">1864</date>], trans. 1:267&#x2013;68). In his &#x201C;Vivian&#x201C; column in the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, <date when="1850-06-15">15 June</date>, Lewes wrote that London was overrun with &#x201C;authoresses&#x201C;: &#x201C;Groups cluster around <hi rend="small-caps">Fr&#xE4;ulein Fanny Lewald</hi>, who is not only an authoress but a German authoress, so that the noodles can practise their &#x2018;German without a master&#x2019; while sitting for their portraits&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">paint</hi> them she will, never doubt it! Groups cluster around <hi rend="small-caps">Geraldine Jewsbury</hi>, who plays with paradoxes, paints characters in a phrase, and spoils all my good stories by absorbing the listeners.&#x201C; These women, including Mrs. Crowe, crowd out the men: &#x201C;Who will invite <hi rend="small-caps">Vivian</hi> when his place in the Opera-box can be filled by <hi rend="small-caps">Fanny Lewald</hi> or <hi rend="small-caps">Zoe Jewsbury</hi>?&#x201C;</note> On Thursday night I have to go and dine with Peel,&#x2014; who has invited me, I guess, to meet a certain Yankee lion called Prescott (a man I care nothing for) who is coming over here.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. H. Prescott, American historian, did not care for TC either, whom he had met three years before. He wrote to his wife, <date when="1850-06-11">11</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-06-14">14 June</date>, about the dinner (G. Ticknor, <hi rend="italic">Life of Prescott</hi> [<date when="1864">1864</date>] 324). Milnes, however, found Prescott &#x201C;most pleasing, so much fresher and more genial than our &#x2018;<foreign>Gelehrte</foreign>&#x2019; [Scholars]&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:440).</note> An indigestion is all I shall get by that.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After Peel&#x2019;s death, TC noted in his Journal, <date when="1850-07-24">24 July</date>, some details of the dinner, <date when="1850-06-13">13 June</date>: &#x201C;A great party there; Milman, Barry (Architect), Mahon, Sheil, Gibson (Sculptor), Cubitt (Builder) &#x26;c &#x26;c. About Prescott I cared little, and indeed, there or elsewhere did not speak with him at all: but what I noted of Peel, tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> put down, and will now do it. I was the second that entered the big drawing room, a Picture-gallery as well, which looks out over the Thames (Whitehall Gardens, second house to the eastward of Montague House). Commands West<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bridge too (with its wrecked parapets), and the new Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Houses; being, I fancy, of <hi rend="italic">semicircular</hi> figure in that part and projecting into the shore of the river. Old Cubitt, a hoary modest sensible-looking man was alone with P. when I entered; my reception was abundantly cordial,&#x2014;talk went on ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> new Houses of Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and the impossibility or difficulty of hearing in them; others entering (Milman &#x26;c.) joined in it as I had done. Sir Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, in his mild kindly voice, talked of the difficulties architects had in making out that part of their problem: nobody knew <hi rend="italic">how</hi> it was to be done; <hi rend="italic">filling</hi> of a room with people sometimes made it audible (witness his own experience at Glasgow in the College-Rector time, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he briefly mentioned to us: sometimes it had been managed by hanging up cloth curtains &#x26;c. &#x2026; People now came in, thick and rapid; I went ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Gallery with those already come, and saw little more of Sir R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there. I remember in presenting Barry to Prescott, he said with kindly emphasis, I have wished to show you some of our most distinguished men. &#x2026; By, when I looked at him, did not turn out by any means such a fool as his Pepper-box architecture w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have led one to guess: on the contrary a broad solid man, with much ingenuity and even delicacy of expression; who had well employed his sixty years or so of life in looking out for himself,&#x2014;and unhappily had found Pepperbox Architecture his Goshen!&#x201C; At dinner, at which Panizzi and Scribe were also present, Peel sat in the middle, nearly opposite TC: &#x201C;Not a creature there for whom I cared one penny, except for Peel himself. &#x2026; After all the servants but the Butler were gone, one began to hear a little of Peel&#x2019;s quiet talk across the table. Unimport<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> distinguished again by its sense of the ludicrous, shining thro&#x2019; a strong official <hi rend="italic">rationality</hi>, and even seriousness of temper. &#x2026; In rising we had some question ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Pictures in his diningroom, which were Wilkie&#x2019;s (odious) John Knox at the entrance end; and at the opposite 3 or perhaps 4 all by Reynolds, Dr. Johnson (original of the Engravings one sees), Reynolds himself <hi rend="italic">by</hi> his own pencil, and two, or perhaps 3, other pictures. Doubts rising ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> who some Lady-Portrait was, I went to the window, and asked Sir R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> himself who turned with alacrity and talked to us about that and the rest: the <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> in Johnson&#x2019;s portrait bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> an anecdote ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Wilkie and it at Drayton; Peel spread his hand over it, about an inch or two off, to illustrate or enforce,&#x2014;as fine a man&#x2019;s hand as I remember to have seen; strong delicate &#x26; &#x26;c most scrupulously clean.&#x2014; Upstairs, most of the people having soon gone, he showed us his Volumes of Autographs: Mirabeau, Johnson, Byron, Scott, and many English Kings and Officialities: excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> cheerful talk and description, human, but official in all things;&#x2014;then, with a cordial shake of the hand, <hi rend="italic">dismissal;</hi> and the B<hi rend="italic">p</hi> of Oxford (<foreign><hi rend="italic">mirum</hi></foreign> [for a wonder]!], insisting on it, took me home in his carriage.&#x201C; It was the beginning of an intimacy between TC and Wilberforce, who, Froude says (misdating the dinner the second week of <date when="1850-05">May</date>), &#x201C;once told me he considered Carlyle a most eminently religious man&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:42&#x2013;44).

<salute>Dear Hunt,</salute>
<p>I have just finished your <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Autobiography of Leigh Hunt; with Reminiscences of Friends and Contemporaries</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1850">1850</date>). Hunt spoke of TC as &#x201C;one of the kindest and best, as well as most eloquent of men; though in his zeal for what is best he sometimes thinks it incumbent on him to take not the kindest tone, and in his eloquent demands of some hearty uncompromising creed on our parts, he does not quite set the example of telling us the amount of his own. &#x2026; Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s antipathy to &#x2018;shams,&#x2019; is highly estimable and salutary. I wish Heaven may prosper his denouncements of them, wherever they exist. But the danger of the habit of denouncing,&#x2014;of looking at things from the antipathetic instead of the sympathetic side,&#x2014;is, that a man gets such a love for the pleasure and exaltation of fault-finding, as tempts him, in spite of himself, to make what he finds; till at length he is himself charged with being a &#x2018;sham&#x2019;; that is to say, a pretender to perceptions and virtues which he does not prove, or at best a willing confounder of what differs from modes and appearances of his own, with violations of intrinsical wisdom and goodness. &#x2026; I believe that what Mr. Carlyle loves better than his fault-finding, with all its eloquence, is the face of any human creature that looks suffering, and loving, and sincere; and I believe further, that if the fellow-creature were suffering only, and neither loving nor sincere, but had come to a pass of agony in this life, which put him at the mercies of some good man for some last help and consolation towards his grave, even at the risk of loss to repute, and a sure amount of pain and vexation, that man, if the groan reached him in its forlorness, would be Thomas Carlyle&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 3:327&#x2013;31).</note> which has been most pleasantly occupying all my leisure these three days; and you must permit me to write you a word upon it, out of the fulness of the heart, while the impulse is still fresh to thank you. This good Book, in every sense one of the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I have read this long while, has awakened many old thoughts, which never were extinct, or even properly <hi rend="italic">asleep</hi>, but which (like so much else) have had to fall silent amid the tempests of an evil time,&#x2014;Heaven mend it! A word from me, once more, I know, will not be unwelcome, while the world is talking of you.</p>
<p>Well, I call this an excellently good Book; by far the best of the autobiographic kind I remember to have read in the English Language; and indeed, except it be Boswell&#x2019;s of Johnson, I do not know where we have such a Picture drawn of a human Life as in these three volumes. A pious, ingenious, altogether <hi rend="italic">human</hi> and worthy Book; imaging, with graceful honesty and free <pb id="pg-25-98" n="25:98"/>felicity, many interesting objects and persons on your life-path,&#x2014;and imaging throughout, what is best of all, a gifted, gentle, patient and valiant human Soul, as it buffets its way thro&#x2019; the billows of the time, and will not drown, tho&#x2019; often in danger; <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be drowned, but conquers, and leaves a track of radiance behind it: that, I think, comes out more clearly to me than in any other of your Books;&#x2014;and that I can venture to assure you is the best of all results to realise in a Book or written record. In fact this Book has been like an exercise of <hi rend="italic">devotion</hi> to me: I have not assisted at any sermon, liturgy or litany, this long while, that has had so <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> an effect on me. Thanks in the name of all men. And believe along with me that this Book will be welcome to other generations as well as to ours. And long may you live to write more Books for us; and may the evening sun be softer on you (and on me) than the noon sometimes was!</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Hunt (you must let me use this familiarity, for I am an old fellow too now as well as you). I have often tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of coming up to see you once more;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt lived at 4 Upper Cheyne Row in the <date when="1830">1830</date>s, moved to 32 Edwardes Sq., Kensington, <date when="1840">1840</date> (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400622-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:171</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-06-22">22 June 1840</date></corr></ref>), and was at 2 Phillimore Terr., Kensington in <date when="1852">1852</date>.</note> and perhaps I shall one of these days (tho&#x2019; horribly sick and lonely, and beset with spectral lions, go whitherward I may): but whether I do or not, believe forever in my regard.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Comparing Wordsworth and Hunt as conversationalists, TC told Duffy, <date when="1849">1849</date>: &#x201C;[Y]ou would get more meaning out of what Wordsworth had to say to you than from anybody else. Leigh Hunt would emit more pretty, pleasant, ingenious flashes in an hour than Wordsworth in a day. But in the end you would find &#x2026; that you had been drinking perfumed water in one case, and in the other you got the sense of a deep, earnest man, who had thought silently and painfully on many things&#x201C; (Duffy 54).</note> <closer><salute>And so God bless you,&#x2014;prays heartily</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>I have seen Prescott,&#x2014;from the distance,&#x2014;who seems a very reasonable, amiable man, whom it would not be unpleasant to talk with on occasion, were his <hi rend="italic">lion</hi>hood but ended!

<p><salute>Dear Hunt,&#x2014;</salute>Many kind thanks! I saw the Book, and sent thanks for it by Vincent; but I did not know, till this minute, what other pleasant thing lay in the Letter itself, which the dusk and the hurry would not suffer me to read at the moment.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt wrote to TC, <date when="1850-06-21">21 June</date>: &#x201C;After having been so often flustered &#x26; rendered inoperative by pains &#x26; troubles, I have been treated in the same manner, this week past, by an incursion of pleasures; letters, to wit, from valued friends, making much of me beyond anything I had looked for &#x2026; ; and you may imagine how extreme the pleasure was in your instance &#x2026; , not a single word of spleen or reproof, but a very torrent of nothing but honey,&#x2014;pure love, &#x26; self-forgetfulness. &#x2026; I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your letter, and cannot but feel very proud of it. &#x2026; As to visits, &#x2026; on Tuesday next, if you are not engaged that evening, I propose to come after tea &#x26; take my good old North-British supper with you. Pray tell Vincent [Hunt] if I may come.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; By all means, Yes, yes! My Wife is overjoyed at the prospect of seeing you again in the old good style: Courage, and do not disappoint us. We are here, quite disengaged, and shall be right glad to see you.</p>
<p>I hope Vincent explained what a miscellaneous uproar had incidentally got about me tonight; and how for want of <hi rend="italic">light</hi> as well as of time, I missed the kernel of the Letter altogether.&#x2014; &#x2014; Tuesday, remember! We dine about 5; and tea comes naturally about 7,&#x2014;sooner if you will come sooner.</p>
<p>One of my people tonight, an accomplished kind of American, has begged a card of introduction to you: he is a son of a certain noted Judge Story; is himself, I believe, a kind of <hi rend="italic">sculptor</hi> and Artist as well as Lawyer:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Wetmore Story, American sculptor. Robert Browning, TC&#x2019;s friend since the mid-<date when="1830">1830</date>s, had written to TC, <date when="1850-06-10">10 June</date>, from Florence, where he and his wife, Elizabeth, had lived since <date when="1847">1847</date>: &#x201C;A year ago, I had great pleasure in making the acquaintance of a very cultivated &#x26; interesting person&#x2014;Mr Story, an American; and I could find no better method of repaying him, than by engaging to make him know you, should he ever go to England. He is there for a very short while and writes to remind me of my engagement. May I venture to hope that a very loveable and talented person may not fare the worse with you on account of this recommendation. &#x2026; Mr Story, I should not omit to say, has a very delightful wife.&#x201C; Emelyn Story, b. Eldridge. John Carlyle complained to Isabella Carlyle of the &#x201C;great crowd of people&#x201C; entertained that night and reported that TC was thinking of ending the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> with no more than seven of them (MS: NLS 9086).</note> pray <pb id="pg-25-101" n="25:101"/>receive him if he call; you will find him a friendly and entertainable and entertaining man.</p>

<p>I have received your Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Guide to German Literature</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1850">1850</date>), which refers to TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;original and expansive mind&#x201C; (1:337).</note> which seems, so far as I yet examine it, to be an excellent one in its kind; lucid concise, correct, full of the needful information, to the exclusion of the needless; an authentic &#x201C;Guide to German Literature&#x201C; in several very essential respects,&#x2014;far surpassing, at least, anything we had before; and likely, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> imagine, to be extensively useful now when so many young people, little adapted to extensive studies, are learning to read German among us. I return you many thanks for the Copy you have favoured me with; and am otherwise bound to acknowledge a good service done on your part to the whole English world.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-102" n="25:102"/><closer><salute>Wishing heartily success both to your Book and to yourself, I remain</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Here is a Letter for you, of this morning, from Jean; I am tempted to open it for news, but decide to obey regulations and send it on in the hope of a vague &#x201C;all well.&#x201C; Your <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> also came this morning; we could see you reading it yesterday, as you rode thro&#x2019; the hot parched world; we figured your safe arrival too at Liverpool, and give you thanks for this mute symbol.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1850-06-25">25 June</date>: &#x201C;Poor John just gone (9&#xBC; a.m.), for Liverpool, and home to our dear old Mother again. He has run about, looking at London persons and things; rather <hi rend="italic">fussy</hi> in this quiet house, but most innocent and good. He will now do his <hi rend="italic">Dante;</hi> poor fellow, it is what he can save from the wreck of a life that had much more and better in it: but he takes his lot with a most childlike good humour. God go with him my poor brother!&#x2014;&#x201C;</note> I have despatched it, with a new cover, to my Mother; I wished to write to her also, but cannot now have time.</p>
<p>The house feels unnaturally <hi rend="italic">still</hi> and solitary since you left it;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh (the meteorologist), who had arrived in London, <date when="1850-06-11">11 June</date>, wrote to his mother, ca. <date when="1850-07-10">10 July</date>: &#x201C;Dr. Carlyle &#x2026; is gone to live with his mother in Annandale. Mrs. Carlyle seems glad he is away as he made so much noise walking up and down stairs with his creaking boots (and all his three pairs creaked) that he disturbed his brother while at his pamphlets&#x201C; (Huxley, <hi rend="italic">LJWC</hi> 630).</note> in all corners yesterday I came upon silent traces of you; silent intimations saying sadly enough to me, &#x201C;Poor Jack is away, then!&#x201C;&#x2014;On the whole I am very glad that you have staid with us again a while, that we have seen you once again. It is not easy for a man to live with men in this world! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mit den andern kannst du&#x2019;s nie zurecht machen</hi></foreign> [With others you can&#x2019;t do it right]. Alas, if you knew what a coil of outer and inner confusions I myself have now to strive with, you would be thankful to me for keeping the lid close over them, and would certainly give me your brotherly prayers!&#x2014; But let us try if we can <hi rend="italic">mind our work</hi>, both of us, and all of us; there is really no other remedy for mortals in this world.</p>
<p>Hunt came duly last night, about 8 o&#x2019;clock, in a cab (being still unable for <pb id="pg-25-103" n="25:103"/>night walking), and had a <hi rend="italic">plate of porridge</hi>, and the kindest reception we could give him. Poor fellow, he is much shaken; his head is much whiter, his wit has a tremulous shake of pathos in it, his eye looks sad and restless;&#x2014;yet he struggles bravely towards peace and composed acquiescence;&#x2014;in his clean worn clothes and linen, with his fine white head, and gentle much-enduring ways, he was really almost venerable. I studied to contradict none of his philanthropic philosophies, studied to praise and encourage him; Jane <hi rend="italic">cried</hi>, and kissed him, when he went away.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had commemorated an earlier kiss from JWC with a poem; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380100-JWC-JHLH-01"><sic>10:3</sic><corr>JWC to JHLH, <date when="1838-01-01">1 Jan. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; Neuberg had been here for two of the Hunt hours; rather an extraneous element; but he went his way shortly after ten o&#x2019;clock.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Before going out, I will write you a word today, tho&#x2019; probably you have heard from John that we are all going on much in the old fashion, and nothing new has befallen us. If anything, I think I am in better health; getting <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to the summer heat;&#x2014;indeed last night we had a hearty thunder-shower of several hours (little thunder <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> here; but a great quantity of lightning all the evening, and then rain in noble plenty beginning not long after midnight), and now we are a great deal cooler than we were, with a brisk wind as well as a strong sun.</p>
<p>Jack went away on Tuesday morning by the mail train for Liverpool: the <pb id="pg-25-104" n="25:104"/><hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper I sent you yesterday was the one we had got from him in sign of his safe arrival there. We have not yet heard anything farther; I have little doubt he has written a word to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, specifying when he is to be expected at Scotsbrig. I yesterday forwarded him a Note that had come from Jean at Dumfries: tomorrow we expect a line from himself.&#x2014; &#x2014; Poor fellow, he was very innocent and good, all the time he was here,&#x2014;the creaking of his shoes the worst fault you could make to him;&#x2014;and now the great increase of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> in the house makes one <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to notice it, and reflect on the cause of it! We are very glad to have had the poor Doctor here once again; and it is a great comfort to me, for my poor old Mother&#x2019;s sake, to think that it is to you he is returning when he leaves us. I hope he will take good care of you, dear Mother, as he has hitherto done. He seemed very well and blithe while here; and purposes now to set fiercely upon the <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> when he gets back.</p>
<p>I am upon my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Pamphlet;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Jesuitism,&#x201C; pbd. <date when="1850-08-01">1 Aug.</date> TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1850-06-25">25 June</date>: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hudson&#x2019;s Statue</hi>, a very bad <hi rend="italic">Pamphlet</hi>, is coming out; <hi rend="italic">Jesuitism</hi> (N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 8) is on the stocks, and, what is still more interesting, with that I am to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> the sad operation! How to do that <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, in the circ<hi rend="italic">s?</hi> With heat, with bustling noise of persons and things, especially with utter <hi rend="italic">wreck</hi> of nerves and liver, it is not easy.&#x201C; B&#xF6;lte also reported, <date when="1850-06-12">12 June</date>, that &#x201C;Jesuitism&#x201C; would be next and that TC &#x201C;was asked the other day to give a definition of the devil, whom he appeared to know so well. Hartmann and Lewald don&#x2019;t understand someone who is forever talking of God and the devil. The former wants to see himself as the beginning and end of all things, which does not get him anywhere with Carlyle&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi>, trans. 82).</note> I think this eighth I am now busy with will be the last. It will be a great relief to be out of that job, for one. However, I believe, it has done well enough in its fashion, and was a thing wanting to be done. On other conditions, or under other forms, I hope to have a good deal more of the same sort to do yet!&#x2014; &#x2014; After ending, or even <hi rend="italic">before</hi> if the weather grow too hot, I talk of running across to my Welsh Attorney<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Redwood.</note> for a week or two of solitary rest: his is the <hi rend="italic">loneliest</hi> household I can hear of in the world; near the sea-shore too, and he has horses; and will leave me all the day in a house entirely to myself! In return he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> an exhilerating companion, tho&#x2019; a very honest one, good man: I rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner</hi></foreign> at the dulness of the evenings! But we shall see what becomes of the project. I shall be loose at any rate. One of these days you will get Pamph<hi rend="italic">t</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 7, and I will write again. <closer><salute>Blessings on you dear good Mother, on you and them all!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have looked over your Pamphlet,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Marriage with a Deceased Wife&#x2019;s Sister not Contrary to the Word of God as Contained in the Law of Moses</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1850">1850</date>); the question was a topical one, brought forward in the House of Commons, <date when="1850">1850</date>, though not passed by it till <date when="1907">1907</date> after sustained controversy.</note> with a pleasant interest in the Author, if not in the subject; and have to give you thanks for your friendly attention to me. The subject is by no means interesting to me; in fact is afflictive rather, when I reflect how very far <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is from being the subject calling first for discussion and exertion in these years now passing! I feel also that, in questions connected with &#x201C;Marriage,&#x201C; we of this poor hebetated corrupt and thoroughly <hi rend="italic">un</hi>chaste and soulless generation have, beyond most generations I have heard of, small chance to be <hi rend="italic">right</hi> in settling new rules for ourselves or posterity! My chief individual wish therefore is that this question w<hi rend="italic">d get</hi> itself settled, in whichever way it likes, and so cease.</p>
<p>For the rest, I heartily give you leave to laugh at the Scotch D. D.s and their gaunt pharisaical appeals to &#x201C;Moses&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c on this and other questions;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There had been a meeting in Glasgow against the proposal, at which the chief speaker, replied to in Eadie&#x2019;s pamphlet, was the Rev. Dr. Wilkinson Symington (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862">1862</date>), minister of the Glasgow Gt. Hamilton St. Reformed Presbyterian church.</note> and wish only you could get them to understand that a much greater than Moses, namely that God Almighty&#x2019;s Fact is now here again, and that Moses cannot at all carry us to a solution of it! Poor Scotland, so far as I can read it, is now in the saddest spiritual crisis of any part of her Majesty&#x2019;s dominions. Nowhere that I know of is a more dismal tragedy enacting itself than there; nowhere a nobler National Character bleeding hourly to death,&#x2014;and the D. D.s all standing over it, with their eyes and nose-spectacles fixed on Moses and the old Presbytery-Book, quite unconscious that anything particular is happening!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This house makes no pretension to equal a Model Prison; but there is a chair in it for you, and a friendly word, if you chanced to call, anytime, in passing.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Sandwich,</salute>
<p>When that unfortunate gentleman &#x201C;with his head in 37 pieces&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire, the forger; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470206-TC-EF-01"><sic>21:156</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1847-02-06">6 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>. For his two visits to Cheyne Row, see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490206-TC-LOA-01"><sic>23:225</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1849-02-06">6 Feb. 1849</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490206-TC-JF-01"><sic>228</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1849-02-06">6 Feb. 1849</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490421-TC-LOA-01"><sic>24:34</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1849-02-06">6 Feb. 1849</date></corr></ref>. On the first visit, <date when="1849-01-23">23 Jan. 1849</date>, TC notes that Squire said that &#x201C;his very life, as it were, had been repeatedly smashed in pieces.&#x201C; At the age of seven he had slipped and &#x201C;broke the scull (as he has learned since &#x2018;into 37 pieces&#x2019;)&#x201C; (MS: Bancroft; pbd. Wright, <hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 331).</note> came to call on me, I used all industry to gather from him whatever light I could as to the history and catastrophe of that mysterious <hi rend="italic">Squire Journal</hi> burnt by him,&#x2014;with a view, first, to elucidate the credibility of his strange story about it; and then farther, to recover from his confused memory, and commit to paper, what fragments of it he (from frequent perusal, as his story bore) could still recollect for me. In this way I collected some ten or twelve pages of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Squiriana</hi>,&#x201C; which I keep with great care here; they are not to be published (under dreadful penalties) till <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have all died and disappeared, and the &#x201C;37 pieces&#x201C; of a certain head have got composed into proper juncture again!&#x2014; Had I not been afraid to bore you with the trouble of reading blotted writing, solemnly keeping &#x201C;secrets&#x201C; that are of no earthly moment, and returning bundles of nearly worthless papers as if they were bank-notes,&#x2014;I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have shewn you this precious Manuscript while you were here, which might have amused you for a few minutes, as it did Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who read it when first put together. On some calmer occasion,&#x2014;especially if we ever get to Hinchinbrook<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hinchinbroke House, seat of Lord Sandwich, nr. Huntingdon.</note> under good omens!&#x2014;this may still be done. Meanwhile here inclosed is a small fraction, which I have extracted as claiming a particular interest from the representation of &#x201C;Sea-General Montagu.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Montagu (<date when="1625">1625</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672">72</date>), 1st earl of Sandwich, nr. Huntingdon.</note> It brings into distinct daylight the fact which I had gathered from various inferences, that the First Earl of Sandwich <hi rend="italic">was</hi> one of the Ironside Captains,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cromwell&#x2019;s troops.</note> and is the &#x201C;Montagu&#x201C; frequently mentioned in these &#x201C;Squire Papers&#x201C; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you have read in print. For, on the whole, I have no doubt there is substantial truth in the story this poor &#x201C;head in 37 pieces&#x201C; has set forth; no theory of the affair is possible for me, except that it is substantially true.&#x2014; Permit me to send you this little patch of writing, to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> instantly if you so doom; and please do not take the trouble of writing a word of answer on the subject, for that really w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be more than needless.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-107" n="25:107"/>The First Lord Sandwich, I find, was Forty-<hi rend="italic">seven</hi> when he met his death.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Your Note did come on Saturday night; many thanks to <pb id="pg-25-109" n="25:109"/>you,&#x2014;and send us another so soon as you can! Here is the <hi rend="italic">Hudson&#x2019;s Statue</hi>, a very bad Pamphlet; but the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> my biliary and other demons w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> allow to make it; and now happily the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> save one: that is the beautiful property of it! These two days I have sat over <hi rend="italic">Jesuitism</hi> (or yesterday I fairly gave up sitting, and took to lying on the sofa, and reading): I do not remember that for many years I have been in worse case for writing. Nevertheless I will do it; as our brave Father used to say, &#x201C;I will <foreign><hi rend="italic">gar</hi></foreign> mysel do it!&#x201C; Nay it will be much easier if I were once fairly into it. Rightly done <supplied>[it]</supplied> cannot by any method be just now: it is but the beginning of a <hi rend="italic">boundless</hi> subject.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening there occurred a thing which I doubt will prove a national tragedy,&#x2014;for the <hi rend="italic">death</hi> of Sir R. Peel at present would be that! Have you heard of it? He was riding up Constitution Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Fri., <date when="1850-06-28">28 June</date>, Peel spoke for the last time in the House of Commons.

For TC&#x2019;s fuller account of Peel&#x2019;s accident and death, see Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:47&#x2013;49. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1850-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;How much has passed in the four or five weeks since the last entry was written! Sir R.

<p>Last night I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to go to W. Stirling,&#x2014;to tea only; tea near midnight!

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>It is all over with poor Peel! The accounts yesterday were of various tenor, generally black and bad,&#x2014;a great crowd of people, poor and rich, streaming about all day, and large placard-bulletins handed out to them,&#x2014;in the evening we heard that there was a <hi rend="italic">marked improvement;</hi> Poor Peel had risen, washed his teeth &#x26;c;&#x2014;and alas, alas, about 11 at night, he died, and it was all ended! Lady Ashburton was here this forenoon with the news; all in tears recently and even still; going out to Addiscombe to be in silence till Monday. The public emotion is very great. Peel retained his consciousness, his perfect composure,&#x2014;took the sacrament, took farewell of them all.&#x2014; I have not been so sad over the loss of any public man in my time. That meeting I had with him in the Horseguards,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle added an asterisk here and a note in the margin before forwarding it to Alexander Carlyle: &#x201C;Met Peel in the Horseguards (building) about ten days ago. He looked very well &#x26; cheerful; came forward &#x26; shook hands. Tom was on the way to call at his house, which is near the Horseguards, &#x26; had been dining with him a few day before.&#x201C;</note> of which I told you, has now become a truly mournful and tragic one.</p>
<p>My dear Mother and you and all of them are likely to feel an interest in this sad news; so I send it, tho&#x2019; without time for a word more. My morning&#x2019;s work has <hi rend="italic">utterly failed</hi>,&#x2014;but I cannot help it now; I must out at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and try to do better tomorrow.</p>

<salute>Dearest Helen</salute>
<p>I heard from John that you were bound for Auchtertool yesterday or today,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She and her father left Liverpool, <date when="1850-07-03">3 July</date>, as shown in her letter to John Carlyle, [<date when="1850-07-05">5 July</date>] (MS: NLS 1775B.99).</note> and I wished to send you a letter of goodby&#x2014;which having failed in; I now change it into one of welcome&#x2014; John would tell you I was extremely well&#x2014;extremely gay&#x2014;rushing after <hi rend="italic">ball-dresses</hi>, good Heavens! and you would believe of all that as much as your credulity could take in&#x2014; I am <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> less sick and sleepless than I was last year at this time, but still consuming a <pb id="pg-25-111" n="25:111"/>quantity of inward suffering, which as I know John has no remedy for it I did not feel any call to trouble him with&#x2014;especially as during the month he staid here, he seemed incapable of fixing his attention on anything for two seconds together&#x2014;and it hurts ones <hi rend="italic">sensibility</hi> to make complaints and be asked a minute after some question proving that not a word of them had been <hi rend="italic">heard</hi>&#x2014; So finding him in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> line this time, I immediately adapted myself to it&#x2014;and held my peace in every thing but the trivialities of the hour&#x2014;</p>
<p>For <hi rend="italic">company</hi>&#x2014;I have indeed had more than enough of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> of late weeks&#x2014;not a day, hardly an hour of repose&#x2014;so many strangers from foreign parts introduced to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, and so many old friends of my own from a distance coming and going till the house has got to look like a Hotel with this only difference that no charges are made for the &#x201C;entertainment to man and beast&#x201C;</p>
<p>The Bath House Ball threw me into a perfect fever for one week&#x2014;as I had got no dress for it; not understanding that I was to go&#x2014;but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was &#x201C;quite determined for once in his life to see an aristocratic Ball and if I chose to be so peevish and ungracious as to stay away there was no help for me&#x201C;&#x2014; I pleaded the want of a dress&#x2014;he &#x201C;would pay for any dress I chose to get&#x201C;; and then I fell back on the horror of <hi rend="italic">stripping</hi> myself, of &#x201C;being bare&#x201C;&#x2014;at my age after being muffled up so many years! and that if I didn&#x2019;t I should be like no one else&#x2014;to which he told me angrily&#x2014;&#x201C;true propriety consisted in conforming to other peoples fashions!!! and that Eve he supposed had as much sense of decency as I had and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> wore no clothes at all!!!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. C. Macready recorded, <date when="1850-06-12">12 June</date>, a visit from the Carlyles: &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle wanted Catherine&#x2019;s aid about a dress for a great ball at Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s to which Carlyle wished to go&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Diaries</hi> 2:467).</note> So I got a white silk dress&#x2014;which first was made high and longsleeved&#x2014;and then on the very day of the ball was sent back to be cut down to the due pitch of indecency!&#x2014; I could have gone into <hi rend="italic">fits</hi> of crying when I began to put it on&#x2014;but I looked so astonishingly well in it <hi rend="italic">by candle light</hi>, and when I got into the fine rooms amongst the universally <hi rend="italic">bare</hi> people I felt so much in <hi rend="italic">keeping</hi>, that I forgot my neck and arms almost immediately&#x2014; I was glad <hi rend="italic">after</hi> that I went&#x2014;not for any pleasure I had at the time being past dancing, and knowing but few people&#x2014;but it is an additional idea for life, to have seen such a party&#x2014;all the Duchesses one ever heard tell of blazing in diamonds, all the young beauties of the season, all the distinguished Statesmen &#x26;c &#x26;c were to be seen among the six or seven hundred people present&#x2014;and the rooms all hung with artificial roses looked like an Arabian Nights entertainment&#x2014;what pleased me best was the good look I got <hi rend="italic">into the eyes</hi> of the old Duke of Wellington&#x2014;one has no notion, seeing him on the streets what a dear kind face he has&#x2014;Lady Ashburton receiving all these people with her grand-Lady airs was also a sight <pb id="pg-25-112" n="25:112"/>worth seeing<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1850-06-25">25 June</date>: &#x201C;Last night at a grand Ball at Bath House; the only Ball, of any description, I ever saw. From 5 to 7 hundred select aristocracy; the lights, decorations, house-room and arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> perfect (I suppose); the whole thing worth having seen for a couple of hours. Of the many women only a few even to be called beautiful; I remember the languid careless slow airs with which the elderly peeresses came into the rooms, and thereafter lounged about, something notable. A Miss &#x2018;Ligon&#x2019; (? a Gen<hi rend="italic">ls</hi> daughter) was the prettiest I remember of the &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">sch&#xF6;nen Kinder</hi></foreign> [beautiful children].&#x2019; Old Londonderry looked sad, foolish and surly; his Marchioness, once a beauty, you could see, had the finest diamonds of the party, Jane tells me. Lord and Lady Lovelace; spoke a little with the former; a man of some reflexion, as men go. Marquis of Breadalbane; thickset farmer-looking man, round steel grey head with bald crown,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">hat nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [he was of no consequence] / &#x2026; Anglesea &#x2026; American Lawrance (Min<hi rend="italic">r</hi> here) &#x2026; frightful American lady &#x2026; his wife,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la</hi></foreign> Cushman &#x2026; Prescot and other Americans there. &#x2026; By far the most impressive figure there was the old Duke of Wellington, who appeared between 12 and 1, and slowly glided thro&#x2019; the rooms. Truly a beautiful old man; I had never seen till now how beautiful. &#x2026; He glided slowly along, slightly saluting this and the other; clean, clear fresh as the <date when="1850-06">June</date> evening itself; till the silver buckle of his stock vanished through the door of the next room &#x2026; and I saw him no more. &#x2026; Home at last, about 2 o&#x2019;clock, and found John waiting.&#x201C; Miss Ligon unidentified.

John Welsh wrote to his mother, ca. <date when="1850-07-10">10 July</date>: &#x201C;Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle were at a magnificent ball given by Lady Ashburton about a fortnight ago the grandest thing that has been in London this season about 700 of the top top people there&#x2014;the Duke of Wellington and such. Mrs. C. told me that when Carlyle insisted on their going she sat down and cried for two hours about what she was to put on as a ball dress&#x2014;it was the first grand aristocratic ball he had ever been at and the first of any kind she had been at for many years. Fancy Carlyle at a ball of that sort! Mrs. C. says however that with his white waistcoat and white gloves he looked quite as respectable as the most of the people there as the men she said were mostly horribly ugly. She is a first rate hand at describing a thing of that sort. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> went to see what sort of a thing a grand ball was&#x201C; (Huxley, <hi rend="italic">LJWC</hi> 630).</note>&#x2014; On Saturday I went to Addiscombe with a party of <hi rend="italic">boys</hi> and <hi rend="italic">girls</hi> and returned on Monday night M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and Thackeray came to dinner on Sunday but had to return at night every room being taken up&#x2014; I cant imagine why Lady A always asks <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to help her with these flirting young ladies and gentlemen I feel more disposed to wring their necks than take part in their riotous nonsense.</p>
<p>Now; all is changed in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> quarter by the death of Peel&#x2014;Lady A was deeply attached to him&#x2014;she is off into the country again to escape parties; came here on her way, all in tears, and asked M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to come by himself <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week&#x2014;as one asks the Clergyman when one is in affliction!&#x2014;indeed this death has produced a greater dismay than any public event of my time. Not <pb id="pg-25-113" n="25:113"/>only among his own set but crowds of working people pressed round his house all the time of his illness demanding news which a Constable lifted above their heads tried to make heard in vain&#x2014;and written pape<supplied>[r]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> bulletins were finally hoisted up to be read by the crowd from hour to hour&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is mourning over him as I never saw him mourn before&#x2014;went today to look at the house where he lies dead!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But no impression lasts long in London society&#x2014;in a few weeks they will all be visiting and &#x201C;making wits&#x201C; again as if nothing had happened&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have seen little of Geraldine she comes pretty often but has always engagements to hurry her away&#x2014; She has sworn friendship with Fanny Lewald the German Authoress who is also lionizing in London at present&#x2014;and gives me much of her semi-articulate company&#x2014;I also met Jane Eyre (Miss Bronte) one night at Thackeays a less figure than Geraldine and extremely unimpressive to <hi rend="italic">look at</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray&#x2019;s da. describes the evening, <date when="1850-06-12">12 June</date>, of the reception in honor of Charlotte Bront&#xEB;, &#x201C;a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, pale, with fair straight hair, and steady eyes &#x2026; dressed in a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">bar&#xE8;ge</hi></foreign> dress with a pattern of faint green moss. &#x2026; It was a gloomy and a silent evening. Everyone waited for the brilliant conversation which never began at all. Miss Bront&#xEB; retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to our kind governess. &#x2026; The room looked very dark, the lamp began to smoke a little, the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all&#x201C; (Anna Isabella, Lady Ritchie, <hi rend="italic">Chapters from Some Memoirs</hi> [<date when="1894">1894</date>] 60&#x2013;63).

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your call and your Note, and all your goodness to me! The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> is excellent; nothing can be kinder, or shew a more friendly meaning towards me;&#x2014;and, you may believe me, this is all the good, or nearly all, the brotherliest critic could do me in these sorrowful operations of mine!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1850-06-29">29 June</date>, reviewed the first seven of the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets.</hi> It began by reminding &#x201C;those who have hitherto been the admirers and panegyrists of Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s writing&#x201C; that they &#x201C;have no right to turn round upon him now. In his <hi rend="italic">Latter-day Pamphlets</hi> Mr Carlyle is simply expressing the same views, and in the same manner, that he has for many years been expressing with infinite applause. The only difference is, that instead of pouring out the vials of his humour (we use the word in Ben Jonson&#x2019;s sense) on the French of the first French revolution, or on the contemporaries of Cromwell or of Jocelyn de Brakelonde, he is now pouring them out upon our own.&#x201C; The review ended: &#x201C;In all this there is, more or less, much pregnant matter for reflection. May its readers know how to turn it to account.&#x201C;</note> If <pb id="pg-25-114" n="25:114"/>indeed any critic or person can do me any good or even any real ill in them at all? Alas, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no help for a poor devil in such cases; he must try if he can welter thro&#x2019;, and get done with it; that will help him, that will be a kind of refuge for him!</p>
<p>On the whole, the people greedily read and buy these Pamphlets, and violently abuse them, I believe: this means that the people take their physic, and that it is physic to them: what other response could be expected or desired by me?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. E. Forster wrote during <date when="1850-08">August</date> to his brother-in-law William Arnold in India: &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s pamphlets will amuse you. They have had an immense reading, but probably less effect than almost any of his writings. They are so one-sided in their stern, almost lurid gloom and preference of the past to the present; and besides, it is too late now to try to whip the world into good manners. It has grown past the flogging age, and all the movement got by the beneficent whip nowadays is, thanks to the pig principle within us, a retrograde movement. Still, the power of his sincerity is great, and he wields his whip sincerely enough&#x201C; (T. W. Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of William Edward Forster</hi> [<date when="1888">1888</date>] 1:268).</note></p>
<p>The best is, I am on the last Pamph<hi rend="italic">t</hi> now,&#x2014;thank Heaven! And were it once well off my hands,&#x2014;then surely there shall be another soiree at L. I. Fields,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields, where Forster lived.</note> and a friendly pipe of tobacco offered to the <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi> there, along with Craik or whom you will. Be that a fixed point. But we must have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> first,&#x2014;say ten days hence or so; for the summer heat is frightful on me; and with that and other bother all strength is withered out of my poor soul and poor body alike.</p>
<p>And so good night, dear Forster. I had other things to say, but a man has come in, and I must cut short.</p>
<p>Poor Sir Robert,&#x2014;alas, alas! No public event, for many years, or ever in my life, has seemed to me more tragical. I will not quarrel with you now for defending even Russell:&#x2014;God only knows what course things now will take; if there be not below decks wisdom of which one sees no symptoms above!</p>

<p><salute>What a day you had yesterday for company to your sad thoughts!</salute> Today is brighter; you will at least look upon peaceable green fields and summer trees; prophetic to one, surely, of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> among all the miserable sorrow that there is. It does the sick heart good to look in silence on the face of our old Mother and her skies.&#x2014; Alas, dear Lady, I fear we have both of us a great <hi rend="italic">many</hi> sad thoughts to struggle with in these days! We must try <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to struggle ignobly with them. We must do the best we can with our griefs and contradictions and provocations; in them too lies <hi rend="italic">good</hi>,&#x2014;and we shall get it if we be ourselves <hi rend="italic">good.</hi> That is my faith always: and you too I love always the more the nobler I see you. Know that always, if it is of any use to you to know it. <foreign>Eheu, Eheu!</foreign>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday I wandered, for afternoon walk, to Whitehall Gardens;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peel&#x2019;s residence.</note> I know not well why to such a sad spot. Some rain was still blowing about; there stood a shifting group of people, gentlemen and common people, looking sorrowfully on the House and the carriages, rich and poor, that seemed to be continually driving up,&#x2014;three there while I passed. All men were silent, all looked grave and sad. The house with its white curtains, as if winding-sheeted; and in that gay room where I had been the other night&#x2014;ah me! Passing out at the other end of the Banqueting House,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Banqueting Hall, Whitehall, erected <date when="1622">1622</date>.</note> there came the old Duke<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wellington.</note> to do his sad ceremony too; he had nodded to his coachman to go round the other way before I noticed that it was he; some poor people lifted their hats to him, the old hero staggered on,&#x2014;I thought, on the saddest errand I had seen a man go. With many thoughts, I turned home again. The sympathy of all the world is notable; all men feel that there has a great and sad thing befallen.</p>
<p>If I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write something to reach you on Saturday night,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Fri.</note>&#x2014;then shall I bid you expect me? Alas, you know well how gladly I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> come. I will try actually; if the <hi rend="italic">day</hi> be fair, and certain other things not quite too wasteful do not forbid the project. <closer><salute>God bless you, brave and noble Friend. About 2 O&#x2019;clock on Sunday probably:&#x2014;but some time or other I think I really shall be there. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, I kiss your hands</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I could give myself a good whipping (with a few side strokes to <hi rend="italic">the getters up</hi> of our new post-office regulations<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abandoning Sun. delivery of letters. Lord Ashley successfully moved the presentation of an Address to the Queen, <date when="1850-05-30">30 May</date>, requesting cancellation of Sun. work in the post office. The decision was widely criticized and was reversed in <date when="1850-08">Aug.</date></note>) for having let the 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> pass without any remembrance of me to old Mary.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note> But it is myself who am the <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> delinquent, for I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have sent my packet to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> anyday of the week who would not have been too puritanical to transmit it too her on the Sunday. I did not think of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> however till too late, having not yet got familiarized to these new regulations. it was only on Friday that it struck my stupidity a letter despatched that night would not be delivered any longer on Sunday. Better late than never anyhow&#x2014;so I send today five shillings for a pair of new shoes to Mary or anything else you may please to invest it in&#x2014;and some lace for Margaret<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone.</note> to put on a cap.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Two</hi> of the roses you sent me are in a promising way and also the polianthuses&#x2014;but the third rose is clean dead and the sweet briar too I fear is past hope&#x2014;it did well at first&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">too</hi> well I suppose; for it hurried itself to put out leaves when it should have been quietly taking root. a procedure not confined to sweetbriars&#x2014;one sees many human beings go off in the same fashion</p>
<p>There has been a dreadful racket here this season&#x2014;worse I think than in any London season I ever lived thro&#x2014;it has seemed to me sometimes as if the town must burst into spontaneous combustion. All the people of my acquaintance <pb id="pg-25-117" n="25:117"/>who come to London occasionally have come&#x2014;this year at one time&#x2014;spoiling the pleasure I should have had in seeing them individually by presenting themselves all in a rush, in fact our house for two months back has been like an Inn, only &#x201C;no money taken.&#x201C; and I feel like a Landlady after an Election week.</p>
<p>And then the Balls and parties all round one, to certain of which I have had to go for the sake of what is called &#x201C;keeping up ones acquaintance,&#x201C; have been enough to churn one into a sort of human &#x201C;Trifle&#x201C;&#x2014; Peels death came like a black cloud over this scene of so called &#x201C;Gaities&#x201C; for a few days but only for a few days&#x2014;nothing leaves a long impression here&#x2014; People dare not let themselves think or feel in this Centre of frivolity and folly; they would go mad if they did and universally commit suicide: for to &#x201C;<foreign>tak a thocht</foreign> and mend&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;Address to the Deil&#x201C; st. 21.</note> is far from their intention</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t know what is to be done next, now that the town is emptying, and my Husband in the act of finishing his last Pamphlet&#x2014; I suppose <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will go away somwhere but where or when will not be known till the day before he does it&#x2014; my old Helen&#x2014;(now gone to the dogs) used to beg pathetically that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> might be told &#x201C;in time to wash all his shirts&#x201C;&#x2014;but he couldnt tell what he didnt know himself till the eleventh hour&#x2014; Probably he will be in Annandale wherever else&#x2014;for myself; I have an ardent and wholesome desire to get my house cleaned! under my own eyes, this year&#x2014;for&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t it need it!&#x2014;besides I had such a fagging about last year, that I feel no need of stirring at all&#x2014;and London is always pleasantest to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> when what is called &#x201C;empty.&#x201C; For my health, it is <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> better than last year&#x2014;not much&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">make it do</hi>&#x2014; <closer><salute>All good be with you and yours dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2014; Ever your</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Pamphlet;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, unless N. J. Denisoun&#x2019;s pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Letters to G. Webb Hall.</hi></note> thanks for your friendly vote on my behalf.

<p>I agree with everything you say about the Currency, and the mad Currency-doctors; who seem to me, in these times, a real <hi rend="italic">weariness</hi> of the flesh. One&#x2019;s hope and comfort is, that the Devil will take them all to himself before long!&#x2014; I am sorry not to see any vestige hitherto of a successor to Peel; whose death, at this precise juncture, looms out upon me as one of the most signal national calamities. But the Upper Powers, I suppose, must know better than we!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; still very busy, I will write you a line today,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> pressure of business being happily got past. My last Pamphlet is now happily all in the Printer&#x2019;s hands; what I call <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> only a few small corrections waiting me now; and in a day or two I hope to have that vile job, for one, fairly off my hands! I can assure you all it is a welcome deliverance to me, this; what with hot biliary weather, what with &#x201C;one tirade and another&#x201C; (which latter item is itself rather heavy on me, of late) I had a sore wrestle with the thing; and have not often had to struggle harder not to be beat. And so I am out at last,&#x2014;thanks be to Heaven, so far. Oh, Heaven <hi rend="italic">is</hi> good, if we could steadily <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> its goodness as we ought!</p>
<p>There is fundamentally nothing whatever wrong with my health: a good spell of rest, and solitary quiet somewhere, will, to all calculation, set me up again and more. I must now set about getting my house put in order; and arrange myself for that new course of adventure. What to do, or whitherward specially to go, is greatly an uncertainty with me; and indeed I had much rather lie down where I am, if that would answer; which it will not. Wales invites me by its hospitable silence; but it is a great way off,&#x2014;almost as far as Scotsbrig, reckoned in time and difficulty; and the gaunt <hi rend="italic">dulness</hi> that awaits me there, not even <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> dulness altogether, is alarming to the imagination! The truth is, I am altogether undecided for some days yet; and the only certainty I can promise myself is that of coming to Scotsbrig for a few days <hi rend="italic">by and by</hi>,&#x2014;perhaps very soon; for my thoughts run in that direction, as one of <pb id="pg-25-119" n="25:119"/>the first places I should aim at. A sleep amid the wilderness of Craigenputtoch itself seems almost inviting to me in this humour.</p>
<p>This last Pamphlet is not much worth, but it will do too. Indeed I often judge falsely of the effect they will produce: <hi rend="italic">Hudson</hi>, which I thought clearly the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of the lot, seems to have given an unexpected degree of satisfaction, and is in various quarters called the <hi rend="italic">best.</hi> So be it. They have been beautifully abused, and extensively read, those poor Pamphlets; and not a grain of God&#x2019;s truth is in them but will produce its whole effect one day (if there be truth in them at all): that is the comfort one has in such cases.&#x2014; &#x2014; Who &#x201C;Denison&#x201C; is is I don&#x2019;t know: his Pamphlet is rather clever, a downright kind of thing; and I send you his Letter, which came this morning.</p>
<p>Our weather was cool, almost <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> for three weeks; and now within the last day or two it has grown excessively hot; tho&#x2019; it is still partly <hi rend="italic">grey</hi>, and has wind in it. I hope you do not suffer much by it, dear Mother: Jack comforts me extremely by reporting so well of your health.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter of <date when="1850-07-11">11 July</date>, saying that his mother was reading &#x201C;the poor tailor&#x2019;s autobiography&#x201C; and sent her love. He asked whether &#x201C;the said tailor,&#x201C; presumably Charles Kingsley, had &#x201C;called or sent for the Dante I left for him.&#x201C;</note> Tell him I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> now got one of the lightest <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> hats, and a <hi rend="italic">white</hi> one besides; and in fact am clad altogether in apparel of imaginery weight,&#x2014;fit for the summer we have. If Jean is with you, give my love to her; say I have often remembered her in silence.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken replied, <date when="1850-07-22">22 July</date>, that she and &#x201C;wee Tom&#x201C; had arrived, <date when="1850-07-15">15 July</date>. &#x201C;What a comfort these Pamphlets are done: tho I think you &#x2018;could a gean on a bit langer as you had plenty of mair stuff.&#x2019; However the Public will be no worse of a while to digest what they have got. / Our Mother is better than I expected to find her; she goes <foreign><hi rend="italic">lunting</hi></foreign> about with a light gown on &#x26; almost nothing else on her this warm weather.&#x201C; Jenny Hanning was coming to Scotsbrig, <date when="1850-07-24">24 July</date>, and she, Jean, would return to Dumfries.</note> The like to Jamie and Isabella, and all the rest. I hope to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> them all soon, once more; and to tell you all my news better than I can here!

<p><salute>My dear Emerson, my Friend, my Friend,&#x2014;</salute>You behold before you a remorseful man! It is well nigh a year now since I despatched some hurried rag of paper to you out of Scotland, indicating doubtless that I would speedily follow it with a longer letter; and here, when grey Autumn is at hand again, I have still written nothing to you, heard nothing from you! It is miserable to think of:&#x2014;and yet it is a fact, and there is no denying of it; and so we must let <pb id="pg-25-120" n="25:120"/>it by. If it please Heaven, the like shall not occur again. &#x201C;<foreign>Ohone Arooh!</foreign>&#x201C; as the Irish taught me to say, &#x201C;<foreign>Ohone Arooh!</foreign>&#x201C;</p>
<p>The fact is, my life has been black with care and toil,&#x2014;labour above board and far worse labour below;&#x2014;I have hardly had a heavier year (overloaded too with a kind of &#x201C;health&#x201C; which may be called frightful): to &#x201C;burn my own smoke&#x201C; in some measure, has really been all I was up to; and except on sheer immediate compulsion I have not written a word to any creature.&#x2014; Yesternight I finished the last of these extraordinary <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets;</hi> am about running off somewhither into the deserts, of Wales or Scotland, Scandinavia or still remoter deserts;&#x2014;and my first signal of revived reminiscence is to you.</p>
<p>Nay I have not at any time forgotten you, be that justice done the unfortunate: and tho&#x2019; I see well enough what a great deep cleft divides us, in our ways of practically looking at this world,&#x2014;I see also (as probably you do yourself) where the rock-strata, miles deep, unite again; and the two poor souls are at one. Poor devils!&#x2014; Nay if there were no point of agreement at all, and I were more intolerant of &#x201C;ways of thinking&#x201C; than I even am,&#x2014;yet has not the man Emerson, from old years, been a Human Friend to me? Can I ever forget, or think otherwise than lovingly of the man Emerson?&#x2014; &#x2014; No more of this. Write to me in your first good hour; and say that there is still a brother-soul left to me alive in this world, and a kind thought surviving far over the sea!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Chapman, with due punctuality at the time of publication, sent me the <hi rend="italic">Representative Men;</hi> which I read in the becoming manner: you now get the Book offered you for a shilling, at all Railway stations; and indeed I perceive the word &#x201C;representative man&#x201C; (as applied to the late tragic loss we have had in Sir R. Peel) has been adopted by the Able-Editors, and circulates thro&#x2019; Newspapers as an appropriate household word. Which is some compensation to you for the piracy you suffer from the Typographic Letter-of-marque men here. I found the Book a most finished clear and perfect set of <hi rend="italic">Engravings in the line manner;</hi> portraitures full of <hi rend="italic">likeness</hi>, and abounding in instruction and materials for reflexion to me: thanks always for such a Book; and Heaven send us many more of them. <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi>, I think, tho&#x2019; it is the most admired by many, did least for me: little save Socrates with his clogs and big ears remains alive with me from it. <hi rend="italic">Swedenborg</hi> is excellent in <hi rend="italic">likeness;</hi> excellent in many respects;&#x2014;yet I said to myself, on reaching your general conclusion about the man and his struggles: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Missed</hi> the consummate flower and divine ultimate elixir of Philosophy, say you? By Heaven, in clutching at <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and &#x2018;almost getting it,&#x2019; he has tumbled into Bedlam,&#x2014;which is a terrible <hi rend="italic">miss</hi>, if it were never so <hi rend="italic">near!</hi> A miss fully as good as a mile, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; In fact, I generally dissented a little about the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of all these Essays; which was notable, and not without instructive interest to me, as I had so lustily shouted &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201C; all the way from the beginning up to that stage.&#x2014; On the whole, <pb id="pg-25-121" n="25:121"/>let us have another Book with your earliest convenience: that is the modest request one makes of you on shutting this.</p>
<p>I know not what I am now going to set about: the horrible barking of the universal dog-kennel (awakened by these <hi rend="italic">Pamph</hi>ts) must still itself again; my poor nerves must recover themselves a little:&#x2014;I have much more to say; and by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing must try to get it said in some way, if I live.&#x2014; Bostonian Prescott is here, infinitely <hi rend="italic">lionised</hi> by a mob of gent<hi rend="italic">n;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Imitations of Horace</hi>, epis. 1, bk. 2, &#x201C;To Augustus&#x201C; 99&#x2013;101.</note> I have seen him in two places or three (but forbore speech):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prescott wrote to his wife, <date when="1850-07-18">18 July</date>, that he had just dined with J. G. Lockhart, where &#x201C;Carlyle was invited, but was unwell. He came the other day to a place five minutes after I left it, and I sat next but two to him &#x2026; some time since, and never knew I was in his company. &#x2026; It proves he did not talk loud that day&#x201C; (G. Ticknor, <hi rend="italic">Life of Prescott</hi> 341). Prescott had scorned TC and his <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> in a letter to the historian George Bancroft (<date when="1800">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891">1891</date>), <date when="1838-11-01">1 Nov. 1838</date>, as &#x201C;a bungler at his own business. &#x2026; The whole thing, in my humble opinion, &#x2026; is perfectly contemptible&#x201C; (Ticknor 388).</note> the Johnny-cake is good, the twopence worth of currants in it too are good;&#x2014;but if you offer it as a bit of baked Ambrosia, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>I am seriously thinking of a flight in your direction now. The <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of these Pamphlets (we are to end with N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 8) is about off my hands,&#x2014;with a terrible struggle; for really in my life I was hardly ever in a more broken heavy-laden, and every-way worn out condition: some repose is most pressingly demanded for this weary soul and body: and, as usual, the quiet nook of St Donat&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village on coast, S Wales, nr. Cowbridge.</note> rises as an asylum on my bewilderment. Occasionally I think of Scotland too, of various lands, and localities and arrangements; for all is perplexity, and my strength is so low at present, even plain paths are beset by brambles and lions for me. Perhaps it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> wisest of all to come for three weeks of sleep and sea-bathing into your friendly hermitage? If it were but a little nearer!&#x2014; But you cannot bring it &#x201C;nearer&#x201C;; that is a respect in which you cannot mend it for me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, at all events, tell me what are the Days, within the next <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>, in which I could accomplish the journey with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> stopping over-night at Bristol: a sleepless night in that respectable old city is a bugbear that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be avoided. Say at what hours one goes from Paddington:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Railway station.</note> I really must make an effort, and lift anchor; and the sooner now I set about the process the better. Tell me also if there are not Steamers from Swansea to Liverpool: I could go to Annandale by that route, after you had done with me at Boverton. Temperance, Silence, <pb id="pg-25-123" n="25:123"/>horse-exercise, sea-bathing: these, with a friend&#x2019;s welcome, might surely do me good!</p>
<p>You will not get this (owing to Lord Ashley and the Judaizing Shamchristians) till Monday:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat.</note> so about Wednesday I will look for your answer.</p>
<p>My Brother is home to Annandale a month ago; my Wife continues here while I wander. I decide to try for a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> ramble (perhaps over seas too) before I return.&#x2014; The &#x201C;universal dogkennel&#x201C; makes such a bowowing over these <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> as never was heard before: but the sale continues brisk and wide; and there will, by and by, a little good be got of them after all.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Till Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> or Thursday, then&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your two Essays;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patmore wrote several essays on architecture. These may be &#x201C;The Aesthetics of Gothic Architecture,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">British Quarterly Review</hi> 10 (<date when="1849">1849</date>):46&#x2013;75, and &#x201C;Ruskin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Seven Lamps of Architecture</hi>,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">North British Review</hi> 12 (<date when="1850">1850</date>):309&#x2013;53.</note> both of which I have looked over, and find to abound in studious exactness, discernment and ingenuity: two Papers very welcome indeed, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think to all architects and critics of architecture. To myself, as to every one, the spiritual qualities manifest in what you say, are very welcome. Unhappily I have next to no knowledge of architecture;&#x2014;and in late years (must I blush to own?) absolutely no care whatever about it,&#x2014;except to keep well out of the way of it, and of the twaddle too commonly uttered upon it! So that except on general grounds I am a very bad reader for you.</p>
<p>On Friday unluckily I am not to be at home: do not come that day. Your best time is about 3 in the afternoon,&#x2014;almost any afternoon;&#x2014;in the evening also ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7 o&#x2019;clock, there is free ingress, and little chance of a disappoint<hi rend="italic">t.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patmore had written to a friend, <date when="1847">1847</date>: &#x201C;I entertain just now a great many <hi rend="italic">dislikes.</hi> Carlyle is one. He worships only power and intellect&#x2014;which are attributes of the devil as well as of God. But I feel I shall like him better, when I shall have time to think more about him&#x201C; (B. Champneys, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence of Coventry Patmore</hi> [<date when="1900">1900</date>] 2:150).</note></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Today there came a Letter for you, I suppose from <hi rend="italic">Dushtie</hi> of Munich,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps of the Eichthals at Munich; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01"><sic>5:134</sic><corr>TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>, though Baron d&#x2019;Eichthal is misidentified there as David.</note>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Postman, in his haste to oblige, demanded to have your Address put upon, and then took away with him. Not till after he was gone, had I time to bethink me that he had better have left it, and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written a word, and saved the penny! Here is the word, at any rate.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> done with &#x201C;Jesuitism&#x201C;; have been in castor and blue-pill,&#x2014;weather very hot;&#x2014;am thinking continually of getting my packages made up. It seems likeliest I shall go to Glamorganshire after all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1850-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;My last Pamph<hi rend="italic">t</hi> now done; had a horrible struggle with it and the preceding one; being in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> stage of biliary weakness and dispiritment;&#x2014; mean now to make for S. Wales (Redwood&#x2019;s), and have some rest there. That first: then what next&#x2014;what! (Finish, today; could not write the above for hurry and confused prostrat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of all energies till now). Am for Scotland too, to see my dear old Mother once again: that also is a fixed thing. Enough today.&#x201C;</note> Here is Redwood&#x2019;s Note of this morning. &#x201C;Early next week,&#x201C; I imagine, must be the appointed day: and probably I may stay overnight at Bath which I have hardly ever seen, rather than at Bristol which I have. What is the use of going &#x201C;in one day,&#x201C; after all? I bethink me of Landor at Bath whom I could have a little talk with. Say Monday next week! I expect to recover fast in Redwood&#x2019;s solitude, with one of his ponies and the sea-bathing. I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ill fundamentally; rather <hi rend="italic">well</hi> almost; but the weakly irritation, with all its sad <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, has risen to a pitch!</p>
<p>Last night, to crown my sorrows, we were inveighed into a Procter <foreign>Soiree</foreign>;&#x2014;Dinner. I resolutely refused to hear of, and so could not well get off farther. Mrs Butler (Kemble) home from the Union was the heroine. A most obstreperous, coarse, and to me ungainly heroine.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Anne Butler, actress, known as Fanny Kemble. The Carlyles disliked her, but perhaps she had also spoken up against slavery, which she had known from her days as mistress of a Georgia plantation and which she detested.</note> She has realised a fortune (&#xa3;400 a-year in amount) by &#x201C;reading&#x201C; Shakspeare in Cincinnati &#x26;c &#x26;c; is now quite divorced, and means to try &#x201C;reading&#x201C; here again. I won&#x2019;t accept another headache for her sake! Oh, the vile pother I was in, all evening! Jews, Greeks</p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>I cannot come on Friday, nor this week;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Wed.</note> it must be the next, the beginning of next. Nay I think it will be better not to attempt the whole journey in one day, if it be such a bother of haste. Better take one&#x2019;s chance for a night, and have deliberation otherwise, than be so flurried and hurried. I think of staying over the night in <hi rend="italic">Bath</hi> rather than in Bristol: I have bethought me that Landor is there, with whom I might have a little talk in passing. You shall have due warning: I will write to you both when the day for Bath is fixed,&#x2014;and if it be needful (nay it will hardly be possible, I doubt!) from Bath itself.</p>
<p>Your redhaired man will do perfectly well, instead of you, at Cardiff. And <hi rend="italic">if</hi>you or he could get me half a dozen right <hi rend="italic">big</hi> and well-constructed <hi rend="italic">Tobacco-pipes</hi> (a feat not possible, I believe, or hardly possible in those parts), it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a marked improvement in my outlooks! Clothes I shall not forget, nor gutta-percha shoes;&#x2014;and on the whole, I expect to get on very handsomely for my three weeks,&#x2014;wrecked as I am (in very many senses) for the pres<hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
<p>About Saturday I will write you another word of warning.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I have got the Cardiff Newspaper,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; not till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Letter;&#x2014;and I mean duly to examine it for the Steamers.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear Redwood,&#x2014;</salute>I now know not in the least what to do! Landor answers, cordially pressing me not only to call on him but to stay over night with him at Bath:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Landor wrote, ca. <date when="1850-07-25">25 July</date>, from Rivers St., Bath: &#x201C;No visit could give me greater pleasure than yours.

I have a comfortable bedroom at your service, and I shall be vext if ever you spend a single hour at a Bath inn. &#x2026; If Mrs Carlyle remembers such a person, pray present my compliments.&#x201C;</note> but alas, on looking at the Steamboat Advertise<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, I perceive there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no boat attainable at all after &#x201C;Friday,&#x201C; which is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day.

Of Cardiff and the Merthyr or Swansea Rail I can make nothing from this imbroglio of a Guide!&#x2014; &#x2014; We must on the whole let it lie, till I study farther. Two hot days would send me swiftly out of this in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> direction:&#x2014;but at present the weather is cool and even wet. On Monday morning, at any rate, I am ready to go; and will go as soon after that as I find feasible. The train that suits me seems to leave Paddington at 12&#xBD; p.m. a very good hour,&#x2014;had there been a boat in the rear of it!</p>
<p>We can say nothing more at present; I will write to you again tomorrow or Sunday: if there is an evening mail to Cowbridge, the Note may perhaps reach you on Monday.</p>
<p>I am weak, and worn to pieces.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Duffy,&#x2014;</salute>The enclosed Note&#x2014;otherwise a <hi rend="italic">model</hi> in its way, brings me in mind of poor old Ireland; and of this time twelvemonth on the street of Stranorlar where I saw you last. Take the Note, therefore; and a transient sincere blessing from me along with it. <hi rend="italic">Look</hi> at &#x201C;p. 17,&#x201C; however, if you chance to have it within reach; and then let us lift up both our hands, and bless the anonymous Coleraine friend.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x201C;Downing Street&#x201C; TC had sarcastically suggested that the work of Parliament, whose chief function currently seemed to be the selection of some insignificant person to be prime minister, might be better transferred to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, &#x201C;which needs no beer-barrels or hustings, and is <hi rend="italic">cheaper</hi> in expense of money and of falsity a thousand and a million fold&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:100). An anonymous correspondent wrote to TC, <date when="1850-07-21">21 July</date>, from Coleraine, co. Londonderry: &#x201C;You mention an admirable project in p 17 of your &#x2018;Downing Street.&#x2019; But why should not something be done as well as said? &#x2026; Why not do something yourself? Say you start a paper at the beginning of next session; you write a leading article now and then, to explain the <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> of certain questions before the House, to explain the nature of the difficulties which it is necessary to meet, and to give statistics when necessary, and let the rest of the paper be open to any M.P., in the way you propose. If your objection to this be of a pecuniary nature, I, for one, would readily subscribe &#xa3;10 a year until there are sufficient funds to carry it on.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>These <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> are now out of my hands; thank God. The last of them is waiting for <date when="1850-08">August</date> in the Printer&#x2019;s or Publisher&#x2019;s hands; and that ugly piece of work, like some others, has been got into the rear. Such a universal howl of astonishment, indignation, and condemnation seldom rose around a poor man before. Voice of the &#x201C;universal dogkennel&#x201C;: &#x201C;Whaf-thaf! Bow-wow!&#x201C;&#x2014;no <hi rend="italic">human</hi> response hitherto, or hardly any;*&#x2014;but that also will come so far as needful, I have no doubt.</p>
<p>My poor <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> is gone almost to destruction with all this, and with the summer heats and other fell <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>. I seldom in my life felt more entirely worn down; I am now straight for the country,&#x2014;Glamorganshire (S.

<p>Your &#x201C;Tenant Agitation&#x201C; looms out very big on me; and I must say it wears a more business-like aspect than any of the previous &#x201C;agitations&#x201C;:&#x2014;and, I could <pb id="pg-25-128" n="25:128"/>fancy, may give work to all the &#x201C;authorities&#x201C; (on your side of the water and ours) for a generation or two to come!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When Duffy restarted the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, he replaced the cause of repeal with tenant rights, involving fair rents and security of tenure; it gathered widespread popular support early in the year, and by <date when="1850-08">Aug.</date> tenant rights activists, north and south, joined in a Tenant League, which was to lead to a parliamentary campaign.</note> Yes, that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the heart of the matter: and a terrific universe of &#x201C;work&#x201C; lies <hi rend="italic">there</hi> before we get to a solution of it! <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Cosa fatta ha capo</hi></foreign> [This kind of thing has an end]; to end, one must <hi rend="italic">begin;</hi> that is true too. <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">Suaviter in modo</hi></foreign>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;[Gently in manner] <foreign><hi rend="italic">fortiter in re</hi></foreign> [strong in effect]&#x201C;; proverbial.</note> then; and good be with you!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your little Note is so kind and hospitable, I cannot but decide to come and lodge with you as I pass thro&#x2019; Bath. After some delays, Wednesday first appears to be settled as the day: the train I think of coming by, leaves Paddington at half past 12, and professes to reach Bath at 4&#xBC;. I will contrive to find Rivers Street soon after that. My Cardiff Steamer leaves Bristol at 10&#xBC; next morning,&#x2014;which, I think, means <hi rend="italic">Bath</hi> by the mail train at 9&#xBC;.</p>
<p>My Wife returns many compliments, and is very proud to be remembered by you. Here is good weather too about to return,&#x2014;and room for hoping, in this &#x201C;place of Hope!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Favorite phrase of TC; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301010-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:171</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-10-10">10 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> <closer><salute>Till Wednesday afternoon then&#x2014; &#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got Jean&#x2019;s Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1850-07-22">22 July</date>, from Scotsbrig.</note> and I got yours; I write you one word today, lest there be still less time tomorrow. After some haggling about the Cardiff Steamers, <pb id="pg-25-129" n="25:129"/>wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> did not suit me with their Bristol hours, it has at length been as good as fixed that I am to go on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> (day after tomorrow), from Paddington at 12&#xBD; p.m.; then <hi rend="italic">at Bath</hi>, Landor, who responds with great cordiality, is to take me over to his abode, and lodge me all night (&#x201C;Rivers Street, Bath&#x201C;); the next morning, Thursday at &#xBC; past 10 (starting from Bath by the mail train at 9&#xBC; a.m.) I get on board a Cardiff Steamer at Bristol; and in some 3 hours more, if all go right, Redwood puts me into his tub-gig on Welsh Ground; and a drive of 2 hours or so lands the &#x201C;happy couple&#x201C; at Boverton,&#x2014;greatly to the joy of poor Redwood at any rate! That is the figure of the program as it at present stands; which I send you for settling my good Mother&#x2019;s anxieties. To her I will write very quickly after my arrival;&#x2014;probably about this day week the Note will come: but her good heart must not take into the flutters even if it do not; for I may still be detained about Bristol or Bath till <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> (at which hour the Steamer suits too), and so the Letter be delayed a day. Tell her not to be uneasy about me in any case; for I am really <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in the foundations of my health, only tattered, a bit, and in need of repose.&#x2014; After three weeks or so of Redwood (<hi rend="italic">three</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> fancy will be enough!) I calculate on getting by a <hi rend="italic">Swansea</hi> Steamer to Liverpool, and hitting either the Annan one or else the railway there.&#x2014; &#x2014; Darwin went off this morning, to Ventnor Isle of Wight. A. Sterling is in Ireland again. Everybody is away, and the Town very quiet:&#x2014;the rainy wild weather is gone too, and I think we are going to have it dry again. Jane is pretty hopeful; is to have Geraldine when I am gone. <closer><salute>Blessings on you all.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Redwood,&#x2014;</salute>I have actually my trunks out here, and am about to begin the horrible work of packing! Never in my life did I feel the job so unsupportable; I ask myself, &#x201C;Why travel?&#x201C; My poor soul seems to desire one thing, that I could be left alone, and not bothered with doing another act or speaking another word in this world! But I must go on with it; I am bound in honour,&#x2014;and otherwise it is very needful too. My program therefore is this:</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Wednesday) at half past 12, leave the Paddington Station; reach Bath about 4&#xBC;, where Landor hospitably waits me, and insists on my lodging with him for the night; next morning (Thursday) get to Bristol in time for the Cardiff steamer, which is announced to sail at 10&#xBC; a.m.,&#x2014;and on this craft, if the Powers be good to me, arrive in the Bute Docks (I suppose) about <pb id="pg-25-130" n="25:130"/>1 or shortly after, and am rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> by the hospitable Redwood or his man, am packed into the tub gig (almost without word spoken,&#x2014;perhaps a little tobacco cautiously administered), and so set down at Boverton, and there left silent for three weeks!&#x2014; &#x2014; If you are yourself at all engaged, don&#x2019;t in the least mind; your man will perfectly serve the turn: tell him he is to look out for an elderly thin man of your own stature; he will know him by his grim look, sober clothing, grizzled temples and <hi rend="italic">white hat;</hi>&#x2014;the last mark is perhaps the best for his perceptive organs. And so if you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing more</hi>, let it stand settled.</p>
<p>However, you had better <hi rend="italic">inquire</hi> of the Postman on Thursday morning before starting. It is possible Landor or some other cause may incite my indolence or curiosity to a <hi rend="italic">whole day</hi> in Bath; in which case <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> (11 a.m. steamer) will be the day; of which I will warn you on Wednesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> from Bath. That is by no means <hi rend="italic">likely;</hi> but that too is a possibility for us, and we may as well include. <hi rend="italic">Nothing more</hi> by Post means Thursday as above.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> then, and happy meeting to us.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks, my kind little Dearest;</salute> I did not look for a Letter today; but find one with a Newspaper silently lying to welcome to me when I step in (by the window) out of our still &#x201C;lawn,&#x201C; into the stillest of all houses, with the intention of writing a word to <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> My hand is jumping about, not yet used to this new locality and this little <hi rend="italic">writingcase</hi> &#x201C;desk,&#x201C; instead of my old big one; indeed Redwood (who rather wishes to be a <hi rend="italic">doctor</hi>, I find, but cannot get me for a patient at all, at all) prohibited any kind of writing today: but I of course laughed the notion to scorn; declaring that one little word to my Wife and another to my Mother were achievements I would do, were I at the point of death, instead of being very tolerably well as at this present! You, poor little soul, had to strive with headache; I at present have nothing against me,&#x2014;except extreme indolence, and now a very limited allowance of time. Swift therefore!</p>
<p>My journey to Bath passed without accident or occurrence of any kind, except indeed the suffocation in foul air which I find inseparable from travel in railways. We gradually <hi rend="italic">filled</hi> soon, either at Paddington or the next Stations. Our fat friend whom you saw took in a still fatter and uglier Wife before many stages, a daughter too; and was rather uncivil to an old Lady (old as Mrs <pb id="pg-25-131" n="25:131"/>Chorley) who sat on their side: indeed I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> him an uncivil ugly fellow;&#x2014;and discovered at last that he was a boarding-school master in opulent circumstances; an unbeautiful class of men. We had likewise a young pair, with a child and infinite continual eatables and drinkables, and far more money than wit or manners; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> an unimportant, seemingly of the clerk species: in short we were a paltry company; and tho&#x2019; I sat with cheek upon the open window, the air was lamentably bad. I read in Madam Herz;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably J. F&#xfc;rst, <hi rend="italic">Henriette Herz. Ihr Leben und ihre Erinnerungen</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1850">1850</date>). Henriette Herz, b. de Lemos (<date when="1764">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), a famous beauty whose salon in Berlin was frequented by thinkers and writers.</note> spoke no word; looked out upon the green or golden country; and emerged in Bath at last. Landor was in his room, in a fine quiet street, like a New-Town Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> one; waiting for me, attended only by a nice Bologna dog; dinner not far from ready:&#x2014;his apartments all hung round with queer old-Italian Pictures,&#x2014;the very <hi rend="italic">doors</hi> had pictures on them. Dinner was <hi rend="italic">elaborate</hi>-simple; the brave Landor forced me to talk far too much, and we did very near a bottle of claret besides two glasses of sherry,&#x2014;far too much liquor and excitement for a poor fellow like me! However, he was really stirring company; a proud, irascible, trenchant, yet generous veracious and very dignified old man. Quite a ducal or royal man, in the temper of him; reminded me something of old Sterling, except that for Irish blarney, you must substitute a fund of Welsh choler. He left me to go smoking along the streets about ten at night, he himself retiring then; having walked me thro&#x2019; the Crescent,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Crescent, built <date when="1769">1769</date>, a row of houses in the segment of an ellipse more than 600 ft. in length.</note> Park &#x26;c &#x26;c in the dusk before. Bath is decidedly the prettiest Town in all England; nay Edinburgh itself, except for the sea and Grampians,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountains extending NE to cent. Scotland; but TC meant the Pentland Hills, 3 mi. SW of Edinburgh, which lies between the Pentlands and the sea.</note> does not equal it. Regular but by no means formal streets, all clean, all quiet, yet not dead, winding up in picturesque lively varieties along the face of a large broad sweep of woody, green, sandstone Hill,&#x2014;with large outlook to the opposite side of the Valley; and fine decent clean people sauntering about it, mostly small country gentry, I was told; &#x201C;live here for &#xa3;1200 a year,&#x201C; said Landor, who, covertly, bragged somewhat to me both of his own wealth and his own poverty.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Landor was of a wealthy family, with whom he quarreled but who gave him an allowance, much of which went to his estranged wife in Italy.</note>&#x2014; At night unluckily I could not sleep at all for hours, owing mainly to my own state of nerves, tho&#x2019; there were noises too;&#x2014;and on the whole I did not get above a <hi rend="italic">half</hi> sleep out of it: L. himself informed me &#x201C;four hours&#x201C; was his common allowance. Duly at 9&#xBC; o&#x2019;clock, I had recovered my big Portmanteau, got into one of the big vehicles (two nasty fat Puseyish parsons my only company, talking solemnly about <pb id="pg-25-132" n="25:132"/>Gorham,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Phillpotts (<date when="1778">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869">1869</date>; <ref target="volume-25/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22180"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), bishop of Exeter, had refused, <date when="1847">1847</date>, to institute the Rev. George Gorham into the living of Brampford Speke, Devon, because of his alleged unorthodoxy over infant baptism. The bishop was supported by the court of arches, but upon appeal the judicial committee of the privy council found in favor of Gorham in <date when="1850-03">March</date>. In <date when="1850-07">July</date> the dispute continued in various courts, till the archbishop of Canterbury declared that he accepted the legal decisions, and Gorham was inducted to the living, <date when="1850-08-11">11 Aug.</date> E.

Higgle-haggle, so it still went on; and our Omnibus at last only staid the Cardiff Packet by rushing off <hi rend="italic">ahead</hi> of it to <supplied>[a]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> certain Drawbridge, from which, a pause being made, we were made to walk down one of the steepest of temporary gangways (one old man preferred doing it back foremost on his hands and knees); and so <hi rend="italic">at length</hi> getting seated in the quarter-deck with all my luggage in view, I did feel in a place of rest, and as if my part of the journey were <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> Mrs Marcet,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Marcet, Swiss-born writer.</note> with various Geneva-looking granddaughters, and a son ditto-ditto older than myself, was there; yellow, frail and frightfully ugly, tho&#x2019; with an air of honest intelligence,&#x2014;such a <hi rend="italic">chin</hi> as you never saw on a woman, or perhaps man either.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I must write you a word today to indicate my whereabout, and let you know that I am well; but time is so short (the Post just approaching, and other Notes to write), it can only be one word at present. I left Chelsea on Wednesday; staid all night at Bath (90 or 100 miles off) with one Savage Landor, an honourable angry-tempered old literary gentleman; came on next morning to Bristol (10 or 15 miles), got straightway into a Welsh steamer there; sailed 2&#xBD; hours across to Cardiff, and was there taken up by Ch<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Redwood, my &#x201C;beneficent Welsh Attorney&#x201C; into his hospitable &#x201C;tub-gig,&#x201C; and rolled away hither some 13 or 14 miles into the interior, to his strange Hermitage here at Boverton, where I hope to continue in unexampled quietude, sea-bathing and riding, and doing nothing at all, for a week or two; and so gather vigour for farther adventures.</p>
<p>It is the most sequestered mode of life I ever had experience of in this world. The place is altogether in a wild unfrequented, tho&#x2019; flat and not naturally unfruitful district, which extends between Cowbridge (a smartish <hi rend="italic">Yellow-ochred</hi> Town, equal to Lockerby or so) and the solitary south Coast; a Country all cut with the roughest bridle-lanes in every direction, and hardly any smooth road; every mile or two a straggling sleepy sluttish-looking village, or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Clachan</hi></foreign> of 50 or 100 souls (generally with some ruinous old Castle in it); and the Sea and &#x201C;the English Hills&#x201C; (Somersetshire Hills) always visible <pb id="pg-25-134" n="25:134"/>near by to the South. We are about a mile from the Sea-beach here, where there is excellent bathing, in perfection of solitude: Redwood goes off to Cowbridge daily to his Office after breakfast; and leaves me bird-alone in the House, where there is not even a servant to disturb me,&#x2014;his two servants live in a house entering by another door, and are always within call, but not under this roof;&#x2014;we are <hi rend="italic">in</hi> a kind of Village &#x201C;Boverton,&#x201C; but cut off from it too by walls, trees, bushes and lawn, as if it were fifty miles away: at this present writing (Noon, Saturday, bright breezy weather), I have a big bay-window open, a bit of green lawn and bushes visible, and actually no sound at all audible, except the ticking of a big lobby-clock, and the general <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> of the summer woods round me: so I remain, varying it as I like, till six, when Redwood returns. If this will not do for a Hermitage, there is no use trying that trade at all! Add to everything that Redwood is a very <hi rend="italic">taciturn</hi> man,&#x2014;not a &#x201C;convers<hi rend="italic">ical</hi> man&#x201C; by any means;&#x2014;and likes and honours me very much: a man that seems to have less intercourse with neighbours than any other man now living, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say! Unhappily he is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> dull to talk with; and if it were not for very shame I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> read altogether, as I do mostly, all the time of his presence too. He furnishes me with a capital horse (<hi rend="italic">big</hi> poney kind) moreover; and I mean to have a dip in the sea every day while I am here.</p>
<p>Well, dear Jean, this is mainly all I had to tell you; and much more than I at first reckoned on. You have my Address now (&#x201C;Boverton, Cowbridge, S. Wales&#x201C; will do by itself), and you may now write at any vacant hour in the next week or 10 days.&#x2014; I wrote yesterday a hurried word to my Mother; if you send <hi rend="italic">this</hi> over to them, they will be glad of it too, for I was in a dreadful hurry,&#x2014;and again am! The Post hour is a most inconvenient one for me.</p>
<p>Jesuitism I suppose came out last Thursday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Trollope wrote to his mother, possibly about this time or soon after (since he speaks of paying eight shillings for TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi>, which was the price for their separate publication whereas in book form the price was a shilling more, available from <date when="1850-08-10">10 Aug.</date>), though in her <hi rend="italic">A Memoir of Frances Trollope</hi> [<date when="1895">1895</date>] she dates it <date when="1851">1851</date>: &#x201C;I have read&#x2014;nay, I have bought!&#x2014;Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Latter Day Pamphlets</hi>&#x2019; and look on my eight shillings as very much thrown away. To me it appears that the grain of sense is so smothered up in a sack of the sheerest trash, that the former is valueless. He does not himself know what he wants. He has one idea,&#x2014;a hatred of spoken and acted falsehood; and on that he harps throughout the whole eight pamphlets. I look on him as a man who was always in danger of going mad in literature, and who has now done so. I used to swear by some of his earlier work.

<dateline>Sunday night [<date when="1850-08-04">4 August 1850</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>&#x201C;Oh dear me&#x201C;!</salute> It looks already a month since you went away; counting by the number of things I have pulled to pieces, and the weary hours I have lain awake, and the lonely thoughts that have persecuted me. But to lie awake at nights, and to have lonely thoughts by night and by day is surely nothing new or strange for me, that I should think it worth recording at this date! and for the <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, it will not be irksome but &#x201C;a good joy&#x201C;&#x2014;such good joy as I am still susceptible of&#x2014;when it gets into the stage of <hi rend="italic">restoring to order</hi>&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">house</hi> has in fact been rushing down towards chaos during the last year&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> smoothing of the surface kept up and underneath dirt and confusion really too bad&#x2014; But it is in the way of getting itself rehabilitated now, and I shall try in time coming to be a better <hi rend="italic">housewife</hi> at least&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> career being always open to talent.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A variation on Napoleon&#x2019;s announced aim.</note> I remember when I was very ill of a sorethroat at Craigenputtoch, thinking that if I died all my drawers and every thing would be found in the most perfect order. and there was more satisfaction in the thought than you (a <hi rend="italic">man</hi>) can possibly conceive&#x2014;curious to think how all would have gone if I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> died then!</p>
<p>But you will like better some news than &#x201C;bottomless speculations of that sort.&#x201C; Well till Thursday night I had no speech with any mortal&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">then</hi>, about eight o&#x2019;clock walked in M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Lewis of all undesired people!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes Lewes had had a child, Edmund (b. <date when="1850-04-16">16 April</date>) by Thornton Hunt, in whose house she and G.

<p>Today (being Sunday) I told Elizabeth to take herself off for the whole day if she chose, that I might have no proposals to &#x201C;go out&#x201C; during the week when I intend that she <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> work&#x2014; &#x2014; Most likely no one would come I thought and if any one did, I would simply not open the door&#x2014; I was standing with hands all over whitning, having just made <hi rend="italic">a brilliant job</hi> of the curtain rods, when there came a rap and ring&#x2014;no reply&#x2014;I held Nero&#x2019;s nose that he might not bark&#x2014;again a rap very loud&#x2014;then a ring very loud&#x2014;then, after a long pause, both together as loud as could be&#x2014;decidedly the individual <hi rend="italic">would</hi> get in&#x2014; I kept quite still&#x2014;surely it is over now I was just saying&#x2014;when the knocking and ringing recommenced&#x2014;and went on at intervals for I am sure ten minutes!&#x2014; I could hardly help <hi rend="italic">screaming</hi> it made me so nervous.&#x2014; at last all was quiet and some quarter of an hour after the uproar, I went to look in the letter box if the horrid visitor had left a card&#x2014;when I looked in I met&#x2014;oh mercy&#x2014;a pair of fox-eyes peering at me thro&#x2019; the slit&#x2014;I threw the door open in a rage&#x2014; (My hands had been washed by this time) and a coarse featured red-haired squat woman exclaimed &#x201C;she will com now&#x2014;please, no to shut&#x2014; Mees Stirling com&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it&#x201C;?

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>I will write you again a word today; tho&#x2019; there is not much to be said, I fancy even <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> written in black on white would be tolerable from me in this remote locality. Pity that my hand is so unsteady;&#x2014;but perhaps it will come in! Our Post too, goes past about &#x201C;12 or 1&#x201C;; so that to avoid giving trouble, I must take time by the forelock,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> and begin directly after breakfast.</p>
<p>I a little reckoned without my host, in regard to noises here: we are indeed quiet almost as Hades during the day; but in the night-watches, as I have found, there sing <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> not a few, sing asses, cattle pigs, as well as the small birds rejoicing on their sprays; and I have had some adventures with that department of my destinies! The night before last, after a day spent in temperate seclusion, in silence interrupted only by a bathe and a walk, and a minimum of evening conversation, I retired to bed; was roused by cocks &#x26;c, and the excessive heat and closeness of the room (invincibly close, tho&#x2019; I had all the window that was openable open), after some 2&#xBD; hours; and slept no more, Macbeth,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2.</note>&#x2014;but passed the miserablest hours in trying vainly to do it, bathing, smoking, and such like, with the continual lullaby of my friend the Cock close at hand, supported by the general animal creation at greater or less distances! You can fancy what a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> it was in consequence! However, we have got various improved adjustments made; have imprisoned that particular cock; agreed to have tea earlier, to &#x26;c &#x26;c;&#x2014;by which means I went to bed last night with new hope; and did in fact sleep till six this morning,&#x2014;six hours or so,&#x2014;which you admit was not bad work. After that, finding little chance where I was, I decided on bundling out, and walking to the <hi rend="italic">sea</hi>, and there despatching one of my jobs at least. Poor Redwood, tho&#x2019; deaf, awoke as I stole past his room; spoke, got little answer; followed me nevertheless to the beach, and hove in sight just as I was getting out of the water,&#x2014;in time to get the use of his <hi rend="italic">bathing-cap</hi>, which I had for the first time worn today. The grey morning was very fine; the utterly solitary coast, the great eternal sea, the Hills of Devonshire (somewhat like Fife from &#x201C;Comely-Bank&#x201C; side, <hi rend="italic">like</hi> enough to remind one of it) spotted here and there with sunshine, and yellow fields of corn:&#x2014;altogether we made a good thing of it; and I decide to take that method in future when I awake too early. I feel <hi rend="italic">better</hi> after breakfast; <pb id="pg-25-139" n="25:139"/>have a ride in store for me (an excellent <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> little horse, a hand bigger than <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s pony at Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:47</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec. 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note>); and the prospect of a perfectly silent day, all to myself till half past five when dinner is. Enough, enough&#x2014; O my Dear what a bulletin I am sending thee!</p>
<p>Well, not to forget the one point of business: I want you straightway to go and buy me a <hi rend="italic">bathing-cap</hi>, and send it by return of post; that, we find, is the readiest and only feasible method. R<hi rend="italic">d</hi> got his, he says, in Albemarle Street (Piccadily), &#x201C;the street next, eastward, to Hatchett&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Redwood apparently stayed when in London; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410616-JWC-CR-01"><sic>13:151</sic><corr>JWC to CR, <date when="1841-06-16">16 June 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> (or White Horse Cellar) which I compute must be Albemarle street; there, &#x201C;on the left hand as you turn up from Piccadilly,&#x201C; dwells an excellent old umbrella-maker,&#x2014;mender &#x26;c, from whom the article in all varieties is to be obtained. Choose the <hi rend="italic">biggest</hi>,&#x2014;but indeed they seem to have an <hi rend="italic">elastic</hi> runner both before and behind, so that they will ply to any head; and Redwood&#x2019;s itself would do for me well enough. I think it will not weigh above two ounces or so;&#x2014;Goody will manage it with perfection, I do believe, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> more said. Only you must take your Letter up <hi rend="italic">written</hi>,&#x2014;you can go to Miss Wynn&#x2019;s or the London Library, and seal it;&#x2014;for the Post will go at half past five: at 8 next morning it will be in Cowbridge, and about 12 here. So much for that weighty matter. I have <hi rend="italic">too much hair</hi> at present; and when the head gets fairly wetted, I hardly get it dried again under 3 or four hours of combing and exposure. Bathing is a &#x201C;duty&#x201C; I mean to neglect no day, as I have not yet on any day: the water is delightfully tepid; there is good smooth floor of limestone rock, if you choose well, for footing; and on the coast is usually to be seen nothing but cliffs, and piles of boulders backed by furze and scrags of weeds and brambles, and except quadrupeds (swine usually) no living creature at all. One ought to bathe in such a place and set of circumstances; there or never! On Wednesday I hope to have my bathingcap,&#x2014;and a Note from my poor little Jeannie into the bargain. Reporting that she is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in worse than usual order, I do hope. Oh my little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, be patient, trustful, patient, I swear to thee all shall yet be well!&#x2014; &#x2014; But now I must explain to you a little about our domesticities here.</p>
<p>Boverton, as I found last day, must be about <hi rend="italic">six</hi> miles from Cowbridge (a place not better than Ecclefechan), and is connected with it by a labyrinthic coil of very bad country roads or waste lanes and bridle-paths. What do you think, the Lord of it about 30 or 40 years ago was <hi rend="italic">Wrentmore</hi>, the Father of the Attorney Wrentmore who lives in Cheyne Row!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isaac Wrentmore.</note> Perfectly certain: he was an English gentleman who came across and purchased it and took possession of the grandish old mansion or Chateau, which now stands here in ruins: one <pb id="pg-25-140" n="25:140"/>of his sons is a superior Farmer in this vicinity, a second our Chelsea neighbour, and the rest are gone over the world. The poor man, it seems, &#x201C;had a foolish wife&#x201C;; was himself not very wise, I doubt; he tore down ranges of superb stables that belonged to his Chateau (so firm-built, he could hardly get them down at), tore down superb porches, flights of outer stairs; nay at last deserted his Chateau, and built a new House nearby, no great shakes of a House, which the chief Farmer now occupies; furthermore he built (in spite of nature and his stars) a pier into the sea, intending that ships sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make a harbour there, and alas there was no highway in the rear of it for the country to call! In fine by the inspiration of self and wife he ruined or nearly ruined himself; and at length <foreign>dei&#x2019;d and did nocht ava&#x2019;</foreign>. The wreck of his old pier, mostly washed away still offers a kind of shelter to Redwood &#x26; me when we strip for bathing; his old Chateau (once a &#x201C;grange House&#x201C; of Cardiff Castle) stands black and mournful, a heap of ruined gables, on the brow of this wretched village; and the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of him is really sad to me, when candidly construed. But is not this of the Cheyne-Row neighbour and me a coincidence?&#x2014; &#x2014; The rest of the village of Boverton (the <hi rend="italic">Cow</hi>town, of Cardiff Castle) excels in ugliness all the villages I have ever seen even in Wales. Happily it only contains some 40 or 50 souls, a most tiny village, and above a third part of it, I think, is in ruins,&#x2014;unroofed and waste, part of it by fire 3 years ago, part of it by time 40 or unknown years ago. Redwoods Father, prospering in some kind of trade,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tanning.</note> purchased a moderate little Farm and house here;&#x2014;whence my present <hi rend="italic">date</hi> among other consequences.</p>
<p>The village itself lies scattered about in various points of a little Dell with an ugly muddy brook stagnating thro&#x2019; it: poor dirty cottages for most part; and such a sluttishness and sleepy desolation of thoroughfare as is seen only in Wales: stones, old kettles, crockery fragments, rubbish of every description quietly flung out, quietly lying till the fulness of time. Were it trimmed up, and well fringed with trees, there could be few prettier villages, for the soil is fertile, dry, and there are rocky features enough; but left as it is, one wreck of thorny, nettly, <hi rend="italic">kettly</hi> desolation: I never saw in Ireland itself so ugly a human <foreign><hi rend="italic">kraal</hi></foreign>, or soporific <foreign><hi rend="italic">clachan</hi></foreign> of idle Ga&#xEB;l. Our House stands quite at the end of the village (on the <hi rend="italic">south</hi> height of the little Dell where it lies, the ruined chateau being on the north one), and is quite divided from it; looks another way, sheltered by walls and bushes, into the look of perfect country, and even with something of a <hi rend="italic">lawn</hi>, which has various trees and fruit-trees upon it, and is carefully kept by scythe and besom: Redwood has judiciously turned his front <hi rend="italic">the other way;</hi> walled up his rearward which lies close upon the road; broken out new windows (very grand and gothic) on the other side; in a little <pb id="pg-25-141" n="25:141"/><hi rend="italic">end</hi> house, which might be a kind of <hi rend="italic">wing</hi> to us, are lodged his man and maid servant, and the Mother of the latter: a House of rather <hi rend="italic">less</hi> accommodation than Puttoch, and not very well ventilated, or successfully arranged for anything but the <hi rend="italic">seclusion</hi> of the owner. He commands a green foot path of his own to the neighbourhood of the sea; rides daily to Cowbridge, silently sits here on his return, and seems to know or concern himself with no mortal whatsoever. His maid is the queerest little body you ever saw; Recca (&#x201C;Dumpy&#x201C; Recca he calls her), a little black-eyed loud-voiced swifthanded Fenella<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A character in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Peveril of the Peak.</hi></note> of a creature, hardly above 3&#xBD; feet high, for she has a terrible crook in her back;&#x2014;goes always with a &#x201C;bit velvet tippety&#x201C; or cloakykin, and is <foreign>gleg</foreign> as a needle, and very obliging and goodhumoured hitherto. She is at this time cutting off <hi rend="italic">the sleeves</hi> of a flannel for me (I find I have but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> here of that kind); will &#x201C;wash&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c and run thro&#x2019; fire and water for me, &#x201C;if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like Sir!&#x201C;&#x2014; Unhappily my kind Host <hi rend="italic">is</hi> &#x201C;dreadfully dull&#x201C;; and I sometimes feel as if in spite of every advantage he, especially if aided by Cocks, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> drive me quite to despair, and compel flight <hi rend="italic">before</hi> my time! But we will hope better things tho&#x2019; we thus speak. I hope to get a good ride today; and to be still better tomorrow.</p>
<p>And now how are you, dear Jeanny? Tell me, as minutely as I give you the example of doing;&#x2014;kindly too, as your last little Letter in its brevity did. You <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> so kindly to me; why, alas, do you ever belie that feeling, and hide it from me and yourself? Oh my poor Jeanny, I feel assured all yet shall turn to well again, if it please Heaven!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Any way here is enough of writing for one day. The Post too announces that his time is about up. The <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> are both lying ready for an hour past. I have taken to <hi rend="italic">Haxthausen</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >August von Haxthausen, German economist and writer on Russia; evidently his <hi rend="italic">Studien &#xfc;ber die inneren Zust&#xE4;nde das Volksleben und insbesondere die l&#xE4;ndlichen Einrichtungen Russlands</hi>, vols. 1&#x2013;2 (Hanover, <date when="1847">1847</date>), 3 (Berlin, <date when="1852">1852</date>).</note> again, and really accomplish a deal of reading in the free hours granted me here.&#x2014; When does Geraldine come to you?

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Strachey</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Your note, as you anticipated, did not come till too late, but was very welcome, as a proof of your hospitable thoughts, when it did.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably inviting TC to Sutton Court, his family home, 8 mi. S of Bristol, nr. the Mendip hills.</note> I lodged with Mr. Savage Landor all night at Bath, on my journey hither; then to Bristol next morning, and across by the Cardiff steamer, and here (twelve miles further) the same night, where I have remained with really a maximum of quietness ever since, and am still to remain for perhaps a fortnight, more or less. My kind host, a solitary man, full of loyalty to me, exclaims zealously, &#x201C;Two months!&#x201C; But that, clearly, will not do, admirable as the plan is for certain of my wants just now.</p>
<p>We look over upon Minehead, Exmoor,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Minehead, on Bristol Channel, 43 mi. WSW of Bristol. Exmoor, a moorland tract of about 30 sq. mi.</note> and the hills of Devonshire; commanding Watchet and Bridgewater Hill on our left, and even something that I call the ridge of Mendip,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Watchet, 6 mi. E of Minehead, also on the Bristol Channel. Bridgwater is inland, 33 mi. SW of Bristol. All places are mostly in Somerset, though Exmoor is partly in Devon.</note> on clear days. The coast is of limestone boulders, with portions of clear, natural flag pavement, clean and smooth as finer kinds of marble might be, and admirable for seabathing; one of the loneliest, or perhaps the very loneliest seacoast I have ever frequented. Landward, no public road within six or seven miles; only a network of rough country lanes, interweaving a congeries of sleepy, sluttish Welsh hamlets,&#x2014;good for solitary riding by a meditative man, if for few other purposes! Pieces of the soil, which is all excellent, are well cultivated, generally by <hi rend="italic">English</hi> farmers, in large lots, or by natives whom they have trained; but the bulk of it still offers the image <pb id="pg-25-145" n="25:145"/>of slovenly &#x201C;folding of the hands to sleep,&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 6:10.</note> which characterizes the Cimbric populations,&#x2014;populations all given to &#x201C;Methodisms&#x201C; or other vague enthusiasms of a drowsy nature, and nothing like sufficiently inspired with horror of dirt, weeds, and other disorder! For a week or two it will suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to ride about in it, and recover a little strength if I can; and farther than that, what have I to do with censuring it?</p>
<p>My next move is toward Scotland; but how I go is still somewhat uncertain. By sea from Swansea to Liverpool, if the steamer will suit my times and hours, or else back eastward to some startingpoint on the railways: that is the alternative which I must settle by and by.</p>
<p>It would give me great pleasure to see you in the Mendip region, which is a country I have never seen, and long rather wished to see; but at present I fear, even in the event of returning by Bath, you are too far to the right to be attainable by me. Across the sea hereabouts there is no conveyance whatever, except you go to Cardiff and hire one on purpose. I fear the omens are not good for the Mendip expedition on this present occasion! However, we will not quite despair, but some time or other it may answer.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Will you offer my kind remembrances and thanks to Mrs. Strachey,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth.</note> and accept good wishes from me for yourself and all your household hidden behind the hills from me at present?</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest, you are very good and punctual!</salute> I got your long Letter yesterday, with its manifold inclosures, and hard tidings of poor Goody&#x2019;s sleep; and here today, about the same hour (12&#xBD; p.m.) comes the magnificent bathing-cap, which, please Heaven, I will try in the Bristol Channel tomorrow morning. Today I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> bathed,&#x2014;very early indeed, between 6 and 7, I should say; for my sleep was again broken: <hi rend="italic">subsidiary</hi> cocks have come to the onslaught (I think), besides swine, oxen, asses, carts: add to which I <hi rend="italic">had a pill in me;</hi> and this house seems absolutely incapable of ventilation, my poor <pb id="pg-25-146" n="25:146"/>bedroom with the window open all day has still a close smell:&#x2014;on the whole, I woke wretched about half past 4; and after vain efforts for another hour and half, gave it up; went into the blessed sunshine (one of the loveliest mornings), and had a beautiful bathe, looking over into Devonshire which lay all bright and corn-spotted, almost as <hi rend="italic">near</hi>-looking as Fife from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, tho&#x2019; 20 miles off by report. Minehead (quasi <hi rend="italic">Burntisland</hi>, for the whole coast reminds me of Fife a little) lay white as a bleachgreen in the early sun;&#x2014;all silent round <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, no live stock, human or other, but a few <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> in the distance; and the great sea singing its everlasting song.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your welcome little Note, which I received yesterday; the first I have got here, except from Jane. I am very glad indeed to be assured of my good Mother&#x2019;s being well, and that all is going on at Scotsbrig in the usual fashion. I have heard twice from Jane since I wrote to you last; she seems to be extremely busy, turning all things topsyturvy in the Cheyne Row establishment, and making a complete &#x201C;earthquake&#x201C; now that she has the field all to herself.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-147" n="25:147"/>This is now my eighth day in this hospitable domicile; and I endeavour to make the most of my advantages, and in fact I suppose am doing not amiss at all, tho&#x2019; the liver and nerves are too far out of order to get to composure all at once. One finds too that there are in every change certain evils as well as benefits, and in particular a modicum of new annoyances in return for the old you have escaped! I go daily and bathe, generally before breakfast; it is a walk of rather more than a mile, mostly thro&#x2019; flourishing wheatfields, a very quiet pleasant <hi rend="italic">flat</hi> footpath country; the beach all of limestone boulders, with <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi> spots of natural rock (which one endeavours to choose according to the diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> times of the tide); the water clear warm and comfortable beyond what I have experienced elsewhere. Very lively <hi rend="italic">waves</hi> for most part: indeed I generally manage my bathe by <hi rend="italic">sitting</hi> on some round big stone, and letting the billow tumble over my head. This morning was the wildest sea of all; very windy indeed: nevertheless I contrived to get a very comfortable washing in that way. I miss bathing no day hitherto; and hardly ever fail of a good ride too: there is an excellent little bay mare (about the size of poor old Harry) which carries me about in a very handsome style; Redwood has had me on some professed &#x201C;rides,&#x201C; or excursions of half a day&#x2019;s riding; but I do not care much for these. Today, for example, we are just waiting post-time, to be off on some such adventure; and I, for my own particular, had much rather stay at home and read!&#x2014; Here is a box of excellent new pipes, too, just arrived from Cardiff;&#x2014;and two <hi rend="italic">Cocks</hi> have been successively imprisoned for disturbing me in the mornings. You w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think I might do excellently well: and so I should if I could sleep a little better, and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;alas, there is no limit to one&#x2019;s &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ifs</hi>&#x201C;; and we must make the thing do, without &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">if</hi>,&#x201C; the best we can manage. Redw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> is one of the kindest; but also one of the dullest of mortal men; I am ashamed to perceive how wearisome I feel him to be while he is so very friendly to me.&#x2014; &#x2014; I delivered him your comp<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> last night; and he charges me to engage you not to come to London again <hi rend="italic">without</hi> taking his House on your way.</p>
<p>Boverton is a sleepy Welsh Hamlet, half or more than half in <hi rend="italic">ruins</hi> (they never mind clearing off old houses that fall, but let them lie for half a century or more); our House (a building like <hi rend="italic">Scotsbrig with a wing</hi> for kitchen &#x26;c, and rather elaborately modernised and repaired, not a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> House after all) is quite cut off from the Village by walls, trees &#x26;c, and we look out into a comfortable lawn with bushes and fruit trees; were it not for the &#x201C;cocks&#x201C; I need not have known that there was a village here at all. Indeed I think there are hardly 50 souls in it; an old ruined Castle, with its skeleton gables and chimnies is the main object: a place of poor sleepy slutti<supplied>[sh]</supplied> <supplied>[la]</supplied>bourers,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Boviarium</hi> (Ox-town or Grange) of Cardiff Castle as it was in former times;&#x2014;fully as dirty and somnolent a hamlet as those of S. Wales usually are. From the Sea-beach we look right across into Minehead, which is conspicuous as a <pb id="pg-25-148" n="25:148"/><hi rend="italic">white</hi> little object (near twenty miles off, they say); to the right we can see Lynton (where I think you have been);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1840">1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:307</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> to the left Watchet and the Hill at Bridgewater. Our own coast without trade, fishing, or any other movement but that of the tidewater itself, is of all coasts the loneliest, nothing to be seen on it but grey boulders, bushes on cliff or down, and here and there a sheep or pig.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014; I have brought with me nothing but <hi rend="italic">geographical</hi> books! These, it seemed to me, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the least disgusting. I have got some stupid Welsh History here, too. If I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be entirely left alone (which it is almost impious <supplied>[to h]</supplied>int at), I could do very well for a while here!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our weather broke on Wednesday; but seems now to be about mending again, a very windy brisk sunny day. Harvest is begun; excellent crop,&#x2014;almost miraculous considering what farming there is; for the soil is fertile all of it to a degree, and treats the idle with leniency!&#x2014; Enters Redwood to ask, &#x201C;How long?&#x201C;<foreign> Ay de mi!</foreign></p>
<p>Three weeks was my date here; about a fortnight hence, that is. How I am to go is not yet ascertained: the Steamer from Swansea has been written about, but there is yet no answer come. A fortnight more will serve me, I should think:&#x2014;some &#x201C;way&#x201C; will before that have become manifest.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Love to my dear Mother, and to all the rest great and small. Write again soon. I have got a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and will send it to my Mother in 2 days. Blessings on you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Oh my Dear</salute>
<p>Why havn&#x2019;t you sent me the least scrap this morning; tho it were but to say that all these cocks have been made into one huge <foreign><hi rend="italic">cockyleekee</hi></foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Soup made with a fowl and leeks.</note> or that you have learnt to sleep <hi rend="italic">thro them.</hi> There can be no letter now till Tuesday perhaps you forgot <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, as I forgot that you could receive none on Sunday. I have been so busy and so bothered! was so needing a word of comfort this morning from the only quarter that comfort <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come! Your friends the Destinies have been very impropitious to me since you went away, every thing I have undertaken has gone wrong. I applied to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Piper to send me a man (Weston)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Piper was the postman; presumably George Weston, builder, 4 Arthur St., Chelsea.</note> to whiten the parlour-ceilings, a man who had worked for me before, Posty who has a fault of always doing every thing <hi rend="italic">over well</hi>, sent <pb id="pg-25-149" n="25:149"/>Weston&#x2019;s &#x201C;best workman&#x201C; instead of himself saying &#x201C;it would be a better bargain for both the man and me&#x201C;&#x2014;we settled that the job was to be done on Monday for eight shillings&#x2014;the rooms were all laid waste to be ready for Monday&#x2014;but all day we expected our white washer in vain&#x2014;at night he came to make excuses and promise for the morrow&#x2014;but nothing of him on Tuesday either. at length after breakfast came another man who said the first man being detained elsewhere had &#x201C;made over the job to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.&#x201C; I asked was he sure he could do it without spotting the paper&#x2014;he scouted the idea of such a possibility&#x2014;I &#x201C;might depend on it there should not be a single spot&#x201C;&#x2014; So he fell to work with clean water in the first instance, and I left him to go after your bathing cap&#x2014; I took the cap to Grafton street to seal up and Miss Wynn insisted on my stopping to Luncheon&#x2014;which I did; thinking it would save trouble at home to eat my dinner <hi rend="italic">there.</hi> I came home about four and walked into the parloure, first thing and saw what struck me speechless! the whole paper smeared and spotted with white-wash&#x2014;not the size of a page of this notepaper clean! to say nothing of all the furniture in the same state! Elizabeth having in her devilishness left it all at his mercy&#x2014; The upper border of the paper was&#x2014;irretrievably spoiled&#x2014;and the body of it would take such scraping and rubbing <hi rend="italic">for days</hi> as I dreaded to think of&#x2014;and even the ceilings had to be done over again! by the original man&#x2014;whom I was thankful to get to come at five of the morning (his only spare time) In the middle of such a disheartening mess it came very unopportunely for me to have to keep my engagement with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Austin for Thursday&#x2014;but it was better I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> engaged myself&#x2014;and was <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to take <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> a day of respite from my disgusting rubbing of the walls&#x2014;which Elizabeth would not touch&#x2014;(her conduct since your departure has been more insanity than anything else&#x2014;I am inquiring after another servant in all directions&#x2014;being quite determined not to endure this sort of thing a day longer than I can help especially as Craik who came the other night now talks of taking his &#x201C;treasure&#x201C; to Ireland with them &#x201C;for a few weeks just to settle them there&#x201C;&#x2014;thus removing <hi rend="italic">her</hi> still further into the vague&#x2014;) I will tell you all about Austindom in another letter&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> is most important&#x2014; well&#x2014;I have finished with it an hour ago&#x2014;after two of the most fagging days works I ever transacted in this world but it looks as well as ever&#x2014; All but the top border which must be renewed&#x2014; My hand is so shaky with the exercise that I can write no better than as you see&#x2014;and my brains too are shaky&#x2014;and of the two hours I had left myself for writing miss Swanwick<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Swanwick, author and trans.</note> has eaten up one.&#x2014; I hope I dont <hi rend="italic">fret</hi> you with these accounts of my &#x201C;troubles that afflict the just&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p><salute>Poor little soul, what a bother with that Paper!</salute> and with Eliz<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and so many other things! I can fancy it all too well; and I can do nothing to help thee in it. But I see it has been, or will be, got thro&#x2019;,&#x2014;&#x201C;with an honourable thro&#x2019;-bearing.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300928-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:167</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-09-28">28 Sept. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> So courage, courage.&#x2014; That of the nasty splashing whitewasher, after such precautions taken to get a right safe artist, is one of the most vexatious things one could imagine of such a sort.&#x2014; &#x2014; Your Letter has hardly come, when I have to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> the answer (unless I like to ride seven miles to and from with it, in two hours hence); nay the <hi rend="italic">Post</hi> calls only <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, and to get this sent away at all, I have to despatch the man to our chief village in these parts, a mile and a half off. So I am utterly hurried; and of innumerable things can say only the fewest few. Add to all, that my hand <hi rend="italic">shakes</hi> at no allowance, and the vile flat table is so unlike my own massive sloping one;&#x2014;and even my eyes seem to be dim and dazzly. In fact I never had less aptitude for writing than here; and today especially must put you off with a mere word.</p>
<p>On the &#x201C;health and comfort&#x201C; side, things go not well with me here: sleep is not easy to be had in these parts! I have got another <hi rend="italic">Cock</hi> imprisoned; but what are Cocks among the general animal creatures? Ten <foreign>cuddies</foreign> young and old lifted up their psalmody this morning under the rearward window of my wing of the house; looking out, I think I saw about ten,&#x2014;and they seemed <pb id="pg-25-151" n="25:151"/>rather to have taken cold, and be asthmatically given! Happily I was already awake, making ready for the sea; and did not mind them. Nay independently of noises I some nights cannot get to sleep almost at all. My little room too is ineradicably <hi rend="italic">close</hi>, tho&#x2019; I have had a fire in it &#x26;c &#x26;c, and the bed is one of these scandalous <hi rend="italic">un</hi>curtained ones; tho&#x2019; it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> posts, and I have got sheets hung up between me and the light. On the whole I have fared ill as to sleep; and do not expect to fall into a prosperous condition on that side while I continue here. Often have I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of my poor little Chelsea room; how comfortable it is, and to whom I owe it:&#x2014;one use of all this is to make one more content with such possessions when one gets back to them. By way of finish to my tribulations, yesterday morning on coming down stairs I took to shove up the big window in the sittingroom; too lustily, I suppose, for at the first shove, there darted across my back&#x2014;a beautiful <hi rend="italic">rheumatism;</hi> and all day I walked and stood with great uneasiness, if at all, and twisted round upon my axis, and making an ang<supplied>[l]</supplied>e<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of 75&#xB0; with the upper and under half of me! Was not there a beauty? Poor Redwood, the friendliest of men, was in consternation to see me: I proposed that we should <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> all the same; that by hard riding I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> try to &#x201C;work out the rheumatism.&#x201C; Well, we did so; the day was brisk wind with dashes of shower: I came home, after 3 hours trotting, decidedly better; had better sleep too;&#x2014;went this morning at 7 to the sea in spite of showers, and sore back (still sorish), and now I do think it is fairly got under, and will go about its business altogether this night. Fair passage to it!&#x2014; I ought to wind up all these <foreign><hi rend="italic">medicalia</hi></foreign>, however, with this decided assurance, to comfort thy poor heart, That I feel actually <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in general health, and perceptibly so, than when I left Chelsea. I have bathed every day (except yesterday, when lameness of back forbade),&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">before</hi> breakfast; rode almost every day, before dinner; walked in the evening, and had six hours of deliciously perfect solitude, in the purest air in the world: decidedly it must have a good effect on me, and has. But the low and <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in which I was cannot be escaped from into a better, without tumbles and wrigglings by the path upward.</p>
<p>Redwood is friendliness itself, poor fellow; discloses a great quantity of <hi rend="italic">passive</hi> intelligence amid his great profundity of dulness; nay a kind of humour at times; and certainly excels <hi rend="italic">in good temper</hi> all the human creatures I have been near lately. Several times his fussiness and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fikery</hi></foreign> have brought angry growlings out of me, and spurts of fierce impatience; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he has taken more like an angel than a Welshman! Perfection of temper;&#x2014;and his pony is very swift and good; and his household is hospitably furnished; and all that he has is at my disposal!&#x2014; On the whole, I shall handsomely make out my three weeks here; and hope to get profit from it after all. I have taken into <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> <pb id="pg-25-152" n="25:152"/>reading, of late days; and find some really interesting things to charm my memory with in these parts. <hi rend="italic">Llantwit</hi>, namely (where this letter is posted), a miserable bewildered little Village half the size of Ecclefechan, and with no shape in it at all,&#x2014;I find indisputably was, above 1300 years ago, a grand Christian College, the Iona of these southern parts, a truly memorable spot on the Earth&#x2019;s surface!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Llantwit Major, or Llanilltud Fawr, named after a Breton saint called Illtyd, who set up, in the 5th cent., a monastery where St. David (ca. <date when="0520">520</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="0600">600</date>) is said to have studied. The parish church of St. Illtyd has a thousand-year-old font carved with names of monks who taught there. For Iona, see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470112-TC-EF-01"><sic>21:134</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1847-01-12">12 Jan. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> And other Welsh things, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you shall hear of by and by.&#x2014; My six hours of solitude (from 11 to 5) are excellent beyond measure. I sit on chairs under the bushes or trees, and read and smoke,&#x2014;well is me! Since the last little Note to you, I have not till now put pen to paper: the day <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that, I had in a kind of dead-light written four or five due scraps or Notes, to Strachey, to Farie, to Mrs Austin, to Lady Ashburton,&#x2014;and perhaps others.</p>
<p>Unhappily that very day of our grand ride, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was beautiful exceedingly at our departure, grew bleak and windy and <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> on our return, and the weather ever since is broken. It does not so much matter when one had <hi rend="italic">bad clothes</hi> and a white hat: besides they are but <hi rend="italic">showers</hi> of more or less continuance, and then the sky breaks out bright again and blue.&#x2014; Enough, O Jeanny, Jeanny; surely enough, all about my own precious self and my ailments and destinies!</p>
<p>I positively forbid you to put up with any more bother or insolence from Elizabeth. It is entirely out of the question. Why not pay her off at once, and go and <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> the House? You have visits enough possible for you; or if you like I will meet you anywhere, and we will go and have a few weeks of bathing? In short there are many things that can be done; and there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> doing with that! End it, I beg of you</p>
<p>Jack wrote me &#x201C;all well from Scotsbrig&#x201C;; nothing else in his Letter, except that they too liked <hi rend="italic">Jesuit</hi>m best of all the Pamp<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>&#x2026; <note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellipsis in MS.

<p><salute>Poor little Life-Partner, dearest Jeannie!</salute> I am bothering myself with apprehensions and imaginations about you in that puddle of house-sorting and change of servant,&#x2014;with perhaps still less sleep than I have to complain about, and nothing but morphine to depend upon. Before opening any book, before the Post or any interruption come, I will send you a little bulletin about my insignificant self, and so both comfort my own mind and perhaps give a momentary fillip of encouragement to yours.</p>
<p>I have had sad work with <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since I came here: let no man henceforth brag of &#x201C;quiet&#x201C; till he have tried! The quantity of <foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddies</hi></foreign> in these parts is enormous. Every cottager has one; they bring their coals home with them, and perform other locomotion; a certain man in every village undertakes to go to the coalmine with all the asses, each ass has its owner&#x2019;s sack and cash for the fuel; the human guide ties them all together, and gets twopence apiece on returning safe. Poor souls, they do need to have coals and other necessaries, not to be got without travel! I cannot be angry at the <foreign>Cuddies</foreign> either; they are such pastoral patriarchal creatures. Nay the fact is they do not often disturb my repose; it is not they, it is my own bad stomach mainly that keeps me from sleeping.</p>
<p>Besides the truth is, Dearest, I have <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a good sleep last night, a nice bathe in the early sunshine on the clean limestone flags, a nice warm breakfast of coffee waiting <hi rend="italic">my</hi> return (Landlord himself did not come in for half an hour after,&#x2014;one of the best-natured of all men!)&#x2014;and so today I seem to feel really better than I have hitherto done here; and hope begins to dawn in my poor soul again. The rheumatism never seriously plagued me after Sunday, and feels today as if it were about gone: I rode a long way yesterday, walked too; but was utterly disconsolate and done up when bedtime came,&#x2014;so much of insomnolency and disturbance both in reminiscence and in prospect. I passed thro&#x2019; Llanblethian<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 1 mi. S of Cowbridge, where John Sterling lived for five years as a child; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430711-TC-JWC-01"><sic>16:261</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-11">11 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> yesterday; found &#x201C;the house with red chimneys,&#x201C; and tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of poor John Sterling and the rest of them. I have seen the place 3 times now since I came; it is one of the prettiest Welsh Hamlets; hanging sprinkled about on the steep green slope, with the greenest woods and wavy pasture-grounds embosoming it under the bright blue firmament. It must be curious to live in such a place,&#x2014;not quite what living in it <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> to one&#x2019;s fancy <pb id="pg-25-154" n="25:154"/>in riding thro&#x2019;! In all those Welsh Hamlets with their mouldery sluttish huts and intricacies, there are singularly excellent individual houses: here for instance, in the dirtiest little <foreign>Clachan</foreign> of them all, is a house of perhaps 20 windows, with pastures, rose-bushes, ornamental and sheltering trees, all in perfect repairs, fit for a man of elegance and quality: very strange to see amid the ruins, the nettles and stagnant confusion close beside. It is inhabited, R. says, by some foolish dissipated &#x201C;Mr Colton&#x201C; (son of some literary and landed Colton, author of <hi rend="italic">Lacon</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Caleb Colton (<date when="1780">1780</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1832">1832</date>), <hi rend="italic">Lacon</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822">22</date>). His son not further identified.</note>), whom his friends have ordered to dwell here, his wife being a Welsh native. Red<hi rend="italic">d</hi> has not the least trade with him, nor apparently with any mortal except giving time of day; but he is much respected by everybody,&#x2014;and indeed is a good and friendly soul, and ought to recommend himself to one that desiderates <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> of intellect especially, for in that he really is great.&#x2014; &#x2014; Oh ungrateful that I am, I have all but forgotten again to say how well the bathing cap serves; which cost you such a splutter of whitewash! The cap does admirably,&#x2014;except that I shall certainly tear the strings one day, they are so fine and small, and you will have to put a pair of cotton <hi rend="italic">tape</hi> ones in instead:&#x2014;but it saves me completely from the water; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hold the biggest head in Wales, I do think, with a ramilies wig<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A wig with a plaited tail tied top and bottom with bows to commemorate the British victory at Ramillies (<date when="1706">1706</date>).</note> on it; and is really an excellent article,&#x2014;thanks to the poor little Martyr for it. If I had known you were to have such a bout of scrubbing, Oh surely I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have taken a wetting of the hair, once or twice more, to save you!</p>
<p>The weather has grown as bright as possible again; really beautiful brisk autumn skies and gales or zephyrs: the people all busy with the glorious yellow wheat,&#x2014;the finest that ever grew for such bad tilling. An East-Lothian colony w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> beat Tamboff with this country for corn. (N.b. Tamboff is a Russian Corn-market, far enough away; about wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Protectionist Stanley once uttered some nonsense: so don&#x2019;t bother thy poor head about Tamboff<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward G.

<p>Tomorrow, so Red<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and the Fates have decreed, we are to go to Merthyr Tydvil:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coal, iron, and steel center in Glamorganshire.</note> off at 6 a.m. &#x201C;in the tub,&#x201C; some 12 or 14 miles; then a railway for half an hour does the rest; and we are to arrive about 10,&#x2014;the very hour while you are reading this, poor little crittur. I did not and do not care about Tydvil, and its huge iron-furnaces and unutterable smoke and confusion: but poor R. takes it so to heart; and, after all, such a place ought to be seen.&#x2014; &#x2014; I told you I had gone into Welsh Books here: tell Miss Wynne I have many times tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <pb id="pg-25-155" n="25:155"/>of her in reading these unspeakable Evanses and Powels; and wondered whether <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was not a Daughter of Gwenwynwyn (pronounce that!) and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in the North? &#x201C;Some poor body&#x2019;s <foreign>bairn</foreign>, beyond doubt.&#x201C;</p>

<salute>Dear Farie,</salute>
<p>If this Note can find you, as I hope the former one did, by so slender an Address, I will ask you to let me know, within a week or so, what is your special place of abode at Malvern; and on the whole how you are related in locality to the Glo&#x2019;ster &#x26; Birmingham Railway, from which line in the neighbourhood of Worcester, I remember viewing your district once.</p>
<p>I shall be proceeding northward from this place before long: my first notion was, to sail from Swansea, and so by the aid of steam see all the coast to Liverpool at my ease; but, alas, this turns out to be an affair of 30 hours, mostly by night, and in short will not suit me at all. The next best scheme is, to sail from Cardiff to Glo&#x2019;ster, a very brief business; then to get into the Birmingham railway, and so be shot home. However, I should like to stay a night by the road, indeed why should not I pause for a day at Malvern, and see what I think of the place.</p>
<p>Please therefore to tell me how far Malvern is from the line, and what is the Inn to drive to (for a quiet bed, if one&#x2019;s imagination durst picture such a <pb id="pg-25-156" n="25:156"/>thing); and finally where is the <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> place in which R Farie will be discoverable in the evening.</p>
<p>I am diligently bathing in the sea and riding about by land in these parts; the weather, good after some interruption, is again charming, and I have the favourable country, with solitude and southern expanse: nevertheless I do not yet find I am making an exemplary figure in the way of practical Hygienics, and certainly am not yet grown a match for the game chicken<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pugilist in <hi rend="italic">Dombey and Son;</hi> see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470924-JWC-TC-01"><sic>22:88</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1847-09-24">24 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> in point of bodily vigour. Tomorrow we are for a small excursion to Merthyr Tydvil; to try the effect of a little soot, I suppose. Another scheme of mine,&#x2014;this is my own scheme,&#x2014;contemplates riding upon galloways to Plinlimmon, Hafod and Aberystwyth; perhaps to the Menai Bridge<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All places to the N and W of Cowbridge.

<p>We accomplished our expedition yesterday; saw the Valley of the Taff<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The river Taff, ca. 40 mi. long, flows SE through Glamorganshire into the Bristol Channel at Cardiff. The railway runs down the valley.</note> in all its beauty, and the foul sulphurous Purgatorio of Merthyr Tydvil in all its ugliness: a laborious business,&#x2014;from 6 in the morning till 11 at night, hard work without interval; it is in this way that mortal creatures seek &#x201C;diversion&#x201C; for themselves! But it was not of my doing; nay I find, after all, it will be well worth while to have seen Merthyr, for surely under the Canopy there are few stranger things in the way of human town than it is. In <date when="1755">1755</date>, Merthyr Tydvil was a mountain Hamlet of 5 or 6 houses, stagnant and silent as it had been ever since Tydvil (the King&#x2019;s or <hi rend="italic">Laird&#x2019;s</hi> daughter was <hi rend="italic">martyred</hi> there, say 1300 years before): but about that time a certain Mr Bacon, a cunning Yorkshireman, passing that way, discovered that there was iron in the ground,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-25-157" n="25:157"/>iron and coal;&#x2014;he took a 99 years lease in consequence:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1763">1763</date> Anthony Bacon, a Cumberland ironmaster, took over iron works established a few years earlier and started new works nearby. In <date when="1794">1794</date> these passed to Richard Crawshay (<date when="1739">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810">1810</date>), a Yorkshireman.</note> and&#x2014;in brief there are now about 50,000 grimy mortals, black and clammy with soot and sweat, screwing out a livelihood for themselves in that spot of the Taff valley. Such a set of unguided, hard-worked, fierce and miserable-looking sons and daughters of Adam as I never saw before. Ah me, it is like a vision of <hi rend="italic">Hell</hi>, and will never leave me, that of those poor creatures broiling, all in sweat and dirt, amid their furnaces, pits and rolling-mills. For here is absolutely <hi rend="italic">no</hi> &#x201C;aristocracy,&#x201C; or guiding class; nothing but one or two huge Iron-masters, and the rest are operatives, petty shopkeepers, Scotch hawkers &#x26;c &#x26;c. Our Innkeeper (a Bath man) was the most like a gentleman of any I saw. The Town might be (and will be) one of the prettiest places in the world; and it is one of the sootiest, squalidest and ugliest, all cinders and dust-mounds and soot; their very greens they bring from Bristol, tho&#x2019; the ground is excellent all round: nobody thinks of <hi rend="italic">gardening</hi> in such a locality, all devoted to metallic gambling. Heigho!&#x2014; But here <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Postie; <hi rend="italic">wants</hi> the letter, if farther trouble is not to be given. I add therefore only that on arriving at 11 we had some tea; that I fell dead asleep immediately thereafter; woke again between 4 &#x26; 5, was a prey to all the animal creation for some 3 hours more, then finally got asleep again for 1&#xBD; hours, and had what may be called an &#x201C;indifferent night&#x201C;</p>
<p>In fact I shall never learn to sleep here; the feat is impossible on such terms; and I have told poor Redwood this morning, much to his sorrow, poor fellow, and a little to his anger too I rather doubt,&#x2014;that I must be off about Thursday next, which was my original time. Alas, alas, there is no rest for the son of Adam here below.</p>
<p>&#x2018;Tomorrow&#x2019; you say, and nothing more! Well I shall hear a word tomorrow then.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have two Notes from John in succession, nothing more. I bid thee <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jeannie. God help us both. I mean to sit under these trees all day; and have told Redwood that I absolutely will go on no other excursion whatsoever.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your two Notes; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> along with the two Newspapers came in due succession. I cannot think what detains the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> from you; I suppose Jane&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cover</hi> must have given way, for it is she that sends it, direct from Chelsea, and she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not readily forget it, I think. We get the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> here, and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> too, on our own footing. I have sent more than one Copy of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to my Mother; but these, it appears, have miscarried likewise. The Post, what with new Railways, what with Ashley regulations, seems to be in a confused condition hereabouts! However, there has been no <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> lost; nor between London and this has anything misgone.</p>
<p>The Swansea-Steamer method of travel I have now quite cast aside: the time, I find, is 30 hours, mostly <hi rend="italic">by night;</hi>&#x2014;a dirty sort of outlook. I intend to go by Chepstow, to which there is a railway, 11 miles off us,&#x2014;time about noon there, a very handy time; then <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Chepstow there is a Coach to Glo&#x2019;ster, and two days in the week a Steamer as well. One way or another it will not be difficult to get to Glo&#x2019;ster; and after that to Birmingham and Liverpool we have it all straight and swift. I rather incline to another trial of the Annan Steamer too: Thursday next, as you say, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> evidently do best; but I hardly think it will prove manageable; the Monday following seems at present the likeliest time.&#x2014; &#x2014; I did not know that G. Johnston lived in Glo&#x2019;ster:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. George Johnston moved from Liverpool to Gloucester ca. a decade earlier.</note> if I knew his Address, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like very well to call on him; there is little use in going out of the Inn for a bed,&#x2014;in his house as in the public one I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have little chance for quietude; and it is as well to wake in the one place as in the other. However I will try for his Address: I think I will write to him beforehand. I have written to Farie also to tell me about Lodgings in Malvern if I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of stopping there for a day or so, to look at the thing: but Farie does not answer,&#x2014;I had lost his proper address, and perhaps he cannot!</p>
<p>Poor Redwood is abundantly disconsolate, and even angry and inclined to sulk, at the notion of my departure so soon: but it is indispensable nevertheless, <pb id="pg-25-159" n="25:159"/>and clearly demands not to be delayed beyond the covenanted time. I can get no right sleep here; I have not slept well one night, nor have I much chance to do it, in such an exposed ill-ventilated situation, with so many animals and their crowings and brayings and lowings attending me every morning! Not to say that R<hi rend="italic">d</hi> himself, one of the best of men, is of a dulness <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; toute &#xE8;preuve</hi></foreign> [completely reliable]; a solid, taciturn, gaunt wearisomeness nearly without its fellow in my experience. The fine sea-bathing (of which I find but little benefit), the fine pony riding (of which d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) are too dear at this price for long. Nay the beautiful seclusion, in perfect silence among green bushes and clean lawns and <foreign>soughing</foreign> breezes every day for six hours, even this, which is truly delightful and profitable, I must give up in favour of a little steady sleep somewhere.&#x2014; I believe I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> getting better however: in such fine bright air, with <hi rend="italic">only</hi> dulness and imperfect sleep to fight against, one can hardly fail to get better. The people are all busy mowing (in a very coarse style) the noblest crop of wheat ever given to such tilth as their&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>On Thursday (day before yesterday) we were at Merthyr Tidvil; a busy day from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.&#x2014; I have decided that we make no more &#x2018;expeditions,&#x2019; tho&#x2019; I cannot regret that one: Tydvil a place of 40 or 50 thousand grimy iron-workers and no &#x2018;aristocracy&#x2019; at all, is the most <hi rend="italic">Stygian</hi> scene I ever saw! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother: love to all!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p>The Post with your Letter, I expect, is just at hand; I will at least tell you I have got it, tho&#x2019; to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> it may be too much of a hurry before sealing. I have had to write to John this morning; to George Johnston (at Glos&#x2019;ter) in intimation of my journey: and thus the time, till Noon is striking, has passed. Our post arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, like some others, are not good here.</p>
<p>Yesterday I did not ride at all: I lay dozing about on the sofa, or garden <pb id="pg-25-160" n="25:160"/>chairs, with a dull soporific Book; rushed off towards the sea about 4 o&#x2019;clock, and that, with a little walk after tea, was all I did. Last night has been (considering a small <hi rend="italic">globule</hi> I swallowed) not ill at all. Sleep from 12 to 6; then, with a <hi rend="italic">pillow</hi> laid over my ear, patient waking or even dozing under the living influences feathery and other. I feel not worse but decidedly better since coming hither: but sleep, once for all, is a thing I need not look to have in a handsome fashion under present circumstances.&#x2014; Poor R<hi rend="italic">d</hi> looks &#x2019;<hi rend="italic">based</hi> and black,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; &#x201C;a phrase of my Mother&#x2019;s&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-xx/lt-18640927-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-09-27">27 Sept. 1864</date></ref> [NLS 617.678]).</note> sad at once and sulky, at the announcement that I will keep my time, and <hi rend="italic">go</hi> about Thursday first.

<p><salute>I was obliged to close on Saturday <hi rend="italic">without</hi> seeing your Letter:</salute> the Postman delayed so long (fully an hour beyond his time) we were obliged to despatch the man to Llantwit Post-Office, on the hypothesis that Postie for that morning had forgotten us, and that unless we bestirred ourselves the return-post also w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> escape us. The creeping dog arrived shortly after, with some excuse that his bags had been delayed at Cowbridge.</p>
<p>Well, there certainly is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">charivari</hi></foreign> [hubbub]; such a domestic splutter in regard to English <hi rend="italic">Helps</hi> as may seek its fellow! Pity you had not transacted the inevitable while I was in the house; we might have made it a briefer affair, and saved your poor heart a very unnecessary agitation. Truly it is miserable to think of; proceeding from such a contemptible source too;&#x2014;and I fear it has flurried you all to pieces; and perhaps, if the mutinous gipsy is still near, may still flurry you. Prevent this latter at least. Pray try to understand that Eliz<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and her deliriums can have no power over you farther; that she may talk all day to all the canaille of Chelsea, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have nothing farther to do with it!&#x2014; The wretched <hi rend="italic">ungoverned</hi> being: she is &#x201C;free&#x201C; like Hodge&#x2019;s horses<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x201C;The Present Time,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>, Farmer Hodge&#x2019;s horses are emancipated and given the vote: &#x201C;Small kindness to Hodge&#x2019;s horses &#x2026; to roam aimless &#x2026; and be hunted home to Chaos&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:27).</note> <pb id="pg-25-161" n="25:161"/>as you say; she is, according to all likelihood, travelling towards the streets; and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be punished for all this mischief, to the last doit of reckoning yet: What a state &#x201C;obedience&#x201C; is grown to in this progressive epoch! And my poor little Jeannie, actually the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> manager of household things and servants I have ever seen, finds that even she cannot manage some of them; but that offences will come! Never mind, my brave Goody; you have done pretty well, after all: Your household improvements, I foresee, will all get accomplished nevertheless; and if they could not, the struggle towards them, and the pious prophecy of them in your little heart will be much the same as the practical reality,&#x2014;perhaps more in some respects. So, above all, keep yourself <hi rend="italic">quiet;</hi> and do not let that scandalous <foreign><hi rend="italic">randy</hi></foreign> of a girl disturb you a moment more;&#x2014;and be as patient with your poor soft dumpling of an Apprentice as you can, in hope of better by and by. &#x201C;Servants&#x201C; are at a <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> pass in these times! I continually foresee that before very long there will be on all hands a necessity, and determination on the part of wise people, to do without servants. That is actually a stage of &#x201C;progress&#x201C; that lies ahead of us. How I feel at this moment the blessedness of such a possibility, had one been trained to do a little culinary work, and were the due preliminaries once arranged! &#x201C;Servants,&#x201C; on the present principle, are a mere deceptive imagination; command is nowhere, obedience nowhere. The Devil will get it all, if it do not mend!&#x2014; Oh my dear little Jeanny, what a quantity of ugly fret you have always taken upon you in this respect; how you have lain between me and these annoyances, and wrapt me like a cloak against them: I know this well, whether I speak of it or not. And as to &#x201C;improvements&#x201C; in our bit of a habitations, I do not know the habitation that has so little need of them, that is so trim and orderly and snug as ours is with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> any improve<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> So cheer up; let nothing beat you, I say, nothing,&#x2014;much less this poor thing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, did Geraldine come then? I hope she did; and helped you to convert this domestic revolution into a matter of history. I expect the history of Austindom too, if it have a history. And all manner of histories, when once the <hi rend="italic">winds</hi> fall. On the whole, I wish Lewald had pilgrimed in other latitudes, and Geraldine could have staid a while longer with you.&#x2014; &#x2014; Poor Miss Fuller,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Fuller was drowned with her husband, the Marquis Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, and infant son in a shipwreck off Fire Island, N.Y., <date when="1850-07-19">19 July</date>.</note> indeed! I saw the tragedy in last weeks Newspaper, and have many times thought of it since. I did not see there the death of husband and child, learn that first from you: but so all is over; it is probably <hi rend="italic">as well</hi> so. O Life, O Death,&#x2014;O what a bottomless Abyss (and a summitless Height too) this our Existence is!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am wasting away my solitary Autumn morning in mere scribble; but I hope it will do you no ill tomorrow morning to breakfast.&#x2014; I am to go to <pb id="pg-25-162" n="25:162"/>Cowbridge today to have my hair cut; item to get tobacco, to &#x26;c &#x26;c. If you write to Liverpool, say they are likely to see me soon. <hi rend="italic">Not</hi> for a night: I think there is no spare room at present? At any rate it is easy to manage hitting the day of the Steamer,&#x2014;possibly this day week.</p>
<p>My sleep has been better the last two nights; but it never can be good under such conditions: free air and silence are in brief irreconcilable here. Nevertheless it is certain I am getting better in health: so let that bring composure to you however much I complain.&#x2014; Red<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, poor fellow, flatters himself he will get me persuaded to continue yet a good while, and rejoices with a strange vitality of cheerfulness;&#x2014;something really strange in the man&#x2019;s relation to me: like that of a <hi rend="italic">male Undine;</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In medieval legend Undine was a water nymph without an immortal soul, which she could gain only by marrying a human; this was the source for F. H. C. de La Motte Fouqu&#xE9;, <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1811">1811</date>), and the opera by A. L. Lortzing and E. T. A. Hoffmann (<date when="1845">1845</date>).</note> and such a dreadfully dull one! I shall have a battle before I get away; but away I must get: <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a life is not required to last beyond the original program.</p>
<p>Yesterday we rode to an old dim Welsh chateau, Castle of Fonmon (pronounce Fun<hi rend="small-caps">m&#xf9;n</hi>),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Late Norman or Early English castle in Fonmon, a village 5 mi. SE of Cowbridge.</note> where a Portrait of Cromwell was reported; nay a report, or possibility, was, that one of the Welsh Regicides, a Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Jones Oliver&#x2019;s Brother-in-law, owned the place in those days.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Jones (d. <date when="1660">1660</date>) m.

Fonmun an old roughcast square-headed handfast-looking mansion stood amid its big ragged trees, like a House in Sleepy Hollow:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Tarrytown, N.Y., known through Washington Irving, &#x201C;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">The Sketch Book</hi> (New York, <date when="1819">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820">20</date>).</note>&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">late</hi> Jones ruined himself by horse-racing, the present with his wife<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Oliver Jones and Alicia.</note> has become a Londoner, and &#x201C;solicits promotion to some office.&#x201C; One little dumpy Welshman (his wife being out) seemed to have charge of the whole outdoor and indoor premises, big gardens gone to wilderness, big stables going to rooflessness: a very world of weeds;&#x2014;the &#x201C;Picture of Cromwell,&#x201C; a dingy unfortunate old Piece (apparently a Copy only, and none of the best) was worth nothing; nor was any of the other Pictures (mostly in rapid decay) worth much: we left the little Welsh<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, very civil for his shilling, with a sentiment as if he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">smothered</hi> one day in weeds; as if the world of weeds was too strong for his weight.&#x2014; A rapid ride, useful for health, bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> us back by other circular routes.

<salute>Only a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> note today Dear,</salute>
<p>&#x201C;That you may know I am in being</p>
<p>Tis intended for a sign.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A childhood poem by Jean Aitken.</note></p>
<p>And for a sign too that I am grateful for your long letters, my only comfort thro&#x2019; this <hi rend="italic">black</hi> business which has indeed &#x201C;flurried me all to pieces.&#x201C; Today&#x2019;s did not come by the mornings post, not till twelve, when I had fallen so <hi rend="italic">low</hi> for want of it that I might have had no news for a week! It is sad and wrong to be so dependant for the life of my life on any human being as I am on you: but I cannot by any force of logic cure myself of the habit at this date, when it is become &#x201C;a second nature.&#x201C; If I have to lead another life in any of the planets I shall take precious good care not to hang myself round any man&#x2019;s neck either as a locket or a millstone!</p>
<p>Geraldine is still here&#x2014;and Fanny Lewald at her house in Manchester since Saturday! but M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Patten<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A friend of Jewsbury&#x2019;s.</note> is there to look to Fanny&#x2019;s bodily and intellectual wants&#x2014;and Geraldine thought herself more needed here; seeing that I had got myself made quite <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> with one thing and another&#x2014; She goes tomorrow night&#x2014;I have not been confined to bed nor in any desperate way; only so nervous that I was &#x201C;not fit to be left alone&#x201C;&#x2014;Geraldine thought.</p>
<p>If that &#x2018;<foreign>randy</foreign>&#x2019; be gone from next house, as I partly hope today, it will be all the better&#x2014; I have not been able to escape from the noise and sight of her all the week:&#x2014;tho the house is <hi rend="italic">let</hi>, and furniture has been coming into it, and people rushing up and down it since Saturday morning; still the Police-people stayed on and Elizabeth with them&#x2014;but today I have been able to go into the garden without having her suddenly appear at an open window and hallo out to people beneath; nor has she been crying &#x201C;poose poose&#x201C; over our area-rails and then rushing off with a loud laugh&#x2014;so I flatter myself she is finally gone&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-164" n="25:164"/>The little &#x2018;apprentice&#x2019; is a very good serviceable creature, dreadfully astonished at everything, but willing and assiduous; no fear but I shall have patience with her! obligingness seems to me <hi rend="italic">just now</hi> the highest servant virtue&#x2014;but she is too small and ignorant to go on with as a regular servant, so I have taken steps about a girl recommended by Geraldines old Lady at High Laver<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaretta Darby, Jewsbury&#x2019;s old schoolmistress, living at High Laver Rectory, Ongar, Essex.</note>&#x2014;have just written a long business-note to the said old Lady&#x2014;and am now going to lie on the sofa and have Geraldine read a novel to me all the rest of this day&#x2014;writing makes me &#x201C;too fluttery for anything&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had misgivings that the cover of the Leader got ruffled Sunday gone a week in pushing it thro that narrow slit in Church Street. I tied the last with a string&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dear little Jeannie;&#x2014;</salute>compose thyself and be quiet! Yesterday there came no Letter; not even the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> Newsp<hi rend="italic">r</hi> came, nor has it yet come (<hi rend="italic">lost</hi>, I suppose?): had there come nothing today too I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been seriously uneasy. Thanks to the struggle you made the little limping Postman has now put us all to quiet. I am much obliged to Geraldine for staying with you. I wish she could have taken a month&#x2019;s quarters with you in your present solitary post. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">randy</hi></foreign>, I hope is gone? The little <hi rend="italic">apprentice</hi> can be but a makeshift: I like ill to think of your fret and agitation about new servants just now. Can we do nothing to help it? It always strikes me you could very easily close the house altogether: I will come back immediately, if you want it; and we can go to some country lodging anywhither for a while, go to Scotland together, &#x26;c &#x26;c. This <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done; and <hi rend="italic">directly</hi>, if you will so decide. Except the sight once more of my good old Mother I have nothing to look for in Scotland. A quiet <hi rend="italic">bed</hi> and board is not very certain to me there either,&#x2014;at least only for a limited time. Quietude in some place or other I must try to get for a considerable while longer,&#x2014;for really I am terribly tattered to pieces, and in need of <pb id="pg-25-165" n="25:165"/>being &#x201C;well let alone&#x201C;;&#x2014;but that bounds my wishes; and alas as for my hopes, it indeed exceeds them.&#x2014; &#x2014; Write immediately <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you will have me return. But I know already you will insist on <hi rend="italic">saying</hi> No. I wish I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> make you understand how feasible a method of deliverance from all your house-keeping miseries this seems to me!&#x2014; At any rate, pray take <hi rend="italic">time;</hi> are not &#x201C;the <foreign>rowings</foreign> all in the loft; nothing pushing?&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451001-JWC-TC-02"><sic>20:6</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-10-01">1 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> Oh my poor little Jeannie, endeavour to compose thy too-vehement soul; <foreign><hi rend="italic">quicquid vult valde vult</hi></foreign> [whatever it wants, it wants strongly]: &#x201C;too vivid, my poor child!&#x201C; I make no doubt all the projected improvements will be in a quite tolerable condition ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my return; and if they are all baulked together, will not the very intention of them be a piety as interesting to me as the fact under luckier circumstances could be? Oh yes; perhaps more so: the wish and the power are a sad contrast in more cases than that, in this world! My poor little home at Chelsea does not fail in comforts of lodgement: I never leave it without finding how it distances all others in that particular; and how the engineer latent of my poor Goody has done for me what no quantity of <hi rend="italic">money</hi> &#x26;c could have done! Thanks to thee; O know that I have thanked thee,&#x2014;sometimes in my silent hours as no words could;&#x2014;for indeed I am sometimes terribly driven into corners (in this my life-pilgrimage, of late especially), and the thing that is in my heart is known, or can be known, to the Almighty Maker alone!&#x2014;&#x2014; No more of this. In fact, I <hi rend="italic">awoke</hi> too early; and my nerves are below par (or <hi rend="italic">above</hi> par) today: that is it. I meant to write only one word; and here are already two slips full, and nothing said.</p>
<p>In spite of my experience of last night, I have to report that <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> goes decidedly a little better: all else goes well, silently regular as the current of Time, peaceable and pensive as the colour of these Autumn days. No news with me at all,&#x2014;except that I have got my hair cut, and a pair of shoes soled; both well done! I bathe daily; this morning again, it was before breakfast: other two or three mornings I have been better employed asleep; bathing come in the afternoon,&#x2014;a most tempestuous sea for three days back, only calm again this morning; scores and scores of ships making their way out of the Channel this morning, being windbound so long. To bathe in these waves the way is, Walk in till you are ancle-deep; then stoop down hand foremost, cluching hard by some crevice in your <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> of natural rock (if you know the right ground); the roaring monsters of waves will abundantly bathe you,&#x2014;well if they do not wash you quite ashore to the injury of elbows and legs! Better <hi rend="italic">water</hi> I was never in. But the whole process appears to me insignificant in a medical point of view.&#x2014; &#x2014; Red<hi rend="italic">d</hi> is reconciled to his lot; or hopes that he will be able to better it? Saturday (or Friday&#x2014;no!) was fixed for the day; <pb id="pg-25-166" n="25:166"/>but we shall have a fight first. <closer><salute>God bless thee, Dearest. I will write again before going.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<dateline>Thursday night [<date when="1850-08-22">22 August 1850</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Now Dear!&#x2014;</salute> I have done a fair days work (of sewing chiefly) and can sit down with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> leisure to write you a peaceable little letter. Yes Yes; I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &#x201C;composed myself&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">am</hi> &#x201C;quiet.&#x201C; You shall have no more wail or splutter from me on this occasion. If I had been an able-bodied woman instead of a thoroughly brokendown one; I should surely have had sense and reticence enough not to fret <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in your seclusion with details of my household &#x2018;worry.&#x2019; But that dreadful Elizabeth &#x201C;murdered sleep,&#x201C; I &#x201C;lost my <hi rend="italic">happetite</hi>.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 2.2; coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440626-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:87</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-06-26">26 June 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> and became so weak and excited that I was really no more <hi rend="italic">responsible</hi> for what I wrote than a person in a brain fever would have been. For the last three nights I have been getting into sleeping again; without morphine which had become worse than useless. and for the last three days I have eaten some dinner &#x201C;to speak of&#x201C; and now I begin to feel <hi rend="italic">sane</hi> again and as John says &#x201C;to see my way.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Geraldine left me last night&#x2014;very unwillingly. a little <hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> would have made her throw over Fanny<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lewald; &#x201C;Letty&#x201C; in <hi rend="italic">LM.</hi> &#x201C;Letty&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;, an intrusive, stupid, ugly, fat Berlin Jewess, coursing about on the strength of sending windy gossip to the newspapers then&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>). After leaving, Jewsbury wrote, <date when="1850-08-29">29 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;When I left you were ill, and all your domestic concerns were in a most unsettled condition, and I don&#x2019;t know that they are any better yet&#x201C; (Ireland 364&#x2013;65).</note> altogether, and remain here <hi rend="italic">for an</hi> indefinite time. It was not my wish however that she should protract her stay longer than she had already done, the pleasure of having her to talk with and to <hi rend="italic">rub my feet</hi> was not&#x2014;at least would not have continued to be a sufficient compensation for the additional trouble of a <hi rend="italic">visitor</hi> in the house&#x2014;with no servant but a little girl who had &#x201C;never been out before,&#x201C; who could not cook a morsel of food or make a bed, or do any civilized thing without having <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at her heels. One does not like, if one can stand on ones legs at all, to see one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">visitor</hi> doing servants work, and besides poor Geraldine <hi rend="italic">can&#x2019;t</hi> cook or make a bed any more than the girl that has &#x201C;never been <hi rend="italic">out</hi>,&#x201C; and at the same time she is nothing like so indifferent as I am to <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> and &#x201C;all that sort of thing&#x201C;&#x2014; And then, to get on with &#x201C;the <foreign><hi rend="italic">rowans</hi></foreign>&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> here was impossible!&#x2014;when I was not <pb id="pg-25-167" n="25:167"/><hi rend="italic">cooking</hi> in the kitchen, or in some way providing for the present moment, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> &#x201C;lie down&#x201C; and have my feet rubbed!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">By myself</hi>, I get on quite nicely with the little maid&#x2014;who, now that I have got her to <hi rend="italic">tidy</hi> herself, and that she is no longer frightened, has developed a curious likeness to your Sister Jane,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken. The temporary maid was Eliza.</note> which makes me feel quite friendly towards her. Not being to keep her, I put off no time in <hi rend="italic">training</hi> her, but <hi rend="italic">use her up</hi> to the best advantage. Today for example she has been cleaning out the kitchen closets and presses&#x2014;where many an abomination came to light, showing new cause why the &#x201C;no-interference&#x201C; principle should never more get &#x201C;carried out&#x201C; in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house, or any house of which I am the mistress.</p>
<p>Tomorrow or next post day I shall probably hear from Miss Darby something final as to the Essex girl she had in view for me.</p>
<p>I feel it very kind of you to offer to take me away, but I am perfectly clear that I should be here rather than any where else just now. In the first place locking up the house would be a foolish risk to run. there are more loose people about here now than when we did so formerly, and we are known now to be <hi rend="italic">better worth robbing</hi> than we were formerly thought to be&#x2014;and even <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it was &#x201C;a tempting of Providence&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> only to be repeated on necessity. I should like very ill to have the house robbed, there are so many odds and ends in it that no <hi rend="italic">money</hi> could replace. Secondly, not foreseeing (how could I?) that I was to be left sole agent of my own will and pleasure, I commenced in the first week of your absence a series of operations, which I feel my house-wife <hi rend="italic">honour</hi> concerned in bringing, without help or with such help as I can get, to a more or less satisfactory close; what I have tumbled up and pulled down <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be restored to at least the habitable state I found it in, and no <hi rend="italic">Brownies</hi>, I guess, would do that for me if I put the house-key in my pocket and went away. Thirdly (a woman has always <hi rend="italic">three</hi> reasons) flying from the present inconvenience would be only <hi rend="italic">postponing</hi> it&#x2014;a servant must be found and set a-going in &#x201C;the right way&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">sometime</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">when</hi> better than now, when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are out of the way of being bothered by the initiatory process? Would it be preferable to arrive at home, hungry and travel-wearied, with our door-key, to usher ourselves into a dark, cold, <hi rend="italic">food</hi>less house&#x2014;and go out the first thing next day to hunt up a servant? If Craik&#x2019;s woman could have been engaged for any particular time; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would have met the last objection&#x2014; But my belief is that they will take her to Ireland and keep her there as long as she will stay&#x2014; At all events I can elicit no particle of certainty about <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, and indeed feel it indelicate to press them on the subject&#x2014; So now, &#x201C;compose <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi>&#x2018;&#x201C; and trouble your heart no further with my my<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> &#x201C;difficulties.&#x201C; When <pb id="pg-25-168" n="25:168"/>I am not too <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> for stirring about, as I have not been today, and do not mean to be for some time to come, and when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are not there to be put about by them; I make as light of <hi rend="italic">material</hi> difficulties as any woman I know, find them in fact rather inspiriting; it was entirely the <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> disturbance from Elizabeth that agitated me so absurdly at the commencement of the present mess.</p>

<p><date when="1850-08-23">Friday morning</date></p>
<p>So far I had written last night when the clock struck twelve, and Nero with his usual good sense insisted on my going to bed; he had gone half an hour before by himself, and established himself <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the bedclothes; but returned at twelve and <hi rend="italic">jumped</hi> till I rose and followed him.</p>
<p>I have hardly anything to tell you of the outer world&#x2014; Mazzini is back from Paris, was here on Tuesday, The Revolution in Paris is postponed for the moment&#x2014;it was anticipated that The President&#x2019;s reception, &#x201C;would have been thro&#x2019;&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;bribery and so on&#x2014;more enthusiatic&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">then</hi> the President &#x201C;would have been emboldened to venture his great <hi rend="italic">coup</hi> and the Communist party would then have tried conclusions with him&#x2014;as it is, these &#x201C;have nothing to fight against&#x201C;&#x2014;which is surely very sad!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The French Chamber narrowed the franchise by 3 million voters, <date when="1850-05-31">31 May</date>, and reintroduced stamp duty on newspapers, <date when="1850-07-16">16 July</date>. Mazzini rushed to Paris to awake others to the dangers to democracy from the French president, Louis Napoleon. Apparently Mazzini had returned briefly to France in late <date when="1850-07">July</date>-early <date when="1850-08">Aug.</date> so as to arrange for the dissemination of his manifesto &#x201C;Le Peuple des Proscrits,&#x201C; that was pbd. in the second number of <hi rend="italic">La Voix du Proscrit</hi>, a journal he had founded with Ledru Rollin and others. See his letter to his mother, <date when="1850-08-10">10 Aug.</date> (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 44:8). Mazzini had connections with the Federation of the Just, from <date when="1836">1836</date>, which linked the small socialist and communist parties in Europe.</note> Another Concert<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In aid of some Mazzini fund, no doubt&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).

I do not <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the profit: but all calculations tend to make me believe that we shall have&#x2014;the expenses, some forty pounds deducted, about 150 pounds left. The artists were brilliant, Mario, Mad. Grisi &#x2026; especially. It lasted from eight o&#x2019;clock till half-past twelve. The audience very enthusiastic. The gas went off, and the room was in sudden complete darkness for five minutes at least: but nobody stirred, two or three old ladies excepted&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 44:13&#x2013;14).

<salute/><p><salute>No news from you today, my Dear;</salute> and tomorrow at this time when the Post comes, I shall be upon the railway to Chepstow! If you have written, as I think probable, we will make an onslaught on the Post-Office at Cowbridge, and catch what there is; at lowest there will be a strict Address left;&#x2014;and note, I pray thee, a Note written on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> at London (after you have read this, and gone about your needfullest affairs) will find me on Monday morning at Liverpool (Maryland Street): after that, the Address is <hi rend="italic">Scotsbrig</hi>, and there I shall write answer, if not sooner than then. And so that one small point is settled. Thank Heaven, we are done with uncertainty here; and it was at last, in a friendly and definitive manner, agreed, this day at breakfast, that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to <pb id="pg-25-170" n="25:170"/>start tomorrow about 10 a.m.;&#x2014;the &#x201C;bedroom is to be altered &#x26;c &#x26;c against my return&#x201C;: ah me! Poor Redwood spoke of <hi rend="italic">accompanying</hi> me to Liverpool; of poney-journies thro&#x2019; the interior of Wales; and other high feats: but he has at length submitted to the plain fact in a handsome manner; and so the first portion of my present pilgrimage will now end.&#x2014;&#x2014; By this Post too there at length comes a Letter from George Johnstone, who has been absent from Glo&#x2019;ster: it seems likely I shall see him tomorrow; but as to &#x201C;going out to Sandhurst&#x201C; &#x26;c, I feel in no spirits for such adventures; and it seems probable I shall not stay more than over the Saturday night with him,&#x2014;if I stay with him at all. By this post too I have a Letter from John; who is now at <hi rend="italic">Newfield</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2&#xBD; mi. W of Scotsbrig, farmed by Alexander (Sandy) C. Corrie; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311124-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:55</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-11-24">24 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500829-TC-GJ-01">TC to GJ, <date when="1850-08-29">29 Aug.</date></ref></note> doctoring certain sick Corries there: he reports all well;&#x2014;advises me <hi rend="italic">now</hi> not to come by the Monday-night Steamer from Liverpool, but to wait till the Friday following, when perhaps it may be quieter. I must answer him, answer Johnstone especially; have my trunks to pack too;&#x2014;and unless I look amazingly sharp there will be no time to spare! In fact I suppose it will be better to decide on riding with the Letters to Cowbridge myself, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> yields about an hour more for the Epistolary part, if less for the packing: but indeed any way the post is highly untowardly here. Oh my Dear, my Dear! Why is all this flurry and agitation appointed to one of the most quiescent of men? I wish for nothing more than a quiet seat to repose on and a quiet table to work at, at any time: and there is much locomotion appointed me in life! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu</hi></foreign> [Alas]. And I wish I were getting home to my own quiet bed just now;&#x2014;but that too would not answer, so unlucky am I. Finding, like &#x201C;Salthound&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satan; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:45</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> (as Jack&#x2019;s mad etymology calls him), no rest for the sole of my foot!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The night before last, after getting wetted on the way to Cowbridge, Red<hi rend="italic">d</hi> took me out after dinner with friendly constraint to a constitutional walk. The air was blustery, cold and damp; I felt myself getting mischief from it, and struggled to walk fast: to better the matter, poor R. seeing ahead of us three Welshmen speaking together on the road, insisted that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> strike into the fields, to avoid them and their hoarse good-night; we had to leap hedges in consequence, terribly ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my will; nay the last hedge we came upon tripped me in leaping, and I landed in the ditch with my kneepan ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a stone-facing! a very helpless and pain-stricken man. There was a go! The knee was sore all ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, seemed to forbid sleep when I went to bed,&#x2014;an unhappy kind of night. Sleep came however at last, in spite of feverish misery; and in the morning I had got a new rheumatism, and (thank Heaven) the pain of my knee was mostly gone. The day proved rainy, windy, cold; no letter or adventure of any kind: I lay on the sofa reading, going out to smoke between showers; snatched <pb id="pg-25-171" n="25:171"/>a ride towards dinner-time, in pilot-coat and shawl; avoided wine, or any but necessary eating;&#x2014;and so today it is all pretty well again. We have again bright breezy beautiful weather; a company of poor women and children <hi rend="italic">gleaning</hi> in the field hard by, reminding one of Ruth and Naomi:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruth 19.</note>&#x2014;I bathed in the morning, my last bathe here; and hot <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> coffee awaited my return: surely, if I c<hi rend="italic">d sleep</hi>, few places c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so suitable to me as this! In spite of sleep, I believe I am essentially a little better:&#x2014;but my last good sleep was in my own bed at Chelsea; and if I don&#x2019;t fare better at Scotsbrig I shall be in a bad way!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well, Dearest; here <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the end then of my garrulities at present. Heaven knows I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> more than the needful! But tell me a word, many words, about poor N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5, and the poor Goody that is struggling there. I say again, Come away and leave it, if you cannot get it to answer. A little more <hi rend="italic">health</hi> to your poor self will be the most important improvement of all! Tell me all about it and especially about <hi rend="italic">you.</hi> What said you of Spedding in London; was it James? Is A. Sterling to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> as Landlord to Ireland then? &#x26;c &#x26;c?&#x2014; &#x2014; We had a noise of bells and jubilation over these parishes two days ago: our ancient Squire and Parson (laird of all his parish and priest of it too), aged 53, was marrying an esteemed &#x201C;Miss Bevan of Cowbridge,&#x201C; age 47:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All unidentified.</note> is not there a heart?&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless thee Dearest; I will write again soon. /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Many thanks for your Note, which comes just in time:</salute> had it been a post later, I should have despaired to see you in Glo&#x2019;ster, and have probably passed without trying! For I am not well at present; nor equal to dubious adventures, especially while on the road.</p>
<p>I leave this tomorrow (Saturday) about 10 a.m; get to Chepstow, mostly by rail, at half past one; and directly thereupon mount into a Coach, which announces itself for Glo&#x2019;ster at that hour,&#x2014;name of Coach&#x2014; &#x2014;? Alas, alas, on consulting my mysterious <hi rend="italic">Railway Guide</hi>, I do not find, that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> any <pb id="pg-25-172" n="25:172"/>coach at all about that hour; my fond memory must have deceived me! Well, then; I do clearly remember, from last weeks Newspaper, there is a <hi rend="italic">Swansea Steamer</hi>, which calls at Chepstow in time for that train on its way to Glo&#x2019;ster: by that I will set my intent to come; and so arrive by water,&#x2014;the hour probably a little uncertain.</p>
<p>As I have little time to stay, and would fain see you,&#x2014;and moreover want very much to be quiet,&#x2014;I think if I do not descry your presence about the landing-place of the Steamer (where you will know <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by a white hat), I will drive directly to your House (&#x201C;Wor&#x2019;ster Street, near the railway bridge&#x201C;), and there, if you have a quiet place for me, I will stay with you overnight; all the happier the more <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> we are;&#x2014;and next day the program says, Forward to Liverpool! I have been bothered all to pieces with the want of sleep ever since I left home, three weeks ago and more; and do not with confidence reckon on any remedy to that sore want till I get to Scotsbrig again. If you are on the spot, with your housekeeper (whatever <hi rend="italic">she</hi> may be, poor innocent soul) it will be all right: if you are not there, I will try on the spur of the moment whatsoever is possible for a sight of you before leaving Glo&#x2019;ster: and surely I think it will go hard if I do not succeed by one method or another.</p>
<p>Being in great haste, packing, writing letters &#x26;c &#x26;c, and in the hope of so speedy a meeting,&#x2014;<closer><salute>I will say no more at present; but subscribe myself, with many old remembrances such as can belong to few other men from me,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here has your Letter come; and I had better write a word of answer, lest I miss the Posts tomorrow. Yesterday I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written to have avoided the Ashley <hi rend="italic">blank;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., no Sun. delivery of mail.</note> but I was so weak and lazy, and the ride to Cowbridge so uncertain from blustering showers, I <hi rend="italic">fell asleep</hi> on the sofa rather, and wrote or did nothing at all! It is now fixed this morning that I am to go <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> by the Chepstow Rail; after that and a 3 miles by omnibus there is a Swansea Steamer to Glo&#x2019;ster; by that I am to proceed next, and so arrive at Glo&#x2019;ster some time in the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, I hope. This Post has at length brought me a Note from G. Johnstone too, who very hospitably presses me to &#x201C;go to Sandhurst&#x201C; (wherever that is, where his Wife now is, and a sick child he had been absent attending to), and stay there &#x201C;for a while&#x201C;: I have just written, engaging to stay <pb id="pg-25-173" n="25:173"/>one night with him at Glo&#x2019;ster; pleading that I must be on straightway to Liverpool for the Steamer. It will all depend! I really cannot do with any more tattering in the way of sleep; and, unless there is great quiet, it will not do for me to linger anywhere.</p>
<p>On the whole, however, it seems a little uncertain whether I shall get by the <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> Steamer or not:&#x2014;of course I will write to you again; but, bad luck to it, nobody knows now (on account of Ashley) whether you will get the Letter in <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for meeting me on Tuesday morn<hi rend="italic">g!</hi> What is to be done? I can write I suppose from Glo&#x2019;ster, so as that the Letter w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> arrive at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on Monday <hi rend="italic">night</hi> (and so I will <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, if the Monday Steamer <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> my scheme); but whether that, by any exertion of yours, will get the Letter to you in time, I do not know,&#x2014;and must take my chance. Of course if you get no notice farther, you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> stir out with the gig: I could even walk up, leaving my luggage; I may come by rail &#x26;c &#x26;c. On the whole if you get no Letter, sit still.</p>
<p>I am sore fretted with flying rheumatisms, continual deficiency of sleep: but otherwise I really think fundamentally improved; and hope always poor old Scotsbrig with its quiet and its kindness; and abundant <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> diet, will do me still farther good. <closer><salute>Love to my dear Mother &#x26; them all.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Poor old Corrie and the poor Lasses!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The two Newspapers came (did not I mention them?)&#x2014; Jane has put away her <foreign><hi rend="italic">randy</hi></foreign> of a maid; and is now quieter.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I am in the agonies of packing; and cannot go without a word (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might be a moan or howl, so sad is it!) of farewell to you,&#x2014;of indication to you whither I am bound. I wrote, the other day, to Alverstoke; but perhaps there may be delay in the arrival of that: perhaps with this too there may be delay; for I am in the vague a little as to your whereabout in these current days: but I love to fancy it as at The Grange; I will hope it may be there. You will be better lodged there than you were this time twelvemonth, blowing wet peats at Glen Truim! Why should one so wander in this world, which is itself such a wanderer? It seems to me, if I had such a Home as The Grange, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> try to get my implements about me, and steadfastly proceed with my trade there; stationary as if I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> chained like the old ram,&#x2014;in fact, constituting myself a &#x201C;chained ram&#x201C;; refusing to be like unto a wheel any more!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. Ps. 83:13. For the ram, see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470924-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:89</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-24">24 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> <pb id="pg-25-174" n="25:174"/>Alas, alas, we cannot manage it. Rest is not appointed to the son of Adam; we must go our journies, we shall get to rest, and plenty of it, by and by. How often have I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> here, were I in one of the Cottages of your Park (say the Gate-keeper&#x2019;s cottage, with some dumb and nearly deaf old woman to look after me an hour each day), how much happier c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I be among the Hampshire trees! And then the next tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is, Thou hast already a cottage of thy own, two cottages, a Town one at Chelsea (made very habitable by a dextrous hand) and a country one among the Nithsdale moors; and in neither of them canst <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> abide,&#x2014;O Censor of the World! Well, well; the world, it seems, is full of possibilities which never can become actualities; we see such every hour of the day: let us be peaceable then; and go our rounds at least without kicking!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My route tomorrow lies by Chepstow, Glo&#x2019;ster, where probably I shall stay over Sunday: after that to Liverpool; and home to my Mother&#x2019;s early next week, there again to lie down, and beg for some sleep if it be attainable. &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan, n.b.&#x201C;: that is the Address;&#x2014;and I once knew a Lady,&#x2014;bountiful she to me as the skies,&#x2014;who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written a word thither! To know <hi rend="italic">where she is;</hi> that is the burden of my request; that she will not deny me. As to France (Oh Heavens, shall I not keep mind of that!) and other things, I will write again soon after Thursday next. <closer><salute>God bless you.</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>Here I am, dear Jeannie;</salute> safe after several adventures; and have had your second Letter too, and also <hi rend="italic">luncheon</hi> (about 3 p.m.),&#x2014;and my first step is to write you a word wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may be in time for the post, and put <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to peace.</p>
<p>I got your first Letter also, duly, at Cowbridge on Saturday morning: good Redwoods <hi rend="italic">Tub-gig</hi> and I turned slightly out of the way in quest of it on our route to station; and there sure enough it lay, thanks to Goody and the Powers: one of the first blessings, and among the greatest of that otherwise not extremely fortunate day. I read it, with a cigar, as we went on.</p>
<p>Redwood&#x2019;s horror of human kind, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had lamed my knee the other night, did me a second mischief on this occasion: he had timed me by a <hi rend="italic"><date when="1850-07">july</date></hi> railway guide, and, not speaking to any fellow creature, was not aware that <hi rend="italic"><date when="1850-08">August</date></hi> was a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> affair in that railway. &#x201C;Train gone half an hour ago, Sir; goes at half past 11 now Sir: <hi rend="italic">next</hi> train at 4!&#x201C;&#x2014; Consider that: 11 miles from home; 4 hours to wait, and nothing earthly of resource but a half-finished station house in a Welsh desert where one could not even walk,&#x2014;the morning being showery, and much mud out! I did my best, dismissing R&#x2019;s servant with a cheerful message, and opening my trunk for a Book and some tobacco: I hope one day to get a little admiration from you for my behaviour in that sad predicament. Four o&#x2019;clock came; and Chepstow and at last even Glo&#x2019;ster <pb id="pg-25-176" n="25:176"/>came;&#x2014;and there poor George Johnstone, who had been seeking me all day, was still awake, and right blithe to see me: but, alas, he does not <hi rend="italic">live</hi> there at all, he only <hi rend="italic">gypsifies</hi> there, and lives like the ancients; I never was in such an establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for creature comfort before! Lukewarm tea without milk, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> coffee with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, &#x26;c &#x26;c: I had lost all notion of <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> before I got thither; and absolutely there was nothing here that I could manage to swallow: so that I <hi rend="italic">fasted</hi> (or as good as that) from the time of quitting Boverton, and all Sunday (tho&#x2019; I had slept a few hours too), had the miserablest headache, heartache, all manner of aches, and bad outlooks altogether. Johnstone&#x2019;s kindness to me was conspicuous, and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have made amends for all things on ordinary occasions: nevertheless I decided that by the first possibility I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get away into civilization again; took place accordingly for Birmingham about 8 at night; <hi rend="italic">got</hi> some living there (boiled egg and a bit of toast with glass of negus); slept in spite of the noisiest uproar I ever heard in Nature during the sleeping time of mankind; rose in time this morning, was punctual every way as a clock, and so at length am <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, safe and sound, and not at all much out of sorts;&#x2014;and mean to go on this night at 12 (by appoin<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) in the Annan Steamer; and so end the affair (I hope) before noon tomorrow.</p>
<p>I have seen nobody yet except Maggy,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret, one of the Welsh das.</note> who has punctually done the honours: there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a room, and laziness w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> much incline me to stop; but in fine I have <hi rend="italic">appointed</hi>,&#x2014;perhaps tomorrow too I shall not be so well; wherefore it is to be settled the other way,&#x2014;for the best, we will believe.</p>
<p>Good news have come (the last this morning) about Helen; she is said to be quite brisk, &#x201C;as well as ever again&#x201C;: such are the virtues of fresh air. Alick &#x26; his Wife are at Auchtertool; so that Uncle has come home, and stands to work in some degree: he is expected before long but has not yet made appearance. &#x201C;Dinner at six&#x201C;: I have some York River<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Virginia; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421013-TC-GEJ-01"><sic>15:127</sic><corr>TC to GEJ, <date when="1842-10-13">13 Oct. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> tobacco to buy; and am otherwise a free man till midnight come.</p>
<p>Your second letter strikes me as cheerier than the first; and gives me great &#x201C;encouragement.&#x201C; Don&#x2019;t bother about your choice; having <hi rend="italic">chosen</hi> you are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to repent, but are bound also to admit that <hi rend="italic">such</hi> repentance is moonshine. I have no doubt you will find the crittur do,&#x2014;or will make her do.</p>
<p>God bless you, Dearest; why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I babble farther in these confused circumstances? I will write again from Scotsbrig,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">two</hi> days hence, it must be,&#x2014;and you will hear everything about me that is needful or needless, with better leisure than at present.</p>
<p>Here is a ring at the door! I fancied it might be&#x2014;&#x2014;Hoho! It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> he;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Uncle John Welsh.</note> and he reports himself <hi rend="italic">well</hi> to you; and looks very well, and is kind, and good, and <pb id="pg-25-177" n="25:177"/>intelligent to talk with as ever.&#x2014; I almost wish I had not decided to go tonight; but it must be,&#x2014;and perhaps it is better.</p>

<p><salute>Well my Dear, here I am at last after a weary struggle;</salute> safe in limb and purse, but tired, travel-soiled, saddened, and distressed in soul, to fully the average extent. I wrote to you from Liverpool that I was to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> in few hours: here, by the first available post, I am bound to signify to you my safe arrival, otherwise your poor little heart might take to forming pictures in your solitude! These few lines shall be alone my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> today,&#x2014;not a heavy job of work, tho&#x2019; none at all were still welcomer to poor wearied human nature;&#x2014;nay perhaps it will do me good, after all; and it is better that I am stirred up to that small measure of locomotion. I am a very unthankful, illconditioned, bilious, wayworn and heartworn son of Adam, I do suspect!&#x2014; Well, you shall hear all my complaints:&#x2014;do not apologize to me for writing copiously an account of your own domestic and other sorrows: it is the law and rule that you should and <hi rend="italic">must.</hi> To whom can we complain, if not to one another, after all?</p>
<p>John&#x2019;s advice to go by the Steamer was one of the worst I have followed in regard to travelling lately: indeed I do not recollect of any more deplorably uncomfortable, sordid, irritating and almost scandalous bit of journeying I have executed for years back; and, please the pigs,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371223-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:376</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-12-23">23 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>, where the origin is incorrectly attributed to TC; a common rustic variation on &#x201C;God willing.&#x201C;</note> that is like to be the last of Annan-and-Liverpool steaming for a while.&#x2014; Johnny your Cousin attended me at half past 11 to the Clarence Dock; put me fairly on board, and rode home by the fly again, a minute or two before midnight. Our evening after dinner had hung rather heavy, tho&#x2019; there was talk enough and kindliness enough, but I had much rather have sat silent or slept than talked at all; and so on the whole it was a relief to be left alone, tho&#x2019; amid the lumber of a midnight steamer. The moon shone brightly down, I was wrapped against the cold; I slowly sauntered about revolving innumerable sad tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> (<hi rend="italic">sad</hi> is nearly all one thinks of, in such a situation); and felt that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done me great good to forget that I was not still a little boy, and to sit down in a corner and <pb id="pg-25-178" n="25:178"/>cry for about two hours or so with all my soul about all manner of things. In such circumstances there is one blessing left possible as I have found: that you <hi rend="italic">be</hi> let alone, that Chaos and you be permitted to settle it between you <foreign>Ay de mi!</foreign>&#x2014; I had tobacco too; but not the smallest inclination to smoke. About one a.m. we got fairly out into the river; and flinging out enormous smoke-clouds that literally eclipsed the Moon, went snoring on our way. I spake no word to any man, and discouraged all men from speaking to me. The night was beautiful; and the jumble of the sea-motion soon raised heat enough to withstand the chilliness. In an hour or so, all hands having gone to their berths below, I descended too to look at mine, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had providently secured in case there had been a scarcity. &#x201C;This way <hi rend="italic">the gents&#x2019; cabin</hi>, sir!&#x201C; And in truth it was almost worth a little voyage to see such a cabin of <hi rend="italic">gents;</hi> for never in all my travels had I seen the like before, nor probably shall again. The little crib of a place wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had glanced at two hours before, and found six beds in, had now developed itself, by hinge-<hi rend="italic">shelves</hi> which in the day were parts of <hi rend="italic">sofas</hi>) and iron <hi rend="italic">brackets</hi> into the practical sleeping-place of at least sixteen of the gent species; there they all lay, my crib the only empty one; a pile of clothes up to the very ceiling, and all round it, gent packed on gent, few inches between the nose of one gent and the nape of the other gent&#x2019;s neck,&#x2014;not a particle of air, all orifices closed;&#x2014;five or six of said gents already raging and snoring; and a smell&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott</hi></foreign>, 
I suppose it must resemble that of the Slaveships in the middle passage:&#x2014;it was positively <hi rend="italic">immoral</hi> to think of sleeping in such a receptacle of abominations. I returned upon deck; found at last a camp-stool; sat down on it, on the lee-side of the luggage-heap; nay slept there, I think 2 hours, with legs and feet only a little cold, and started up really refreshed, about 5 o&#x2019;clock. Hottish tea for breakfast came at last; and I hoped about 10 a.m. we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be ashore. Alas, it turned out <hi rend="italic">they</hi> did not calculate on having water till &#x201C;about 2&#x201C;;&#x2014;and to crown the matter, it began about this time to rain,&#x2014;and I had no umbrella, and in the cabin, except by force of almost actual battle, there could no free air be had anywhere;&#x2014;and the rain continued, and grew worse and worse (such a day of wet as we have not had since this time twelvemonth); and the gents grew out of humour; and I took refuge (oftenest) among the Irish shearers, male and female, screening myself under gangways: a sublime spectacle of misfortune, appealing to Goody and Posterity, as I now do! The sober truth is, when I got flung out into the street of Annan, and saw Brother Jamie run up, I felt like Jonah getting out of the Whale&#x2019;s belly, and could not but address a silent word of thanks to the merciful Powers!&#x2014;&#x2014; Jamie, too, was there by accident, not at all certainly expecting me: I had written appointing him, wh<hi rend="italic">n</hi> consciousness had driven me away from Maryland Street and desire enough to stay and rest there; but by bad accident or bad manage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the notice had never come to <hi rend="italic">Jamie</hi> (Jack, I <pb id="pg-25-179" n="25:179"/>suppose, had it, and still has it, at Newfield, with good excuse, I rather think): one thing only was certain, Here I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> got to land; and was not a whit worse for all that tattering; perhaps was <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, and could appeal to Goody and Posterity, still in a whole skin. About 5 o&#x2019;clock my poor old Mother came joyfully out to meet me from her solitary cup of tea: Isabella soon got me all expedient refresh<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in the handsomest style; I had ample porridge at 9; slept sound for at least 7 hours; am thoroughly <hi rend="italic">washed;</hi> and really, comparatively speaking, a good boy today, much at your service. For the day is bright: all looks beautiful and fresh and still round me (nothing heard but the <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> of the trees and the Burn): all is very sad and death-like to me; but it is a kind of sacred sadness, and does me good withal. Leave the wretched soul alone there. He designs to have <hi rend="italic">no dinner</hi> today, only an egg, then tea with the household;&#x2014;and in fact intends to lean much upon <hi rend="italic">meal</hi> and milk-diet while here. I found your two Newspapers duly here: thanks. A Letter will come before long?</p>
<p>John is not here, nor have I yet seen him he is at Newfield where all manner of distress seems to abound. Two elderly Miss Corries (the elder of them my age or more) felt unwellish some weeks ago, and went to the &#x201C;Brow well&#x201C;; &#x201C;drank water largely twice a day for some time,&#x201C; came home in a dangerous <hi rend="italic">dysentery:</hi> the younger was <hi rend="italic">buried</hi> yesterday; the elder, and others of the family from other causes, we hear today, are still alarmingly ill. John has been there for above a week, and only <hi rend="italic">calls</hi> here now and then.</p>
<p>Jamie looks very well, seems doing well; Isabella is brisk and busy,&#x2014;talks much about y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> visit still. My Mother too is wonderfully lively; tho&#x2019; the loss of her upper teeth has much changed her look, and considerably obstructs her in eating and a little in speech too, she does wonderfully well. Since I began she has stolen twice in,&#x2014;once to say pointedly, &#x201C;Now thou <foreign>maunna</foreign> forget to remember me to Jane!&#x201C;&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">trunk</hi> is not yet come from Annan; but a cart is to bring it tonight. Is not here enough of writing! I declare I am growing a perfect <hi rend="italic">clatter</hi>, and will <hi rend="italic">end.</hi></p>
<p>Write as soon as you can. You know how I like all your Letters; but I don&#x2019;t want to bother you with writing.&#x2014; Remember for, one thing, <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> is still no day. So I suppose you <hi rend="italic">will have to write straightway!</hi> <closer><salute>God bless you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Today your handwriting appears on two Newspapers, and reminds me of hospitable Boverton, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> at any rate I was not disposed to forget. One word of kind farewell to it, of authentic notice that I am actually here far away from it.</p>
<p>My four hours waiting among the green fields of Llantrissaint<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Llantrisant, parish and market town with railway station, 10 mi. NW of Cardiff.</note> were accomplished with a patience which you would have called heroic: I got out a Book, and Tobacco, and, spreading my pea jacket by way of carpet, lay down on the sunward side of a solitary bush. At Glo&#x2019;ster, where the Surgeon was nigh desperate seeking me (for it was now 9 p.m.), I did no good at all; to eat was out of my power, to sleep d<hi rend="italic">o;</hi> after a sunday of miserable headache and donothingism, I decided to try a night journey to Birmingham, and there accordingly I did both &#x201C;eat two eggs,&#x201C; and sleep in spite of frightful noises. The Liverpool Steamer, of Monday Night, was frightful! But perhaps it is good for one to become acquainted with practical Irish reapers, Border Cattle-jobbers, and Commercial &#x201C;gents,&#x201C; in a crowded condition; and to form some image, grounded on experience, of &#x201C;the horrors of the middle Passage&#x201C; such as Niggers feel. I sat on deck, a mere onlooker, refusing to speak or partake: in fine about 2 o&#x2019;clock next day that also ended; and, like Jonah from the Whale&#x2019;s Belly, I saw myself, with gratitude to Heaven, flung ashore here, with friendly presences once more around me, and tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> and emotions such as no other scene in all this Planet, or in all this Universe belike, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> awaken in me! Here I mean to rest for a ten days or more,&#x2014;in fact for an uncertain period; after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> also my future movements are extremely uncertain. In my life, I think, I never felt so heartworn and wayworn, and utterly weary in body and soul,&#x2014;desiring <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> only; rest if it were that of death (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter imagine will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> fail any of us).&#x2014; Thousand thanks to you, dear Redwood, for what you gave me, and took from me, with such friendly patience: a friendlier face I am not likely to see soon on my travels! <closer><salute>Good be ever with you. Friendly regards to Dumpy &#x26; Madge.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Madge Wildfire was the fast-trotting mare TC had used at Boverton.</note> And will remain / Y<hi rend="italic">s</hi> always</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Doctor</salute>
<p>Here is a hasty note to satisfy your friendly anxieties about me; my hurry and incapacity for writing to-day are very great.</p>
<p>I had a beautiful, saddish but altogether pacific, solitary and improving ride to Birmingham that evening and got into the Hotel about 11 p.m., actually disposed to eat some slight article&#x2014;an egg with a crumb of toast as it chanced. On this, moreover, in spite of noises equal to the sack of cities, I fell asleep in an otherwise excellent bedroom, and so held on, in a most beneficial manner, for above six hours.</p>
<p>The next day, of course, I was greatly better; and so it was all plain sailing to Liverpool. Of my sail homewards I will say nothing except to caution all mortals against that mode of conveyance so long as there exists any other; and merely add that I got home safe and sound after all, and found my good old mother and the rest of them well here and flung my dirty troubles off me for a season and except on compulsion, have done nothing except smoke tobacco and sit silent ever since.</p>
<p>All things look well here; crops excellent, all except blighted potatoes everywhere; harvest busily going on.</p>
<p>Your kinsfolk, so far as country rumour goes, are all understood to be well and in their usual course of peaceable industry.</p>
<p>Brother John is not quite here at present; for a week past he has been staying at Newfield with A. C. Corrie, where terrible affliction and fatality prevail, most of the family sick, two daughters already dead of dysentry (the second, Miss Corry, only last night) and others still dangerously ill; a most distressed house.</p>
<p>God bless you, dear old friend, my scrap of paper is run out, and I have not room to thank you in words (nor is that necessary) for all your friendliness to me in Glo&#x2019;ster. <closer><salute>Fair befall your household and you and may we meet again before long.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<p><salute>Tomorrow I expect a Letter from you;</salute> today I will only write one word to season your Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Newspapers on Saturday, and prevent your little heart from being vexed with apprehensions. I am well,&#x2014;&#x201C;as well as c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be expected&#x201C;! I have slept handsomely all these three nights; last night best of all, the only really good sleep there has been since I left my own stall at Chelsea. Nobody is here, John still away; we are the quietest of househo<supplied>[l]</supplied>ds<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> for all but necessary noises. A mason worked before this window till yesterday, &#x201C;making a new gig-house&#x201C; at the end of the stable; and is now away, waiting for the joiners to roof. Shearing begins on Monday. The weather is cool and bright, almost coldish; no rain since that deluge of the Steamer day. I walked to the top of Stockbridge Hill (up the <hi rend="italic">made</hi> road, opposite to the end of Burnswark) last night about sunset, and met nothing but two horses; one of the peacefullest evenings, salutary to the vexed heart of a son of Adam. Your Newspapers came, two of them, with Redwood&#x2019;s mark on them as well as yours: I have found German <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;hrchen</hi></foreign> [folk tales] here (Jack&#x2019;s stock), and employ all vacant minutes upon these, finding them very curious and ingenious.</p>
<p>Jack came down for twenty minutes, just after my letter to you was sent away. We have seen nothing of him since; but, alas, his second patient too is gone, died that same night (as he seemed to anticipate); here has just come a letter for me to the funeral tomorrow, and now, it seems, another and still another of the household has caught the disorder,&#x2014;dysentery, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is said to be prevalent at Carlisle and about, and has an infectious quality. Poor old Corrie; one&#x2019;s heart must be terribly taken up otherwise not to spare a tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of sympathy for such a case as his too. His sorrows come all upon him in his old age: better when they come <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that sad stage of our course. His eldest son, of whom we used to hear enough, &#x201C;John Corrie,&#x201C; has just been dismissed from Liverpool for drunkenness, and is at home unwell too. This &#x201C;Nancy&#x201C; that is just dead was of my age; and I well remember her</p>
<p>My trunk is up from Annan, and all my things safe; 4 <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> shirts still left, which is well, as the prospect of speedy washing is not clear in these harvest times! I shall never forget my Steamer voyage; but I am glad to have made it too.&#x2014; At Jamie Ewart&#x2019;s I had forgot my &#x2019;bacco-box; found yesterday that it was lost, and knew not where; it <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> lost,&#x2014;and last night brother Jamie bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it up with him from Ewart&#x2019;s and Annan market; &#x201C;could have sold it for pounds,&#x201C; he said (owing to Literature), being slightly (scarce perceptibly) <pb id="pg-25-183" n="25:183"/>elevated with liquor as he spoke! A true zeal for literary honours, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear, prevails in Annan: bad luck to them, they sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have had a better omnibus to bring me up from Waterfoot,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A harbor for the steamer, ca. 2 mi. W of Annan.</note> and not two dirty Cumberland mechanics to insult me in it, whom I had to <foreign><hi rend="italic">golly</hi></foreign> down into silence amid the mud and rain that were <hi rend="italic">aggravating</hi> us all! Literary glory, I perceive, is not good for much. Here is an example of a Newspaper Cover (which actually <hi rend="italic">came</hi>), which I saved for you the other ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> from my Mother&#x2019;s pipe. Were such &#x201C;drapers&#x201C; (dirty <foreign>drucken daised</foreign> bodies) ever made before?&#x2014; Burn it as soon as read or sooner.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC apparently refers to the scrap of a scandalous newspaper report.</note></p>
<p>At Annan, on that Steamer day, Jamie was properly waiting for Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Hoggan, to take him up for the rent-day to Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> which feat he and I accordingly did,&#x2014;at the cost of leaving my trunk behind for a day. Poor Hoggan looks grey, but otherwise changed only for the better: a most modest well-conditioned man, with the air of a gentleman too, tho&#x2019; very poor. Jamie likes him very much, none speak other than well of him. I did not see him again; but he talked very kindly about old things, especially of Uncle Robert<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably JWC&#x2019;s uncle Robert Welsh.</note> and Puttoch and you: I was really glad to have seen him. The Russels &#x26;c are well; Menteath<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of the Stuart Menteath family of Closeburn, Dumfries; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240927-JBW-EA-01"><sic>3:164</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1824-09-27">27 Sept. 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360730-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:32</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1836-07-30">30 July 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> has got bit by a dog, and is still in some horrible terror it may have been mad!</p>
<p>Oh Goody, I never take pen to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> without running to such lengths! I have a little note to write to Dumfries too.

Emerson&#x2019;s Letter<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1850-08-05">5 Aug.</date></note> (came today from you) is worth little; you shall have it next time.

<p>I am going off to poor Nancy Corrie&#x2019;s funeral, the time (Noon) just at hand; and write only to tell thee so much, lest on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> there be disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> felt.

I took a long circuit last night, by <hi rend="italic">Relief</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Clint Hill;</hi> a truly pensive, melancholy but peaceable and grateful walk of contemplation. I <pb id="pg-25-184" n="25:184"/>read the <hi rend="italic">Seven Swabians</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Seven Swabians&#x201C; was a medieval German folk tale, retold by many later writers, including Hans Sachs and the Grimm Brothers, evidently found in John Carlyle&#x2019;s stock of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Volksm&#xE4;rchen</hi></foreign>.</note> a small Pamphlet, thro&#x2019; the day; then went to bed, slept, &#x201C;and did <foreign>nocht <hi rend="italic">ava&#x2019;</hi></foreign>.&#x201C; It cannot be said that I am killed with <hi rend="italic">work</hi> here.</p>
<p>John has never been back, nor have we heard any certain word from Newfield; there is a kind of rumour, and attempted hope, that things go better there, and the fatal malady is stayed. We shall see shortly. I wish Jenny were here with <hi rend="italic">your Letter</hi> (in case there is one):&#x2014;in the mean time I must go and dress; and will leave this open, till we see.&#x2014; I keep Emerson&#x2019;s Letter till John have seen it: a word or two about poor M<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Fuller&#x2019;s death is all there is of any value in it.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote that Margaret Fuller Ossoli, her husband, and child were drowned &#x201C;at 3 in the P.

Her health was much exhausted. Her marriage would have taken her away from us all, &#x26; there was a subsistence yet to be secured, &#x26; diminished powers, &#x26; old age.&#x201C;</note></p>

The new maid was Emma.</note>&#x2014; I will venture no opinion of her on such short observation; further than that she looks, tho rather youthful, perfectly &#x201C;respectable&#x201C;&#x2014;and that her manners are <hi rend="italic">distinguished!</hi>&#x2014;so self-possessed, and soft-voiced, and <hi rend="italic">calm</hi>, as only english people <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be&#x2014;</p>

The opium is too strong in the air than that words should make any impression on the dull tympana. Besides, the Age consists of its best men, &#x26; I do not wish them to believe their senses to that point as to get into a pretty fury with any windmills. The actors are to believe obstinately the newspapers, &#x26; that the world exists, but thinking men must trust their conviction that right is as secure as the respirability of the air. &#x2026; We are beleaguered with contradictions, and the moment we preach, though we were archangels, things turn on their heel and leave us to fret alone. But there is no choice, &#x26; volcanoes must burn, as well as canaries sing. And, I believe, though I often dissented as I read, the main objection was, this ignoring of the benevolent necessity that rounds us all in. And the ignoring too of the general good intent that must be imputed to the worst of us poor oysters.&#x201C;</note> Of which I do not believe a syllable.

<p>Yes indeed, Dear! a letter from you on Saturday night would have been more to my purpose than the lot of newspapers, which I never look at, except for &#x201C;a <pb id="pg-25-188" n="25:188"/>bird&#x2019;s eye&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s phrase; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500918-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1850-09-18">18 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> glance at <hi rend="italic">the Leader</hi>, just to see how the creatures &#x2018;get thro&#x2019; it,&#x2019; and more to my purpose than even the new <hi rend="italic">Copperfield</hi> which came at the same <hi rend="italic">rush</hi>, and which to this hour remains uncut; the former one having given me no feeling but remorse for wasting mortal time on such arrant nonsense: but on Saturday night there came <hi rend="italic">no</hi> letter; both your letters arrived together this morning, puzzling me extremely which of them to open first. It is much to be wished that one had a post that knew what it was doing again, and Law-makers that knew what they were doing&#x2014;if I were the Government I should feel rather ashamed of making regulations one month, and unmaking them the next&#x2014;but &#x201C;folk <foreign>maun</foreign> do something for the bits of <foreign>bairns</foreign>&#x201C; (as Adam Bogue<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A Haddington farmer&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> said when reproached with ruining himself in race horses)</p>
<p>Before you receive this I hope your Mother will have got the volume of <hi rend="italic">Chalmers.</hi> I found on inquiring at the postmaster in Piccadilly, when I posted my last letter on my way to the Library, that books of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> weight could be sent by post, at the rate of sixpence to the pound; so I despatched the bulky concern today with nine blue stamps and all the newspapers at the same time, deferring the writing of my own letters to the evening, partly because I thought you had literature enough by one post, and partly because &#x201C;I felt it my duty&#x201C; to go and ride all the forenoon in an Omnibus&#x2014;instead of aggravating the sickness I was feeling by writing or any indoors work. On my return I learnt from <hi rend="italic">Emma</hi> that &#x201C;a Gentleman in a carriage, with two servants&#x201C; had been here&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">names</hi> are a thing she does not <supplied>[at]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> all meddle with&#x2014;but a <hi rend="italic">Pendennis</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either the final number or vol. 1, both recently pbd.</note> on the table told that Darwin had returned, the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the Romans! Yesterday I had Elizabeth Pepoli for three hours&#x2014;I wondered at the length of her visit, and wondered at the softness of her manner; today the whole thing is explained it was our <hi rend="italic">last</hi> meeting! I asked her, &#x201C;when are you going?&#x201C; and she answered, &#x201C;soon, but don&#x2019;t let us speak of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well, I said at parting, I shall go to you on Tuesday or Wednesday&#x201C;: tonight is come a note saying &#x201C;dont come here dear Jane for you will not find me&#x201C;! Alas! what a way to part! a saving of <hi rend="italic">emotion</hi> certainly to both; but should we never meet again as is most likely some farewell words, would have been a comfort for the survivor to recall, Pepoli is in depths of tribulation at present&#x2014;thro &#x201C;something very particular&#x201C; having occurred to prevent his Virtue (in the case of old <pb id="pg-25-189" n="25:189"/>Manfredi<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410827-JWC-TC-02"><sic>13:226</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1841-08-27">27 Aug. 1841</date></corr></ref>, where he was apparently one of the Pepoli household.</note>) being &#x201C;its own reward.&#x201C;&#x2014;(or is it not always thro the <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> on which one piques oneself that one gets over the fingers in this Life?)

<p>Passing along Paradise Row the other day I found two <hi rend="italic">mutes</hi> standing with their horrid black bags at Maynard the Butchers door.

Just think&#x2014;going round asking all the people what they wanted for dinner and returning home to die!</p>
<p>I think the new servant will <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> she looks <foreign><hi rend="italic">douce</hi></foreign>, intelligent, well-conditioned. very like Lancaster Jane, (if you remember her) with a dash of Anne<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Ireland; either Ann Cook or Anne Brown.</note> and of Phoebe Baillie!

However she may turn out; I am certainly under great obligations to Geraldine&#x2019;s old Miss Darby for having hunted up this girl and taken much trouble to &#x201C;suit me&#x201C;; in a situation that was really very desolate my state of weakness at the time considered&#x2014; But all is going on decently now again.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dear little Goody;</salute> all your messages have come, and right welcome are they all. Very glad indeed am I to hear that your new maid promises fair; that you are like to get a little rest for your poor wearied heart from that mean part of your afflictions. You do not say how you sleep; I fear there is no great news on that head, or you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have mentioned it. But I beg you, at any rate, to be quiet; to go on steadily with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">rowins</hi></foreign>, if you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> them down from the loft, and not put yourself into a fret about disappointments and misadventures, should such befal, in that department. It is good news too that Darwin is come home; I do not figure you so very solitary any longer in your Town life. Poor Elizabeth Pepoli! That mode of stealing away is very like her, and very affecting to me after its sort. Did anybody ever hear the like of that Manfredi business! The injustice of man to man is occasionally extreme in this world;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;Man&#x2019;s Inhumanity to Man,&#x201C; and Wordsworth, &#x201C;Strange Fits of Passion.&#x201C;</note> the theories and interpretations men form about their fellow man are mad, sometimes, beyond measure! There is, as you say, a kind of <hi rend="italic">nemesis</hi> in this of the poor Conte,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Pepoli.</note> with his sentimentalisms and ostentations; nevertheless one cannot help a little pitying him.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-191" n="25:191"/>I seem to grow a little stronger gradually here; as indeed I have the fairest chance, according to my own program. A man could hardly expect to be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> &#x201C;let alone&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> than I am here even now. The whole day passes in solitude, in sauntering about the burn-side, reading some innocent book, smoking an innocent pipe (tobacco from Liverpool, and <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> clay-pipes from Annan), broken by a word or two now and then with my poor old Mother,&#x2014;who is wonderfully well for her age; busy &#x201C;washing&#x201C; today, and will have nobody to help her:&#x2014;at 4 o&#x2019;clock I eat my two eggs; then walk sharply round by Middlebie and the <hi rend="italic">Waterbeck</hi> <foreign>gate</foreign> to this place, a circuit of half an hour or more; this done, tea is waiting here and three people hungry for that repast: a pipe after it, and walk to <hi rend="italic">Blaweary</hi>, up that loneliest road in Nature, finishes off the day, and makes me ready for a bowl of porridge between nine &#x26; ten; soon after which comes shutting of the shop, and sleep. I have slept every night, last night rather the worst, yet by no means to be called ill. Except <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Letters I have accurately no communication whatsoever with the outer world; a thing &#x201C;probably just as well&#x201C; at the present. I am very pensive, often very sad,&#x2014;have literally no soul to commune with at all. But I find it good that all one&#x2019;s ugly tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, ugly as Sin and Satan sev<supplied>[e]</supplied>ral<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of them, should come uninterrupted before one; and look and do their very worst: many things tend towards settlement in that way, and silently beginnings of arrangement and determination shew themselves. Why, oh why should a living man complain, after all? We get, each one of us, the common fortune with superficial variations: a man ought to know that he is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> ill-used; that if he miss the thing one way he gets it another. &#x201C;Your beautiful blessings I have them not, I cannot train myself by <hi rend="italic">having</hi> them; well then, by doing without them I can train myself; it is <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that I go ahead of you; there too lie prizes, if you knew it!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is not much that I can say to you on the study of General History, except what Nature herself will suggest to you if you be, as I hope you are, intent on prosecuting it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allingham wrote from Ballyshannon, <date when="1850-08-27">27 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I would gladly have had the privilege of a second conversation with you before I left London, &#x26; have sought your assistance on other matters besides the study of Irish History. &#x2026; [I]t would give me much encouragement, in a position in w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I sometimes need it, to receive from you &#x2026; some hints on the self-study of German, &#x26; of General History&#x2014;and &#x2026; whether there is any sufficient reason why one should not attack the <hi rend="italic">great</hi> German writers directly after escaping from the grammar?&#x201C;</note> The Books that exist on it are far from being such as one could wish them; and no man, least of all one in a retired situation, has command of what Books do exist. Let not that discourage you: in this, as in all things, you have to endeavour honestly, with all the virtue, ingenuity and earnestness that are in you; and it is on this latter condition, much more than on your means and appliances, that your real progress will depend. One Book leads to another: begin with almost any Book on the subject, read it faithfully with all your faculties awake, it will gradually lead you towards better Books, and the subject growing more luminous at every step, you will see more and more where the real centre of it lies for you, and how you are to strive towards that. For every subject, and History above all others, has what we may call a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;centre&#x201C; for every diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> man; and it is of great importance that every man sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> candidly listen to the monitions of his own mind in regard to what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> really interesting and nutritive to him as an individual, and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> all foreign monitions, <pb id="pg-25-193" n="25:193"/>with patience, with modesty yet with courage, and silently reject them if they do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> fit with this.</p>
<p>Probably you have already read the fashionable Modern Historians, Robertson, Hume, Gibbon;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Robertson (<date when="1721">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793">93</date>), David Hume (<date when="1711">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1776">76</date>), Edward Gibbon (<date when="1737">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794">94</date>).</note> if not, it will behove you to read them, especially the two latter, and most especially for your present object the last: Gibbon with all his faults is a man of great talent, worth meeting upon any subject, and his Book<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</hi>, 6 vols. (<date when="1776">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788">88</date>).</note> is by far the best Bridge between the Ancient and the Modern world that has yet been constructed anywhere. Johanness von M&#xfc;ller has a little Book on <hi rend="italic">Universal History</hi>, three voll., translated into English about 30 years ago;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johannes von M&#xfc;ller (<date when="1752">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1809">1809</date>), <hi rend="italic">Vier und zwanzig B&#xfc;cher allgemeiner Geschichten, besonders der Europ&#xE4;ischen Menschheit</hi>, 3 vols.

(<date when="1818">1818</date>).</note> this I think I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> recommend you to purchase and keep about you: it is a solid work, and will serve to open the subject for you better than most others. The same M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s Book on Switzerland<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Der Geschichten Schweizerischer Eidgenossenschaft</hi>, 5 pts. (Leipzig, <date when="1786">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808">1808</date>).</note> has a high reputation, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I did not find that it quite deserved; at any rate it is not translated, and must lie over.

<p>One specific very simple precept is perhaps more important than any I have now room to add: Never read a Book of History <hi rend="italic">without a map.</hi> Follow out the details of the localities (chronologies &#x26;c &#x26;c): it <hi rend="italic">forces</hi> you to pay a livelier attention;&#x2014;till you have put the event into its <hi rend="italic">place</hi> and into its <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, in every detail, you cannot be said to have read it at all. And be diligent; and labour faithfully, <hi rend="italic">virtuously;</hi> and fear not!</p>
<p>As to German, which I also greatly approve of for you, the best plan <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to begin directly after you have done the grammar with Goethe, Schiller &#x26;c (avoiding Richter), and on the whole to read resolutely on, labouring towards the meaning,&#x2014;if possible in some Book your <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> is in. Do you know M<hi rend="italic">me</hi> de Stael&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Allemagne?</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Louise Germaine, Baronne de Sta&#xEB;l-Holstein, <hi rend="italic">De l&#x2019;Allemagne</hi> (Paris, <date when="1810">1810</date>, destroyed, only a few copies extant; Paris and London, <date when="1813">1813</date>).</note> That for guide-book;&#x2014;and persist and prosper!</p>

<dateline><place>Scotsbrig</place>, Friday, <date when="1850-09-06">6 Septr, 1850</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>Tho&#x2019; there is nothing new, or in the least like new, I will write a word to you, dear Goody mine;</salute> it is at once a kind of duty and an undeniable pleasure to me, in this sabbath stillness of my days, to open my closed pack to you and talk a little. Nothing so like a &#x201C;sabbath&#x201C; has been vouchsafed to me for many heavy months as these last ten days at poor Scotsbrig are. Let me be thankful for them! They were very necessary to me; they will open my heart to sad and affectionate thoughts which the intolerable burden of my own mean sufferings have stifled for a long time. I do nothing here, and pretend to do nothing, but sit silent in the middle of old unutterable reminiscences, and poor simple scenes more interesting to me on this side Hades: one sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be content to admit here that one is Nothing; a poor vainly struggling soul,&#x2014;yet seen with pity by the Eternal Powers I do believe;&#x2014;and whose struggles, at worst, are bending towards their <hi rend="italic">close.</hi> This puts me to peace, when nothing else can: and the beggarly miseries of the mere <hi rend="italic">body</hi> abating a little (as with me they sensibly do), it is strange what dark curtains drop of their own accord, how the promise of clearer skies again visits one.</p>
<p>These last three days have been of surpassing beauty; calm, clear <date when="1850-09">September</date> days; the sky bright and blue, with fluctuating masses of light clouds: the hills are all <hi rend="italic">spotted</hi> with pure light and pure shade, everything of the liveliest yellow or liveliest green in this lower region; on riding up from the <pb id="pg-25-196" n="25:196"/>Kirtlebridge<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 mi. SSE of Scotsbrig.</note> side hitherward, I could not but admit that the bright scene, with Burnswark<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hill 3 mi. N of Ecclefechan on the slopes of which was the new home of TC&#x2019;s friend William Graham.</note> and the infinite azure behind it, was one of the loveliest (Wednesd<hi rend="italic">y</hi> afternoon and yesterday) that I had anywhere seen. Poor old Annandale, after all!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>&#x2014; For you must know I have got a little lame in one of my feet; nothing to speak of, indeed nothing at all that one can see with the naked eye, or medically make anything of: but it furnishes an excuse for saddling the Gig-poney to me; a most rough inexpert trotter, but a walker nearly unparallelled: and so I am to go daily and ride, rather than walk too much, while this petty ailment continues. The ailment (not to frighten your poor little imagination with it) is a most insignificant kind of <hi rend="italic">pain</hi>, not sensible except when I walk, directly under the second toe (or between that and first d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) of my left foot: to the eye there is nothing wrong, as I said; to the feel there is a slight hardness, no bigger than a pea, and sorish when pressed: the only evil is, that in walking, by the unconscious effort to <hi rend="italic">save</hi> this speck of disorder, I at length rather twist my leg; and so am advised to ride rather when I do not sit or saunter. It has been there above a week; I think, almost since my third day here: the origin of it unaccountable,&#x2014;unless perhaps that, the second night, my bed was wrong-made, and I had to get up, and grope about a little, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> slippers, whereby probably I have got some little prick on the place. A terrible matter that, is it not! Shall we summon the Royal College<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Physicians.</note> about it, think you? Oh Goody, Goody!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This afternoon it is decided that I must take the gig rather, and carry my Mother <hi rend="italic">up to Burnswark.</hi> Graham &#x201C;has lost his memory,&#x201C; is said to be <hi rend="italic">much</hi> &#x201C;stupider than ever&#x201C;: think what a <foreign><hi rend="italic">bureau d&#x2019;esprit</hi></foreign> [group of wits] we shall make of it! Poor fellow, I saw him at the funeral on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last, and am bound to come. James Stewart is also said to be sensibly worse; quite broken down, in fact: perhaps I am entitled <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go there?&#x2014; &#x2014; Jamie&#x2019;s harvest is begun here; a capital crop, I understand, all but potatoes,&#x2014;potatoes are all <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-ruined everywhere, <hi rend="italic">half</hi> not wholly, which I for my own share sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have preferred. I have not tried a single potato here; nor indeed eaten one <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> strictly so called; my &#x201C;<foreign>mimmit</foreign>&#x201C; (ham-meat) is two eggs with bread and fresh butter,&#x2014;baddish bread, in small quantity, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I oftenest substitute a modicum of excellent <foreign><hi rend="italic">flour-scon</hi></foreign> (hot milk, flour, with particles of soda and of sugar, baked by Isabella,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi> counterfoil of my old Mount-Annan scons,&#x2014;and not baked for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at all, but for herself): on this I live till nine o&#x2019; clock when porridge arrives. The <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of all dinner I find to be a real alleviation, for the <pb id="pg-25-197" n="25:197"/>time; perhaps in the long run it might not quite answer? I sleep wonderfully hitherto; last night worst yet (for reasons), and still well. I wish I could hear as much of you! Tell me at any rate. Also whether your &#x201C;baking&#x201C; succeeded; whether &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short I greatly want <hi rend="italic">news;</hi> and surely I set you the example of a most <hi rend="italic">minute</hi> narrative!</p>
<p>Jack came here yesterday for half an hour: I walked with him to Wood-Land (<hi rend="italic">too</hi> far for my toe), and then he went cantering along on a little fat bullet of a pony he rides. The poor young woman is understood to be past the crisis; but I find is yet very far from well, nor (as I guess for my own behoof) by any means quite out of danger. Poor Jack looks old and grey: there is something touching to me in his nestling into this small <hi rend="italic">field</hi> (a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>wee</foreign> bush</hi>&#x201C; indeed)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial, &#x201C;Better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than no <foreign>bield</foreign>.&#x201C;</note> after all his rovings. He is of a much happier humour than I!</p>
<p>I have finished <hi rend="italic">Chalmers:</hi> much more readable than I expected; clearly interesting where one begins to be oneself a little connected with it. I looked far for that Highland Tour when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were present;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had been on a short tour in the Highlands with him, date untraced, before her marriage; see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 215.</note> didn&#x2019;t find it tho&#x2019; many simpler and sillier are given. Duffy&#x2019;s letter rather pleased me: I did write to the other Irish<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and have yet written nothing. A Note to Lady Ashburton after I arrived here bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this answer yesterday: great <foreign>gaudiamus</foreign> [merrymaking] at The Grange, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem! Between life there and life <hi rend="italic">here</hi> as I now have it, it must be admitted there is a contrast: we are about the two <hi rend="italic">extremes</hi> of decent human lodging; and I know which answers me the best, for one!&#x2014; &#x2014; No other letter at all; no sound at all from the big busy Hurlyburly of mankind: thank God!</p>
<p>Have you ever gone to see Leigh Hunt yet? Not you; and yet you ought to go, and I wish you could, some day. With Mazzini if possible,&#x2014;but that is not possible, I believe. Recommend me to Miss Wyn if you ever see her, and generally to all friend: good souls, I like them all better than perhaps they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> suspect from my grim ways.&#x2014; &#x2014; Doubtless I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go to Dumfries too; but am loath to stir <hi rend="italic">anywhither</hi> Sometimes it has struck could not I <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> this <hi rend="italic">sabbatic</hi> period in a room at Craigenputtoch perhaps? Alas, alas!&#x2014; &#x2014; But enough now my dear little woman: I believe there is more than even your patience can stand. I hope the Post will do his duty <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time! Last time, I find there was no fault <hi rend="italic">here.</hi> <closer><salute>God bless thee always</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Here is a letter from Lady Ashburton, the first I have had during your absence;</salute> neither had <hi rend="italic">I</hi> written to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> (till I answered this today by return of post&#x2014;) partly because she had said at our last meeting that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> first; and partly because in the puddle I have been in, I felt little <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> addressing Serene Higher Powers,&#x2014;before whom one is bound to present oneself in &#x2018;Sunday clothes&#x2019;&#x2014;whereas I have been feeling all this while like a little sweep on a Saturday night!&#x2014; But the letter you forwarded to me had prepared me for an invitation to the Grange about the end of this month, and I was hoping that, before it came, you might have told me something of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> purposes, whether you meant to go there after Scotland, whether you meant to go to them in Paris that you might have given me in short some skeleton of a programme by which I might frame my answer. In my uncertainty as to all that, I have written a stupid neither-yes-nor-no sort of a letter&#x2014;&#x201C;leaving the thing open&#x201C; (as your phrase is) But I said decidedly enough that I could not be ready to go so soon as the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x2014; What chiefly bothers me is the understanding that I &#x201C;promised&#x201C; to go alone&#x2014; The last day I saw Lady A she told me that she could not get <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to say whether you were coming to them in <date when="1850-09">September</date> or not; that you &#x201C;talked so darkly and mysteriously on the subject, that she did not know what to make of it&#x201C;&#x2014;that you refered her as usual to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and then she said &#x201C;I want you both to come M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;will you come&#x201C;? I said &#x201C;Oh, if he go I should be very glad&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;But if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> never comes back as he seems to meditate, couldn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come by yourself?&#x201C; I answered to that, laughing as well as I could; &#x201C;Oh he will be back by then, and I dare say we shall go together. And should he leave me too long I must learn to go about on my own basis&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC caught up the phrase from Jewsbury, who wrote, [<date when="1850-09-04">4 Sept.</date>], of an unidentified friend, who was apparently single and a writer, that &#x201C;living on her own basis, she has got a habit of taking care of herself, and making use of other people. &#x2026; I daresay I should get into the same sort of thing if I had to go about like men, and have nobody but myself to look to to help me&#x201C; (Ireland 367).</note>&#x2014; Went to bed&#x2014;Saturday&#x2014; I dont think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was a <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> to go to the Grange alone on &#x201C;the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of this month.&#x201C;&#x2014; Do you think it was? most likely you will decline giving an opinion.

Once more &#x2018;all straight&#x2019; here, I shall see what time remains before the journey to Paris, and which looks easiest to do, whether to go for a week at the cost of some unsettling, or to stay away at the risk of seeming ungrateful for kindness. To descend&#x2014;like a <hi rend="italic">parachute;</hi> Who think you waited on me the night before last?&#x2014; Elizabeth!&#x2014; The last you heard of her was that she had gone away with the police-people; but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was not final&#x2014; I did not tell you, having determined to fret you no more with my annoyances from <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, that she presently burst out on us again, under the form of servant at no 8 or 9 in this street&#x2014; &#x2014;passed the windows often with house-key over her finger, shouting to make herself noticed&#x2014; &#x201C;Better than ever I was, <hi rend="italic">my Love</hi>&#x201C;! I heard her call one day across the street to some butcher who had asked after her welfare But either she must have been only filling up an interregnum in that house, or must have already &#x201C;had enough of it&#x201C;&#x2014;for she came the other night to ask <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to give her a character to a Lady who would write for it next day. She was gaily&#x2014;much <hi rend="italic">too</hi> gaily dressed&#x2014;and came into the room with her head laid on one side and a soft smile on her face just as she looked when I hired her!&#x2014; I said that after her outrageous behaviour I should have prefered her request for a character to have been made in writing&#x2014; She needed to <hi rend="italic">come</hi> she said because I would get the Lady&#x2019;s letter next morning&#x2014;&#x201C;as for her behaviour it was all-along of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> fender and she would do the same over again&#x201C;!&#x2014; I told her &#x201C;I would answer what questions were asked, with truth and fairness; her conduct towards <hi rend="italic">me</hi> was a thing between ourselves; I <hi rend="italic">hoped</hi> I should not be <hi rend="italic">asked</hi> about her temper&#x2014;and so there being no further business to be done I wished her <hi rend="italic">good night.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Good bye</hi> Mam&#x201C;&#x2014;and away she went looking rather foolish, but quite unsubdued&#x2014; As a companion picture to this interview&#x2014;I had one yesterday with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thomas Eliza, sister, who came partly to tell me the result of her <hi rend="italic">petition</hi>, but chiefly to bring me a message from Eliza on her deathbed!

<p><salute>Dear Goodykin,&#x2014;</salute>I think we are for Dumfries this afternoon, tho&#x2019; it depends a little on my Mother who is not very strong: I must be brief therefore, all manner of arrangements in regard to that contingency being yet to make. I sent yesterday to the old place for your Letter, but did not get it there; a new Postboy goes on Sunday, and had left the packet at Middlebie, where late in the afternoon, as I returned from my ride, a friendly shoemaker&#x2019;s-apprentice brought it out to me. A welcome windfall! Many thanks for taking such pains with me; I had but little hope of a Letter even at the regular noon-time, and after that, of course, hope had altogether quitted the Post-Office regions. For two days before I, for my own poor part, had been seized with the uttermost excess of <hi rend="italic">inaction</hi>, heavy indolence weighing me down all day, and sleep itself rather scorning me at night: writing, even to Goody, was a thing I rather shirked; indeed I did nothing at all, good or bad: today however, being stirred up to motion again, I will leave you a word before I go. By Tuesday night your <pb id="pg-25-204" n="25:204"/>appetite I dare say will be sharp enough again. Considerable masses of obligation to write accumulate upon a man even at Scotsbrig, if he altogether lay by the pen! I have turned over Bamford upon C. Knight; advised him to put the whole case into Knight&#x2019;s hand; this is one small instalment towards settling the latter account: when I get back from Dumfries (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign>, why must I go thither or anywhither!), it is to be hoped I shall feel a little livelier on that side.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have been much struck with a poor old man the Farmer of Middlebie-Rig (close by here, as you go up towards Burnswark): he is very old, and may naturally be supposed to be sinking towards his final lethargy, and be excused for being sick and ill; this member of Old Annandale, tho&#x2019; greatly ailing, will not admit that anything is the matter with him but &#x201C;Laziness&#x201C;; when a neighbour asks him, &#x201C;How are you, John?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh, as <hi rend="italic">lazy</hi> as ever; vera ill wi&#x2019; laziness; <foreign>sair hadden doon</foreign> wi&#x2019; that!&#x201C;&#x2014; It is really a terrible disease in that sense.</p>
<p>We went to Burnswark, a beautiful drive (tho&#x2019; my poor Mother was very cold), and I had an interesting climb and walk and solitary lie on the Hill itself; but Mr Grahame was not there at all,&#x2014;&#x201C;gone to Eskdale moor to a funeral,&#x201C;&#x2014;and only Miss Grahame welcomed my Mother, whom I left with her till the time of tea came, speedily followed by departure, and rapid course down the Brae again. The <hi rend="italic">bureau d&#x2019;esprit</hi>, therefore, is still to hold! Ah me, I am very ungrateful; this good man, one of the dullest of men, is and has long been a right kind friend of mine. Woe&#x2019;s me, one does get very lonely on this Earth; and has to seek repose by and by on a hard pillow indeed!</p>
<p>Miss Grahame had seen at Moffat, the other day, Miss Anderson of [&#x201C;]Stroquhan&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stroquhan, a large country house nr. Craigenputtoch. Moffat, ca. 20 mi. NNE of Dumfries. Quotation marks omitted.</note> poor Miss Anderson has now &#x201C;a very fine lodging-house there&#x201C;; still a managing woman, and much liked: she has been there some year or more, as I gathered. Upper Stroquhan too is again for sale (the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> says):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Advertised, <date when="1850-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, as a &#x201C;desirable small estate &#x2026; in the parish of Dunscore,&#x201C; ca. 10 mi. NW of Dumfries, for sale, <date when="1850-09-03">3 Sept.</date></note> all things alter fast, there and elsewhere!&#x2014; I heard again yesterday of Miss Anderson by another channel.</p>
<p>Jack namely had been in Moffat too: on Saturday morning came an announcement that he was off thither &#x201C;to see Dr Hunter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John Carlyle&#x2019;s friend Dr. Jacob Hunter.</note> and his Mother,&#x201C; and not to be expected here. Yesterday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> on my return from the Springkell woods (with your Letter in my pocket), I found him here; smoking, and preparing for tea. He had &#x201C;called on Miss Anderson,&#x201C; bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> compliments to you and me; he had also seen your Aunts Grace and Anne<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> there, from whom <pb id="pg-25-205" n="25:205"/>likewise due remembrances,&#x2014;to which Grace added (on the score of Saintship) express regards to my Mother. All these persons were <hi rend="italic">well:</hi> but poor Mrs Hunter, it appears, has got some incurable ulcer, <hi rend="italic">cancer</hi> of aggravated form it is turning to, upon her breast; and for the last year has been looking to a gloomy end! About six months ago she told her son of it. Poor creatures, I was and am heartily sorry for the poor simple pair, one of whom is known to me as a very innocent creature. Nestle as low as you will, afflictions, grief and death will by no means miss you! One pauses mournfully here over the great wounds inflicted by Universal Destiny in these poor Middlebie regions as in others. Minsca&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Minsca is a farm ca. 4 mi. E of Lockerbie, N of Burnswark, and its owner (who was called after it) was George Bell; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501104-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1850-11-04">4 Nov.</date></ref></note> eldest son, a fine young man of 28, rapidly dying; he and the rest steadily conscious of it these several months: this is but one case of so many. The old Farmer of Scalewood<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >WSW of Scotsbrig, on the other side of Middlebie.</note> (a mile from this) was a healthy old man of 80; got a <hi rend="italic">wart</hi> on his thumb; attempted to cure it with his knife, made it worse, consulted a Dr Edgar,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who ordered caustic;&#x2014;applied the caustic; &#x201C;next morning his whole hand was red&#x201C;; red, and ruined; now it is all rotted or rotting away, and the poor old man is getting the miserablest end. A third case, and I will add no more. A poor industrious couple lived at Craighouse, on the hilltop between this and Waterbeck;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craighouse was E of Scotsbrig, halfway to Waterbeck.</note> a man-and woman-<hi rend="italic">servant</hi> out of the same house, who had married and were doing well, with two children &#x201C;one an infant the other 5&#x201C;: suddenly one morning the poor Wife, sitting by the fire at some kind of work, took a fit (never had the like before); fell into the fire,&#x2014;her hand over some kind of <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> bar they had for guarding off the children;&#x2014;hung there with her head upon the bar of the <hi rend="italic">grate</hi>, till the boy of 5 ran greeting to the next cottage: her right cheek, ear eye &#x26;c are &#x201C;all burnt away&#x201C;; and she is like to live still: they had a horse and cow, but have sold all now for expenses, and are fallen quite poor. Good Heavens, what a catalogue I am giving you; with trouble to myself, and with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> benefit on your side, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think!&#x2014; &#x2014; And your poor Butcher, and poor old Eliza, and poor old Wynn: it is one story everywhere;&#x2014;and whosoever w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> live unastonished in this world must prepare himself for quantities of exception to &#x201C;happiness&#x201C; while here! I know not what has engaged me in such a catalogue: however, here you have it.</p>
<p>You have got rid of Miss Sprague, I hope, forever. I think I would have been a little less emphatic in regard to her good qualities, and have answered <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi> simply, in a <hi rend="italic">low</hi> tone? Perhaps however you are right: if she is a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> servant, which seems undeniable, perhaps the blame is not hers alone but <pb id="pg-25-206" n="25:206"/>chiefly that of the system of mutinous quasi-servitude we are now all used to;&#x2014;and with the <hi rend="italic">System</hi> you have nothing to do in relation to this Miss Pinkerton of the Ladies School.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>, she kept an academy for young ladies on Chiswick Mall.</note> And so let it end. &#x201C;Better than ever, my Love!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; Elizur Wright of Yankeeland I take to be the hatchet-faced man that left the <hi rend="italic">Lafontaine</hi> some years ago: a sharp-tongued, snappish, pretended-<hi rend="italic">laughing</hi> creature; beautiful among men as the Newcastle Rag<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A sharpening stone.</note> is among stones and jewels! By all means keep his lucubrations for the fire&#x2019;s or Postie&#x2019;s benefit. Nor am I in <hi rend="italic">fidget</hi> for Alton Locke: <hi rend="italic">Malte Brun</hi>, an authentic describer of the Planet Earth, is a still surer card!</p>
<p>Nor can I advise you any way <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> as to accepting the Grange invitation,&#x2014;except in so far as this consideration will go, that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> follow your own authentic <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> in regard to it. As to me, I do not think there is any sure chance of my being at Chelsea before &#x201C;the 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x201C; (I am much better here, so long as it will do otherwise); and if I were, my &#x201C;wishes&#x201C; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not point to travelling thither. Of the visit to Paris I have yet said nothing in the way of acceptance or refusal; but certainly of the two that seems by much the more inviting if I feel up to such a thing when the time comes. At present I desire &#x201C;milk-diet and utter <hi rend="italic">silence!</hi>&#x201C; So do thy own way, Goody&#x2014;what more can I counsel? If the visit is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> disagreeable, perhaps a ten days or week of it might stir you up and do you good. Consider it, thy own self; and do what is best&#x2014; &#x2014; On the whole, why not go?&#x2014; &#x2014; Here at this moment, little Jenny has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, by way of Letter for the day,&#x2014;a mass of <hi rend="italic">thistle-down</hi> directed in her Ladyship&#x2019;s hand, and no word whatever! I shall have to answer &#x201C;No&#x201C; for this of the 23<hi rend="italic">d:</hi> the greater reason for you saying &#x201C;Yea&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x2014; Oh dear, Oh dear; and we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to go to Dumfries; and all is getting into uproar about me, and I am really far from well, and in need of peace above all things.&#x2014; &#x2014; Goody, dearest Goody, do thou take pity on me; thou <hi rend="italic">hast</hi> pity on me too, I know! My poor nerves are sadly out of order; but surely surely they will improve some day!&#x2014; Take care of your own poor health any way, for my sake among others. I expect to be back on Wednesday.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Mon.</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks, Dearest, for that nice kind little cheery Letter I found here last night on my return!</salute> It reminded me of old times, and did me real good in my dispiritment.</p>
<p>We got home very softly and fast,&#x2014;a most excellent running pony, and the day bright and still; staid two hours with poor Mary, by the road, who is kindhearted, and full of cares and toil, as usual:&#x2014;all was right, in short, except one&#x2019;s own deplorable soul and liver (or <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>, or whatever it is); and that does make such an insolubility &#x26; misery of it! Alas, alas, I ought to be wrapt in cotton-wool, and laid in a locked drawer at present: I can stand nothing. I am really ashamed of the figure I cut among creatures in the ordinary human situation. &#x201C;If I had the wings of a dove,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Song by Mendelssohn.</note> as poor Mrs Chorley sang, &#x201C;I <pb id="pg-25-208" n="25:208"/>would&#x201C;&#x2014;do several things <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than &#x201C;flying to seek something comfortable to eat!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The truth is, I did not sleep well last night either; and, partly on inclination, partly on principle, took almost no breakfast but <hi rend="italic">tea</hi>; have sat in the sun by the &#x201C;<foreign>dyke-backs</foreign>,&#x201C; reading <hi rend="italic">Alton Locke</hi> &#x26;c till now (3 o&#x2019;clock) when they are frying a chop for me; and&#x2014;and&#x2014;&#x201C;W. Grahame and his Sister&#x201C; are momentarily expected to &#x201C;spend the evening and have tea&#x201C;! I must swallow a pill, swallow a chop; and, if it please Heaven, be fairly out walking on the Moor <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that fatal arrival,&#x2014;to curtail the visit for one hour at least! Otherwise it will be worse for me. No Letters today at all, except some dud of a message from Farie at Malvern, needing no answer,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux</hi></foreign> [so much the better], <foreign><hi rend="italic">tant mieux!</hi></foreign> One couldn&#x2019;t do with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> human creatures altogether, Oh no, no; but, at present, in such moods as I now am in, it were such an inexpressible saving of fret and bother and futile distress, if they could but let one alone! Woe&#x2019;s me; woe <hi rend="italic">is</hi> me!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Alton Locke</hi>, I fear, is worth very little; but I have yet done only half a volume;&#x2014;it is probable I shall struggle quite thro&#x2019;. A very jangly, exaggerative, intemperate kind of Book.

<p><salute>My dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>We got home perfectly successfully that day about 6 o&#x2019;clock, stopping 2 hours and more at the Gill where we found Mary and the rest of them busy and well. The day was beautifully bright and calm enough, and did my poor Mother and self good as we drove along thro&#x2019; the still country. I thought how kind and long-suffering you all were to me, and what an unfortunate bundle of nerves and diseases I alway am when I come among you! Patience, patience: we cannot help it,&#x2014;at least not at present. I have never yet recovered my sleep; indeed last night I did very ill in that respect: but today I feel that I am much better, and shall probably perform a good sleep again tonight, and be all as I was. Poor old W. Grahame &#x26; Sister<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Graham.</note> were here last night; and, unconsciously, proved very wearisome: tonight we hope to be alone. Our Mother is round to her usual beat, or perhaps even better for the journey;&#x2014;the gloves too, she did at last find, were exquisitely good! She is at present buried deep in a new Novel called <hi rend="italic">Alton Locke Tailor and Poet</hi> (and Chartist, too) which has lately come: her appetite for reading is great, fortunate and remarkable. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> James&#x2019;s American <hi rend="italic">whisk</hi> is hung up by a <hi rend="italic">tack</hi> on the wall; it brushes my coat better than anything I ever had.&#x2014; Jack has just come over (favourable news from Newfield), and is writing Letters &#x201C;till 2.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Will you tell Jenny<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hanning.</note> there is no hurry about any of these things but the new <hi rend="italic">nightshirt</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I cannot well want (nay it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be clean too!) on Thursday next. Also that if any overplus remain of the purchase-money I gave her, she must divide it equally between her two Lasses.&#x2014; &#x2014; It is by no means certain that I shall not run up again by myself some day before leaving this region: but I must promise nothing, being so weak a vessel. My kind love to one and all.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have had your Account by me these ten days or more, and have run my eye over it, but not having any records here, or even a complete copy of the <pb id="pg-25-210" n="25:210"/>Pamphlets, I can make no hand of criticizing it. The most surprising item I yet find is the fact that I am assessed about a third of my wages for doing too much! But this also I suppose is partly according to the bargain,&#x2014;partly, and we will hope, not wholly: when once the Account of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 8 comes, we will add the Pages of all the Pamphlets together, and dividing them by 8, whatever excess there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> over the prescribed average of 48 pages for each,&#x2014;for that I, of course, am liable. Altogether, in comparison with the toil and bother expended, it is as beggarly an account of empty boxes as I have lately <supplied>[word illegible]</supplied> in with! But we cannot help that.</p>
<p>In the meantime I wish you would call some morning at Chelsea (any time within a week or so), and give my wife a Draught for Fifty Pounds payable somewhere in London; and send me a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> for what more of <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> money you have in hand (<hi rend="italic">crossing</hi> said &#x201C;d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>&#x201C; for the Banker&#x2019;s use): I will then by return of Post send you a receipt (or sign and return one if sent to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, which will be better);&#x2014;and so we shall be ready for the next bout when it comes round.</p>
<p>I have just done reading <hi rend="italic">Alton Locke</hi>, in these bright <date when="1850-09">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> solitudes; and am very glad to find it an article likely to be of benefit to various parties, you among the number. With kind regards to Forster if you see him, <closer><salute>yours ever truly (in haste)</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>I am still short of sleep, dear Goody mine,</salute> indeed I did <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> last night, than usual in that respect: nevertheless today I feel much better, and look forward by the spirit of medical prophecy to complete reinstatement in my rights of seven-sleeper <hi rend="italic">this</hi> night (if I prove steady, as I promise to do): and so I write poor Goody a word to that effect by way of seasoning to her poor solitary cup of tea, and study of the newspapers, on Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> as usual. Last night I had myself to blame, or rather poor W. Grahame <hi rend="italic">and</hi> myself: one of the dullest mortals, and most perfect of innocent bores, that poor old friend of mine, now is!&#x2014;but tonight the blame will be all my own in case of failure. Nay this morning, lying in bed after bathing or before it, I did, as my poor old Mother prescribes, &#x201C;call on Patience&#x201C; and considerably composed myself thereby! No wonder I am unwilling to drive to Dumfries or anywhither. <pb id="pg-25-211" n="25:211"/>Here is the best part of a week passed in meanest miseries, owing chiefly or solely to that inevitable adventure.</p>
<p>I told you little about my proceedings in Dumfries; indeed except on the medical side, which you got <hi rend="italic">full</hi> enough, there was almost nothing to be told. Dumfries lay dim <foreign><hi rend="italic">stoory</hi></foreign> and ragged (it was a <hi rend="italic">clouded</hi> day tho&#x2019; dry); one got from it, as ever, the impression of a place sinking to decay. They are to have <hi rend="italic">water</hi>, however; that was something: poor fellows! James Aitken for his share prospers; Jean, poor thing, has surely the life of a galley-slave with those heaps of noisy children: but she is fresh and hearty,&#x2014;always very kind and sisterly to me. D<hi rend="italic">o</hi> Jenny as to health, and kindliness tho&#x2019; in a quieter style; her two bits of Lasses are a very picture of cottage orderliness and propriety,&#x2014;the eldest, mounted on a stool, was baking <hi rend="italic">scons</hi> while I sat there; a thing to be laughed at and wished well to.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1895">1895</date> Janet Hanning and her da.

The mother was going to reprove Margaret and some other children for making noise after dinner when TC slept, but he called, &#x201C;Never mind them, Jenny. Let them laugh as loud as they can.&#x201C; &#x201C;The happiest time we youngsters ever had was when we saw Uncle Tom coming,&#x201C; she recalled, for, among other reasons, he &#x201C;&#x2018;used to give my sister and me&#x2019; &#x2026; a crown piece&#x201C; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:314&#x2013;15).</note> I called on nobody at all except Aird and Banker Adamson.

It appears we are worth 2 thousand and a fraction there; I had forgotten the new <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, in guessing it in my head: but indeed such a fact as the above testifies to some peculiarities in me, I think! &#x201C;The little that a just man hath&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

One cannot say; he himself hopes it; has aspiration in him,&#x2014;which, as it comes out in this <hi rend="italic">musical</hi> manner, may perhaps be taken as a virtue and the prophesy of some undeveloped merit, not as mere discontent and a crime? A small Gift of money, from such a place as The Grange, might properly enough be ventured on him;&#x2014;and if there were any delicate way of bestowing it (which I suppose there is not) <hi rend="italic">except</hi> as prepayment for a Copy of his Poems, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a second good deed to discourage him from farther attempts in that carreer.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Poor soul, he is a fellow creature, struggling, as we all do, in the midst of darkness, to better himself and get into clearer regions:&#x2014;and so I will leave him to your tender mercies.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-213" n="25:213"/>I am delighted to hear that the Tuesday weather was propitious; that her Ladyship&#x2019;s grand-to-do came off with due success! Many more such to you and her, and those that are lucky enough to depend on you! These things are not quite easy to do; yet they ought to be done,&#x2014;they, and so many, many more which the Lords of this Earth are terribly negligent of in our poor time.</p>
<p>For myself I am at present the weariest, or probably it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the laziest, of all her Majesty&#x2019;s subjects. Never in my life did I feel such a passion for lying still at any price. Really I believe my liver and nervous-system are far out of order; and Nature herself perhaps prescribes this medicine to me. I sit, with some harmless reading or sometimes without any, plunged into convenient scraggy bushes, under shade of wild trees, &#x201C;by melodious waterfalls,&#x201C; or at least clear-rushing Scotch <hi rend="italic">burns;</hi> and look out into the Universe in the most wayworn manner. &#x201C;To sit is better than to stand,&#x201C; say the red Indian sages; &#x201C;to sleep is better than to wake;&#x2014;to be dead is best of all!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; It is to be hoped I shall rouse me by and by; and try to do some stroke of work farther before all end. To open my mouth, except upon compulsion, or make any effort at all: even that were something. If I can get with you to Paris in the end of <date when="1850-10">Oct</date><hi rend="italic">r</hi>, how happy shall I be! That is really the most agreeable prophecy the future offers at present.</p>
<p>My Lady sent me a bag of Hampshire thistle-down, the other day;&#x2014;intending probably that I should sow it here in Annandale? Alas, alas, I find we have plenty here already: no want of thistle-down in these parts either!

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to have a word from you again. I ran into South Wales, directly after writing to you; and there lay in the utmost attainable inaction, for three weeks; after which, nearly other three weeks ago, I came over hither to my Scottish Birthland, where your Letter soon found me,&#x2014;where I have been ever since, endeavouring with all my might to keep free of every botheration (a difficult problem in this world!) and to continue doing absolutely nothing. I do not even speak, unless it cannot be helped. Amid these old scenes of infancy, which have grown so <hi rend="italic">supranatural</hi> to me, peopled with mere <hi rend="italic">ghosts</hi> and inarticulate memories, I find silent occupation enough! One is much called to sink silent, at intervals, in this Babel of a world; and let the turbid elements settle into sediment a little. Could I abolish grouse-shooting; and doom all the washed classes to sit as I am now doing, for a month each year, what immeasurable quantities of manure should I <hi rend="italic">precipitate</hi> out of every mind, and out of the poor world&#x2019;s business, by that act alone!</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> comes to me, round by London, on Tuesdays; everything Irish has got a new impressiveness since I saw the poor old Land with my eyes. Depend upon it, I have by no means forgotten poor old Ireland, nor the people that dwell there. A strange ragged still <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> is in my Memory of Ireland; a country bare and waste and poor, but noble nevertheless: poor souls, how kind and patient all the people too were with me, and &#x201C;never minded&#x201C; my sulky humours! From no human soul in Ireland that I can bethink me of did I get one uncivil word or look. &#x201C;A kind of noblemen thrown into the poorhouse&#x201C; (by whisky, and other sins and misfortunes): really this is <pb id="pg-25-215" n="25:215"/>in some sort the definition of poor Ireland;&#x2014;shall get <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the poorhouse, and cast away the sins and whiskies yet, if it please Heaven! I have told certain proud Yankees on occasion: &#x201C;Well, you have many dollars, immensities of bacon, molasses, and such like; but there never yet was a soul of you that could bring a <hi rend="italic">Coolun</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Irish song.</note> out of it, much less <hi rend="italic">teach Europe Christianity</hi> in old days:&#x2014;be patient with poor old Ireland, I tell you!&#x201C;&#x2014; Ireland it is to be hoped, will learn wisdom by experience <hi rend="italic">at last;</hi> learn to know a lie from a truth, a little, when it hears it; and no more expend its breath and hope upon &#x201C;Mullaghmast Caps,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A nationalist cap as worn by Daniel O&#x2019;Connell (<date when="1775">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847">1847</date>), the Irish &#x201C;Liberator&#x201C; always denounced by TC for fostering dissension and as the &#x201C;father of lies&#x201C; because he promised repeal knowing it to be an impossibility. Mullaghmore is 13 mi. NW of Sligo.</note> and the like Dom-daniel<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An underground cave in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights.</hi></note> ware (authentic produce of the <hi rend="italic">Devil</hi>, however fine it look). Ireland will cease to be a lie <hi rend="italic">to itself</hi>, and gradually become a truth; every Irishman that does not lie to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>self is helping her towards that!</p>
<p>You never did a wiser thing than that of excluding <hi rend="italic">Stump-oratory</hi> from the Tenant-League;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500727-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1850-07-27">27 July</date></ref>. Duffy had contacted many provincial supporters when on his tour with TC in <date when="1849">1849</date>, and, he says, &#x201C;Carlyle watched its progress with constant interest&#x201C; from the time of its foreshadowing in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> till it took a practical form (Duffy 157).</note> I duly noticed that fact, with glad hope, at the time. And on the whole I continue to say your pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;Agitation&#x201C; looks more like doing work than any I have ever seen in Ireland. But the work, alas, is <hi rend="italic">immense;</hi> and God only knows when or how it will be got <hi rend="italic">done!</hi> &#x201C;Rent by a valuation&#x201C; is not intrinsically so unfeasible, nay so <hi rend="italic">unusual</hi>,&#x2014;witness the old <hi rend="italic">Usury Laws</hi>, only abolished in these years;&#x2014;but it is utterly at variance with all the free-trade, <foreign>laissez-faire</foreign> and other strongest practical tendencies of this poor time; and, tho&#x2019; said tendencies appear to me mostly mean and wooden and ninetenths <hi rend="italic">un</hi>true; yet it is precisely the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> tenth that rules at present. In fact, to <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi> altogether, you must have&#x2014;a New Era, no less! Nay I cannot but perceive that &#x201C;fixity of tenure,&#x201C; with such a set of tenants as you now have in Ireland, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never do, tho&#x2019; you even could get it;&#x2014;that in fact, independently of all obstacles on the Landlord&#x2019;s, Parliament&#x2019;s and official sides of the question, there is a total <hi rend="italic">unpreparedness</hi> on the part of the population. &#x201C;More ado than a dish to wash,&#x201C; as the Proverb says,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I have more ado,&#x201C; etc., meaning &#x201C;I have business of importance on my hands!&#x201C; Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scotish Proverbs</hi> 209.</note> before you attain this same New Era of <hi rend="italic">Justice</hi> on the Land Question! Nevertheless, I must say always, Pause not; use all your courage, all your wisdom, in continually advancing! You will do good in every way, if you advance wisely; every step you secure is a laying bare of new intolerable abuses; a bringing of the Grand Problem (in all its <pb id="pg-25-216" n="25:216"/>figures, moral, political, social, not agricultural alone, and not Irish alone) <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> to the tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi>, to the practical necessities, of all men, and thus nearer to its only possibility of solution. Like other such problems it will be solved, by slow degrees (I suppose), so soon as all men feel that they cannot live without solving it,&#x2014;not much sooner, I doubt.</p>
<p>One thing, it strikes me, will become in the course of your struggle much more apparent than it now is: The necessity of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">regimenting of Paupers</hi>,&#x201C; in which I see clearly, and nowhere else at all, the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of new government, and the means of transition towards that, for the afflicted world in this epoch.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For which TC argued in &#x201C;Irish Regiments (of the New &#xc6;ra),&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May 1848</date>, and <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:164&#x2013;67.</note> Suppose every Irish &#x201C;free&#x201C; tiller of the Earth, so soon as he declared himself a &#x201C;free&#x201C; beggar, in need of Indian meal from his poor brothers,&#x2014;fell at once into the hands of an agricultural Sir Duncan Macgregor, and became a &#x201C;well-commanded&#x201C; tiller of the soil, doing <hi rend="italic">his</hi> feat as your green Police do theirs; and not only relieving all men from the burden of him, but gallantly exterminating bogs, and approving himself a blessing to the Earth and to all men: I leave you to compute a little what boundless relief to all interests whatsoever w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lie there;&#x2014;free space granted to <foreign><hi rend="italic">laissez-faire</hi></foreign>, and all extant principles of proceeding to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> themselves ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the fact, and run their very utmost <hi rend="italic">without</hi> shackles on their feet: <hi rend="italic">if they</hi> proved equal to the Problem of the 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Cent<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, well and good; if (as I see to be inevitable) they proved <hi rend="italic">un</hi>equal, at least they (what was good in them) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be able to last longer, and to see their successors <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> before departure hence.&#x2014; These things, I fancy, will gradually come athwart you, these and so many others of the like genus, either in this or some other form of the &#x201C;Tenant Agitation&#x201C;; and whatever real <hi rend="italic">work</hi> you do in that, is done for behoof of those also,&#x2014;which lie so far away from the general tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, but will become if I mistake not very familiar to it by and by!</p>
<p>Lucas, I do believe, is capital in his present place; give him my compliments and true good wishes for that and all other real service to Ireland that may lie in him. When he took to Catholicism first (which seemed to me so distracted an operation), and I heard what he had to say about Irish Tenants and Landlords,&#x2014;I could not help recognising the finger of Heaven in his change of religion.</p>
<p>No Irish &#x201C;List of good Members,&#x201C; nor indeed of English, has fallen in my way: they are a dreadfully scarce commodity, I imagine! Nevertheless you must seek for them, as for the <hi rend="italic">vital air</hi> of your undertaking. The more <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi> you seek, the better is your chance both of finding what is, and of calling forth a set far worthier to be found, in time coming.&#x2014; &#x2014; And so, Good <pb id="pg-25-217" n="25:217"/>speed to you, in this and in all honourable courses; and <foreign>adieu</foreign> for the present. <closer><salute>With kind remembrances to Mrs Duffy and Mrs Callan,&#x2014;Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>&#x201C;Nothing,&#x201C; still &#x201C;Nothing&#x201C; today again,</salute> is what little Jenny reports from the Backburn post-office where she has been. Yesterday I pretty confidently expected some line from you: that &#x201C;influenza&#x201C; you were nursing had seized my attention; I noticed farther that the &#x201C;Ecclefechan&#x201C; on the last Newspaper was very badly written;&#x2014;suppose you were lying sick all this time! I will endeavour not to torment myself with what I cannot help or influence; but I do wish very much I had an articulate word. Ashley&#x2019;s Sunday is out now;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sun. reception and delivery of mail was restored <date when="1850-09-01">1 Sept.</date></note> and if this could still reach you in time to operate upon tomorrow, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bid it make speed! Poor Goody, poor little soul, and nothing but a stranger maid beside her!&#x2014; Well, I must be patient; Tuesday and the Newspapers will bring me some indication at any rate.&#x2014; As to myself, I have recovered my sleep again, these past two nights, and am altogether at the old pass or better. My <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> itself has considerably abated; I have got my shoes <hi rend="italic">gutta-percha&#x2019;d</hi> anew at Ecclefechan, anew and rightly, the Chelsea work was scandalous: and now I have a pair of real <hi rend="italic">shoes</hi>, in which I can walk, and the <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> says next to nothing! A ride or two I have also had; rapid steady <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>, is the pace; very beautiful thro&#x2019; the hot sunny windless afternoon. Last night at dusk I went down by <hi rend="italic">Sattur</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450929-TC-JWC-01"><sic>19:225</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1845-09-29">29 Sept. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> the valley of Mein (very rough paths there), and home by Ecclefechan again: one of my <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> walks, which I sometimes try. On the whole, I am <hi rend="italic">lazy</hi> to a degree, but must not otherwise complain.&#x2014; Jack still visits us rarely and with great brevity; <hi rend="italic">reports</hi> favourably of his patient: yesterday, I suppose, he must have been at Moffat again, visiting poor Mrs Hunter. His &#x201C;practice&#x201C; here is great,&#x2014;all in the gratuitous shape. Jamie was yesterday building ricks; crop good, but ripens slowly. No potatoes eatable; no vegetables at all: I have dined thrice on mutton-chop to bread; am returning today to my two eggs as preferable.&#x2014; God bless thee, dear Jeannie; I shall surely hear some word tomorrow or Tuesday?&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>I fear I have been too late in writing to you. It is now almost three weeks that I have sat here, doing my utmost to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, and escape all action or exertion whatever; looking daily over withal into Cumberland and the Greta-Bank locality, with some pleasant hypothesis in that direction;&#x2014;till now the time is come when I must bethink me of actually lifting anchor, and unless a sight of you be accomplished soon, it too must vanish to the realm of impossible <pb id="pg-25-219" n="25:219"/>possibilities. The truth is I am very low in bodily health and what they call &#x201C;animal spirits,&#x201C;&#x2014;indeed mere carrion considered as an &#x201C;animal&#x201C;;&#x2014;and am fitter for a place in some hospital of incurables than for roaming up and down in such a screeching railwaying tornado of a world as this now is.</p>
<p>However, I have discerned that there does a train start from this neighbourhood on Saturday mornings, &#x201C;a market train&#x201C; so-called, which fits to a quarter of an hour at Carlisle with the Maryport<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Solway Firth, 28 mi. SW of Carlisle.</note> early train (&#xBC; to 10 a.m. <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Carlisle); a route that leads me towards Keswick but will by no means set me down there;&#x2014;indeed I know not in the least what it will do with me, and am reduced to question you on that and the cognate points.</p>
<p>Tell me therefore as soon as possible, <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, whether you are at home on Saturday first,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1850-09-21">21 Sept.</date></note> and disposed for a dyspeptic visitor till about Tuesday or Wednesday next; <hi rend="italic">Secondly</hi>, what are the methods of arriving at you by that train I speak of, especially the method by the <hi rend="italic">minimum of bother</hi> (my nerves being really unequal to much just now):&#x2014;if said method be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> too heavy for my imagination and me, I will surely make some attempt towards screwing myself to the sticking place,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 1.7.</note> and seeing you on the day mentioned! If anything be wrong for next Saturday, or if I myself and my poor imagination go wrong for that day,&#x2014;then alas I fear the project is off; and I am wandering uncertain over space, not near you for a year again. What loads of &#x201C;pavement&#x201C; a certain Place gets from poor souls like me whom human health has forsaken!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Tell me also whether the Colonial Sec<hi rend="italic">y</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding.</note> is in your parts: I heard an echo of him from Chelsea not long since. And please remember me kindly to Mrs. Spedding,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances.</note> and the Genius of Cumberland in general, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has always been an <hi rend="italic">azure</hi> kind of country to me.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>For some three weeks I have been in these parts; find Grahame and all <pb id="pg-25-220" n="25:220"/>your friends and my own pretty well; and now I am thinking to pick up my staff again, and journey farther&#x2014;uncertain a little witherward in the first instance.</p>
<p>Before returning to Chelsea, there is one problem in the way of travel which has always for some years past suggested itself as a thing that ought to be done: <hi rend="italic">a deliberate sight of the Island of Iona, Icolmskill</hi>, or whatever they call it: one of the remarkablest spots to me in all her Majesty&#x2019;s dominions.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Iona, island of the Inner Hebrides, W Scotland, early center of the Celtic church; St. Columba and his disciples landed there from Ireland, ca. <date when="0563">563</date>.</note> Alas, I fear I have by no means strength and spirits sufficient for the enterprise just now. Nevertheless, I will give myself a chance; and so address a question or two to you, by way of making the conditions clear. You have Glasgow steamers, I believe, which call there; by a little trouble, which you will not grudge me, information enough may probably be had in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>First, then, please tell me when (on what days and hours) the steamers sail towards that Island; how long they naturally stop there, and what interval there is till they call on their return; <hi rend="italic">item</hi> (if you can) whether one finds any public house or other place of refuge on the poor Islet,&#x2014;a miserable boggy spot, I understand,&#x2014;or if one has to live under the canopy till civilization and the Glasgow steamer revisit one? In short, I want to <hi rend="italic">see Iona;</hi> care little about Fingal&#x2019;s Caves,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cave 227 ft. long, 66 ft. high, on island of Staffa, nr. Iona; associated with the Gaelic legendary hero Fingal.</note> the picturesque etc., etc; and will restrict myself and you to that one point. Probably there is some paltry little rag of a guide-book about it? If you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> lay hold of such a thing, and send it by post, that (in addition to your own word) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> probably be the shortest method.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>And so enough for this day: I am in great haste and confusion for the moment; but</salute></closer></p>

<p>I shall go now however when I have written a bit&#x2014;for I am able to go out again without risk.

<p>I have a fine <hi rend="italic">misadventure</hi> about the Library also to reveal to you; but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and my other various misadventures shall form a &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">Chelsean</hi> <hi rend="italic">Nights Entertainments</hi>&#x201C;; when sufficiently remote to be laughed over&#x2014; So, I decided some weeks ago when I saw the part your Ungrateful &#x201C;Destinies&#x201C; had taken against me. that it would be better to keep my squalid difficulties to myself till I could &#x201C;take a bird&#x2019;s eye view&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Phrase of old McDiarmid&#x2019;s, of Dumfries&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> of them in the <hi rend="italic">past</hi> tense, and work them up, at my ease, into a conversational &#x201C;Work of Art.&#x201C;&#x2014; But I was going to say that just as I was a-finishing the above mentioned job I was surprised by the rare sound of a knock and ring, and a brisk little voice asking &#x201C;is your mistress within&#x201C;? Emma came up with much awe in her face, and said &#x201C;it is the <hi rend="italic">Bishop</hi> of something&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know what.&#x201C; Actually Terrot again! He had been brought up, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at his own expense, to bear witness that he had married a couple who now want to be divorced, and deny having been properly married ever, &#x201C;it was a love-runaway sort of match&#x201C;!</p>
<p>After an hour and half he went his way and I returned to my carpet&#x2014;in five minutes I was called down again to &#x201C;two gentlemen and a Lady&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t you know their names?&#x201C; &#x201C;No&#x2014;but there is a coachman and a footman! and the Lady is very stout&#x201C;&#x2014; Bunsen.

See <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Baron Bunsen</hi>, ed. Frances Bunsen (<date when="1868">1868</date>) 2:253.</note>&#x2014; After these came my Cousin John<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> to early tea&#x2014;his second visit since he was settled at Kew three weeks ago&#x2014;and latish Craik who improves in sententiousness and that universal forgiveness which springs from universal understanding A luck I didn&#x2019;t wait for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> Maid&#x2014;he now &#x201C;thinks of keeping her three months&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> thinks of &#x201C;a little shop after.&#x201C;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Spedding,&#x2014;</salute>Thanks for your prompt answer and comfortable intelligence: I find there is a Train here which, with little waiting, will fit your Jenny-Lind Coach at Penrith;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Named after Jenny Lind.

Penrith, during the hour of waiting, will yield me something in the form of dinner; and Mrs Spedding, of her bounty, will comfort the thirsty soul with a cup of tea on my arrival. Wait patiently till you <hi rend="italic">hear.</hi></p>
<p>That was an excellent idea about <hi rend="italic">Bacon</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding was the biographer of Francis Bacon.</note> and the Industrial Exhibition! Commend me to the most patient of Biographers and quietest of Philosophers, all the same.</p>

I hope; and be wound up, like yours of the Library into a &#x201C;work of art&#x201C; for some &#x201C;Chelsea Evening Entertainment,[&#x201C;]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quotation marks omitted.</note> if I prosper, by and by; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> That affair of <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> comes heavy on the Son, much more on the <hi rend="italic">Daughter</hi> (I suppose), of Adam! I instructed Jean to buy me <hi rend="italic">three</hi> pairs of drawers, for instance; and here has the Tailor sent me <hi rend="italic">five</hi> excellent pairs out of the stuff,&#x2014;only all of them, I fear, too strait! And my Dressing-gown, exactly like Sampson&#x2019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Sampson.</note> and an excellent article, is clearly <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> in the lining,&#x2014;a dim <hi rend="italic">drab</hi> Colour, which Jean and the Draper fixed upon, never minding my precepts taken from the law of Goody, nor once shewing it to me! Oh Goody, Goody!&#x2014; But we shall get thro&#x2019; it all, better or worse; and look back on it as a &#x201C;work of art,&#x201C; before long.</p>
<p>Do not regret those contrivances &#x201C;of a rude age,&#x201C; dear Goody mine; they are still useful for our circumstances, and are always beautiful as human virtue is. We are not yet <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>, my woman; nor likely ever to be,&#x2014;Devil may care for that part of it! No &#x201C;new suit of virtues&#x201C;; only not quite so tight a fit in the old one,&#x2014;an advantage that undoubtedly. But Chapman&#x2019;s Account for the Pamphlets might teach us moderation if we were forgetting ourselves: such a return of <hi rend="italic">money</hi> for so much toil and endurance of reproach and other things, as has not often come athwart the Literary Lion,&#x2014;Devil may care for that too! He says &#x201C;the Account is all right,&#x201C; you perceive (about &#x2153; <hi rend="italic">deducted</hi> for doing too much):&#x2014;he will pay you your bit of an allowance this week, however; and so let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and his trade-ledgers go their gates again. &#x201C;The little <pb id="pg-25-224" n="25:224"/>that a just man hath is more and better far&#x201C;&#x2014;said the old Jew Psalmist;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 37:16.</note> a most true and comfortable saying</p>
<p>My last Letter ended with a Prophecy, which has come and is hourly coming <hi rend="italic">true.</hi> I am frightfully in the way here, now that Jack has returned; my own sleep too has gone a good deal, and my quietude and silence still more; poor Isabella in the heart of busy harvest too:&#x2014;in fact it was clear to me next morning, as I lay awake in bed, that <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I cannot any longer handsomely or even humanely be. Two little projects of travel rose upon me: one a visit to Spedding, which is easy, but not very useful; the other a sail to the <hi rend="italic">Island of Iona</hi> (Western Highlands) which I have been demanding of myself for years past, a much more difficult (or disagreeable) piece of travel! On both I wrote after getting up. From Spedding there is already an answer; quite ready for me they, and attainable by 7 hours rolling: I might go thitherward on Saturday, if all else suited,&#x2014;if in fact I had <hi rend="italic">clean linen</hi>, which (not by my fault but by the necessities of this place) will not be the case till Saturday <hi rend="italic">night.</hi> Spedding therefore is postponed to the beginning of next week. From David Hope of Glasgow, in reference to <hi rend="italic">Iona</hi>, I yet hear nothing: alas, I sadly fear that is too hard an adventure for me in the present state of nerves and spirits, at this advanced point of the season! But I do think I shall go to Spedding:&#x2014;after which might not this (fruitless) hunt after &#x201C;a quiet place&#x201C; turn itself&#x2014;perhaps towards Chelsea again! O Heaven, I have been in no reasonable set of human arrangements, for sleep and lodging, since leaving it, I think! We shall see. Meanwhile I purpose running over to Dumfries for a couple of days till the Cumberland adventure be ready;&#x2014;Monday I shall be ready, if that suit otherwise. At Dumfries I shall but be a little worse off for quiet than I am here; and an immense alleviation (I perceive) will ensue <hi rend="italic">here</hi> whenever I go. So courage! I have written all the due letters; and it is settled to be <hi rend="italic">so.</hi></p>
<p>You are to go to The Grange on the <date when="1850-05-25">25th? May</date> it prosper with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, Dearest! Miss Farrar must have misreported, or have been misinforwarned:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> I have written to Lady Ash<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that I cannot come at present; that I will go to Paris <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I be well enough. Guess for me, by and by, how <hi rend="italic">long</hi> you are to <hi rend="italic">stay;</hi> I think you may find me at Chelsea on your return,&#x2014;perhaps before it, if Iona go to smoke! Mind also you are to take travelling expenses, as if I were there myself;&#x2014;keep some account, namely, and let me pay it,&#x2014;without <hi rend="italic">bother.</hi> And take care of yourself, my little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>; according to the 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Command<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lass dich nicht verbl&#xfc;ffen</hi></foreign> [Let yourself not be bewildered];&#x2014;and try to get any scrap of profit or of enjoy<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there may be going.

<p><salute>Oh my dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg</salute> what may you be thinking of me I wonder! that I am an entire humbug of a woman, with <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> pretensions to sentiment &#x201C;and all that sort of thing,&#x201C; and whom nevertheless serious friendship is thrown away upon&#x2014;one of those unsatisfactory women in fact with whom &#x2018;out of sight is out of mind? is that your private opinion of me in these days of waiting for an answer to your letter, and some acknowledgement of your gift? If so however you are quite out in your calculations. My silence hitherto is no proof that I am without heart, and even common politeness&#x2014; I have been silent for a reason extremely stupid, but <hi rend="italic">conclusive</hi> all the same. I had mislaid your letter and did not know your address! And if you only knew what a <hi rend="italic">sack of Troy</hi> has been transacting itself in this house latterly you would find it quite simple that I should have lost not only a letter but my purse and my keys, and <hi rend="italic">nero</hi> and my own wits!</p>
<p>I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C into Wales, nobody invited me nor would I have gone in any case&#x2014; I chose to remain here to get up a household earthquake, accordingly M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was no sooner off, than I proceeded to pull up carpets, and pull down beds, and to send all manner of things to the <hi rend="italic">Dyer!</hi> and to bring in Sweeps and Whitewashers and Carpenters and Smiths, and in short to raise such a dust as had not been in the premises I should think since they were first built in the reign of Charles the 2<hi rend="italic">d!</hi> If virtue had been as surely its own reward as good people say it is; I should have been long ere this sitting at ease in the midst of unspeakable cleanness, looking complacently on the little &#x201C;Babylon which I had builded&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dan. 4:30.</note> but everything went wrong; my Husband&#x2019;s friends &#x201C;the Destinies&#x201C; had for some reason best known to themselves taken his wife into decided aversion&#x2014;the whitewasher spoiled all the paper on my <pb id="pg-25-226" n="25:226"/>walls, the Smiths made a perfectly other <hi rend="italic">new grate</hi> for the Library than the one I had ordered. in every room of the house &#x201C;the pigs ran thro,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., played havoc with; coterie speech.</note> and to crown all my maid Elizabeth whom I had allowed to get the upper hand with me, lead me such a devil of a life after M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s departure, that I finally convinced myself I should be better as a negro eating pumpkins than the so-called <hi rend="italic">mistress</hi> of that young person&#x2014;and so I gave her notice to quit at the end of the month, whereupon she would not wait till the end of the month, but rushed off in a day! leaving me with no servant, a house in a most &#x201C;abnormal&#x201C; condition, a visitor (Miss Jewsbury) expected for some days, and my own health all &#x201C;gone to smithers&#x201C;&#x2014; But so long as one keeps alive one struggles thro better or worse, so now; so now I have got things straight again, or nearly so, and have realized myself a country-girl for Servant, who has a temper as sweet as barley-sugar, but knows no more of cooking than an unfledged dove. And I am to try to teach her, God help me! And B&#xF6;lte says &#x201C;but, you are mad! how should <hi rend="italic">you</hi> now cook <hi rend="italic">in your old age?</hi>&#x201C; Well, it is a questionable adventure certainly, yet one might take to worse in one&#x2019;s old age&#x2014; Meanwhile I am very tired and in need of what is called &#x201C;a change&#x201C; and so I am going off to <hi rend="italic">the Grange</hi> on Wednesday, where I shall find in the magnificent and brilliant atmosphere of Lady Ashburton as complete <hi rend="italic">a change</hi> from my own late squalid maid-of-all-work atmosphere, as human heart could desire M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is now at Scotsbrig and has not fixed the time of his return; will perhaps join me at the Grange, where I shall stay a fortnight or so; perhaps not&#x2014;one never can tell what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will do till he does it. The Ashburtons go to Paris in the end of <date when="1850-10">October</date> and Lady A has invited <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;not me&#x2014;to stay with them a fortnight there, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I think he will do. as he has not said that he will <hi rend="italic">not.</hi> My maid let fall a box in my bedroom this morning and broke the lid in two pieces and strewed all the letters it held, on the floor, and behold <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>there&#x2014;where I did not dream of having put it, so I have lost no time in availing myself of the recovered address&#x2014; Thanks for your kind thoughts of me&#x2014; I fancy we shall see you back in London before long&#x2014; Give my best regards to your nice little Sister<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosette (or Rossetta).</note> <closer><salute>Ever affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>You must be satisfied with the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of writing today; my own state and that of all my implements being of the most unfavourable kind. Except to you (and to Jemmy to bring me home tomorrow) I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write to no creature this day!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am not ill, however; one word is due to poor Goody, to indicate so much.&#x2014; Confounded steel pen, that &#x26;c &#x26;c!&#x2014; Oh, why do I ever <hi rend="italic">travel</hi>, why am I obliged to travel! Among her Majesty&#x2019;s subjects is probably found no one who gets himself so thoroughly saddened and made miserable by the operation. Yesternight I slept badly, night before d<hi rend="italic">o;</hi> I am maddened too by being kept incessantly talking; last night I hurt my watch some way, and it is stopt; the weather has fallen quite wet; and my tailor <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> threat<supplied>[en]</supplied>ing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> to go awry:&#x2014;in short, here is a distempered human Soul, that has <hi rend="italic">slept ill</hi>, and has been terribly dadded about of late! A phenomenon probably not quite unfamiliar to your observation.&#x2014; However, I am to get to Scotsbrig tomorrow (Annan at 20 minutes past 2 by rail, and there Jamie meets me). Perhaps there will be a word from you awaiting me at Scotsbrig? I have not yet decided about Cumberland: the wet weather dashes everything.

<p>Do you proceed with your own bits of travels, Dear, as <hi rend="italic">if I were not stirring from Scotsbrig for an unlimited period;</hi>&#x2014;week on weeks yet of such a life w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been so advantageous to me: but failing the possibility of that, may not the solitude of my own house be the next best?&#x2014; Tell your Maid when you go that perhaps she may get a Note from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and a sight of me some evening <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you come back! And write, pray, by return of Post: so that I have it on Wednesday. And pity me, and pray for me, and be patient with me;&#x2014;and so I quit this <hi rend="italic">brush</hi> pen, almost a worse than the steel was. <closer><salute>God bless you.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Alas Dear!</salute> I am very sorry for you. You as well as I are &#x201C;too vivid.&#x201C; to you as well as to me has a skin been given much too thin for the rough purposes of human life! They could not make ball-gloves of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> skins Dear&#x2014;never to dream of breeches!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, Tannery of Meudon&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 3:247.</note> But it is to be hoped you will feel some benefit from all this knocking about <hi rend="italic">when it is over</hi> and you are settled at <hi rend="italic">home</hi>, such as it is. It does not help to raise my spirits for my own adventure, that you are likely to arrive here in my absence&#x2014; You may be better without me so far as my company goes; I make myself no illusion on that head; my company, I know, is generally worse than none, and you cannot suffer more from the fact than I do from the consciousness of it. God knows how gladly I would be sweet-tempered and cheerful hearted and all that sort of thing for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> single sake, if my temper were not soured and my heart saddened beyond my own power to mend them. But you would certainly be the better for me to stand between you and this new Servant who has as little idea of going on <hi rend="italic">without</hi> &#x201C;interference&#x201C; as Elizabeth of going on <hi rend="italic">with</hi> it. She is very <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> however and &#x201C;not without sense,&#x201C; only you must give your orders in simple <hi rend="small-caps">un</hi>figurative speech, and one after another: if you were to tell her in the same breath <hi rend="italic">three</hi> things to be done, she would fly at them all at one time, and spin round on her heel simply: for <hi rend="italic">living</hi> you must confine yourself to broiled chops, or fowl <hi rend="italic">quartered</hi> and one quarter boiled in soup another broiled&#x2014; mutton broth is beyond her, and in roasting she is far from strong&#x2014; we are getting very plausible potatoes and she boils these pretty well.</p>

<p><salute>Well Goody dear,</salute> this is to salute you at The Grange on Thursday morning, where I hope it will find you safe (and well-<hi rend="italic">slept</hi> I should like to add!), and looking out upon Nature <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;budding Percy,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">1 Henry IV</hi> 5.4.</note> but &#x201C;decaying Jeannie,&#x201C; with a certain degree of quietude and hopefulness. You have done all that was to be done hitherto quite in the way one wishes; held to your own day &#x26;c independently of the Farrars, &#x201C;tho&#x2019; dreadfully poor&#x201C;; taken in a judicious space for stay; and all the rest of it: in fact, if you can <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> and be quiet, all the <pb id="pg-25-230" n="25:230"/>rest will go along at its own rate in a tolerable fashion, and your little spell of country will do nothing but good. It will also be a pleasing feature to start with that you are not &#x201C;using up <hi rend="italic">Miss Farrar</hi> and she you,&#x201C;&#x2014;at least not quite at the beginning of the enterprize! I am sorry and angry the lazy Chapman did not come with your money; the blockhead&#x2014;but indeed I suppose he is simply rusticating by the sea-shore yet, and will call <hi rend="italic">in your absence</hi>, poor man! Write to me instantly, however, if you really have the smallest threatening to want money: here, or at Chelsea, or wherever you hit me, there shall <hi rend="italic">money</hi> to the required amount set off by return of post; would that all else could go as sure as money can. Also assure yourself, poor little Goody, your private capital will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be drawn upon for that mysterious &#x201C;improvement&#x201C; at Chelsea, whatever it may be. No, I should think not. And oh my Dear, if you could but cease being &#x201C;conscious&#x201C; of what your company is to me;&#x2014;the consciousness is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the malady in that: ah me, ah me! But that too will mend, if it please God.</p>
<p>&#x2014;Here has <hi rend="italic">Tea</hi> come, <hi rend="italic">summons</hi> to Tea; most unwelcome to me, who dined hardly an hour ago: and Tea done, here already is Garthwaite&#x2019;s Boy, my messenger to the Post: no hope of a long letter tonight! I am pretty well, and all is pretty well; let that suffice you for the present. No great misfortune has happened me, and all these tossings and tumblings will come to some benefit when once I am out of them.&#x2014; Yesterday the weather grew bright again, and the auspices better: I rode to Annan, alone, and in 40 minutes, with decidedly composing sensations. But, alas, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bat</hi>luck&#x201C; followed me to the Orient: No Scotsbrig Gig or any vestige of escort was there! I set out on foot in an angry rapid manner; and so held on, little comforted by the balmy silence of the country, and the Elysian afternoon; got here, safe, while they were at Tea: &#x201C;No letter had come.&#x201C; I put it in along with <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the<foreign>[re]</foreign> is an <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> today, when <hi rend="italic">it</hi> from Dumfries is just arriving! All were sorry for me; they got me fried ham, did their very best.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my Dear, I will write again tomorrow or next day, why should I scribble more just now. My respects to your noble Hosts.

<p><salute>Thanks, Dear Sir,</salute> for your prompt and copious intelligence about Iona: your letter came to hand just as I was setting out for Dumfries; for which reason I have been so long in replying and am so hasty now in doing it.</p>
<p>My decision at once was, that the thing would not do for this season: we will leave it standing for another, when happily I may be better provided with introductions &#x26; other furtherances and equipments. Thank your friend too for his kind commentary added to the Steamboat Bill. Grahame has just sent me a (very flimsy) little book upon Iona; which I will read out before calling on him to-night, as my scheme runs. The few days more permitted me in these parts I am now to spend with some friends in the Cumberland and Westmoreland region; whither I go the day after to-morrow. So <foreign>adieu</foreign> to poor old Scotland; <foreign>adieu</foreign> to you and all kind friends there, till, if Heaven be bountiful, we meet some other time!</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I must write a word by way of finish to the incoherent scrawl hurried off yesterday: it will be a consolation to my soul to pour out the whole flood of &#x201C;complaints&#x201C; into the soul of Goody:&#x2014;perhaps they will not prove so dreadfully overwhelming, after all, when I see them once on paper! I have an hour or two of absolute silence and leisure (in this Eastern Room, John being off to Ecclefechan, and the rest all busy or at the Rood Fair of Dumfries):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470929-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:99</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-29">29 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> such an interval is itself a great blessing. I have had some considerable sleep, too, last night; and little troubles of life. Surely they are all very <hi rend="italic">little</hi>,&#x2014;at least those I have to complain of are!</p>
<p>By Spedding&#x2019;s letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> got to me (I know not how, for the &#x201C;Dumfries Post-Office&#x201C; had never any trade with me) this morning, you will see that there is absolute necessity for a resolution as to Cumberland; which, alas, <pb id="pg-25-232" n="25:232"/>involves more or less all manner of resolutions! Pity the soul (and body) that is too weak for making any &#x201C;resolution&#x201C; whatever, if it could help it!&#x2014; Well, I have written to Spedding that I will go to him <hi rend="italic">on Friday:</hi> so let your answer to this Note go thitherward, &#x201C;Greta Bank, Keswick, Cumberland&#x201C;: that is one point fixed, whatsoever may follow out of that. I have told him farther that if he will take me to Coniston and Marshalldom,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monk Coniston, belonging to James Garth Marshall.</note> he may. For in fact I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> rather leave you time where you are, and have some recoil about fronting Chelsea for a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> long while without the protection of Goody!&#x2014; There remains the question as to coming back to Scotsbrig, or pushing right on homeward from Coniston. A question involved in a certain complicacy.</p>
<p>My clothes &#x26;c are all here (at least all that I shall get of them), a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of clean linen; all things <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, in fact, and for myself no real <hi rend="italic">business</hi> more. But there is this other consideration: my poor old Mother, who is <hi rend="italic">visibly</hi> weaker than last year, and has lost all her <hi rend="italic">upper teeth</hi>, has been much urged by me (for John rather hung back) to go into Dumfries, and try for a new set, wh<hi rend="italic">h she</hi> is anxious enough to do if it proved feasible. Well, John and she are to go, most probably tomorrow, and <hi rend="italic">try.</hi> Shall I steal a march from her; and leaving the matter loose or altogether secret, take myself away, and <hi rend="italic">escape</hi> the torment of such a morning as leave-taking &#x26;c always gives me here? I should like to see my poor old Mother <hi rend="italic">after</hi> her return;&#x2014;alas, alas, the possibility is always present to me that I may never see her again!&#x2014; This is still to be considered about; in this you cannot help me, nor can anybody. So we will leave that.</p>
<p>Address your Note to me, I say, at Speddings: Perhaps tomorrow or Friday I may already get one from you? No, I now perceive I cannot,&#x2014;unless you chance to write <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I fear is hardly to be expected. Well, they will send it after me. Write at any rate whenever you get this: and tell me all and sundry; you have ample <hi rend="italic">time surely</hi>, and all your accounts of how you are, and how they <hi rend="italic">ack</hi>, and how you <hi rend="italic">ack</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321010-JWC-EA-01"><sic>6:234</sic><corr>JWC to EA, <date when="1832-10-10">10 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> and feel and get along, will be abundantly interesting to me. I have heard of that Lady W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Russell (of the Russell kindred, but I know not how), and of her two German-English sons who were said to be better specimens than usual.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord George William Russell, Lord John&#x2019;s brother, had been ambassador at Berlin, <date when="1835">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841">41</date>; his two younger sons especially were Germanophiles.</note> &#x201C;They will do well enough for all we want with them,&#x201C; I fancy! And Miss Farrar, is she come &#x201C;with the means of travelling&#x201C;? And who else is there? In short, how do they <hi rend="italic">ack;</hi> how do you ack;&#x2014;and have you formed any notion of your <hi rend="italic">time of stay</hi> yet? If you have not, do not the least form any on my account. But tell me everything that is in your head</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-233" n="25:233"/>The &#x201C;five pairs of drawers&#x201C; are off the Taylor&#x2019;s hands: a capital article intrinsically; and if they <hi rend="italic">be</hi> wrong (on trial), I promise not to trouble poor Goody in the job. But I do perceive, O Goody, there will never a right result be got for the <hi rend="italic">Flannel</hi>garments I internally require in this world, during my sojourn there,&#x2014;till Goody herself takes the thing in hand; resolutely <hi rend="italic">measures</hi> me to her own satisfaction; cuts a paper pattern of everything; calls in a model distressed needlewoman to work under <hi rend="italic">her</hi>eye, to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> cutting;&#x2014;and so defies, for me, the devil and the world! That good time must come; a good time coming, lass!&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Bat</hi>luck following me to the Orient, I somehow hurt my watch (as you heard), and it proves to be a broken mainspring: so my poor watch must lie dead till I get to Chelsea; a sore bereavement. I felt really sorry when my poor Watch hung dead at the bedhead, that morning: a kind of <hi rend="italic">child</hi> (all I had for a child) gone dead!&#x2014; On the other hand, I have got an admirable brush for clothes: really the like hardly ever seen!&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless thee, Goody dear. Give my respects to the Grange <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herrschaft</hi></foreign> [master and mistress], my <foreign><hi rend="italic">bon voyage</hi></foreign> to Lord A.; and be well always.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>It is curious, Dear, how in the midst of the perfect idleness that is here, &#x201C;something very particular&#x201C; always occurs to prevent one&#x2019;s having time to write a deliberate letter&#x2014;</salute> When I was leaving the drawingroom after breakfast, in the intention of writing all day in my own room M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Henry Taylor ran after me, and insisted on my going out with her and Lady W Russell; &#x201C;for it looked like rain and there would be no walking later&#x201C;&#x2014; So I went, and by and by she slipt in to her children and I remained sitting alone with the elder Lady who is an immense talker, and whom I felt bound to <hi rend="italic">use up</hi> in Lady A&#x2019;s absence who is gone today to Southampton to see Lord A off on the spanish adventure&#x2014;and left Lady W Russell who only came yesterday to <hi rend="italic">our</hi> attentions&#x2014; There, on that bench, have we sat talking &#x201C;all round my hat&#x201C; till lunch-time; and now I am required to go driving with her in half an hour&#x2014;and as I dont know what will be my fate when we return I think it best to write a few hasty lines before starting&#x2014;</p>
<p>I performed my journey in perfect quietude and safety; B&#xF6;lte brought a cab from The Hospital to take me to Waterloo, and went and saw all my <pb id="pg-25-234" n="25:234"/>luggage put in, in a much more calm useful manner than <hi rend="italic">men</hi> do<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >B&#xF6;lte wrote Varnhagen, <date when="1850-10-20">20 Oct.</date>, that she had stayed with JWC for two days and had accompanied her to the train for the Grange (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 84).</note>&#x2014; The Taylors (the three children are here too) met me at the door when I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">descended</hi> from the <foreign>carrozza</foreign> [carriage]&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420814-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:14</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-14">14 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> and welcomed me with those little cares which one is used to in middle life&#x2014; They are very nice for me, both of them.

By the way I am in the room that used to be yours, where the four posted bed is&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope you did not come away without taking leave of your Mother it is a bad <hi rend="italic">dodge</hi> that! I shall never forgive Mazzini for having played it off on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, if a son had done so I would disown him&#x2014; I dont know yet in my own mind the precise term of my stay&#x2014; I should wish to stay as long as that <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> is &#x201C;staved off&#x201C; by the change of air and food&#x2014;that will not be long I expect, I have always found that the benefit of removing into the Country lasted with me but for a week or so&#x2014; even a weeks respite however is something to be thankful for&#x2014; I must also consult Lady A&#x2019;s convenience about my going, now that she has been kind enough to fetch me here for my own convenience&#x2014; Lord A being absent she will not like being left without some woman in the house when these men come&#x2014;and if she have trusted to having <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, I must stay <hi rend="italic">thro them</hi>&#x2014; To do her pleasure in such matters is the only return I can make her for her manifold civilities&#x2014;the obligation of which should not be lessened for me because they are shown me in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> account&#x2014;</p>
<p>So if you wish to return South before my time&#x2014;you had best just leave your superfluous luggage at Chelsea and come on here&#x2014; It would certainly be much more natural, since you like being here, than fighting for your daily existence at Cheyne Row&#x2014; That poor Emma being all made up of good intentions as yet&#x2014; I also have an &#x201C;intention&#x201C; which must be carried into effect before the winter set in and I am disabled (possibly) from doing my own cooking &#x26;c&#x2014; I will tell you how cleverly I have made things dove tail into one another when we meet</p>
<p>In the third page of this letter I was told that the carriage had come round <pb id="pg-25-236" n="25:236"/>and have since been a long beautiful drive, and have so &#x201C;ingrushed&#x201C; myself with Lady William that Lad<supplied>[y]</supplied> A (who is come back) has just been to my room to ask if &#x201C;I, rather than Miss Farrer&#x201C; will accompany her tomorrow to Winchester&#x2014; as I &#x201C;seemed to suit her particularly well&#x201C;&#x2014; Finding me writing she said &#x201C;if you are telling M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle when you are to be home mind you say on the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and if he wants you sooner, he can come here<supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quotation marks omitted.</note>&#x2014; I said I was not going to fix any stay just yet&#x2014;</p>
<p>Miss Farrer is come and I must go and see her I suppose&#x2014; If I had only Nero here!&#x2014; Lady A would have made him welcome she says</p>

<p><salute>Well Goody, here I am according to program,</salute> after manifold experiences, of which if it please Heaven there shall one day be a copious narration by the hearth at Chelsea or elsewhere. At present, the Post goes so <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, my business is to signify articulately that I am <hi rend="italic">here</hi> and well, postponing the rest.</p>
<p>My Mother went away with John to Annan (for Dumfries) on Thursday; very weak and much flurried, the good old Mother: she kept asserting and insisting (tho&#x2019; with an air of secret doubt), that I was to &#x201C;come back&#x201C; and &#x201C;see her with the new teeth&#x201C;; but I privately felt, and feel, that I ought to spare myself and her that misery of a new parting: ah me!&#x2014; Thursday afternoon (they went about 12) I spent in the profoundest silence; sad of heart, but not quite wretched at all, being perfectly let alone: a most deliberate packing took place, in the evening a dark walk to Ecclefechan, glance at the streets, glance at the Churchyard-tree; then home, the wild wind singing lullaby to me, and at length <hi rend="italic">getting</hi> me to sleep (in my solitary upstairs floor).</p>
<p>Yesterday morning was pouring wet; but Jamie and I on consulting found that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not last all day (nay it practically ceased before my going), so the gig was drawn out; and towards noon (in a <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> carriage, as usual in these parts if you take a first-class) I was rolling towards Carlisle; thence, with half an hour of ugly waiting, in a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> to Penrith; and there between 1 and 2 o&#x2019;clock, a <hi rend="italic">Jenny Lind</hi> (Coach so called) took me on the roof of it,&#x2014;with perfect liberty to smoke cigars, but also with ominous recommencement of <hi rend="italic">rain;</hi>&#x2014;and so off we went, up Ulleswater (beautifullest of the Lakes) and, by breakneck roads, <pb id="pg-25-237" n="25:237"/>generally up hill and down dale,&#x2014;the rain diminishing into windy insignificant showers, and generally the ride being definable as a <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> rather than a wet one,&#x2014;till not long after Sunset, we reached the turnpike here; and Spedding&#x2019;s servant made his appearance, and shortly after Spedding&#x2019;s self: and so there was dinner (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> however I was too far gone for eating), and a talking ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I would rather again have passed in <hi rend="italic">silence.</hi> The excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> bed and bedroom, known before, received me kindly, and I soon fell asleep, but soon awoke again (the <hi rend="italic">windiest</hi> night I can remember); then at last fell asleep the second time;&#x2014;and so here, about Noon within half an hour of Post-time, I sit scribbling to you, not at all much below par, and confidently expecting to be up to it again tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are only Spedding, self and Mrs S. as yet; but expect to be enlarged by James (and Meyers,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Rev. Frederick Myers.</note> alas) from Coniston (30 or more miles to the Southwest of us, <hi rend="italic">over</hi> the head of Ambleside); whither there is pendent a negociation that I and my host here and all of us are to go. There is Mrs Ja<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Marshall&#x2019;s flowery missive which awaited me here; in reference to <hi rend="italic">last</hi> week all that: how this is to be I know not, but suppose we shall have to go. Alfred Tennyson with Mrs is said to be there (not any excessive charm for me, I do fear);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred and Emily Tennyson had spent a few days with James Spedding at his father&#x2019;s home, Mirehouse, in late <date when="1850-07">July</date> and then, ca. <date when="1850-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, moved to Tent Lodge, opp. Monk Coniston, staying till <date when="1850-10-14">14 Oct.</date></note> but it seems they are just about going if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> already gone. The Monteagles are &#x201C;in an Island of the Lake&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Herbert&#x2019;s Isle, the site of a traditional <date>7th-cent.</date> hermitage, in Derwentwater.</note> (romantic-house of Henry Marshall&#x2019;s) here; &#x201C;Miss Lynn<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Lynn.</note> is here,&#x201C; many a one is here:&#x2014;heigho!</p>
<p>Dear Goody, I do hope there will be a word from the<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> tomorrow: if sent on friday there will. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> my poor little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, I hope thou art <hi rend="italic">well:</hi> at all rates <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> me how thou art. Direct hither, at least till you hear <hi rend="italic">again.</hi> Alas, I am not quite sure but they will <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> this in London over Sunday (no, they don&#x2019;t!)&#x2014;so you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get it on Monday morning. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I know not whether you will get this till Monday, or any sooner at all for my writing it today; but I have a few minutes still (tho&#x2019; our post goes so early), and it will <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a comfort to my own feelings to send you a word. Tomorrow I hope confidently to hear from John about the Dumfries enterprize and you; tomorrow also I expect my first news from Jane: in both directions I calculate to write speedily again.&#x2014; We were very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> about you that blustery showery day, especially as you were hurried and flurried at getting off: but little John<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, James and Isabella&#x2019;s son.</note> told us you were in excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> time for the train, and that &#x201C;Grandmother didna look tired or ill,&#x201C;&#x2014;perhaps <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was no great observer! However, I hope to hear tomorrow that you arrived safe, and got a good report from the Dentist: I shall be very anxious to hear daily till that good operation.&#x2014; &#x2014; Alas, alas! Here just at this moment is Jacks Letter handed in to me: and it appears there is no good chance for new teeth; which is very sad news to me! Well, well, dear Mother, we must be content. I suppose it was a quite wise decision not to afflict you with these <hi rend="italic">hinge</hi>-teeth:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A double set, held in place by a steel spring.</note> but if there were any chance of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> getting good by them, the <hi rend="italic">expence</hi> &#x26;c, and all that can be done by <hi rend="italic">us</hi> to it, shall simply be nothing at all. I don&#x2019;t know whether it is worth assuring John practically of this, with an eye to still farther practical consideration of the matter: but if it be, let him know it for a clear <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> such as it is,&#x2014;alas, all the little that I can do towards helping you at present.</p>
<p>I am so hurried today,&#x2014;but I will write to Scotsbrig before leaving this, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is likely to be soon. For there is strong speculation of our going over to a place called <hi rend="italic">Coniston</hi> where the Marshalls are (of whom Jack can tell you), who seem anxious enough to have me;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; nothing can be settled to about it till after <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>, when <hi rend="italic">James</hi> Spedding &#x26;c with <hi rend="italic">messages</hi> is expected. I will duly write.</p>
<p>Do not disturb yourself about my journey &#x26;c, dear Mother; I am very well here, have an excellent bedroom &#x26;c &#x26;c: my journey too was quite successful; excell<hi rend="italic">t sunny</hi> weather all the way to Penrith; then a Coach ready with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> waiting, and not a wet afternoon but a windy showery one, thro&#x2019; beautiful country, and with liberty to <hi rend="italic">smoke!</hi> I buttoned myself together, and did rarely;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">saw</hi> a <pb id="pg-25-239" n="25:239"/>waterfall even (walking about a mile of short-cut); a far showier thing than the &#x201C;Spout of Mein!&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A waterfall 1&#xBD; mi. S of Ecclefechan.</note></p>
<p>Tell the Doctor I will <foreign>spier</foreign> about his Dr Leitch<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> and his whereabouts, and see what is to be done. Thank him much for the letter, and ask for more. My best regards to Sister Jean and household (are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> staying there?)&#x2014;item to Jenny and her <foreign>bairns</foreign>. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother, I will very soon write again.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I hope you will get my Letter of yesterday before leaving Dumfries. I write a single line today again that it may catch you tomorrow, for my address is once more to <hi rend="italic">alter.</hi></p>
<p>We are quite solitary here, Mr &#x26; Mrs S.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding.</note> and I; and I find they have <hi rend="italic">postponed</hi> a visit of their own to the Marshalls on my behalf (last week); so in fine it is settled that we all go off to Coniston <hi rend="italic">tomorrow;</hi>&#x2014;and I wish you to write <hi rend="italic">thither</hi> so soon as you can: &#x201C;J. G. Marshall Esq Coniston, Ambleside&#x201C;; that will find me at once (by aid of the Railway), and I will write to you again from that establish<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> The Speddings I suppose will take me in their own vehicle; it is 24 miles to Ambleside, then 7 miles farther, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> does not make much of a journey even in wet weather. Tennyson, James Sped<hi rend="italic">g</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c are there; but I do not expect much satisfact<supplied>[ion from]</supplied> my visit among such a crowd of talking people (of late hours): however it is <hi rend="italic">partly on my way</hi>, whichever direction I travel in: Ambleside being only four miles from the end of the Westmoreland Rail which corresponds with the Carlisle one at Kendal. Write to me and I will answer before going anywhither.</p>
<p>My mother&#x2019;s disappoin<hi rend="italic">t</hi> distresses me exceedingly; but what can we do? If at any future time she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to try it&#x2014; But I suppose she herself coincides in her notion with you?

<p><salute>A word in the utmost hurry, Dearest;</salute> better than none at all! For we are going off to Coniston,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in the margin: &#x201C;J. G. Marshall Esq., Coniston, Ambleside.&#x201C;</note> and my Address is again changing: <foreign><hi rend="italic">ay de mi</hi></foreign>, when will these &#x201C;changes&#x201C; terminate, and a place of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> be found!</p>
<p>Your Letter came yesterday at our early dinner time (2 o&#x2019;clock, in spite of Dietetics!),&#x2014;&#x201C;twopence to pay sir!&#x201C; the Note having proved too <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> in the Post-office Three sheets of <hi rend="italic">thinnish</hi> Notepaper will do; <hi rend="italic">thick</hi> and with copious wax, it is too much.&#x2014; It was a cheap purchase nevertheless; and I right thankful for the punctuality of Goody.</p>
<p>My poor Mother&#x2019;s teeth-speculation proves utterly a failure; the man cannot do it without more fret, and annoyance probably of a permanent nature (for he needs to put <hi rend="italic">two</hi> rows, with wire joint &#x26;c), than will outride all the benefit to so old a person&#x2014; Thus John reports. And they are to return to Scotsbrig today, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any result. I am infinitely sorry, disappointed,&#x2014;sad on that and all accounts. But what can I do,&#x2014;except hold my tongue. John writes earnestly that I must come <hi rend="italic">back</hi> to Scotsbrig: alas, alas, there is no place for me there, I fear; however I have not quite finally refused till I write from Coniston.</p>
<p>Here I have done little good; lost a good deal of my sleep; gone pining about in the wild blustery weather (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> today happily is <hi rend="italic">bright</hi>); regretted much the scarcity of <hi rend="italic">coals;</hi> in short been very dull (for T.

<p><salute>Alas, my Dear,</salute> I am sinking from bad to worse in this expedition of mine; and have just decided to conclude it suddenly by the earliest possible retreat to my own poor den at Chelsea, where, alone in this Earth so far as I can see, there seems to be some prospect of what is most essential for me: Sleep, and being left alone!&#x2014; Since leaving Scotsbrig, my nights have been worse and worse, my share of sleep &#x201C;small by degrees and beautifully less&#x201C;; and last night here was the worst of all,&#x2014;with no prospect of improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> but of far the reverse while here;&#x2014;so we will make one other great gulp; swallow down the horrors of an Express Train with its <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> tomorrow, and get to the end of the affair. That was my resolution as I lay awake this morning, amid <hi rend="italic">noises</hi> <pb id="pg-25-242" n="25:242"/>equal to those of Sharp and Roberts<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Sharp Bros. &#x26; Co.; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470909-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:57</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-09">9 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> (with the addition of poultry, children and flunkeys), in a very sick frame of mind indeed, and much deserving to be pitied (at least by the gods) it did seem to me! But let me bother poor Goody no farther. I have written to Emma, that she may not be surprised when I arrive tomorrow or next day. Marshall has compulsed his <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bradshaw&#x2019;s Monthly General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide;</hi> &#x201C;compulsed&#x201C; thus in MS.</note> for me; and I find I have the possibility of running in by Liverpool to &#x201C;sleep,&#x201C; if I find myself unequal to the whole of the journey while at it. So let it be settled. The voice of my poor Mother sounds <hi rend="italic">faint</hi> but most distressingly impressive asking me (<hi rend="italic">against</hi> prudence or reason) into Annandale again: alas, alas, I must even disregard that too, and go my own sour road, my case being decidedly a sour one!</p>
<p>As for you, stay where you are as if I were not.&#x2014; You shall hear from me at <hi rend="italic">Chelsea</hi> (I hope) next; and with more composure on my part than just now! Alfred Tennyson &#x26; Mrs Alfred, the Speddings male and female are here; love of the picturesque is here; &#x201C;gorgeous magnificence&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> quiet or any sort of comfort wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> to me (in my exceptional, thinskinned, thrice-morbid condition) were <hi rend="italic">human:</hi> I had to run away abruptly from a survey of certain sublime rock-passes and &#x201C;pikes&#x201C; never-to-be-forgotten, lest the Post sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go without my writing. And now I do suppose it is on the very edge of <hi rend="italic">going:</hi> so here (avoiding &#x201C;Lunch&#x201C; too, &#x26; taking a solitary pipe instead) <closer><salute>I end for this day. &#x201C;Feeling himself to be of all men by far the most miserable&#x201C; (like that old Greek),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A conventional phrase in Greek drama; cf.

<p><salute>My dear Mother.&#x2014;</salute>You see where I am; safe here since last midnight! I did not run away from you without regret and sorrowful affection and almost remorse: but in the state things stood in I saw clearly that it was the wise course. Right <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> was I yesterday, at the &#x201C;Kendal Junction&#x201C; to think that it was not northward I had now to go, but southward, away from you and from so much else that is dear to me. And you had gone to Dumfries in vain too; and had to take these other disappointments when you came home: I felt <pb id="pg-25-243" n="25:243"/>sorry enough, if I could have helped it; but alas, what was the good of sorrow? My only consolation was the hope of seeing you again, perhaps after even a shorter interval than the last.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1850-10-04">4 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;This morning our mother was very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> &#x2026; repeatedly regretting that she had left you so abruptly last week. &#x2026; Now that she hears of your safe arrival &#x2026; she seems to have cast off all regrets about your not returning to Scotsbrig.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>At Keswick I did not get on very well: the weather was wet and blustery; the people tho&#x2019; very kind, lonesome and not in the best of spirits: neither could I <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> any way well, which was of course the worst condition of all for me. We felt bound moreover to make off (there being a previous engagement on their part to that effect) some 30 miles farther south, to the place called Coniston where the Marshalls are,&#x2014;old friends of mine, whom I had rather neglected of late. The drive thither, in Speddings carriage (a kind of double &#x201C;<foreign>clatch</foreign>&#x201C; with two horses), past the root of Helvellyn<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain, 3,118 ft. high, 9 mi. SE of Keswick.</note> &#x26;c, in moderate weather, was pleasant enough: but, alas, there my satisfactions, such as they were, came to a close The House was noisy with company and bustle; in particular my bedroom was exposed to nurseries of children, tumults of flunkies &#x26; housemaids: I almost lost my sleep entirely that night; and felt, as I lay tossing about in the morning hours, that there was but one scheme for me,&#x2014;to rush home to my own den, and <hi rend="italic">end</hi> these roamings up and down the world. Accordingly I wrote to warn the servant here; wrote also to Jane (from whom I expect answer <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> morning); and took my measures with that object. The kind Mrs Marshall put me into a smaller but far quieter bedroom for next night, and there I did sleep well and long; but my arrangements were already made: and so, yesterday about noon, in much better spirits for my sleep, I pushed away (James Marshall hospitably accompanying me, in my own hired tub-gig) to &#x201C;Windermere Station,&#x201C; and so by Kendal to join the Express Train from Carlisle. The Journey, which I had looked to with a kind of horror, was far less severe than I expected: we were not crowded in the carriage, indeed a shifting company of whom only myself continued stationary; there was plenty of air to be had; for food I had at one place &#x201C;a mutton-pie&#x201C; (price twopence), then at Birmingham three miserable fractions of sandwiches (price sixpence) with a glass of brandy and water: I sat very quiet too, nay at times fell into a kind of doze; and on the whole got along without much suffering at all. The poor little maid, a cleanly, discreet, assiduous but rather inexperienced creature, was waiting for me; and so, after a cup of thin tea, I got fairly into bed, silently thankful to Heaven that I had got the ugly jumble over.&#x2014; &#x2014; My sleep was none of the best, but I expect to do better tonight; all morning I have been busy sorting my articles, and looking out for my old <pb id="pg-25-244" n="25:244"/>tracks of procedure. Poor Jane has been making innumerable improvements in the house; really cunning and excellent many of them;&#x2014;but they are <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi>, they, and she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have liked to be here herself to shew me the way of them. I have not yet got quite into my road, and can only do so by degrees. Nay it seems, by what the maid informs me, Jane has decided on <hi rend="italic">not</hi> keeping her as a servant; but has another, &#x201C;properly experienced,&#x201C; in her eye; and only delays till she find this poor &#x201C;Emma&#x201C; of hers another proper situation. I shall hear more about this tomorrow. I suppose it is all wise and proper: but alas for these &#x201C;changes&#x201C;; nothing but change, change,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is a mere loss and vexation to all concerned! I fancy unless Jane can get home sooner than &#x201C;the 21st,&#x201C; she means that I should join her where she is. We will see about that; we will have a right good spell of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> here first, and not be easily beaten with the &#x201C;inexperienced maid&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I must now go and write to Jane herself. You may think she should have been <hi rend="italic">first:</hi> but I some how felt as if the first stroke of my pen belonged to you on this occasion.&#x2014; I got the Dr&#x2019;s second Note at Keswick before setting off on Monday; if he have written to Coniston, as I think likely, it will follow me hither (I suppose tomorrow). I called upon his Dr Leitch, whom I found a worthy man, tho&#x2019; with a <hi rend="italic">dreadful</hi> face, poor soul. He was just writing to John, he said. I too will soon write to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, I hope; &#x26; you will hear more of me. I send Jamie his Newspaper: thank him and Isabella and everybody. <closer><salute>God&#x2019;s blessing be with you all forever! Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Well, my Dear, here you see I am;</salute> some seven or eight hours, I suppose, before you knew of my intention: your exclamations of surprise I expect tomorrow morning!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mrs Marshall, a good kindhearted soul (tho&#x2019; privately, a great fool), so soon as she heard of my afflictions in the way of sleep, shifted me into a totally <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> room, where on Tuesday night I had good sleep for six hours, which was a mighty comfort to me; and, with the bright sky (for our weather too had cleared itself), produced a great alteration in me; so that I was privately not indisposed to have staid another day, and still other days, had I been asked: but none asked me,&#x2014;really I believe I was not wanted, nothing except the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of me which was already got: so the former resolution stood; I had to hire my own private &#x201C;<foreign>clatch</foreign>&#x201C; from the neighbouring inn; fare off to Windermere <pb id="pg-25-245" n="25:245"/>(12 miles or so, &#x201C;James Dear&#x201C; hospitably attending me so far, and forcing me to talk, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was small favour); and then, by aid of the Express Train, I was shot off far enough,&#x2014;and have nothing to do with Marshaldom for some time coming. You shall have my narrative of all that in due season (only <hi rend="italic">be discreet!</hi>); in the meanwhile I have done with it, and with the astonishingly admirable lights and shadows, and vallies, and Langdale Pikes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Two mountain peaks.</note> and a worship of the Picturesque in all its branches, from all and every of which, for the future, good Lord deliver <hi rend="italic">huz!</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490902-TC-JWC-01"><sic>24:212</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1849-09-02">2 Sept. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> Oh my poor Goody, it is a great blessing to be born a person of sense, were it even with the &#x201C;temper of a rat-trap&#x201C;! One must put up with the temper; the other is not to be put up with.&#x2014; On the whole, tell Mrs Taylor, who will be asking you, that I found Coniston the beautifullest place conceivable,&#x2014;picturesque to a degree;&#x2014;that I liked the people too (which is <hi rend="italic">true</hi> in a sense);&#x2014;and that, in fine, <hi rend="italic">here</hi> I am, it being there. All this, in a discreet manner, at your peril!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theodosia Alice Taylor and Mary Alice Marshall were sisters.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Tennysons are lodged in what they call &#x201C;the Cottage,&#x201C; a place similar to a Factor&#x2019;s House or Minister&#x2019;s house as I judged; one of the several little Properties wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Marshall has bought as they fell in, &#x201C;to keep them out of bad hands.&#x201C; There Alfred lives with his new better half, for the present; does not mean to stay above &#x201C;a couple of weeks&#x201C; more: indeed I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> judge it much more charming for the Marshal&#x2019;s than for him: &#x201C;Sir, we keeps a Poet!&#x201C;&#x2014; Softest of soft sowder <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> a vacant Cottage and to dinner as often as you like: &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">magna est <hi rend="small-caps">pecunia</hi> et prevalebit.</hi></foreign>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Magna est veritas et prevalebit</hi></foreign> [Great is truth (for which TC has substituted &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">pecunia</hi></foreign>,&#x2019; money) and will prevail]&#x201C;: <hi rend="italic">Apocrypha</hi>, 1 Esdras 4:41.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; For the rest, Alfred looks really improved, I should say; cheerful in what he talks, and looking forward to a future less &#x201C;detached&#x201C; than the past has been. Poor fellow, a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> soul, find him where or how situated you may! Mrs. T. also pleased me; the first glance of her is the least favourable. A freckly <hi rend="italic">round</hi>-faced woman, rather tallish and without shape, a slight <hi rend="italic">lisp</hi> too: something very <foreign><hi rend="italic">kleinst&#xE4;dtisch</hi></foreign> [provincial] and unpromising at the first glance; but she lights up bright glittering blue eyes when you speak to her; has wit, has sense and, were it not that she seems so very delicate in health, &#x201C;sick <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a disorder,&#x201C; I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> augur really well of Tennyson&#x2019;s adventure.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emily Tennyson wrote of first meeting TC: Alfred &#x201C;made me rather nervous &#x2026; listening to what I said to him [TC] at dinner, and no doubt was rather nervous himself when he heard me say &#x2018;Mr. Carlyle, you know that that is not sane&#x2019;&#x201C; (H. Tennyson, <hi rend="italic">Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir</hi> [<date when="1897">1897</date>] 1:334).</note>&#x2014; Other news if there were other, will keep till we meet. Aubrey de Vere was expected there on Thursday (today): I had a glimpse of him, of Monteagledom, and of Henry-Marshaldom, in a highly <pb id="pg-25-246" n="25:246"/>romantic Island residence of Keswick Lake, last Sunday (as indeed I think I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> you!)&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> T. Spedding and I rowed to a poor Dr Leitch, frightfully disfigured in face, but rational, hopeful, and overjoyed to see us. On the whole my Lake Excursion was decidedly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> worth the trouble it cost. Enough of it.</p>
<p>The ride hither was&#x2014;<foreign>Ach Gott!</foreign> Yet let me admit that it was far <hi rend="italic">within</hi> my anticipations; there being <hi rend="italic">room</hi> in the carriage, fresh air attainable in it: snatches of food, such as a hungry dog falls in with, were likewise vouchsafed. I noticed Brougham<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Brougham.</note> in the same vehicle, just behind my compartment; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> face grew redder and redder, poor old fellow;&#x2014;his cab I perceived went cheek by jowl with mine in the Piccadilly regions.</p>
<p>Poor Emma was duly awake, and did get me tea and even bacon to it; all things that she could do were faithfully done: a house clean as a new pin, and quiet, which was far the best feature of it for me. Nero, after an instant or two, manifested a most respectable degree of enthusiasm, to the length even of barking, and leaping very high; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> humour still continues with him. Poor wretch, I was really a little obliged to him. The cat sat reflective, without sign of the smallest emotion more or less;&#x2014;and poor Emma herself (a very amiable poor little creature, as you described) seemed sad at the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of being obliged to leave,&#x2014;which, however, I suppose you <hi rend="italic">find</hi> to be wise in respect of her. And the House&#x2014;O Goody, incomparable Artist Goody! It is really a &#x201C;series of glad surprises&#x201C;; and this noble <hi rend="italic">grate</hi> upstairs here:&#x2014;all good and best, my <foreign>bonny</foreign> little Artistkin! Really it is clever and wise to a degree: and I admit it is pity you were not here to show it me yourself; but I shall find it all out too. Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! I made no figure at sleeping last night, have accordingly a headache &#x26;c; but I shall do better tonight. <closer><salute>Write, write</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>I have put a lucifer to my bedroom fire, Dear, and sat down to write but I feel more disposed to lay my head on the table and cry.</salute> By this time I suppose <pb id="pg-25-247" n="25:247"/>you are at home&#x2014;returned after a two months absence&#x2014;arrived off a long journey&#x2014;and I not there, nobody there but a stranger servant, who will need to be told everything you want of her, and a mercy if she can do it even then! The <hi rend="italic">comfort</hi> which offers itself under this last innovation in our life together (for it is the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time in all the twenty years I have lived beside you that you ever arrived at home and I away) is the greatest part of the grievance for my irrational mind&#x2014;I am not <hi rend="italic">consoled</hi> but &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">aggravated</hi>&#x2019; by reflecting, that in point of fact you will prefer finding &#x201C;perfect solitude&#x201C; in your own house, and that if I were to do as nature prompts me to do, start off home by the next train, I should take more from your comfort on one side than I should add to it on another: Besides being considered <hi rend="italic">here</hi> as beyond measure ridiculous. Certainly this is the best school that the like of me was ever put to for getting cured of every particle of &#x201C;the finer sensibilities&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note></p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Henry Taylor was in London yesterday at &#x201C;Virginia Pattle&#x2019;s&#x201C; marriage<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Virginia Pattle m., <date when="1850-10-02">2 Oct.</date>, Charles Somers Cocks, styled Viscount Eastnor.</note> and saw my maid, on business of her own, and brought back word from her that you were coming last night&#x2014;and the shouts of laughter, and cutting &#x201C;wits&#x201C; with which my startled look and exclamation &#x201C;Oh gracious&#x201C;! were visited when the news was told me as we sat down to dinner were enough to terrify me from &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">showing feeling</hi>&#x201C; for twelvemonths to come&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Henry Taylor shan&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">snub</hi> me however&#x2014;I am quite as clever as her any day of the year and am bound to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> by no ties human or divine&#x2014;and so I showed her so plainly that I was displeased with her impertinent jesting at my expence that she made me an apology in the course of the evening.</p>
<p>And now what is to be done next? You say, stay where I am as if you were not&#x2014;easily said but not at all easily done&#x2014; It is quite out of the question my remaining here till the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014;the day Lady A has appointed for the term of my visit&#x2014;doing nothing&#x2014;and thinking of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at home with that inexperienced girl!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Who</hi> cares one doit for me here, that I should stay here; when you who still care a little for me&#x2014;more anyhow than any other person living does&#x2014;are again at home? and what good can &#x201C;ornament and grandeur&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450807-JWC-TC-01"><sic>19:135</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-08-07">7 Aug. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> and &#x201C;wits&#x201C; and &#x201C;the honour of the thing&#x201C; do to my health when &#x201C;my heart&#x2019;s in the Highland&#x2019;s my heart is not here&#x201C;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;My Heart&#x2019;s in the Highlands.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;Oh dear certainly not&#x2014; I shall keep to my original programme and come home after a fortnight, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will be next Wednesday when you will have had plenty of time to <hi rend="italic">subside</hi> from your jumbling, and will have exhausted all Emmas powers of cooking&#x2014;unless you are savage enough to <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> not to see my face till the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and honest enough to tell me so&#x2014;or unless you prefer to accept the invitation which Lady A is <pb id="pg-25-248" n="25:248"/>again writing to you to come here after you are rested&#x2014; You would be bored here just at present, with Henry Taylors solemn fatherhood, and the much talk and bother about the children&#x2014; But the Taylors depart sucking baby and all, on the eighth&#x2014;and after that I hear of no one coming but Thackeray and Brookfield, and Lady Montague,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Olivia Montagu.</note> George Bunsen and Colonel Rawlinson are coming but only for a day or two&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> Dear &#x201C;consult <hi rend="italic">your</hi> authentic wish&#x201C; whether you will join me here or have me back there&#x2014;which ever way of it you like best I shall like best&#x2014;upon my honour&#x2014; The only very good reason for my staying till the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, viz: to be &#x201C;another woman in the house&#x201C; as Lady A said, while men visitors are here in Lord A&#x2019;s absence is done away with by the fact of Lady Montagues coming and Miss Farrers being to stay till the 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x2014; by going next Wednesday I shall not put Lady A about then the least in the world&#x2014;at the same time&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> might be better here perhaps till the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> than in London&#x2014;as Lady A says you should have this bedroom which is quiet enough&#x2014;at least will be&#x2014;when the Taylor children have ceased to &#x201C;run horses&#x201C; over head, and shall have your dinner by yourself at what hour you please&#x2014; And so I will now go and try to walk off the headach I have got by&#x2014;&#x2014;what do you think?&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">crying</hi> actually!&#x2014;prosaic as this letter looks I have not somehow been able to &#x201C;dry myself up&#x201C; while writing it&#x2014; I suppose it is the <hi rend="italic">compress</hi> put on me in the drawingroom that makes me bubble up at no allowance when I am alone</p>

<p><salute>Don&#x2019;t &#x201C;cry,&#x201C; you foolish dear little Goody;</salute> there is no cause at all for crying! And the &#x201C;comfort&#x201C; you shall have in this matter (so soon as the Devil is got <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> away, which he shall by &#x2014;&#x2014;!) will be of a much more authentic sort than <pb id="pg-25-249" n="25:249"/>the one which now &#x201C;aggravates&#x201C; you: I shall know better than I ever did what the comfort to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> is of being received by you, when I arrive worn out, and you welcome me with your old smiles, and the light of a human fire and human home! Shall it not be so? I say it shall!</p>
<p>My own private most &#x201C;authentic wish&#x201C; is very clear to me, this morning, with this pile of letters, as it has in silence all along been. That you were here to wrap my sore skin and soul safe against injury of noise or kitchen-poison, and let me <hi rend="italic">stay</hi>, and sleep and rest till that Paris expedition come off (if it do come off, and I have gathered strength for it): that clearly, were I alone in this world, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be my authentic wish, and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be my realised resolution here and now, did it depend wholly on myself and my &#x201C;wishes.&#x201C; But on the the other hand, I suppose I disoblige Lady A., who certainly does not deserve that of me; you also I cut off from two weeks more of country, which is supposed to be doing you good;&#x2014;and to say truth, O Goody, I do not think even you, without incessant fret and bother, and slaving of yourself like a Cookmaid, could quite save me from this <foreign><hi rend="italic">Taupie</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whom it will be much better for us to <hi rend="italic">dismiss</hi> handsomely, according to your scheme, and replace <foreign><hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;m primum</hi></foreign> [as soon as possible] by somebody that <hi rend="italic">understands</hi> the work she is paid wages for. If you have such a one in view, delay not to secure her: if she can be ready ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the appointed &#x201C;20th,&#x201C; so much the better.</p>
<p>My present notion therefore is, You shall meet me at the Railway on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday next</hi>, and I will try The Grange again till your term is out. I mean to try if I can stipulate for a horse and <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> riding, from her Ladyship; if she knew how advantageous it is, no official of the stables w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prevent it! This I will try; and with nobody but Brookfield &#x26;c, and plenty of woods and downs around me, perhaps I too <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be able to repose myself there, and get better sleep than I have ever done since quitting home. Of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter requisite God knows I am in need enough. I know the room you have (<hi rend="italic">minus</hi> Taylorlets) is very quiet: is there not a side-room to it where I could lodge close by you, and so <hi rend="italic">save</hi> you from a flitting? This is my plan: Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> if that is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> &#x201C;authentic wish&#x201C;;&#x2014;otherwise, O foolish crying Goody, that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do (and bid me do) what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> your wish. And don&#x2019;t mind Mrs Henry,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Taylor.</note> or take any &#x201C;wits&#x201C; from her that you don&#x2019;t return with interest: I should think you might be trusted for the <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> of interest,&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">Chreosote</hi> incarnate, or spiritual &#x201C;Essence of Soot&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Satirical wit; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390818-JWC-TC-01"><sic>11:168</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1839-08-18">18 Aug. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; On Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> happily Taylordom will have quite struck its camp; from that extraordinary figure of human magnanimity Good Lord deliver me&#x2014;just now! Write then, if you want it so, or changed in any way; there is time in spite of Sunday.</p>
<p>I have had to write to Spedding &#x26;c: I have written to the <hi rend="italic">Washerwoman</hi> <pb id="pg-25-250" n="25:250"/>also (tho&#x2019; she is not indispensable); I have paid nearly all my money away to the Taxgatherers this morning,&#x2014;and need very much to do as I intended, Call on Chapman and make him come down! After a word to Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, who is still to answer, I am off for Chapman. And there is need of speed! Jack&#x2019;s letter of today, and what he says about my Mother, comforts me a good deal.</p>
<p>I have still made no hand of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, and feel accordingly. I went to bed last night with the best omens; was just falling over, when something,&#x2014;the fall of a plate of sheet-iron on some neighbouring floor? No, the kick of one of Chancellor&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Chancellor, stabler.</note> horses sounding ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> its stall thro&#x2019; the ambrosial night,&#x2014;struck me broad awake again; and it was long before I betho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me of the sorry cause: and I had a pill in me, and there was no bread discoverable; no &#x26;c &#x26;c: and so it was towards Two before, by the exertion of philosophy, I got into oblivion of my wearinesses. The House is like a china tea-tray for cleanness and perfection of arrang<hi rend="italic">t:</hi> but Oh, there is a want of Goody, at every turn such a want!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The poor maid does all that you promised for her; one of the most assiduous punctual creatures: but on the whole she is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Taupie</hi></foreign> (by circumstance if not by nature), and falls short within narrow limits accordingly. Till Wednesday she will, with watching and driving a little, do altogether well: but longer&#x2014;? She can sew, however, and I employ her so withal. She did me an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> mutton-chop yesterday (and I found <hi rend="italic">brandy</hi>); today she is trying her hand on chicken broth. This morning we made an experiment on <hi rend="italic">Coffee;</hi> but that shall be the last!&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Oh Goody, Goody; and don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">cry</hi> another tear; but write for Monday morning, and be good to me!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Why did you burn the four pages!</salute> Perhaps you might as well have sent me what the spirit dictated on the spur of the occasion; the deeper it came out of your heart (which cannot <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> anything that I should be displeased with), it would have more clearly pointed me out my path. O Goody, Goody dear! But one is master of one&#x2019;s own writing; and it is always a little in the case of John&#x2019;s medicine, &#x201C;You had better take it, or perhaps you had better leave it alone.&#x201C;</p>
<p>I will come by the Train you mention, one o&#x2019;clock precise from Waterloo-Bridge Station; and, if it please Heaven, I shall see my poor Goody again at <pb id="pg-25-253" n="25:253"/>Andover Road, soon after three! But you will have to write for Wednesday morning too; and can mention accurately what time a Cab takes from <hi rend="italic">this:</hi> I will attend to all your directions hitherto given, nay have already attended; but&#x2014;but, on Saturday as I went out towards the City and Chapmans Bank there, I perceived at the end of this street a Hansom, and in it Farie! Poor soul, is dull as ditchwater or duller, just come from the Watercure, to see his Brother off to Lisbon,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie and his brother Gilbert.</note> just returning to the Watercure, and capable of no speech but about that: and now today, not finding <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, he has written a Letter &#x201C;to be forwarded,&#x201C; speed, speed, all about the <hi rend="italic">Wahlverwandtschaften;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Elective Affinities</hi> (<date when="1809">1809</date>), a novel by Goethe; evidently his MS trans.; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501008-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1850-10-08">8 Oct.</date>]</ref>.</note> how the maid is to be taught to find it; how &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;how in short he may directly get it again,&#x2014;with my <hi rend="italic">blessing</hi> to it! I have sought in all places, especially on the top of the Bookshelves; but can see nothing of it. Tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> on Wednesday morning, and let that matter conclude itself with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Emma&#x2019;s help. Both the Spencer and claret-coloured gown (a reddish shade of d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x2014;I rejected one of Emma&#x2019;s offerings, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> with stripes, and not merino, and am sure I am right) have been sought out; and Emma is now <hi rend="italic">sleeving</hi>one of my waistcoats: so that I fear nothing from cold. You have the brown &#x201C;rug&#x201C; with you, I suppose;&#x2014;so that I shall bring a plaid. Lady A. promises a horse (on which topic I fear I was almost rude): and so, in all respects, we must do the best we can!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am really happy the solemn &#x201C;Spirit of Love&#x201C; is gone, or going before me. In my present humour such a phenomenon is dreadful. The advent of Thackeray, alighting like a big dangerous Condor upon that <foreign><hi rend="italic">Coq d&#x2019;Inde</hi></foreign> [turkey cock] among his hens, and revolutionising all the barnyard, is a thing worthy of memory! More power to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> elbow. Kinglake is an acquisition; Brookfield, Rawlinson &#x26;c will do; and the Bishop&#x2019;s dinner is over;&#x2014;and, on the whole, will not my own poor Goody meet me with welcome the day after tomorrow!</p>
<p>Last night was my first good sleep; my vile railway headache is not gone till now. Thanks to <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> and blue-pill withal:&#x2014;poor Emma administered even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to me, tolerably well, by dint of instruction;&#x2014;and I sat in the house, and strode across the Sunday Park, in profound silence; called only at Darwin&#x2019;s finding his street all in straw, his window-blinds down, and not even a servant in. Rain was evidently brewing itself as I came home Rain fell all night; and today there is sun and blustery wind. &#x201C;Mutton-chops&#x201C; for dinner today; d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> tomorrow; the poor creature does them really well,&#x2014;yet I am right glad to hear of an <hi rend="italic">experienced</hi> servant: a novice is terrible to handle, especially to the like of me! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest; God bless thee /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your hospitable word: had it hit me on my road southward, it would have been very tempting; a <hi rend="italic">place to lie down in</hi> was much a want with me during that bewildering process! But I was safe here two days before it reached me.</p>
<p>My Wife is in Hampshire, whither I go to join her for some ten days; there is then, after a week or so, some talk (uncertain as yet) of the great people taking me to Paris for a fortnight; and then&#x2014;then surely I must try to collect my scattered limbs again, in this den of smoke, and see if there is no more work possible for me in the world!</p>
<p>Commend me much to the goodwill of Mrs Forster;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane.</note> to whom and to you all that is <hi rend="italic">best</hi> be granted in your new relation.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Coniston Letter safe, then the Scotsbrig one, announcing my Mother&#x2019;s and your arrival;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1850-10-04">4 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;[O]ur mother &#x2026; came from Dumfries yesterday in James Aitken&#x2019;s gig, &#x26; had a very pleasant quiet drive the whole way.&#x201C;</note> so that I suppose there has been nothing lost; and I write to you with the account straight. I have not much time; but you shall get duly a part off the very beginning of it.</p>
<p>Do not neglect to tell my Mother one small particular, which was interesting to me on my railway journey. She gave me one day some &#x201C;peppermint-drops&#x201C; to chew on the road to Dumfries: I had not meddled with them that <pb id="pg-25-255" n="25:255"/>day nor afterwards; but they were still sticking in my waistcoat pocket, and I took them successively in that huge long-continued clangour of locomotive machinery (fit for nothing but iron or dead substances to travel in),&#x2014;ate the last of them between Camden Town and Euston Square,&#x2014;with real benefit, and you may suppose with many a kind and beautiful tho&#x2019; sad reflexion, as we roared along! Tell her this.&#x2014; In Express Train travelling, I do think it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be suitable to take provisions both of food and water with one; the rest might then prove manageable; and one w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a shade less miserable!</p>
<p>I am now pretty well got out of my railway sufferings, yet only just now; for last night (after <hi rend="italic">Castor</hi> &#x26;c!) is the first truly good sleep I have had; and a dirty headache had attended me all along till then. I have been as silent as a mouse; generally passing day and night perfectly alone,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; one or two curious observers have discovered me. But the poor servant here is a very feckless creature; inadequate to feed or tend one with any perfection in such cases;&#x2014;of a morning especially I am painfully reminded of Isabella&#x2019;s Coffee;&#x2014;this has kept me back a little But I am otherwise greatly mended by my silence; and indeed have nothing to complain of now. It is settled that we are to have a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> servant, one experienced in her work, of whom Jane knows, directly on her return,&#x2014;her return which is also to be <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, as you will hear.</p>
<p>For it has been arranged that I am to be off again to The Grange on Wednesday,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Mon.</note> to join Jane there, and bring her home on the &#x201C;20th,&#x201C; which was her natural term. She &#x201C;cries&#x201C; (about the ill-attendance on me), frets herself to fiddlestrings, they report; <hi rend="italic">was</hi> getting great good of the country, but must come home directly if I will not come:&#x2014;in short, I have found it quite uncivil not to say I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come; and so I am off on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> again, and she meets me with a carriage at the Andover Road Station. There has been talk farther of a fortnight excursion with the Ashburtons to Paris,&#x2014;talk this long while, which must either turn<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This part of NLS 524.91 ends here.</note> <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi> or else <hi rend="italic">No</hi> &#x201C;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the end of <date when="1850-10">October</date>&#x201C;: in some respects I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like it very well, in others decidedly ill; and so it hangs uncertain yet, depending on my &#x201C;health,&#x201C; as it has all along done.</p>
<p>Helps&#x2019;s wife had seen me on the street; Helps has found me out here:&#x2014;so has Craik, this morning about 10 O&#x2019;clock; and has sold me an <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> (&#x201C;75 voll. in Russia,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., Russian leather.</note>&#x2014;unseen) for &#xa3;8, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have paid! Poor Craik, he is just on the wing for Belfast; and seems to be in a variety of confusions, tho&#x2019; cheery and thick of skin for fronting them.&#x2014; Nay on Saturday, as I stept forth to walk, there came to pass&#x2014;Farie! Farie was in a cab, to see Jane,&#x2014;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Wahlverwand</hi>n (with a <foreign>murrian</foreign> to it<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC seems to mean &#x201C;<foreign>murrain</foreign> [plague] on it,&#x201C; being impatient with Farie; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501007-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1850-10-07">7 Oct.</date></ref></note>), concerning wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he has <hi rend="italic">written</hi> <pb id="pg-25-256" n="25:256"/>today;&#x2014;come from the Watercure &#x201C;to see his Brother off to Lisbon,&#x201C; and just ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> returning to the Watercure;&#x2014;dull as ever, to a degree! None other but Chapman and the Banker&#x2019;s Clerk (brief words to each) have I spoken to here. And so enough in all conscience about myself and my affairs here.</p>
<p>Poor Leitch sent me an enthusiastic Note, the morning I left Keswick,&#x2014;partly aimed at Alfred Tennyson too, to whom I sent it on Saturday with an explanatory word.&#x2014; I fear there is little question but you have decided <hi rend="italic">right</hi> about the Dentist; but it strikes me some new arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of my Mother&#x2019;s way of life,&#x2014;some <hi rend="italic">house</hi> for Jenny and her, and for yourself if you tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 518.77 ends here; the rest is at the beginning of 524.91.</note> living mainly thereabouts, and for me too on occasion,&#x2014;is fast becoming very desirable?

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I am here, alone, since Wednesday Night; you may perhaps have heard of my movements: how I went to Cumberland, but found no continuance there; then on into Westmoreland (with my Cumberland hosts), but found ditto ditto, in a still stronger degree; and so, at last, saw myself constrained to &#x201C;sling my kit,&#x201C; and get away home, to see if there were any quiet and comfort attainable in the solitude there. My railway ride was not so bad as many have been; and I arrived accordingly. Alas, the little maid that waits on me here is full of &#x201C;inexperience,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; a fine little creature otherwise; so that unmixed good was not attainable here either; nay, what was worse, Jane knew too well all the shortcomings of this handmaid (having indeed already provided a <hi rend="italic">successor</hi> for her, properly <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to her work); Jane took on, and made herself miserable on my account, and got no good of her country advantages where she is: so, in fine, it has been arranged that I am to go and join her there, for the next 12 days;&#x2014;and accordingly tomorrow I am off, on the tramp once more, happily only a journey of 2 hours by rail; and am to meet the poor Dame tomorrow about 3 o&#x2019;clock. That is my history up to this date. In spite of all evils, I feel plainly strengthened by my country operations: the 12 days more of it, I hope, will not throw me back, but advance me.&#x2014; I heard too how James took my mother down to Scotsbrig; I have regularly heard of all things: no <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi> for poor Mother, ah me!&#x2014; &#x2014; My haste <pb id="pg-25-257" n="25:257"/>just now is extreme: but if you write within 12 days, the address is, The Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s / The Grange / Alresford / Hants /: tell Jenny about these things also;&#x2014;and thanks many for the patience and kindness you shewed to me. <closer><salute>God bless you all. Your ever affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was extremely grieved yesterday morning to find in my pocket, just while I was in the agonies of starting hitherward, a Letter I had written to you <hi rend="italic">two days</hi> before, and fancied I had duly posted along with the bunch of others then sent off! Alas, alas, and I had not a moment&#x2019;s time left me; hardly enough to scribble some German on the cover, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly understand.</p>
<p>Well, I got here at any rate, prosperously, tho&#x2019; after an awful flurry just at starting, the silly maid having taken 35 minutes to find me a cab instead of 20 which I had given her. We were <hi rend="italic">within</hi> 4 minutes of losing it, for all our swift driving. I found Jane looking thin,&#x2014;poor soul she has been terribly bothered since I went away;&#x2014;however, she seems doing well at present, and is cheerfuller than I have seen her this long while. I myself slept ill last night, in spite of the excellent bed and room (one of the quietest I was ever in); but indeed I expected to sleep ill: and tonight, if I can manage my <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi>, I hope to do <pb id="pg-25-259" n="25:259"/>better and <hi rend="italic">well.</hi> For I am this moment returned from a 3 hours ride, on a most swift nimble horse of Lord A.&#x2019;s, which I used to call the Kangaroo;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460408-TC-JWC-01"><sic>20:164</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1846-04-08">8 April 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> a really beautiful ride (in the brill<hi rend="italic">t</hi> afternoon and silent woods and lanes); I have to write &#x201C;like distraction&#x201C; to save the post, Jane sits by me the while.&#x2014; &#x2014; We are a shifting party, Thackeray and Rawlinson (Bagdad) went today; a nice little Frenchwoman (Mrs Craven)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pauline Marie Armande Agla&#xE9;, m. to the diplomat Augustus Craven.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>One cannot always get done with people by simply giving over going to see them, or otherwise testifying recollection of their existence&#x2014; You have &#x201C;turned a cold shoulder&#x201C; to me this long while (as Robertson accused &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the world</hi>&#x2019; of doing to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> after the affair of Camilla Toulman)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Camilla Dufour Toulmin and John Robertson. Above &#x201C;Robertson&#x201C; TC wrote &#x201C;John the tumultuous&#x201C; and corrected &#x201C;Toulman&#x201C; to &#x201C;Toulmin.&#x201C; For Robertson&#x2019;s affairs with Jewsbury and an unidentified woman, see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450405-JWC-JW-01"><sic>19:49</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1845-04-05">5 April 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> but that makes no difference in the temperature of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> shoulder towards <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, nor in my faith in your good nature&#x2014;</p>
<p>Without the least hesitation then I comply with the request of my friend Miss B&#xF6;lte to forward the inclosed to &#x2018;the Editor of the Examiner.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1850-10-19">19 Oct.</date>, printed an &#x201C;extract from a private letter of a nobleman of Transylvania to a friend residing in England [that] will be read with deep sympathy. The writer is Colonel Count G. Bethlen, formerly commander of the cavalry in Transylvania.&#x201C; The extract concerned the last words of Gen. Count Karl August von Leiningen, condemned to death by Gen. Julius Jacob Haynau: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I recommend Haynau not to venture on a visit to England, for the people will stone him.</hi>&#x201C;.</note>&#x2014;It may be that it is quite out of rule to insert such things as a matter of favour&#x2014;and in <pb id="pg-25-260" n="25:260"/>that case The Editor of the Examiner has nothing to do but light his cigar with the document, if however he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> insert this notice in the course of nature, it would be doing a favour to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;as I am interested in &#x201C;The German Lady&#x201C; and indebted to her for many little kindnesses</p>
<p>I have been here, with Lady Ashburton for the last three weeks, recovering from the melancholy effects of a dreary solitary house-cleaning-six weeks at Cheyne Row&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C came back from the North ten days ago and has joined me here&#x2014; On Saturday next we return to London&#x2014;so that you need not pretend to be ignorant of our whereabouts</p>
<p>We have had Thackeray here&#x2014;and today Brookfield and Kinglake are coming<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Wynn wrote to Jane Octavia Brookfield, W. H. Brookfield&#x2019;s wife: &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle writes that Mr. Brookfield is going to the Grange on the 15th, and many other pleasant ones are now there. How that woman does contrive to skim the cream off for her parties; one wonders what she does with relations and duty people which usually so entirely swamp a country house. Mrs. C. is evidently a little overturned by the different life she is now leading which is very funny, as I did not fancy she could be influenced in the slightest degree by it. The change from dulness to talent is certainly bewildering, and makes one blink like an owl in the sun, but in her case she has far more <hi rend="italic">esprit</hi> in her own home than she is likely to find at Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s.&#x201C; Brookfield wrote to his wife, <date when="1850-10-16">16 Oct.</date>, from the Grange: &#x201C;Got here all right at six thirty yesterday evening. Was ushered at once to the Salon where &#x2026; sate Madam, Miss Farrar, Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle, and Kinglake; and we forthwith fell to chattering without much of the creaking of new acquaintanceship. &#x2026; I walked this morning with Lady A. &#x2026; After lunch had a drive with her, the Carlyles, and Farrar&#x201C; (Charles and Frances Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Mrs. Brookfield and Her Circle</hi> [New York, <date when="1905">1905</date>] 2:322&#x2013;23).</note></p>

<p><salute>Well, my Dear, sure enough you are wanted here whenever you can come;</salute> but it is certain also that you have again decided right. I can stand these tepid <hi rend="italic">ploasters</hi> for an indefinite period of time; and to run away in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> present circumstances was a thing not to be thought of for a moment. Stay till Lady A. is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> nervous about your going away, however long that may be. And let us hope withal it will be tomorrow! And if you have the grace to write me another line, saying by what train, I will duly be in waiting (with or without Nero):&#x2014;however, you will have no difficulty without the help which otherwise I should like to give.&#x2014; To say truth Miss Farrar did not expect you on Monday, nor did I quite certainly: I am accordingly to leave word at Miss F.&#x2019;s as I pass today. And tell her Ladyship that I am content to have tepid food another day for her sake,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I hope, not!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-262" n="25:262"/>Emma demands only &#x201C;5/&#x201C; to account; which she shall have, and then go. Nor will I call in B&#xF6;lte; the affair can transact <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> this evening; and if I miss Darwin, I have chophouses in store. And may the gods deliver me henceforth from imbecil housemaids, when I am out of sorts and off a railway; and give me Goody to take charge of my poor existence in that case! After all, I slept <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night; and feel a great deal better than I did yesterday. I have also read a good mass of <hi rend="italic">Sophocles</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date>496 <!-- <sCap>b.c.</sCap> --></date>?&#x2013;<date>406 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Greek tragic poet.</note> and sorted (with toil enough) my new Edinburgh Box of Pipes:&#x2014;that, besides existing, is nearly the sum of my history.

<p>Besides Nero, who barked and leapt to a great extent at sight of me, I have had two visitors, not to mention B&#xF6;lte,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now employed as a trans. and researcher in the home of William Henry Smyth<sic>e</sic> (<date when="1788">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865">1865</date>; <ref target="volume-25/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25961"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), admiral and scientific writer, 3 Cheyne Walk. She wrote Varnhagen, <date when="1850-10-20">20 Oct.</date>, mistakenly, that both Carlyles had returned home &#x201C;yesterday&#x201C; from the Grange, where they enjoyed &#x201C;a very lively society&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 84, trans.).</note> who came no further than the lobby. Yesterday&#x2019;s visitor,&#x2014;as I sat answering some new &#x201C;Cromwell matter&#x201C; to Frewen, and had nearly finished,&#x2014;was the little Irish Mephistophiles, called Marshall from Weimar!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Marshall.</note> Poor little soul,&#x2014;he was overjoyed to see me; looks uglier than ever (being just out of a Dutch Steamer); is here about Pictures for his Duke, goes on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning; will call here tomorrow in hopes of seeing Mrs Carlyle withal. I had to walk him out, as far as Hyde Park, before he would go; afterwards I found no Darwin, and came slowly and desolately home to my <hi rend="italic">Sophocles</hi> and chop.&#x2014; Visitor second, just gone after an hour&#x2019;s talk, was A. Sterling; very fat and grim, with flowers, two candlesticks, and a Talbotype Portrait of himself,&#x2014;value five shillings, he says.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Photography had recently become his hobby; see K.

The step, however, taking in young Edward&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Coningham Sterling.</note> interests, I decidedly think will be wise. Of Mrs Sterling I heard nothing. At Paris A. has nothing at all to <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> solely some &#x201C;John (?)

<p>This letter from &#x201C;Kirkaldy&#x201C; will perhaps tell one something about John Fergus; but probably it is only some blush of Jessy&#x2019;s, therefore (being in great haste too) I do not open it.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Goody mine; come safe tomorrow, and take the helm in hand again.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Your letter and Pamphlets have duly reached me; for which accept my acknowledgments. The style both of what you write and of what you have spoken invites a considerate perusal; and such accordingly you have had from me. If it were in my power to forward, in the way you mention, what I find to be right and essentially just in your endeavours, surely I should not neglect it. But that, I must add, is little likely, in the present state of our affairs, as of yours! Our &#x2018;New Downing Street,&#x2019; as the present omens indicate, is still at a great distance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, dark as we are in regard to all details, I think you rather exaggerate to yourself our ignorance as to your essential position in that big controversy. I find it a settled conviction among rational Englishmen, which they frequently express in a careless way, that the Southern States must ultimately feel driven to separate themselves from the Northern; in which result there is not felt here to be anything treasonous or otherwise horrible; our grand short-coming is that we regard the matter as one in which <hi rend="italic">we</hi> have no concern, or a much smaller one than the fact might indicate if we would look at it;&#x2014;that, in short, the <hi rend="italic">rational</hi> class, on this as on some other subjects, is at present a dull and luke-warm one; and that, Exeter Hall having all the talk to itself, a windy foolish and otherwise inconsiderable <hi rend="italic">minority</hi> (for such I really take it to be, even by a count of Heads, if you insisted on having any degree of sense in them) usurps the name and figure of England in treating of this matter. Perhaps now at last the dumb sense of the Country does begin to stir, and growl a kind of inarticulate contradiction to the Platforms; but I foresee it will be a long time, such is the complicated depth of this Emancipation <pb id="pg-25-264" n="25:264"/>Question, and such the general numb bewilderment of men&#x2019;s minds, before the wise result be insisted on with emphasis, and get the majority in its favour.</p>
<p>For you and other men of sense and manfulness of spirit, who stand in the very coil of Negro complications, and feel practically that you must retain command of your servants, or else quit your place and task in the world, I find it altogether natural that you should in silence resolve to front all extremities rather than yield to an extrinsic demand of that nature, however big-voiced and pretentious it became: in which quarrel, too, what can I say, except &#x2018;God stand by the <hi rend="italic">right</hi>,&#x2019; which I clearly perceive you in part are!</p>
<p>But, alas, the question is deep as the foundations of society; and will not be settled this long while! For the cry about Emancipation, so well pleased with itself on Humanity Platforms, is but the key-note of that huge anarchic roar now rising from all nations, for good reasons too,&#x2014;which tends to abolish all mastership and obedience whatsoever in this world, and to render <hi rend="italic">Society</hi> impossible among the Sons of Adam! And I doubt we have hardly got to the crisis of that yet,&#x2014;at least among speakers in England I find myself in a painful minority of one in regard to it;&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the crisis, when the minority shall have even become considerable, I feel too well what a task will lie ahead of them! It is truly time that each brave man consulted solemnly his own most religious oracles on the subject, and stood piously prepared to do whatever God&#x2019;s mandate he felt to be laid on him in regard to it.</p>
<p>Give me leave, in my dim light, but in my real sympathy with your affairs, to hint another thought I have. It is that this clamour from your &#x2018;Exeter Hall&#x2019; and ours, which few persons can regard with less reverence than I, was nevertheless a thing <hi rend="italic">necessary.</hi> My notion is that the relation of the White man to the Black is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at present a just one according to the Law of the Eternal; and tho&#x2019; &#x2018;Abolition&#x2019; is by no means the way to remedy it, and would be a &#x2018;remedy&#x2019; equivalent to killing it (as I believe), yet, beyond all question, remedied it must be; and peace upon it is not possible till a remedy be found, and begin to be visibly applied. &#x2018;A servant hired <hi rend="italic">for life</hi>, instead of by the day or month&#x2019;: I have often wondered that wise and just men in your region (of whom I believe there are many) had not come upon a great many methods, or at least some methods better than those yet in use, of justly enunciating this relation, and relieving such asperities of it as become intolerable. Have you, for example, a law by which a Negro, on producing a certain sum of money possible for the thrift and foresight of a superior Negro, can <hi rend="italic">demand</hi> his Freedom?&#x2014; I could conceive many other laws, and Practices not quite in use at present; but am at the bottom of my paper, and must end. I shall say only, the Negro Question will be left in peace, when God Almighty&#x2019;s law about it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> (with tolerable approximation) actually found out and practised; and never <pb id="pg-25-265" n="25:265"/>till then. Might this also be a word to the wise!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tucker passed TC&#x2019;s letter on to James Henry Hammond (<date when="1807">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864">64</date>), South Carolina politician and strong advocate of states&#x2019; rights, &#x201C;as a sort of cordial to grave heartedness&#x201C; (quoted W.

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>I have now been at home a whole week, yesternight I got the Doctor&#x2019;s Letter telling me about Scotsbrig and you:&#x2014;today, in spite of my repugnance to writing, I surely ought to send you a word, and will! I have meant to do it almost every day this week; but my indolent unfitness for any kind of exertion has hindered me; my sole wish has been and is &#x201C;to go <foreign><hi rend="italic">dawnering</hi></foreign> about, and altogether hold my tongue.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Of The Grange I did not much benefit or hurt; the <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> there are eminently unwholesome to me (dinner between 7 and 8 &#x26;c); otherwise I should have done very well: I rode daily, for most part quite alone, a beautiful swift horse, for two or sometimes three hours, among thick woody avenues or far and wide over the country, a sad yet pleasant occupation; which was the main event each day. Our company went and came, never three days the same, and was at no time very interesting to me: this day week, we two with a young lady, Miss Farrar whom John knows, were the last of the party and had been appointed to go: go two of us did accordingly; but on the morning in question Lady Ashburton had fallen unwell and requested Jane to stay behind for a little, which accordingly she did, and I had to escort Miss Farrar without her; and it was Tuesday afternoon before Jane joined me: a welcome sight, the incompetent <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluistering</hi></foreign> servant maids not being at all fit for my management! We have now got that all happily settled, I do hope; and a really good, serviceable and cheerful lass, who understands her work, has taken possession of the gang,&#x2014;long may she keep it; for these changes are quite hateful to <pb id="pg-25-266" n="25:266"/>me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote to JWC, [<date when="1850-10-22">22 Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;I felt a grim satisfaction in thinking that Mr. Carlyle would have to be an uncomplaining victim, and go back alone and face his household destiny as best he might. He would feel the want of you without having the satisfaction of fancying himself ill-used. &#x2026; I hope her Ladyship will keep her cold a little while, and keep you along with it&#x201C; (Ireland 371).</note> In the meanwhile, however, I had taken a dirty little feverish cold, which has not yet entirely departed but keeps me dispirited and uncomfortable; and poor Jane, the next day after her arrival, was nailed down with one of the worst headaches I have seen her have for six months past. That too, however, is now over; and my cold also is evidently going; and so, if I can steadily sit quiet, we shall get thro&#x2019; into tolerably clear water again before long. Indeed the water, I ought to say, is already &#x201C;clear,&#x201C; such a comfort is it to have people with <hi rend="italic">hands</hi> about one in the house, and no charge except of one&#x2019;s own discontented self, which is now my case&#x2014; It appears to be settled that I am to visit Paris, along with the Ashburtons, for a ten days, early in next month.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote to JWC, [<date when="1850-10-22">22 Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;As to Paris and Mr. Carlyle, you would have no comfort in that arrangement&#x2014;going in that company, you would be worried and tantalised to death.&#x201C; She begged her instead to come to Manchester, adding in her next letter, [<date when="1850-10-29">29 Oct.</date>], &#x201C;I think of you a great deal, and I am still hoping to see you arrive down here&#x201C; (Ireland 371, 375).</note> I confess I have small or no heart to the enterprise; little or nothing in Paris I much care to see: and if I am not in better case than hitherto, I shall not go at all: at the same time it seemed stingy and cowardly not to take advantage of so handsome an offer, but reject it absolutely; and so, in the end, it seems likely I shall go for the little while. A. Sterling is off there just now;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It may have been Anthony Sterling that Jewsbury asked after, [<date when="1850-10-29">29 Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;How is &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;? I am very sorry for him, and yet his feeling for you is like a heavy piece of ordnance, with which he intends to blockade you &#x2026; . Upon my honour, I am frightened when I recollect him. It is his military instinct which makes him &#x2018;manoeuvre&#x2019; his love, as if it were a detachment of heavy cavalry. Do write me one line to tell me how you are, which is all the news I care to know&#x201C; (Ireland 377).</note> people go in 11 hours, the short sail included; and seem to think nothing of it at all.</p>
<p>Various people have been here: Darwin with the Wedgwoods, Farie, Helps, and a big Irishman called Carleton<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Carleton.</note> (whom John may have heard of as a Tale-writer); Masson also, and Chorley: but, alas, alas, nobody comes whose talk is half so good to me as silence; I fly out of the way of everybody, and would much rather smoke a pipe of wholesome tobacco than talk to any one in London just now! Nay their talk is often rather an offence to me; and I murmur to myself, &#x201C;Why open one&#x2019;s lips for <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a purpose?&#x201C; In fact I am not <foreign><hi rend="italic">stiddered</hi></foreign> here yet, and above all must get rid of my cold.</p>
<p>Dear Mother, I need not say how sorry I was to learn your disappointment about the Dentist. I shall not soon forget that day I had at Scotsbrig after you <pb id="pg-25-267" n="25:267"/>went away; and the days that followed till I got up hither again! I know how quietly you would take the disappointment, and &#x201C;study,&#x201C; as a great Authority bids us, &#x201C;therewith to be <hi rend="italic">content</hi>&#x201C;:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Phil. 4:11 and 1 Tim. 6:8.</note> but I had confidently hoped it, and cannot yet help regretting about it.&#x2014; John tells me you are moderately well, considering the bad weather: Oh take care of yourself;&#x2014;and tell him to write me another short word soon.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane and I were speaking about the Scotsbrig butter &#x26;c this morning; but there was nothing settled; and now she is gone out: so it must lie till next time. We have a big keg of <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> butter still, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think is hardly so good as Isabella&#x2019;s. It shall be settled soon. Poor Mary must take care of herself! Especially at this time the weather is eminently bad for us all. My grateful regards to Jamie &#x26; Isabella. Bid the Doctor write. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother. Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is now a good many weeks that I have been your debtor for a Book, which in various senses was very welcome to me. <hi rend="italic">Alton Locke</hi> arrived in Annandale, by post, from my Wife, early in <date when="1850-09">September</date>; and was swiftly read by me, under the bright sunshine, by the sound of rushing brooks and other rural accompaniments: I believe the Book is still doing duty in those parts; for I had to leave it behind me on loan, to satisfy the public demand. Forgive me that I have not, even by a word, thanked you for this favour. Continual shifting and moving ever since, not under the best omens, has hindered me from writing almost on any subject or to any person.</p>
<p>Apart from your treatment of my own poor self, on which subject let me not venture to speak at all, I found plenty to like and be grateful for in the Book. Abundance, nay exuberance of generous zeal, headlong impetuosity of determination towards the manful side on all manner of questions; snatches of excellent poetic description, occasional sunbursts of noble insight; everywhere a certain wild intensity, which holds the reader fast as by a spell: these surely are good qualities, and pregnant omens, in a man of your seniority in the regiment! At the same time, I am to say, the Book is definable as <hi rend="italic">crude</hi>, by no manner of means the best we expect of you,&#x2014;if you will resolutely temper your fire. But to make the malt sweet, the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> should and must be slow: so <pb id="pg-25-268" n="25:268"/>says the Proverb;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Butler, <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi> 1.3.1251&#x2013;54; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240322-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:52</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-03-22">22 March 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> and now, as before, I include all duties for you under that one!&#x2014; Saunders Mackaye, my invaluable countryman in this Book, is nearly perfect: indeed I greatly wonder how you did contrive to manage him; his very dialect is as if a native had done it, and the whole existence of the rugged old hero is a wonderfully splendid and coherent piece of Scotch bravura.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He is extremely Carlylean and given to citing &#x201C;Maister Tummas.&#x201C; Kingsley had admired TC for years, thinking that his writings did not &#x201C;lead to gloomy discontent &#x2026; but a bright view of life,&#x201C; which seemed darker only because he found &#x201C;fault in tangible original language&#x201C; and deemed the usual church sermon boringly conventional (<hi rend="italic">Charles Kingsley</hi> 1:119).</note> In both of your women, too, I find some grand poetic features; but neither of them is worked out into the Daughter of the Sun she might have been;&#x2014;indeed nothing is worked out anywhere in comparison with Saunders; and the impression is, of a fervid creation still left half-chaotic. That is my literary verdict, both the black of it and the white.</p>
<p>Of the grand social and moral questions we will say nothing whatever at present: any time within the next two centuries, it is like, there will be enough to say about them! On the whole you will have to persist; like a cannon-ball that is shot, you will have to go to your mark whatever that be.&#x2014; I stipulate farther that you come and see me when you are at Chelsea; and that you pay no attention at all to the foolish clamour of reviewers, whether laudatory or condemnatory.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude says that he remembered &#x201C;the gratification with which Kingsley showed me his approving criticism; and it speaks volumes for the merit of the book that at such a time Carlyle could take pleasure in it. Little did either of us then guess in what a depth of depression it had found him. The cloud lifted after a while; but these fits when they came were entirely disabling. Robust constitutional strength, which is half of it insensibility, was not among the gifts which Nature had bestowed on Carlyle. His strength was moral&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:57&#x2013;58).</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you, at this late date, accept my hearty acknowledgements for that <hi rend="italic">Second Volume</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs &#x2026; of Thomas Chalmers</hi>.</note> your kind Gift to me; which was received with a welcome far out of proportion to this apparent negligence. The Book reached me in Annandale, where I was at the time of its appearance; I read it there with deliberate pleasure, under the silent <date when="--09">September</date> sunshine, generally with <pb id="pg-25-269" n="25:269"/>nothing but the sky over my head. I had to leave it (not yet recovered) in those parts, to my Mother and a wide circle of interested readers: ever since, I have been wandering to and fro, abhorrent of pen and ink; and do not till now acquit myself of a very simple and pleasant duty, not to speak of others that were less so in that kind!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This Second Volume seemed to me decidedly more attractive reading than the First: the narrative acquires greater compactness; the scene is more populous, stirring,&#x2014;perhaps too an active influence was, I myself had occasionally been a spectator of the things recorded. All is right skilfully managed; few Books of modern Biography half or tenth-part as well! A cheerful candid temper, the perpetual exercise of ingenuity and insight, perfects the smoothness of the Picture; and amid the multifarious details, now in full light now in <hi rend="italic">chiaroscuro</hi>, the Image of the Man comes out more and more recogniseable, as each new feature is added to it. A Third Volume, which perhaps will be as difficult as either of the others, will well complete our panorama of a Life-history, on this scale you have adopted. About the size of the <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> I occasionally hear some difference of opinion; one desiring a smaller, still <hi rend="italic">more</hi> condensed scale of narrative; another urging that the scale in such cases is usually exorbitantly <hi rend="italic">bigger:</hi> but about the <hi rend="italic">Likeness</hi> there can only be one opinion among judges; and that surely is the grand and indispensable, and one essential merit of the Painter.</p>
<p>For my own sake and that of many readers,&#x2014;to say nothing of the poor Writer&#x2019;s sake, who may perhaps have his own wishes in it, too!&#x2014;I heartily wish you had done with your Third Volume, in the same honourable fashion. <closer><salute>And so with many thanks and regards, I remain always,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>So Paris is over, then!</salute> I have sat silent as a stone in a kind of strange anticipation of it; and it too is away for the present. Well, well; who knows that it is not, in this world, &#x201C;just as well&#x201C;! Perhaps the time may come for breaking silence there or elsewhere; perhaps also never. Some things are known and sure to me without speaking; and I think, to you also. Thanks evermore for your continual goodness to me; and may Heaven grant that I make a wise and manful use of this great possession! I really ask for nothing more.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is full of troubles again, about &#x201C;Help&#x201C; as the Yankees phrase it. <pb id="pg-25-270" n="25:270"/>Our new maid, a promising good creature, of Irish breed, proves entirely broken in health,&#x2014;unable to eat a morsel of food;&#x2014;and so, after a fortnight, all we can do with or for the poor soul, is to get her a place in the Middlesex Hospital: thither she is now wending; and her mistress is out on the great Deep, trying to catch another fish, who again will last but for a short space. I really think, since one <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get rational little Niggers (the Hindoo breed, I should prefer), or other <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> domestic really helpful to one, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be well to have done with this mockery of &#x201C;service,&#x201C;&#x2014;for such it really is, in all spheres of life at present. How the New Era will adjust itself on these new terms remains to be seen!&#x2014;</p>
<p>All this while I have been doing literally <hi rend="italic">Nothing:</hi> idle reading (chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi>, old N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of it, which I recommend to you also, on occasion), idle musing, a vigorous &#x201C;consumption of my own smoke,&#x201C; and for the rest <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> as much as possible, have been my occupation since I left your woods. There must something else come out of me by and by; but over that rest clouds. I feel myself sometimes, with almost a kind of terror, the most utterly lonely man I ever read of in these ages. The wild roar of Sophocles&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Philoctetes</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek myth Philoctetes had an invincible bow with arrows, but suffered a foul-smelling infection from a serpent&#x2019;s bite. Though the story was treated by Aeschylus and Euripides, only Sophocles&#x2019; tragedy survives.</note> (which also I have been reading) seems to me the dialect I could a little express myself in: but it is better not.

<p>Kinglake came to us one night; Darwin also was there. I like Kinglake, even him, as compared with the grinning inanity of most men&#x2019;s &#x201C;conversation&#x201C; to me: a hard man, but always means something by what he says;&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">feline</hi> element in him too, I fear:&#x2014;but even a genuine <foreign><hi rend="italic">felis</hi></foreign> [cat] is something!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinglake felt that TC had &#x201C;great graphic power but was essentially a humourist; a man who, with those he could trust, never pretended to be in earnest. &#x2026; So far from being a plain prophet he is a loud Scotch joker, and knows himself to be a wind-bag&#x201C; (W.

<p><salute>Alas, my dear Cousins,</salute> my hostile star is still in the ascendant! and hardly anything short of a strong impulse of <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> affection could prevail on me to write <hi rend="italic">a letter</hi> just now<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau wrote to Frances Wedgwood, [<date when="1850-11">? Nov.</date>], to &#x201C;carry on one bit of our <hi rend="italic">confidence</hi> of this time twelvemonth&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491110-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>24:283</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1849-11-10">10 Nov. 1849</date></corr></ref>). She had received from JWC &#x201C;an extraordinary letter, which I think it due to myself, and to her, to tell you of,&#x2014;as I should certainly show it you, if you were here. She pours out such a quantity of woe as it sickens me to think of:&#x2014;says she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write &#x2018;as of old,&#x2019; and does so. She assigns no cause for her misery, but calls it her &#x2018;inveterate <foreign>malheur</foreign>,&#x2019; and beseeches me to tell her how to be happier. It is true, she goes off into a burlesque account of bad servants: but the greater part of the letter is serious enough: and the wretchedness must be real enough to make her thus confess herself to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, after all that is come and gone. <hi rend="italic">What</hi> is it? and what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> she? In answering, I have done a rather rash thing; but I believe I shall not repent it. I have asked her to come and rest here, if she finds herself in need of quiet and refreshment, at any time. I suppose she will not. If she does, I shall be delighted to try to cheer her. But I shall have to be careful in our intercourse,&#x2014;a thing I don&#x2019;t like, and am not used to. But the only point to be considered is how one so suffering can be aided. Do tell me how she appears to you; and your letter shall go into the fire, in all silence. I really want guidance, on this strange renewed appeal&#x201C; (Arbuckle 111&#x2013;12).</note>&#x2014; But it looks so very long since I wrote, and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are so good in answering: that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> find half an hour&#x2019;s time and a little composure of soul just to tell you briefly how it has been and is going with me here&#x2014; Your last long good letter found me still at the Grange&#x2014;where I remained three days beyond the appointed time. Lady A caught a cold at the end of the business and was in bed the day we were all to come away. Lord A was not yet returned from Spain where his wife had sent him for the purpose of being made seasick in the Bay of Biscay&#x2014;sea sickness being &#x201C;extremely good for all that family&#x201C;&#x2014; Among the <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi> servants at the Grange there was not one in whose kind nursing her Ladyship seemed to trust&#x2014;moreover she seemed a little afraid of being murdered by housebreakers!! So I offered to stay behind the rest till she was <hi rend="italic">about</hi> again if it pleased her&#x2014;and it did please her&#x2014;tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">why</hi> were difficult to tell, for&#x2014;she would not have me sit with her above an hour in the day while in bed, and when out of it, the third day, she had absolutely nothing to say to me! I dont know whether she is always so when <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> with women&#x2014;but the longer we know one another and the more we are intimate to outward appearance the less have we to say to one another <hi rend="italic">alone.</hi> On Tuesday gone a week I finally returned to London, a change of servants <pb id="pg-25-272" n="25:272"/>having transacted itself the night before. Bolte had found a place for the innocent fool of a contry girl who I think I told you had been sent from Essex, and could not <hi rend="italic">cook</hi> more than an unborn infant&#x2014;and had found me a servant <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> everything and some things more!&#x2014; This hopeful stranger received me at the door and looked quite as glad at my return as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C or <hi rend="italic">Nero</hi>&#x2014;she had not &#x201C;known where anything was&#x201C;&#x2014; I liked her <hi rend="italic">shaping</hi> immensely&#x2014;and went to my own red bed that night with a feeling that at last the house was going to be restored to its normal condition&#x2014;a consumation to be devoutly wished;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 3.1.</note> my two months of house cleaning with my own hands having thoroughly disgusted me with <hi rend="italic">all work</hi>&#x2014; Next day I could not move out of bed! the railway having developed a headach in the wind for me some time into the most unbearable <hi rend="italic">agony</hi> I had yet known&#x2014;till ten at night I lay <hi rend="italic">screaming</hi>&#x2014;and it takes a good deal of <hi rend="italic">physical</hi>pain to make me <hi rend="italic">cry out</hi>&#x2014; The new maid was very kind&#x2014;decidedly she was going to be &#x201C;a treasure&#x201C;&#x2014;tho <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi>&#x2014;the second day I was up and doing&#x2014;found I had got a capital cook and <hi rend="italic">warmhearted</hi> assiduous, clever Servant. that night however she complained of feeling sick&#x2014;the following day she vomited all her food&#x2014;and continued doing so for several days, and looking more and more ghastly, and of course unable for her work&#x2014; So I had again to rush out in quest of a temporary help, and also in quest of hospital orders&#x2014; I got her to Middlesex Hospital on Darwins name&#x2014;first as an <hi rend="italic">out</hi> patient and then as an <hi rend="italic">in</hi>-patient and in Middlesex Hospital she now is, with no chance of recovery for an indefinite time&#x2014;if ever!!&#x2014;the illness being of long standing. and having taken her to the Hospital from several places before this one! <hi rend="italic">So</hi> one of the Physicians wrote to me last night&#x2014; Meanwhile for several days I have been rushing wildly thro the Tradespeople in search of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> servant! Yesterday hearing of absolutely none by that process I went to a Register office&#x2014;the &#x201C;oldest in London&#x201C; seventy five years old in fact, and the same Woman has kept it most of the time!&#x2014;her Mother the rest of it&#x2014; So old a looking Woman and place I never did business with! I paid her half a crown &#x26; she sent for first one servant and then another from the neighbourhood to show me&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">these</hi> did not answer she would send more to my house the first was about six feet tall and three feet broad&#x2014;age between fifty and sixty&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">no</hi> teeth.&#x2014; She was &#x201C;willing&#x201C; (as Barkis)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">David Copperfield</hi>.</note> &#x201C;sure she could please me&#x201C; (good God!)

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came duly from the Gill; many thanks to you for it: I meant to have answered on Saturday at latest, but was hurried that day.</p>
<p>We are tolerably well in health here, both of us; you are to tell my dear Mother that I have quite thrown off my little cold, and almost feel in general as if I had derived some real advantage from my late knocking about, full of tumult and confusion as that was. Indeed I am a degree stronger and quieter than when I set out on my roamings; which is usually the result, tho&#x2019; one does not feel it till the general summing. I am also rather glad than otherwise to say that the Paris expedition is quite off for the present. The Grange <foreign><hi rend="italic">Herrschaft</hi></foreign> [Master and Mistress] is all sickly; gone to Brighton; quite renounces farther travelling for the present season. &#x201C;Probably just as well!&#x201C; Our house here is all very bright and comfortable; decidedly the quietest <hi rend="italic">bedroom</hi> I anywhere get is that cell of mine upstairs: I do feel as if it were snuggest to lie still here <pb id="pg-25-274" n="25:274"/>where I am. So that matter is settled.&#x2014; We are again out of a servant, however: Jane is hiring a new one downstairs at this very moment! The new one we got at her return, a good Irish creature, full of promptitude, zeal and skill, broke out again into some old form of ill health, in two or three days; could swallow <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> stay on her stomach,&#x2014;literally, I think, had no sustenance at all for above a week, nor yet has any when we saw her last night:&#x2014;we could do nothing for her or with her, but get her into the Middlesex Hospital; and there the poor soul lies, little hope of her, I am afraid, and she is far away from &#x201C;Cashel&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are several places in Ireland called Cashel.</note> her native place; and can neither read nor write!&#x2014; One of the Cooper&#x2019;s daughters serves in the interim; and this new subject about to be hired, a smart-looking mannerly English lass of 30, from Kent, who again &#x201C;promises fair,&#x201C; will come into play in a day or two. One has a frightful bother with that side of one&#x2019;s affairs just now! &#x201C;Service,&#x201C; I think, will by and by be recognised to be a mere mockery as we have it at present.</p>
<p>Poor George Bell:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> noted the death of George, eldest son of George Bell of Minsca; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500909-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1850-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300319-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:78</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-03-19">19 March 1830</date></corr></ref> for others of the Bell family.</note> he held sore by life; but his struggle is now over! Poor old <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">Wright?</hi>]</supplied>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Name unclear but possibly one of TC&#x2019;s paternal cousins &#x201C;Wullie and John&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:179</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></corr></ref>, where speculatively surnamed Brown.</note> too (just my own age, and two days more); I was shocked to hear of his forlorn distressed situation. What you can do for him, I am sure, you will try to do. His brother Wull appears to behave generously, poor slut: if there is anything that can fall upon his <hi rend="italic">Cousin Tom</hi> in supplement to these helps, I pray you let me know it, and it shall be attended to.&#x2014; You will have told Austin how dangerous a burn in the foot is; no <hi rend="italic">flesh</hi> to establish a cure upon? I hope to hear things are better there before long.</p>
<p>Jane undertook to write about the Scotsbrig butter &#x26;c; but must wait, I suppose, till the servant hurlyburly is a little settled,&#x2014;a few days hence. This of <hi rend="italic">Eliza Cook</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Eliza Cook&#x2019;s Journal</hi> 3 (<date when="1850-10-12">12 Oct. 1850</date>):369&#x2013;71.</note> brought to her by the Postman, written by I know not whom, is for my Mother&#x2019;s reading; and <hi rend="italic">must be returned</hi>, pray attend to that when you write next. A really striking review of me was introduced by Darwin the other day, and I have read it, in the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Review:</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >[John O&#x2019;Hagan], &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Dublin Review</hi> <date when="1850-09-29">29 (Sept. 1850)</date>:169&#x2013;206, which hails TC as &#x201C;a man of unquestioned genius&#x201C; who, &#x201C;a complete unbeliever &#x2026; in revealed religion,&#x201C; nevertheless has a &#x201C;transcendent scorn for the whole class of infidel thought in our days&#x201C; (171&#x2013;72). O&#x2019;Hagan sees him as &#x201C;impotent to solve a single question that he thus awakens&#x201C; because &#x201C;the only solution in which human heart and reason can find rest, is that of the Catholic church&#x201C; (180).</note> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, it is by some <hi rend="italic">Newman</hi> Catholic; agrees with me, in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, only damns me for not finding a remedy in the Pope.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Blessings to my Mother &#x26; you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Beyond doubt I might have written sooner to you; but I have been much hurried about too, and oftenest in very low water; and in fact have avoided writing altogether, wherever I could. Two Notes of yours have come to me thro&#x2019; John; and of me also, as I have of you, you have kept up some sketchy history: so let bygones be bygones;&#x2014;and attend to the little bit of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> I have for you today; one of the smallest bits of &#x201C;business&#x201C;!</p>
<p>Jane, who has been terribly <foreign>hubbled</foreign> this long while with &#x201C;servants&#x201C; &#x26;c, and unable to attend to anything extraneous, has at length written for the Scotsbrig meal; which, with your <hi rend="italic">Honey</hi> and other appendages, will probably be <supplied>[re]</supplied>ady, and take the road, in a few days hence. A couple of additional items along with it, is what I now want of you. <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the best 3 red nightcaps you can get: my old stock is a good deal worn out, and I want new,&#x2014;of the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> make and fashion in every particular! <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> (but this is of considerably less moment, and indeed may be either done or omitted according to the chances you have), if in the old sponge-shop, you see any nice <hi rend="italic">round-made</hi> compact sponge for about 3/ or so, you may send it,&#x2014;the old <hi rend="italic">flat scon</hi> of a one, of last year, is all gone to wreck; and indeed I have got another (but it cost me 5/, too dear that!)&#x2014;and as the <hi rend="italic">former</hi> Dumfries one still sticks together, tho&#x2019; weak, I fancy another like it might be a possession for me. But don&#x2019;t mind it, unless you find one answerable,&#x2014;round-made and good stuff. And now that is all; except that you are to send me the <hi rend="italic">account</hi>, pointedly, that I may pay it in stamps<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >NLS 513.57 ends here.</note> or otherwise. And to be sharp; for I suppose there will be no delay at Scotsbrig!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was gratified to learn that <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> has actually gone to Closeburn; I have little doubt, that is the best school in Dumfriesshire just now; and the poor little fellow will have a fair chance to find his road again there. I can still remember how I myself was situated under W. Gullen,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Gullen, teacher at the Ecclefechan parish school, &#x201C;a downbent, broken-hearted underfoot martyr&#x201C; (see Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:24).</note> a man teaching me without having knowledge himself!&#x2014; In the end, if the Boy don&#x2019;t want to learn, don&#x2019;t force him; consult honestly what of tendency you can discover in his own inner mannikin,&#x2014;that is the real impulse that will have to make itself good by and by, with or <hi rend="italic">against</hi> foreign &#x201C;help,&#x201C; if the poor fellow live and have luck in the world!</p>
<p>The failure of the Dentist was sad news to me for our poor Mother&#x2019;s sake. <pb id="pg-25-276" n="25:276"/>John writes always good accounts of her; and indeed so long as he is there, I feel a kind of composure; but my impression otherwise is clearly that she ought to have somebody to look after her household work (especially in the winter season), and to wait upon her when she is left alone. I wish I could contrive or assist in providing something! One w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think, the situation of the Doctor, or Jenny and our Mother did hold in it the materials for a solution? But it depends on the Doctor&#x2019;s deciding to take a house <hi rend="italic">for himself</hi> (or chiefly for himself); and probably any <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> about that would rather tend to hinder it; so let us say nothing!</p>

<p>On Saturday, by way of mute memento, rather than with the hope of doing any service to your studies, I despatched a <hi rend="italic">Sophocles</hi> by Post,&#x2014;duly settling for the &#x201C;three blue stamps&#x201C; with the official person here, and nothing doubting but you would get the poor Book next day. From Mr Maberley,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Col. William L. Maberly, joint-sec. of the Gen. Post Office. Under one pound in weight, three twopenny blue stamps were enough, provided that the book included no handwriting apart from the owner&#x2019;s name and address. It had to be left open at each end for inspection. TC&#x2019;s copy had his annotations, which meant that he had to pay full letter postage plus a penalty if it were to be sent on. The requirements were later modified; but, as further letters show, the book was sent to the Dead Letter Office in the regular way, and a form sent to the offender in Maberly&#x2019;s name. There is no post office record of correspondence with TC.</note> however, there arrives this morning an announcement that it lies, for some reason quite mysterious to me, imprisoned in the <hi rend="italic">Dead Letter Office</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be forwarded on payment of &#x201C;4/7 more&#x201C;! What the knot of this foolish coil is I <pb id="pg-25-277" n="25:277"/>cannot conjecture; but today, by one means or another, I will see to it; and tomorrow, most probably, the poor prisoner of a Book will fly out towards you again, and arrive this time. If it do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> arrive within three days (before you go to Norman Court<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Hampshire, 7 mi. E of Salisbury; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471225-TC-LHB-01"><sic>22:182</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1847-12-25">25 Dec. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note>), please let me know;&#x2014;if it do, you can also let me know, but are not bound to any day for it. And this is all the &#x201C;business&#x201C; I can pretend to have at present; this smallest of the small! For which I am even thankful as better than none at all.</p>
<p>Alas, I am very low at present; never was so buried under mountains of encumbrance, and crushed down almost to the <hi rend="italic">over</hi>loading of my considerable powers of endurance, as even now. Better to be silent altogether. To nearly all mortals I am silent from choice; to the infinitesimal remainder, to whom my poor heart might long to speak, I seem to be compelled to silence. Never, or not often I think, in human history, were the &#x201C;speaking powers&#x201C; of an individual more <hi rend="italic">in</hi>adequate than mine at present! Let us follow the rule then, so far as we can gradually read it or grope it; one must endure whatever it be, when there is nothing that one can wisely do.</p>
<p>To come to Brighton for a day is what I of course <hi rend="italic">wish</hi>, nor do I omit or purpose to omit any glimmering of chance there may be of well doing it: but, in fact, I suppose there is or will be <hi rend="italic">none;</hi> and probably it will be best for me to lay my account with that. I shall thus avoid disappointment at least. In fact I think I am low enough down at present to be pretty safe from &#x201C;disappointment&#x201C;:&#x2014;God help me! But neither will I make any complaint. I have heard, &#x201C;it is a long lane that has no turning.&#x201C; We shall see. I often enough think I know of such &#x201C;lanes&#x201C; too. But we shall see.</p>
<p>Of writing there is yet no definite outlook or project. But I must <hi rend="italic">write;</hi> it is my one way of expressing all the imprisoned existence of me, this horrid &#x201C;wrestle&#x201C; I have had (I for one, and I think I know others in this devil-ridden Planet) ever since my poor biography began: a miserable outlet and &#x201C;way,&#x201C; as I often passionately reflect; but it is and has been my sole one; let me not spill that too, and go mad altogether. O Lady, O my Lady,&#x2014;had not you better score me out of your books, and bid me begone as a grumbling ion of mere Misfortune, Pain, and as it were Perdition (temporal if not eternal)? I believe you will not, after all, just yet; and yet perhaps you had better?&#x2014;&#x2014; Well; here is the Note from Cobden, in reply to mine about his School Agitation: will neither you nor Lord A. join in that &#x201C;reform movement,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Cobden had long advocated national education. In autumn <date when="1850">1850</date> he visited large cities seeking interviews and conferring with persons interested in resolving sectarian conflicts and establishing a system of education paid for by local rates that would be free, compulsory, and nonsectarian. He wrote to a correspondent, <date when="1850-11-09">9 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I want standing-ground for the House of Commons. At present the Liberal party, the soul of which is Dissent, are torn to pieces by the question, and it is not easy to heal a religious feud. The Tories, whatever they may say to the contrary, are at heart opposed to the enlightenment of the people. &#x2026; If I could say I represented the Radical party or any other party upon the question, I should have some standing-ground in the House. But the greatest of all causes has no <foreign><hi rend="italic">locus standi</hi></foreign> in Parliament&#x201C; (J.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>You are often enough present to my thoughts; but yesterday there came a little incident which has brought you rather vividly upon the scene for me. A certain Mr &#x201C;S. E. Ward&#x201C; from Boston sends us, yesterday morning by post, a Note of yours addressed to Mazzini,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Gray Ward of Boston. Emerson&#x2019;s letter to Mazzini, <date when="1850-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, asked for information about the last six years of Margaret Fuller Ossoli&#x2019;s life for a memoir of her; see Rusk 4:232&#x2013;33.</note> whom he cannot find; and indicates that he retains a similar one addressed to myself, and (in the most courteous, kindly and dignified manner, if Mercy prevent not) is about carrying it off with him again to America! To give Mercy a chance, I by the first opportunity get under way for Morley&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trafalgar Sq., Charing Cross.</note> the Address of Mr Ward; find there that Mr Ward, since morning, <hi rend="italic">has been</hi> on the road towards Liverpool and America, and that the function of Mercy is quite extinct in this instance! My reflexions as I wandered home again were none of the pleasantest. Of this Mr Ward I had heard some tradition, as of an intelligent accomplished and superior man; such a man&#x2019;s acquaintance, of whatever complexion he be, is and was always a precious thing to me, well worth acquiring where possible; not to say that any friend of yours, whatever his qualities otherwise, carries with him an imperative key to all bolts and locks of mine, real or imaginary. In fact I felt punished;&#x2014;and who knows, if the case were seen into, whether I deserve it? What &#x201C;business&#x201C; it was that deprived me of a call from Mr Ward, or of the possibility of calling on him, I know very well,&#x2014;and Elizur Wright, the little dog, and others know!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Perforations in the &#x201C;Latter-Day Pamphlets&#x201C; by One of the &#x201C;Eighteen Millions of Bores&#x201C;</hi> Wright concluded: &#x201C;we will take in good part the broad hint to make our calls shorter and less frequent at Cheyne Row.&#x201C; Emerson wrote to Ward, <date when="1850-12-03">3 Dec.</date>, upon his return to the U.S. and enclosed TC&#x2019;s letter: &#x201C;I am, I think, quite compensated for your leaving Carlyle unvisited, by the fine vengeance of it&#x201C; (Rusk 4:236&#x2013;37). See K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle and the Americans: &#x2018;Eighteen Million Bores,&#x2019;&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Studies Annual</hi> 15 (<date when="1995">1995</date>):55&#x2013;64.</note> But the fact in that matter is very far different indeed from the superficial semblance; and I appeal to all the Gentlemen that are in America for a candid interpretation of the same. &#x201C;Eighteen million bores.&#x201C; good Heavens don&#x2019;t I know how many of that species we also have; and how, with us as with you, the difference between <hi rend="italic">them</hi> and the Eighteen thousand noble-men and <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-bores is immeasureable and inconceivable; and how, with us as with you, the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> small company, sons of the <pb id="pg-25-280" n="25:280"/>Empyrean, will have to fling the former huge one, sons of Mammon and Mud, into some kind of chains again, reduce them to some kind of silence again,&#x2014;unless the old Mud-Demons are to rise and devour us all? Truly it is so I construe it: and if Elizur Wright and the Eighteen millions are well justified in their anger at me, E. S. Ward and the Eighteen thousand owe me thanks and new love. That is my decided opinion, in spite of you all! And so, along with Ward, probably in the same ship with him, there shall go my protest against the conduct of Ward; and the declaration that to the last I will protest! Which will wind up the matter (without any word of yours on it) at this time,&#x2014; &#x2014; For the rest, tho&#x2019; Elizur sent me his Pamphlet,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC thought it was addressed to TC in Emerson&#x2019;s handwriting; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500906-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <sic>[<date when="1850-09-06">6 Sept.</date>]</sic> <corr>[<date when="1850-09-06">6</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-09-07">7 Sept.</date>]</corr></ref>; but she also thought it illustrated, which it was not.</note> it is a fact I have not read a word of it, nor shall ever read. My Wife read it; but I was away, with far other things in my head; and it was &#x201C;lent to various persons&#x201C; till it died!&#x2014; Enough and ten times more than enough of all that. Let me on this last slip of paper give you some response to the Letter I got in Scotland, under the silence of the bright autumn sun in my Mother&#x2019;s house, and read there.</p>
<p>You are bountiful abundantly in your reception of those L. D. Pamphlets; and right in all you say of them;&#x2014;and yet withal you are not right, my Friend, but I am! Truly it does behove a man to know the immense resources of this universe, and, for the sake both of his peace and of his dignity, to possess his soul in patience,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 21:19.</note> and look nothing doubting (nothing wincing even, if that be his humour) upon all things. For it is most indubitable there is good in all;&#x2014;and if you even see an Oliver Cromwell assassinated, it is certain you may get a cartload of turnips from his carcase. Ah me, and I suppose we had too much forgotten all this, or there had not been a man like you sent to shew it us so emphatically! Let us well remember it; and yet remember too that it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> good always, or ever, to be &#x201C;at ease in Zion&#x201C;; good often to be in fierce rage in Zion; and that the vile Pythons of this Mud-world do verily require to have sun-arrows shot into them,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The monster serpent hatched from the mud of Deucalion&#x2019;s deluge was slain by Apollo.</note> and redhot pokers struck thro&#x2019; them, according to occasion: wo to the man that carries either of these weapons, and does not use it in their presence! Here, at this moment, a miserable Italian organ-grinder has struck up the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> under my window, for example: was the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> fought out on a bed of down, or is it worth nothing when fought?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The French national anthem was originally a war song.</note> On those wretched <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> I set no value at all, or even less than none: to me their one benefit is, my own heart is clear of them (a benefit <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be despised, I assure you!)&#x2014;and in the Public, athwart this storm of curses, <pb id="pg-25-281" n="25:281"/>and emptying of vessels of dishonour, I can already perceive that it is all well enough there too in reference to them; and the controversy of the Eighteen millions <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> the Eighteen thousands, or Eighteen units, is going on very handsomely in that quarter of it, for aught I can see! And so, Peace to the brave that are departed; and, Tomorrow to fresh fields and pastures new!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, &#x201C;Lycidas&#x201C; 193.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Last night about 7 o&#x2019;clock, and not sooner, the Scotsbrig Packets arrived; where they have been all this while I have no guess,&#x2014;but they don&#x2019;t seem to have taken the full benefit of steam in coming from you to us! I suppose the Pickford people may delay them more or less about Carlisle, and then after arriving in London there is again delay about Euston Square: at all events, we ought to know in time coming, <hi rend="italic">such</hi> is their rule: best part of a week between Scotsbrig and this. The very moderate <hi rend="italic">charge</hi> was five and four-pence, in all.</p>
<p>For the rest, everything was perfectly safe; nothing whatever had gone <pb id="pg-25-282" n="25:282"/>wrong, except the state of the two &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chuckas</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chickens or chikhors, red-legged Indian partridges.</note> which latter depended upon Time! The poor Chuckas had got considerably maimed; indeed one of them, I think, was almost <foreign><hi rend="italic">hors-de-combat</hi></foreign>, or two like that: but Jane will take wise order about them; and some result will be realized still. One thing only we must remember: <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to send any more of that or other perishable ware by so uncertain a conveyance. The Ham, from my dear Mother, was very conspicuous, and the tongue, and the bar of shaving-soap for me;&#x2014;dear good Mother! The Butter is not yet broken up, nor the meal, nor has anything been <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> by the practical test: I can only thank everybody, and wish with all my heart there may ever be <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> where these good things came from! Farther particulars in future Letters.</p>
<p>We have clearish weather, generally of a superior sort, with little fog; no frost hitherto till today, when some such tendency has become traceable. Nothing to complain of in weather; in fact nothing that I should complain of at all but the wretched state of my &#x201C;digestive-apparatus,&#x201C; which plagues me beyond all else, and sometimes won&#x2019;t behave handsomely at all! But that is an old story now; and I must try to make the best of it as formerly. Jane seems pretty well, considering her and the season we are in: she has now much more composure, the new Servant being fairly at work, and seemingly promising very well. Many little things have altered in and about the house since I left it in <date when="1850-07">July</date>: she has put me, for example, a fine new grate in this <hi rend="italic">up</hi>stairs room (in the style of the one downstairs), curtains &#x26;c are all put in order; on the other hand a new rather noisy Tenant has come into N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 6:&#x2014;change rushes on forever in this world!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I have heard from you or written to you; I indeed pretty regularly hear <hi rend="italic">of</hi> you, for your Letters, to whomsoever addressed, are <pb id="pg-25-283" n="25:283"/>rapidly sent over the whole kindred of us; so that the first part of my complaint is of less moment,&#x2014;but as to the second, I truly meant to have written long ago; and now, this day, before going farther, I will do it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The truth is, I have been terribly &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded</hi></foreign> about,&#x201C; and am generally in a most dislocated, tossed and tumbled state of temper these many long months past; not at all in a state for writing Letters or doing anything else (if I could help it);&#x2014;the old story with me, you perceive; <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> of body and of mind, only aggravated by some incidental circumstances which will not last always, and doubtless too by the approaches of old-age, which is a thing one cannot expect to get better of when once it has come! Oh, it is an earnest tussle this Life of ours here below; and if a man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">body</hi> fail him, and he get continual grinding misery of ill-health to encompass him for thirty and odd years, and drag down every step of his poor limbs&#x2014; But let me not complain. I do believe there is nothing quite essential but complete health of <hi rend="italic">soul;</hi> and surely the sicker one&#x2019;s body is, the livelier ought one&#x2019;s care to be not to let that other better part grow unhealthy, and fall down into cowardice!</p>
<p>I was utterly done before, in the end of <date when="1850-07">July</date> last, I could get those wild <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi> off my hand; the last two in particular did try all the obstinacy I was master of; and really, to my own mind, had something of worth in them in that respect, if in no other. They have done little for me hitherto, these <hi rend="italic">Pamphlets</hi>, in any outward respect; the money of them (which however I could happily do independently of) has been mostly pocketed by the Bookseller; mostly, not quite, so negligent was I in bargaining about them; and as to their reception from mankind, you never in your life heard such a screaming and squealing,&#x2014;a universal &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">screigh</hi></foreign> as of stuck pigs,&#x201C; struck to the heart, all running about with <foreign>gillies</foreign> in their sides, and bleeding to death, by the hand of a <hi rend="italic">friend!</hi> Really it was something like that; but there were other better sounds also perceptible in a low key; and as I kept far away from the universal &#x201C;<foreign>skreigh</foreign>,&#x201C; and would not read a word of the balderdash that was written upon me, and was zealously abetted by my Wife in that obstinate course too,&#x2014;it was in truth rather entertaining to hear the said universal &#x201C;<foreign>skreigh</foreign>&#x201C; from the distance, and served as a sign that at least the medicine had been <hi rend="italic">swallowed</hi>, and that probably (as old Keble<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> used to say) &#x201C;it had took an effect on them.&#x201C;&#x2014; In late weeks, now that the thing is all over, I find the tone perceptibly altering; and have no doubt it will alter to the right pitch, or even beyond it,&#x2014;like the Irishman&#x2019;s jamb, &#x201C;plumb <hi rend="italic">and more.</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430728-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:324</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-28">28 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> They had much need of a dose like that, the stupid blockheads of this generation.</p>
<p>But the fact is, being quite knocked up by such a job, following on many other rubs and injuries to one&#x2019;s nerves, I ran off to a certain friendly hermit&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-25-284" n="25:284"/>in South Wales (one Redwood&#x2019;s, about 120 miles off), as the quietest shelter I could think of in the attainable parts of this world; to try for a little rest there. Alas, rest was not in store for me there; difficult for the like of me to find rest! After 3 weeks or more of very torpid yet agitated existence, I set off towards Scotsbrig; had an unpropitious journey, so far as weather, inns, companioncy, sleep and other outward things went;&#x2014;and was at last, in a deluge of rain, taken up by Jamie on the street of Annan (in the old fashion <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can well remember), and set down at Scotsbrig to tea with my good old Mother once again in this world. Oh me! You can fancy what a strange mixed emotion;&#x2014;for a man half-mad with weary misery of body, more especially! Here I staid near a month, with <hi rend="italic">as</hi> little stir as it was possible for me to contrive: I meant always to write to you during that month; but always missed it. In fine, I had to lift anchor again, and steer southward, homeward; and so after various hoverings about, I am only got fairly <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> at home a few weeks ago,&#x2014;for there has been much bother with change of servants &#x26;c, and it has only got <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> to an end lately;&#x2014;and so here I at last am, writing to my Brother a few words over the Sea.</p>
<p>Our good old Mother is wonderfully cheerful and well, considering all that she has now seen and suffered: brave old Mother! She had lost her teeth since my last visit; all her upper teeth, I believe, &#x201C;except one stump&#x201C;; which change altered her appearance to me somewhat at the first glance: but this too she had taken cheerfully, and was doing her best with it. We tried, while I was there, to get her an artificial set at Dumfries; but the Dentist, on examining, found that he could not fix them, without the likelihood of doing greater mischief otherwise; so we had to give it up, much to our disappointment, not very much to hers, tho&#x2019; she was anxious too about it. She bakes <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> bread for herself, soft, <hi rend="italic">soda</hi>-scons &#x26;c; she struggles along quite bravely under that and all losses. Her hand shakes perhaps rather worse too, especially when she is out of order; but she does not complain of that either. She reads with all the old eagerness; is ever full of interest and affection for you and me and all that pertain to her; occasionally even <hi rend="italic">jokes</hi>, in her old genial way;&#x2014;twice or thrice she had a <hi rend="italic">washing</hi> while I was there, and did it all herself and well. The chief falling off one sees in her is the facility with which any ailment knocks her quite down: she can stand almost nothing in the way of injury; her little stock of strength is not adequate for <hi rend="italic">any</hi> extraordinary draught upon it. But in general she shifts along wonderfully still; used to walk with me to the Back-burn and round by the Fairy Brae,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A nearby field and favorite resort of TC.</note> chatting, and picking up sticks by the way: she was a sad but also one of the beautifullest sights to me always. Jack&#x2019;s residence at Scotsbrig (where he continues pretty steadily, doing gratuitous medicine) is an immense help to her: indeed if he were not there, I should <pb id="pg-25-285" n="25:285"/>not feel easy in the arrangement that now is. I sometimes think Jack will perhaps take some better house for himself some day, and bring Jenny to look after Mother and him;&#x2014;in which I should be most glad to assist, as you may fancy; <hi rend="italic">only</hi>, as is necessary sometimes, I must <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing of it, for fear I <hi rend="italic">obstruct.</hi> At present all is on a very tolerable footing, in the fashion I describe.&#x2014; &#x2014; Scotsbrig otherwise is much as you left it, only scraped up a little, with some new walls and roofs in some of the buildings, and last year with a shifting of the <hi rend="italic">garden</hi> into what was once the &#x201C;swine <foreign>fauld</foreign>&#x201C; (under the big <hi rend="italic">back</hi> or eastern window), and a general <hi rend="italic">inclosing</hi> and tillage of the waste grounds about the dwellinghouse: all, visible improvements. Jamie is in much better health after his Edinburgh operation.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490919-TC-JAC-01"><sic>24:239</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1849-09-19">19 Sept. 1849</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491017-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>272</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1849-10-17">17 Oct. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> His crop this year is good: but farming, I see, is all altering thereabouts into a grazing-and-fattening business for the Liverpool market,&#x2014;and I suppose the railway, with its trains hissing by continually, will open other similar markets more and more. Jack is still hearty, restless, tho&#x2019; very grey now. Jamie even has grey hairs; and as for me, I am rapidly tending in that direction, quite <hi rend="italic">silvery</hi> on the <foreign><hi rend="italic">haffits</hi></foreign> (&#x201C;half-heads&#x201C;), and getting a grim, austere and I hope rather <hi rend="italic">venerable</hi> aspect! It is the way of all men and of all things, dear Brother; let us all learn to grow <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, as we must; and know that age too has its beauty to the w<supplied>[ise?]</supplied>&#x2014; My Paper is done, for I want to send you Jean&#x2019;s Dumfries Note of this morning;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1850-11-13">13 Nov.</date></note> so <foreign>adieu</foreign>.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I know nothing of <hi rend="italic">Hogg&#x2019;s Instructor;</hi> and, for my own share, can have no wish, but rather the reverse, to see any smear of my poor physiognomy bodily or spiritual come forth on such an occasion;&#x2014;yet surely, for the love of you and of Aird and of Gilfillan, or for the tenth part of the least of you, it were very ill-natured if I refused &#x201C;to step into Beard&#x2019;s for three minutes as I passed,&#x201C; to do you a little pleasure!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken wrote, <date when="1850-11-13">13 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Hog the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Publisher wishes Mr Gilfillan to ask you to sit for a Daguaratype likeness for his Weekly Instructor. But as Gilfillan is rather <hi rend="italic">arch</hi> to meddle with you; knowing your aversion to such Matters he again writes to Mr Aird today to see if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would name the matter to you. I was to say farther that we all get the Instructor &#x26; would take it as a <hi rend="italic">very neighbourly sort of thing</hi> if you would step into any of Beards Establishments in London for three minutes: He has been instructed to &#x2018;take you&#x2019; &#x26; is they say quite unerring in making a correct likeness.&#x201C; She refers to James Hogg, George Gilfillan, and Richard Beard. This portrait was to appear in <hi rend="italic">The Instructor</hi> n.s. 7 (<date when="1851">1851</date>): opp. 17, from a daguerrotype by Beard, engraved by F. Croll, signed &#x201C;Yours very truly / T. Carlyle.&#x201C; Also an article, &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle,&#x201C; in a &#x201C;Portrait Gallery&#x201C; series, 81&#x2013;86, gave a vigorous and enthusiastic account of TC, admitting his general &#x201C;reverence&#x201C; but regretting &#x201C;no blink of the resurrection,&#x201C; no &#x201C;hope of immortality,&#x201C; and no &#x201C;grapple&#x201C; with sin (85).</note> But unluckily that is not the case in hand <pb id="pg-25-286" n="25:286"/>at all. I have been at Beard&#x2019;s twice already; got two excellent Likenesses on the one occasion, could not get a tolerable one at all in the next; and both times, the Establishment being three miles off me, and the delays considerable and the fidgettings very great, not to speak of the horrible poisonous vapours in that glass dove-cot of his,&#x2014;I lost my whole forenoon, and came away with an inflammation in my eyelids which lasted for two weeks after. That is the real net-total of the affair. And, on calling yesterday (for I did call yesterday at another shop of Beard&#x2019;s and staid <hi rend="italic">above</hi> three minutes, making more preliminary inquiries), I found that the process was not abbreviated in any way; that they could not act at all after three o&#x2019;clock (about which hour I am commonly just leaving home), and that on dim days too (as yesterday) they were unable to act. In the spring or more luminous times of the year, I suppose, it is different; but such is the rule of their resources at present.</p>
<p>On the whole therefore I believe it will be better to decline, or indefinitely postpone this honour; the rather as there are already plenty of scarecrow Likenesses of me, in chalk, in oil, in lithograph, photograph and copperplate,&#x2014;hideously unlike, for most part,&#x2014;and there can be no use in taking trouble to increase such a class of entities.</p>
<p>Let this serve for your answer to my friend Aird, this with many affectionate regards. About other things I will write to you on another bit of paper.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I am exceedingly concerned to hear of her Ladyship&#x2019;s sad condition:&#x2014;not roaming along the downs, under the bright bracing air; but lying imprisoned under influenza and mere <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> misery! Today too there is new frost, and of a vile damp character withal; which I fear is no favourable circumstance in that complaint. Pray keep the Doctor to his duty;&#x2014;and let us hear at least how matters go.</p>
<p>Whether the <hi rend="italic">Sophocles</hi> will ever reach you, or indeed see the light of the sun anywhere again, is still uncertain. Perhaps it will come in the end; and you will love it for the dangers it has passed: today Col. Maberly writes, with great politeness, that he &#x201C;will pay every attention&#x201C;;&#x2014;and there it yet lies.</p>
<p>I will straightway set about getting you a <hi rend="italic">Suetonius</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus (<date><hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi> 2d cent.</date>), Roman biographer and historian.</note> in English or French;&#x2014; so that you may read the blackguard History of those ancient Blackguards: a <pb id="pg-25-288" n="25:288"/><hi rend="italic">sin</hi>, if it be one, to which human nature is prone! Nay, by management, it is capable of being a virtue too. But the general rule is, &#x201C;Poke not into carrion, for you will get mischief of it; let all carrion, classical or other, get under ground as soon as possible, and stay there!&#x201C;&#x2014; I will also, as I walk up to Town, call at Bath House, and look after that Map; probably tomorrow (if not sooner) I may be able to give some account of the Book and it.</p>
<p>I am utterly alone here, within doors all day, except one walk, which I take generally in silence and by myself, with the humour of a man taking physic. The Town is getting fuller of carriages; but to me at present it is little other than a phantasmagory; of which I hear little beyond the physical noises, and regard next to nothing. Not because I am <hi rend="italic">busy;</hi> alas, no, I can yet work at nothing;&#x2014;only sit, like a Siberian Bear in winter time, empty enough of pabulum or outlook, and for the present contemplatively sucking his paws.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1850-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, that she had the day before received a letter from JWC telling her that TC was not going to Paris. B&#xF6;lte regretted this because the trip might have proved a stimulus and a relief from his sad, despairing mood. &#x201C;He has been courting intimacy with the aristocracy for years, &#x2026; and now he has put himself forth as the defender of this world of appearances. This last change is very distressing. While the earlier manifestations were incongruous in an unpolished gem like Carlyle, this last stage is a betrayal of his true self, and therefore regrettable. His wife regards it with deep distress. She sees her life as having failed in this respect, since the Truth, which she has worshipped in him, is revealed as a false idol. No one yet notices this transformation (which he himself feels possesses him) except her and myself, because in front of others he controls himself. But he is awful&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 85, trans.).</note> &#x201C;No Popery,&#x201C; and worse, still abounds on the flag-stones;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The anti-Catholic prejudice caused by the papal decision to establish Roman Catholic episcopal sees in England was further stimulated by the prime minister&#x2019;s letter (widely printed in the press) to the bishop of Durham, <date when="1850-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, expressing indignation at &#x201C;the late aggression of the Pope upon our Protestantism.&#x201C;</note> and Paxton&#x2019;s Industriality rises, like the hugest Bird-cage in Creation, whenever you enter the Park.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Paxton&#x2019;s building for the Industrial Exhibition, generally known as the Crystal Palace, was being built in Hyde Park.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">O curas hominum, O quantum</hi></foreign> &#x26;c [O the cares of men, O the emptiness]!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Persius, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> 1.1.

<p>Yesterday I easily found the German Map in its case, and committed it to the Housekeeper, who professed to have &#x201C;other Books&#x201C; which she was waiting for an opportunity to send.</p>
<p>My next step was to the London Library. &#x201C;Croucher&#x201C; (vulgarly called <hi rend="italic">Cochrane</hi>) professes to have a <hi rend="italic">Thomson&#x2019;s Suetonius</hi> among his Books,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Lives of the First Twelve Caesars translated &#x2026; with Annotations &#x2026; by A. Thomson</hi> (<date when="1796">1796</date>).</note> and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to have lent it out: but the unfortunate mortal could not lay his hands on it when he tried. &#x201C;Fallen aside somewhere!&#x201C; However, he zealously promised either to find this copy, or to have another ready tomorrow (this day), and to send it directly to the above-said Housekeeper, with a mark on it (meaning &#x201C;despatch immediately&#x201C;) which I had agreed upon with that vigilant woman.</p>
<p>The case therefore stands thus. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> Croucher keep his word (which I doubt) you will have the Map, the Suetonius and &#x201C;other Books,&#x201C; by course of nature and railway, on Monday or tomorrow. If Croucher don&#x2019;t keep his word, he shall be pricked and incessantly stung into doing it,&#x2014;may succeed perhaps about Wednesday or so; and then the above phenomena will follow, as they ought to have done before. He shall have no rest till they do, on Wednesday, or sooner, or later;&#x2014;and that also is my briefest method of <hi rend="italic">buying</hi> you a Suetonius, which will thus come in the way of <hi rend="italic">loan.</hi>&#x2014; On the other hand, should the <hi rend="italic">Map</hi> be more pressingly wanted (as is possible), a word to Bath House will now bring it at any time.</p>
<p>No news from My Lady; nor any, I fear, to be looked for now till Monday.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat.</note> Unless you have happily sent a word for the evening post of this day? Let us pray for good news any way, and speedy if it please the Powers. <closer><salute>I send many regards to her poor Ladyship;&#x2014;and am ever,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Apparently you are a young man, of unusual, perhaps of extreme sensibility, and placed at present in the unfortunate position of having nothing to <pb id="pg-25-290" n="25:290"/>do. Vague reverie, chaotic meditations, the fruitless effort to sound the unfathomable, is the natural result for you. Such a form of character indicates the probability of superior capabilities to work in this world; but is also, unless guided towards work, the inevitable prophecy of much suffering, disappointment, and failure in your course of life.</p>
<p>Understand always that the end of man is an action, not a thought.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frequently quoted by TC.

Your thoughts, moods, &#x26;c., will thus in part legitimate themselves, and become fruitful possessions for you; in part fall away as illegitimate, and die out of the way, and your goal will become clearer to you every step you courageously advance towards it. No man ever understood this universe; each man may understand what good and manful work it lies with him to accomplish there.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I wish we heard again that you were actually well; there was the best hope when Lord A.&#x2019;s word came; but then it stops, and the fulfillment questionable still. Surely he would have written had matters <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone well?&#x2014; And you have abruptly turned us out of the Book-trade too,&#x2014;in which truly we succeeded very ill;&#x2014;and no tidings of any kind come.</p>
<p>Croucher, when his Mittimus arrived, had a <hi rend="italic">Suetonius</hi> actually lying at <pb id="pg-25-291" n="25:291"/>Bath House, ready to start for eight-and-forty hours preceding; he had even found his own copy, and that too was, and is ready: but the Mittimus came; he took all back, and retired disconsolate (I believe, for I have never seen him since) into the interior of his shell again. Nor will the <hi rend="italic">Map</hi> come till Lord A. write a word for it; the Housekeeper is to let it lie till then. And Col. Maberly gives no sign farther; is &#x201C;giving every attention&#x201C; to that <hi rend="italic">Sophocles</hi>, I believe,&#x2014;and may make himself a nightcap of it if he like. Truly we have been unfortunate in the Book-trade, this time. And perhaps made too much fuss about it withal? Whereupon her Ladyship dismissed us; bought a <hi rend="italic">Suetonius</hi> for herself,&#x2014;or perhaps only the polite <hi rend="italic">myth</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">Suetonius</hi>,&#x2014;and so had peace at any rate? Unfortunate that we are!&#x2014; But tell us you are well at least,&#x2014;or indeed at <hi rend="italic">most</hi>, for there cannot from any quarter be better news.</p>
<p>We have got into a very peaceable train here; and I do not even find the dark muddy weather an unkindness to me. It sweeps the streets much clearer; I have thick gutta-percha shoes, and can all the better enjoy my own sombre thought amid the rain. How inexpressibly annoying human beings <hi rend="italic">Can</hi> be to one another! It is pity they would not be more considerate; the accords <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be sorted out, surely, and combined to melodies: alas, in this huge soul-confusing Dissonance there does creep, trodden out of hearing, such a Sphere-Harmony withal! To be got at in Heaven, I suppose; not handily in this world, in these revolutionary epochs. Let us be patient nevertheless.</p>
<p>For these last two days, thanks to rigorous avoidance of all noise and confusion, I seem to feel (if I durst) a little better,&#x2014;healthier in all respects: but how can I hope that it will last? &#x201C;Let it <hi rend="italic">not</hi> last, then, but cease!&#x201C; is what I have to say in such cases; and study the duty of keeping down the lid at any rate. I am still <hi rend="italic">idle;</hi> looking merely at the heights, and sauntering hither and thither still on the level ground. Not right, not proper at all!&#x2014; I read <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;nagiana</hi> of nights:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gilles M&#xE9;nage, <hi rend="italic">Menagiana</hi> (Paris, <date when="1693">1693</date>).

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We got your Moffat Letter; and were very glad of your news, especially of the good account you give of our Mother, standing out so bravely against this bad weather. I only hope, it still continues. We have the muddiest time here too; but it is very mild in temperature, and there comes about once in three a brisk day when at least the flags are dry. I find a great benefit in my gutta-percha soles, and walk independ<supplied>[en]</supplied>tly<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> of all manner of <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;rather glad sometimes that all is so <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, and that I have so much of the roads to myself. I have ceased now to walk by Hyde Park as my last feat of the day; I oftener go up by the <hi rend="italic">Nine-Elms</hi> way,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., towards Kennington; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480123-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:230</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1848-01-23">23 Jan. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> round by Pepolidom and Craikdom (which <hi rend="italic">were</hi>, for alas both these parties are gone); this I find a much lovelier road, and poor Nero goes with me if it is not quite wet, on occasion.</p>
<p>I am also to report, more particularly, of the excellence of the Scotsbrig meal, butter &#x26;c; to which I myself can testify, for I often take a <hi rend="italic">cup</hi> of porridge lately before bedtime. No better meal need be wished. The Ham too (tell our kind Mother) is very good at breakfast time. As for the butter, it is admitted to be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> we have had even from Scotsbrig for years past: Jane has trucked away the Irish butter (which was threatening to become quite questionable), and we stand steadily to this;&#x2014;sorry only the firkin seems to <hi rend="italic">leak</hi>, and will not hold brine; so that Jane is at a loss whether not to venture on taking the whole out and packing it in crockery pots? I have advised her to take a <hi rend="italic">beer</hi> keg which is here, and putting the firkin inside that, fill the <hi rend="italic">interstice</hi> with brine, which I think sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do! We got, two days ago, a tinsmith over; he with a hot copper <hi rend="italic">wedge</hi> (I having tried in vain with <hi rend="italic">pokers</hi> &#x26;c) knocked open the Honey which is also much approved, and has now got itself packed away in gallipots.&#x2014; Our new servant is an excellent, handy attentive skilful woman; so that all is now quiet on that side too.</p>
<p>We are as well as usual, both of us, or rather better, except this, which I must tell you of, if you can give any advice in it. Yesterday, poor Jane who was busy &#x201C;covering a stool,&#x201C; or doing some such upholstery, in front of the sofa, saw Nero doing something wrong; and hastily whirling round to switch him or threaten switching, lucklessly hit her breast against the sofa-corner,&#x2014;right side, <hi rend="italic">between</hi> the center of the breast and top of the shoulder (as I understand it),&#x2014;and is ever since suffering pain, and suffering alarm still more. If we <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> a right surgeon, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> apply to one; if the thing grow worse, we must <pb id="pg-25-293" n="25:293"/>apply to one,&#x2014;can you tell us to whom? I am in hopes it will prove nothing; for when she keeps her right hand quite quiet, there is little or no pain, so I suppose it is muscular only. She is now <hi rend="italic">writing;</hi> and feels bound only to be very <hi rend="italic">steady;</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">looks</hi> very well otherwise.</p>
<p>Great noise here still about Wiseman and the Pope&#x2019;s Mountebankeries: I almost suppose there will be some thing need to be done in this foolish business, which has provoked everybody; so loud is the noise upon it, and not like passing away for some time. Speech enough in Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there will be about it! The flagstones and walls are all chalked &#x201C;No Popery!&#x201C; &#x201C;Burn the Pope&#x201C;; &#x201C;Kick the Pope&#x2019;s bottom&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Or perhaps <hi rend="italic">Barclay and Perkins&#x2019;s people</hi> will again interfere? That seems the more rational solution; I should less object to them (at least, if they broke no bones) on this new occasion perhaps!</p>
<p>This day week I sent my Mother a <hi rend="italic">N. B</hi>h <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>, which I conclude she received. Tell me what she has now got to read, and very specially how she is. Oh take care of her&#x2014; I know you will, and do, which is a great comfort to me.&#x2014; Darwin is ill of cold; Craik, as I hinted, is gone to Belfast; Leigh Hunt, Ballantyne, little Stores Smith are about setting up a &#x201C;Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s Journal&#x201C; again; poor little Smith (who has just married and came hither to live by Literature) investing his little fortune in the speculation,&#x2014;not a good one at all, I should say!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s London Journal</hi> had been pbd. <date when="1834">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835">35</date>. Stores Smith agreed to put up the capital to revive it, and the first no. was <date when="1850-12-07">7 Dec.</date> Hunt wrote to TC, <date when="1850-11-07">7 Nov.</date>, for a contribution: &#x201C;Is it possible that we could have the honour &#x26; glory of your name in it, and the more sequestered side of your nature? that is to say, the unantagonistic part of it,&#x2014;the more obviously loving or sympathetic portion&#x2014;or anything <hi rend="italic">not actually opposed to us &#x26; our pacifics</hi>,&#x2014;essay, memoir, criticism, pleasantry, pathos, or what not? &#x2026; [T]he pay (that is to say, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> pay) two guineas a page.&#x201C; TC responded affirmatively, Hunt writing to William Allingham, <date when="1850-11-22">22 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle is hearty for us, and will glorify our first number with a contribution&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Leigh Hunt</hi>, ed. T. Hunt [<date when="1862">1862</date>] 2:120). TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Two Hundred and Fifty Years Ago. (From a Waste-Paper Bag of T.

Hunt&#x2019;s promise of payment was not met, and he wrote TC, <date when="1851-06-30">30 June 1851</date>, after the journal had collapsed: &#x201C;Oh how vexed &#x26; mortified I was, on finding the condition in which you and all the other friends whose pens [Stores Smith] had encouraged me to invite into co-operation were to be left! Not that I supposed you cared anything for such poor profits as might have accrued. Indeed it was clear you did not.&#x201C; He complained of &#x201C;having ceased to receive any payment myself. &#x2026; And to this compliment was added the violation of every other engagement, the discontinuance of even personal consultations, and finally the insult of bearding the minister [Lord John Russell] in an article professing to be &#x2018;Our&#x2019; view of his politics, and then hindering me (by threats of not paying the printer) from disowning it in my own paper!! Such were the vagaries of the, I believe not on the whole ill intentioned, but uncouth, self-sufficient, &#x26; blunder-headed gentleman with whom I found myself suddenly &#x26; unaccountably linked, as if I had been walking arm in arm, in a dream, with a wild bull.&#x201C; Smith expressed his own view in his anon., &#x201C;Personal Reminiscences,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Freelance</hi> 3 (Manchester, <date when="1868-04">April 1868</date>):109&#x2013;10, 113&#x2013;15, 133&#x2013;35, that Hunt was untrustworthy, unreliable, and exactly like Skimpole in Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Bleak House:</hi> &#x201C;There remained a large residuum in Hunt&#x2019;s dealings &#x2026; which to say the least &#x2026; was &#x2018;fishy.&#x2019;&#x201C; See K.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Thanks for your pleasant letter. I inclose a cheque (is that the way to spell it?) for the money. Please to send a line or old newspaper; that I may know it has arrived.</p>
<p>I returned some days ago rather improved by my month in the country; in spite of all its unwholesomenesses&#x2014;late hours&#x2014;french cookery &#x26;c &#x26;c But the first thing I did was to give myself a <hi rend="italic">wrench</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">crush</hi> all in one on the ribs under my right breast, which has bothered me ever since and I am afraid is a more serious injury than I at first thought&#x2014;two days of mustard plasters <pb id="pg-25-295" n="25:295"/>have done little yet towards removing the pain. which I neglected for the first three days</p>
<p>I find the mud of our London streets perfectly abominable after the clean gravelly roads in Hampshire&#x2014;it is such a fatigue carrying up one&#x2019;s heavy winter petticoats! For the rest; home is always pleasantest to me after a long sojourn in a grand house, and solitude never so welcome as after a spell of <hi rend="italic">brilliant</hi> people&#x2014; One brilliant person at a time, and a little of him is a charming thing; but a whole houseful of brilliant people, shining all day and every day, makes one almost of George Sands opinion, that good honest stupidity is the best thing to associate with&#x2014;</p>
<p>I send you a little photograph of my Mothers miniature,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Kenneth Macleay; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420325-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:90</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-03-25">25 March 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> which I have had done on purpose for you&#x2014; It is not quite the sort of likeness one would wish to have, but at least it is a<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> like as the miniature</p>
<p>I will not wait till next year to write again; if I live&#x2014;</p>

<p>If you know Mr Glyde jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Glyde, historian, of Ipswich.</note> or take any interest in the Ipswich Mechanics Institute, as seems possible to me,&#x2014;you may perhaps hear of a certain Mr Maccall, a highly deserving friend of mine, whom, it appears, Mr G is now in treaty with about a Course of Lectures in your Town. If so, pray help in this matter as you can. I have addressed to Mr G. a kind of Testimony on the subject,&#x2014;which (if occasion arise) he will of course readily consent to shew you: that expresses my real opinion of the Gentleman in question; and will suggest to you what farther, if anything you can do in consequence</p>

<p>I have not heard Mr Maccall<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Maccall, writer and public speaker, known to TC since; see <ref target="volume-23/lt18480805-TC-WM-01"><sic>23:89</sic>TC to WM, <date when="1848-08-05">5 Aug. 1848</date></ref>.</note> lecture; but have read various Pieces of his writing, and have often had the pleasure of conversing with him; and can very freely testify that he is a man of original, penetrating and accomplished mind, who has read, observed and reflected much, and with an earnestness, sincerity, and sharpness of vision which are very uncommon in our epoch. A man of elevated, devout and manful character; who, for his years, has had many experiences in this world, and has generally conquered these, and not been conquered by them;
<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maccall had a varied career, starting in the dragoons, and then becoming involved with various churches, finally embracing Unitarianism, moving to London in <date when="1846">1846</date>, and supporting himself and his family by preaching and writing.</note>
 &#x02014;whose conclusions, whether they differ from the common or agree with the common, are emphatically his own and well worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>In the way of Lecturing, I should expect from him a free and lucid style of utterance, not rhetorical or ornamental so much as pregnant and impressive; tinged, on occasion, with generous affection and enthusiasm; tempered too perhaps with here and there a shade of pungent contradiction or hidden satiric humour;&#x02014;and, on the whole, whatever the subject were, conveying to other minds, in a very singular degree indeed, what to his own mind was fact and conviction, not hearsay, hypothesis and plausible commonplace. A Lecturer, or Speaker, extremely well worth encouraging to speak, among the kind now commonest among us!
  <note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC continued to encourage and recommend Maccall for many years; see, for instance, <ref target="volume-44/lt-18660702-TC-WM-01">TC to WM, <!-- 2 July 1867 is incorrect --><date when="1866-07-02">2 July 1866</date></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Lest I forget altogether, I will this day send you your 6/3 worth of stamps:&#x2014; provision for an immense series of Letters; of which, I hope, you will let me have my just share among others! Many thanks for your care about the purchases; the articles will come safe by and by; and in the meantime there is nothing going wrong for want of them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken wrote, <date when="1850-11-13">13 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I got all your bits of orders &#x2026; &#x26; sent them with Jardine on saturday I am sorry to find they were too late by one day You know it was thursday when I got your note and so there was no time lost However the Dr says there is to be another package of Hams soon when you may expect to get three good &#x2018;<foreign>Kilmarnocks</foreign>&#x2019; &#x26; a very small <hi rend="italic">greybeard</hi> [earthenware jug] of raspberry vinegar for Jane (of my own making).&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>We have got frosty weather these two days; and a kind of frost that is never welcome here: a dirty damp <hi rend="italic">frozen-fog</hi>, against which there is no defending of yourself except by strong exercise and <hi rend="italic">internal</hi>fire.

I hate that kind of temperature very much; and poor Jane, I doubt, is like to suffer from it if it last long. She has hurt herself on the breast lately, struck her breast on the corner of a sofa; and suffers somewhat by it since,&#x2014;suffers in her mind, by apprehensions, a great deal from it. She is otherwise as well as usual; and so I am: &#x201C;usual&#x201C; is no very high figure for either of us as you know!&#x2014; Indeed my poor &#x201C;inner man&#x201C; (I mean <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi> inner man) is in general very badly off indeed:&#x2014;and often there has risen in me the serious thought lately (which indeed is no <hi rend="italic">new</hi> one for the last ten years) that I ought actually <hi rend="italic">to get out of London</hi> and its tumults, to turn the closing years of my life to some better account than that of mere silent endurance of pain as here!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am bound for the Museum today: a certain unfortunate has written to me about a <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letter</hi> (sorrow on his labour, and <hi rend="italic">less</hi> power to his elbow!)&#x2014;by way of clearing myself of that small <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign>, I find I had better go at once and take a copy of said &#x201C;Cromwell Letter.&#x201C; May it prove the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of the set!</p>
<p>Jane applied the Liniment, and I believe still applies it; but does not yet admit that the hurt <hi rend="italic">in the breast</hi> is at all improved. The arm seems to have recovered; but the other (I find it is <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the center of of<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> the right breast; I said <hi rend="italic">above</hi>, last time) stands where it did. There is no outer discolaration, no hardness; nothing to be seen or felt (it appears); only a constant uneasiness, and pain when it is interfered with. The pain or the uneasiness, I conjecture, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a small matter; but poor Jane has got her Aunt Jeannie, her Aunt of Liverpool,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Welsh, JWC&#x2019;s maternal aunt, and Mary Welsh, wife of uncle John; for their deaths, see vol. 4 and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381015-TC-AC-01"><sic>10:200</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1838-10-15">15 Oct. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I know not whom else into her head; I see, she afflicts herself with apprehensions considerably, and is in bad spirits about her hurt. Mrs Wedgwood was once hurt somewhat so; and tells her it went quite away, but took a year first, and Brodie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Benjamin Brodie, surgeon.</note> himself could do nothing for it. We must just be <pb id="pg-25-298" n="25:298"/>patient; this thing, once one is used to its presence, will not frighten so much.&#x2014; We have at present the addition of harsh weather; dirty <hi rend="italic">frozen-fog</hi> weather; which does neither of us a kindness. I often wonder how my poor Mother is getting on amid the storms? My own inside is in the queasiest condition; and I often wish I were far off in the quiet country and had a horse to ride! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Cor inquietum est</hi></foreign> [The heart is unquiet], saith St Augustine,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> bk. 1, ch. 1.</note>&#x2014;especially when the bowels are gone to ruin! Tell us punctually how my Mother is; and do your best to guard her against the weather and other injuries. Ah me!</p>
<p>Poor Dr Hunter&#x2019;s black Note was one of the saddest to me I have seen, this long while. A sad dissolution of partnership to him indeed.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle wrote to Janet Hanning, <date when="1850-11-25">25 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;about an hour ago the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> arrived from Moffat where he has been since Friday week with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hunter&#x2014;his mother M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hunter has been very ill for a good while she died yesterday at ten oclock&#x201C; (MS: Yale).</note> Poor fellow, he tried to cower as low as possible, and nestle in the nook where he was born: but here too the Destroyer finds him, here too there is notice given, Thou must begone! Send my kind sympathies to him, poor fellow, when you write, if it seem to you the expression of such a thing can be of the least alleviation to him.&#x2014; And poor John Carlyle,&#x2014;by all means use me in anything you think could help the poor simple soul in the state he is in.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken wrote TC, [ca. end of <date when="1850-10">Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;A letter has lately come to one of the Ecclefechan Bells from John Carlyle enquiring very earnestly for his brother Tom hinting sensibly at intolerable hardships in the shape of sickness &#x26; poverty but adds that he has now got into a situation &#x26; is mainly anxious to hear about his brother.&#x201C; John Carlyle, TC&#x2019;s half-brother in Canada.</note> I suppose it is little help, beyond what he has, that mortal man could yield him: but his sad state often comes before me, and gives rise to many thoughts.</p>
<p>I am still unoccupied except with reading &#x26;c: in fact, my state of <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> arrangement is such as to forbid the &#x201C;rage of composition&#x201C; just now, if there were life in me to conceive such a purpose in my present humour. John Chorley recommends a <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> German watering place (Green Country, Rhineland or elsewhere) so soon as the winter is over. Perhaps? The fact is, I must decide on trying something for myself, if such wretched <hi rend="italic">prolapsus</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c don&#x2019;t please to abate by and by.&#x2014; &#x2014; Here is Jamie&#x2019;s Newspaper, come <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week,&#x2014;the first instance of such a thing. The No Popery continues; and there is still nothing else.&#x2014; I must off thro&#x2019; the dim haze; no sun will get out today.

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Will you send me the exact <hi rend="italic">name</hi> and address of Shine Lalor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denys Shyne (Shine) Lawlor.</note>&#x2014;is he not <hi rend="italic">John</hi>, or something else, besides <hi rend="italic">Shine?</hi> As to the Address, I suppose <hi rend="italic">Killarney</hi> itself will do, if he is still resident in his Castle thereabouts. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi> the <pb id="pg-25-301" n="25:301"/>Christian name of Dr Cane,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert.</note> Kilkenny?&#x2014; I am to send (as you perhaps guess) a certain volume to each of these gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, by way of testifying, in a most imperfect manner, what a remembrance I have of them. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>You seem to make rapid way with your Tenant Association: indeed, I see clearly, that is the direct road into the centre of the Abyss;&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">facilis descensus</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">averni</hi></foreign> [the descent into hell is easy],<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 6:126. Vergil reads &#x201C;Averno.&#x201C; The rest of the quotation reads, in trans.: &#x201C;but to recall your steps, and reascend to the upper air, this is labor, this is work.&#x201C;</note> if you will take the metaphor in good part; for surely, if the World-Cloaca <hi rend="italic">have</hi> any bottom, I do clearly perceive it lies there.</p>
<p>Our poor old friend the Pope has committed a sad blunder in sending his pasteboard Cardinals with their Bull thunder over to us just now! All men think it an impertinence and futile infatuation on the part of the old gent<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> and among the general mass of the English people there is such an uproar as I have not seen for twenty years past. Of which I cannot say, for my own part, that I altogether disapprove. The Pope may depend upon it, we will by no means come back to <hi rend="italic">him;</hi> never, thro&#x2019; all Eternity, to him! We may find worse fellows too (nay I expect far worse,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy omits everything from this point on to the penultimate sentence of the paragraph.</note> on occasion); but we are travelling, these three centuries now, quite in the opposite direction, and ha<supplied>[ve]</supplied> not, I think (for all our bleeding feet and bad weather), the smallest vestige of a notion to turn back!&#x2014; In brief, it will not surprise me at all if, when the Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> meets, a <hi rend="italic">Law</hi> (after infinite jargon) is passed, to send Wiseman a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> about their business again, and prohibit any British Subject henceforth from importing ware of that kind into this Country. The beautiful &#x201C;principles of toleration,&#x201C;&#x2014;in which I myself do not believe a jot,&#x2014;will receive some illustration in this business; and to me, sure enoug<supplied>[h]</supplied> (if I could have patience with the vile temporary <hi rend="italic">dus<supplied>[t]</supplied></hi> this beating of Humbug against Humbug, is the destruction of nonsense to such and such extent, and ought to be regarded as a gain. For the rest, I warn you in any case to take no offence ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> us, you in Ireland; for we do not in the least mean you! That is truth; and I am very glad to see <hi rend="italic">the Nation</hi> teaching that, and hope you will all along keep it well in mind.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, in point of real talent (&#x2019;bating perhaps a little worldly wisdom, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">savoir-faire</hi></foreign>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not quite its forte), seems to me the cleverest Weekly Paper I read. Really on Saturday nights there is none of them that (spite of the exotic colour) has so much the ring of the real metal in it. Go on and prosper!&#x2014; &#x2014; I have had some difficulty to defend you, to myself and others, for voting against &#x201C;the Godless Colleges.&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Young Ireland had been in favor of the three nondenominational Queen&#x2019;s Colleges when Peel first proposed them in <date when="1845">1845</date>. But the Roman Catholic bishops were divided, sensitive about their own influence and fearful that the colleges would offer inadequate safeguards for the faith and morals of the students. Duffy came round to advising that Roman Catholic students should not attend them unless certain reforms were made.</note> Beware of that; look on both sides <pb id="pg-25-302" n="25:302"/>of that! What if this that poor dark angry mortals now call &#x201C;Godless Colleges,&#x201C; were actually the beginning of the real <hi rend="italic">Religion</hi> of the Future for Ireland and for us all;&#x2014;destined to live, and rise ever higher <hi rend="italic">heavenward</hi> (I grant you it is not very high just yet!) when Papism, Lutherism, and so many other <hi rend="italic">isms</hi> had rotted fairly into Ragfair in minds of all men!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Heaven love you always, Dear Duffy; I meant only to write a word, and you see&#x2014;!&#x2014; Yours always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest Helen,</salute>
<p>&#x201C;The Immortal Gods&#x201C; are not favourable to writing this day. Firstly, we have &#x2018;a London Fog&#x2019; coming on, and if it advance at the same rate in half an hour more I should need candles to write by; secondly my morning hours have been unavoidably taken up in rehabilitating my chief winter-gown, and now I am in momently expectation of Miss Williams Wynn who is in town for two days and has written that she will come today betwixt 2 and 4&#x2014;and then, today I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> write to John Carlyle who asked last night in a letter to his brother that &#x201C;Jane would write to him <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> about that accident&#x201C;&#x2014;with all this bearing me away from you, however I feel as if it would be a sort of sin not to tell you at once how grateful I feel for your and Jeanies letters containing such kind and also&#x2014;oh how rare in this world! such <hi rend="italic">judicious</hi> sympathy&#x2014;and to relieve you also from any painful speculating about my accident <hi rend="italic">more than the occasion requires</hi>&#x2014; The day before yesterday I was sensible, for the first time, of a considerable diminution of the pain, it has been growing less and less ever since; I really <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it is going away altogether; I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> there will be no return of it; and from the first minute I could assure myself it was <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> to feel better I begun to cheer up my heart&#x2014; Oh God forbid that I should die a <hi rend="italic">lingering</hi> death, trying the patience of those about me; beside a Husband who <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not avoid letting me see how little patience his own ailments have left him for any body else&#x2019;s&#x2014;should <hi rend="italic">such a thing</hi> come upon me in reality, I should go away from here, I think, and ask <hi rend="italic">one of you</hi> to tend me and care for me in some little place of my own&#x2014;even my low spirits about the thing which in the first days I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not conceal from him&#x2014;nor in fact did I think there was any obligation on me to <hi rend="italic">keep up appearances</hi> with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> brought down on me <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a tempest of <hi rend="italic">scornful</hi> and wrathful words, such charges of &#x201C;impatience&#x201C; &#x201C;cowardliness,&#x201C; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">impiety</hi>,&#x201C; &#x201C;contemptibility,&#x201C; that I shut myself up altogether and nothing should ever wring from me another expression of suffering&#x2014;to <hi rend="small-caps">him</hi>&#x2014; The more thankful did I feel for your and Jeanies kind toleration of my anxiety&#x2014; So well both of you just hit the right tone of treating such a state of mind, speaking hopefully to me and at the same time not making <hi rend="italic">light</hi> of my accident, nor <hi rend="italic">mocking</hi> at my fears&#x2014; I wonder after all how I come to be grown such a coward, for I was certainly one of the bravest little children alive&#x2014;used to bear pain like an Indian&#x2014;take hissing <hi rend="italic">Ganders</hi> by the neck&#x2014;and show myself up to every emergence&#x2014; I suppose my bravery active and passive must have been like most of my other good qualities &#x201C;for the occasion got up&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">assumed</hi> to gain my Fathers approbation, <pb id="pg-25-304" n="25:304"/>to be <hi rend="italic">praised</hi> by him, and kissed, and &#x201C;loved very much indeed&#x201C;&#x2014; Oh! that was the right handle to take me up by&#x2014;not &#x201C;shoving me out of creation&#x201C; for my faults and weaknesses, not trying to make me heroic by <hi rend="italic">abusing</hi> me as &#x201C;contemptible and impious&#x201C;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>How much in these two weeks past I have thought of my Aunt Jeanie and of my &#x201C;aunt Mary&#x201C;&#x2014;your Mother&#x2014;the latter I never saw in her illness but I heard often of her Roman fortitude,&#x2014;and my aunt Jeanie Oh! <hi rend="italic">her</hi> I was with in her last weeks, and was the first who found out about her breast&#x2014;and Oh if ever a woman behaved like an angel it was that one When I think of her sitting whole days altering at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> ill-made marriage clothes, with her sad but ever gentle loving face, and trying to keep up every body&#x2019;s spirits, while she was already suffering agonies day and night&#x2014;when I think of my Mother finding fault with her for always &#x201C;using her left hand&#x201C; of myself <hi rend="italic">laughing</hi> at her because when I galloped my pony and hers followed, she <hi rend="italic">screamed</hi> (with <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> she told me long after) Oh God when I look back over that whole time I feel such love and veneration for that woman! I think if I had her again for one day one hour that I might fall at her feet and ask her pardon for never having enough recognized the angel in her, till I came to <hi rend="italic">realize</hi> thro selfish fears all she had to suffer and triumph over! Do you know what she said when I had by a sort of inspiration discovered her state and insisted on telling my Mother that she might be brought immediately to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x201C;Oh no dear Jeanie! for Gods sake not yet&#x2014;not yet&#x2014;just wait till Mary and the children are gone back to Liverpool&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">dont spoil the poor childrens visit for them</hi>&#x2014;it does them so much good to be here&#x201C;! And the night before that on which she died&#x2014;when I had gone to her bedside when she was in a paroxysm of pain, as soon as she could speak again&#x2014;she looked to me and said &#x201C;Oh Jeanie <hi rend="italic">do</hi> go to your bed&#x2014;you are sure to have such <hi rend="italic">a headach</hi> to morrow&#x201C;!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You are all very kind, to run about looking for scope to my whims and <pb id="pg-25-305" n="25:305"/>schemes. By this same post I had a Letter from the Doctor, reporting to the same effect as you, but more in detail, about Kelton, Cargenholm &#x26;c.&#x2014; It is clear that there is nothing in the least like suiting me but the <hi rend="italic">lease</hi> of that thing you call &#x201C;Drungun&#x2019;s Lodge,&#x201C;&#x2014;if I read you right?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >High Kelton, advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1850-12-10">10 Dec.</date>, as a &#x201C;Beautiful Small Estate&#x201C; of 80 acres, 3 mi. S of Dumfries, to be sold &#x201C;by Public Roup,&#x201C; <date when="1851-01-24">24 Jan. 1851</date>, at a &#x201C;Reduced Upset Price of &#xa3;3,000.&#x201C; Drungan&#x2019;s Lodge, on the banks of the Cargen, ca. 1 mi. from Dumfries, was to be advertised as to let, <date when="1851-02-24">24 Feb. 1851</date>, application to be made to James Aitken, painter, Dumfries.</note> Pausing on the Brig of Cargen that day of my walk, I very well remember seeing to my right, on the south bank of the Cargen, perhaps 3/4 of a mile off, a not too brilliant white-looking House among woods; a narrowish Cart-Lane (just across the Brig) leading towards it along the course, or rather <hi rend="italic">up</hi> the course, of the Cargen. That is Dungun then? The rent, at &#xa3;20, with a field or &#x201C;park,&#x201C; is what surprises me! Really if there is a habitable house, of any capability at all, to be had on these terms, it seems to deserve a little consideration.</p>
<p>Will James, at his leisure, examine this Place a little farther; let us know more correctly what rooms, and of what size, &#x26;c &#x26;c there are in it; what the &#x201C;park&#x201C; is;&#x2014;and how it comes that a place of that kind is to be let for such a rent. A &#xa3;20 were well worth paying annually to have a quiet sleeping room, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> sitting room, and convenience for boiling a porridge-pot, to fly to in extremity! Our old drunken Landlady of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> House, it appears, is suddenly dead; whereupon, as we understand, the House falls into the hands of Attorneys and money-lenders; so that it is very likely we shall have to lift anchor out of this at any rate. Tell us about this shelter on the Cargen!&#x2014; In seasons when I get very ill, it seems to me there ought no cause whatever to detain me in this noisy captivity; then again, when I get better any day, and reflect what I possess here, and cannot hope to attain or attempt in any country place,&#x2014;abundant Books, total <hi rend="italic">freedom</hi> from the question of money-income, power to <hi rend="italic">choose</hi> my society from the best of the kingdom and even to be <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> (rather than otherwise) of being and continuing poor among them, and flunkeyless and carriageless among so many flunkies and equipages,&#x2014;I feel as if it would be very rash to cut London, too. And so one wavers hither and thither; and is a fool,&#x2014;and unable to carry his sick <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> with perfect propriety! Tell us about this Drungan&#x2019;s at any rate,&#x2014;and write the name plain, for one thing.</p>
<p>Hogg wrote and Beard wrote; and to cut the thing short, Jane and I went, and it is <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, and I suppose now fairly got to hand in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> The ugliest of Portraits, and <hi rend="italic">angry</hi> as a Hyaena; the foolish creature wouldn&#x2019;t let me sit as I wished, but insisted on having my head perked up &#x26;c:&#x2014;Jane says it is &#x201C;extremely like&#x201C; withal!&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister. Y<hi rend="italic">s</hi> ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Can you learn for me anything about this unfortunate creature whose Letter I inclose: is she a begging imposter; or a poor old woman of some merit endeavouring to escape the Atropos<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the three Fates who cut the thread of life with a pair of scissors. The woman is unidentified.</note> scissors a little longer by &#x201C;Literary exertions&#x201C; on those terms? The story sickens one&#x2019;s heart. On the whole, what is one to do; or can nothing properly be done,&#x2014;except perhaps send a few shillings and say, &#x201C;God help you, go&#x201C;?&#x2014; Tell me if you know anything or nothing, in two days. I <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> the Address; not to bother you with returning the Letter itself,&#x2014;which burn rather. We got home under good omens; and are not the least hurt by the pleasant evening we had. May never worse be among us!&#x2014; Come soon to Chelsea again; and let us hear more of your news;&#x2014;and good be ever with you, dear Forster<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At this time TC was starting to consider a study of Frederick the Great, reading widely and frustrated by the paucity of reliable information.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>John wrote to us not long ago of your being well and all being well; for which, as for his constant attention in that matter, we are much indebted to him: I want now to get another Note from him, as well as to tell you how we ourselves are; so I write today before going out. Our weather here is very gentle in temperature, accompanied with a liberal share of mists and mud,&#x2014;which I suppose will mean, for you in Annandale, great quantities of rain. We imagine these don&#x2019;t suit you quite so ill as harsh frost; and will hope therefore that you are still moving about in something like your usual way. You do not venture out, I suppose, except on a rare day when the weather is favourable; <pb id="pg-25-307" n="25:307"/>but you keep stirring, I doubt not, within doors, and never fall lazy,&#x2014;which was always a merit of my good Mother&#x2019;s since the very first discovery of her! Jenny too is with you, or was lately; which would keep the house livelier. With all your rains, too, you have the satisfaction of <hi rend="italic">seeing the sky</hi> now and then; which we here, in this season, are often deprived of for a course of days, nothing but a dark blanket of smoky fog being spread over all Nature for us.&#x2014; We hold up in health very handsomely; Jane has taken no cold yet, goes out in some omnibus whenever the day is not quite wretched; I hear nothing lately of her <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi>, and believe it is getting well, tho&#x2019; she does not seem to like any speech about it. I myself am decidedly better than when I wrote last: I come and go as very slight accidents direct;&#x2014;have in fact nothing wrong about me, except an incurably squeamish liver and stomach, which disease however is capable of standing instead of many! I generally go out for an hour&#x2019;s walking before bedtime again; the little <foreign>snaffle</foreign> of a <foreign><hi rend="italic">messin</hi></foreign> called &#x201C;Nero&#x201C; commonly goes with me, runs snuffling into every hole, or <foreign><hi rend="italic">pirrs</hi></foreign> about by my side like a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarry</hi></foreign> rat (delighted by a mere nothing); and returns home the joyfullest and dirtiest little dog one need wish to see. He was <hi rend="italic">given away</hi> to A. Sterling some weeks ago,&#x2014;somewhat to my satisfaction;&#x2014;but made <foreign><hi rend="italic">moyen</hi></foreign> [the means], on his first call afterwards, to be taken back, and reinstated in all his rights,&#x2014;the wretched <foreign>messin</foreign> that he is;&#x2014;and so eats bones as formerly.</p>
<p>We are very quiet at this season for most part; and I often think of trying some Book again, which is the only amends I can get of this bad world and its ill-usage of me at all. I suppose we must come to that by and by: but &#x201C;Gude guide us to, Sawny; I think he&#x2019;s stiff to the rise, man!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400723-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:204</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-07-23">23 July 1840</date></corr></ref>. &#x201C;Sawny&#x201C; is for &#x201C;Sandy&#x201C; (i.e., Alexander).</note> Dreadfully stiff indeed, poor old spavined <foreign>garron</foreign>!</p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your friendly human Letter; which gave us much entertainment in reading (at breakfast-time the other day), and is still pleasant to think of. One gets so many <hi rend="italic">in</hi>-human letters, ovine, bovine porcine &#x26;c &#x26;c.: I wish you would write a little oftener; when the beneficent Daimon suggests, fail not to lend ear to him.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to a pleasant evening or two when you get to Town:&#x2014;a melancholy errand, indeed; but, as you see, there is good in all things! By no means fail us. Any evening, almost <hi rend="italic">any</hi> evening or day. I quit my pretended studies here daily between 2 and 3 o&#x2019;clock, and go out to walk in idleness,&#x2014;if that hour happen to suit you. At 5 there is some kind of dinner of herbs;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 15:17.</note> fit for the dyspeptic constitution; suitable potluck for an abstemious philosopher that happens to be passing: tea is at 7, and there burns a fire upstairs for narcotic nicotian purposes. We are hardly ever out; nor, alas, are my employments almost ever of a kind which it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> proper to interrupt!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I left these parts in the very end of <date when="1850-07">July</date>, and fled into S. Wales, by Bath and Bristol; one of the most thoroughly down-broken mortals; seeking <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> in this world, and knowing beforehand that there was none, most likely, to be found. A visiting man, with his liver all gone to wreck, is a terrible fellow in these epochs of the world! Sir Lytton Bulwer would really do well to build some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Diversorium</hi></foreign> [small lodging], <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hospitium</hi></foreign> [Inn], or the like Establishment, with an old dumb cleanly woman in it, and no <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi> within earshot, for poor creatures in that situation, that they might repose there for a week or two on occasion.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bulwer Lytton advocated hydropathy in his <hi rend="italic">Confessions of a Water Patient</hi> (<date when="1845">1845</date>).</note> But he won&#x2019;t; no one will.&#x2014; I fled out of Wales, after 3 weeks or more, dumb, opening not my mouth; fared along, under varieties of horrors, to my Mother&#x2019;s house in Annandale, and there flung myself down,&#x2014;sorry only that I could not lie down in silence forever. Such a business is the brewing of <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> in a heart otherwise given to acidity. I went no farther than the Border; did nothing while there but saunter over the moors, or lie idle by the side of brooks: in about a month I had again to move; came over to Cumberland, saw Tennyson, the Speddings, and numerous to me insignificant or even impertinent &#x201C;Pikes&#x201C; of Langdale, Pikes and Fells and Becks of this and that;&#x2014;and in a day or two more, got packed into the Express Train, and after about 10 hours of screaming clangour, and chaotic raging <hi rend="italic">Dissonance</hi> which I think might fit the Devil for dinner-music (if he were in <pb id="pg-25-309" n="25:309"/>want of such a thing),&#x2014;was shot out at Euston Square, and so ended the Northern part of my tour. We were in Hampshire three weeks more: and at the end of all, I could not say that I was in the least better; but now after two months of almost continual silence and isolation, I do begin to feel sometimes a little more composed. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi!</hi></foreign> But it is pusillanimous to lament; so I will say no more, but hope the gods will give me again some bit of work to do: it is really all the amends one can get of this perverse world,&#x2014;which at any rate is so rapidly taking itself away, and making us <hi rend="italic">rid</hi> of its perversities and shortcomings! Mrs Alfred is a very nice creature, cheerful, good-mannered, intelligent, sincere-looking: Alfred and she, I since hear, are in these parts, &#x201C;looking for houses&#x201C;; but I have seen nothing of them since.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Tennysons were staying with Tennyson&#x2019;s sister and brother-in-law, Cecilia (<date when="1817">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1909">1909</date>) and Edmund Law Lushington (<date when="1811">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893">93</date>; <ref target="volume-25/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17210"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-TC-JF-01"><sic>17:86</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>), at Park House, Maidstone.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your assiduous investigations about those Houses! I must write you a word on the subject, tho&#x2019; my time is very limited, and my judgement on the question none of the clearest.</p>
<p>Jane is much taken with your description of Cullivat, the spacious rooms, nice grounds &#x26;c: indeed it is an inviting outlook from these smoky imprisonments. But, alas, when I consult her what I am to tell you about it, she answers with a satirical humour which cannot be called &#x201C;hidden,&#x201C; That the real <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> is, I cannot resolve to leave London, and become a quiescent zero in the country, just yet; and that I ought not to bother my friends with negotiating about such a thing!&#x2014; Alas, alas, and there is some truth in what she says; my desperate desire to be out of some fit of bilious misery makes me snatch at any hope; and then, when the fit alleviates itself again, I feel what I possess here, and that I ought to stand a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> degree of sickness for it. Thus is the poor sick wretch driven hither and thither, in a very foolish way! It appears also that whenever I do resolve on taking to the country, I must carry <pb id="pg-25-310" n="25:310"/>not myself only but another on my back. Surely, surely, some time or other, such a resolution must be taken nevertheless!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, do not quite lose sight of Cullivat, but do not bother yourself too much about it. The thing I had and have chiefly in my desire is rather a place of shelter, to fly to for a month or two in summer or when over-wearied here: in this view the Drungan concern (or something like that; into which perhaps Jenny, and our Mother and the Dr himself might be drawn to participate) than a lease of of<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> the Cullivat mansion and formal establishment there. However, do not quite lose it out of sight either; you can tell us the exact rent of it at any rate;&#x2014;also any thing more about the &#x201C;Lodge&#x201C; on the Cargen: is it a thing <hi rend="italic">like</hi> your house? It seemed to me to be of two stories? And what is the &#x201C;park&#x201C; attached? I think I remember the old Priest Dalrymple<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> lately stationed there: a very ignorant windy idle soul in grey knit pantaloons, whom I once, somewhere or other, <supplied>[met]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">blethering</hi></foreign> over whisky punch, &#x201C;above thirty year ago&#x201C;;&#x2014;done with his whisky now, poor soul!&#x2014; &#x2014; Nothing has been settled about our own house here; but I suppose there will be something opened to us on the subject next term, which is now within a few days&#x2019; distance. &#x201C;A man is not a <hi rend="italic">bird</hi> that flits so easily from bough to bough; a man is not a <hi rend="italic">snail</hi> that carries his house on his back&#x201C;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014;the more is the sorrow, says the evil spirit in one!</p>
<p>We have had much mud and rain and drizzle; and seem now in the fair road towards frost. Jane seems pretty well; and <hi rend="italic">says</hi> nothing more about her hurt, nor seems willing to have me speak about it: I do hope it is practically <hi rend="italic">away</hi>, and will not even give her poor imagination much trouble. I perceive however she is still shy of using the right hand for heavy work: poor little soul, she has a great load of sickness to carry too. This morning came a Letter from Alick, which they will send you; all well too with him. <closer><salute>Best regards to James; and so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, dear Sister. /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here, this morning, is a Letter from Alick; which a little hastens the purpose <pb id="pg-25-311" n="25:311"/>I already had of writing you a word, in answer to the last messages you sent me. You are very punctual in writing; and you may believe me I am duly thankful, whether I say so or not. I in general have little or nothing that I care to write, being very still and as if quite <hi rend="italic">mute</hi> in these dim winter weeks.&#x2014; Poor Alick, as my Mother and you all will be delighted to learn, is going on tolerably,&#x2014;all but his rheumatism, which we may hope is but temporary;&#x2014;his finances seem still a little confused, as was from of old the tendency with him; but they appear to be coming fairly round too: and in the meanwhile, hope, and <supplied>[hon]</supplied>est industry with an aim before it, are his portion in this world; the best porti<supplied>[on]</supplied> this world can give to any of us.&#x2014; Some time in <date when="1850-10">October</date> I wrote a long Letter t<supplied>[o Al]</supplied>ick; but he does not appear to have received it at the time of writing.</p>
<p>We hear from Auchtertool that you have a project of a visit thither before you. Thomas Erskine is at Linlathen, just now; if you go to Fife, Dundee is but an hour or two farther: a little excursion to those parts would knock the rust a little off you. But do not stay long; our Mother will be unwilling enough to let you stay long! Her <hi rend="italic">Crookshank</hi>that I spoke of has never yet come; but I suppose it will: at any rate we are getting some little Parcel ready, to come one of these weeks, either with that Book in it or something else. In the meanwhile, you can say we are busy eating <hi rend="italic">the Ham;</hi> item the <hi rend="italic">Butter</hi>,&#x2014;and with regard to the latter it is remarked that no equal, not to say better, article of the kind has come athwart our experience for many years back. Thanks to all the kind souls for their care of us!</p>
<p>You would read Jean&#x2019;s Letter about the Houses in the Dumfries neighbourhood. If you happen to be again in that quarter, you might a little continue your investigation in that respect; but I think it is by no means worth while to go on purpose: my one temptation into those parts w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be some place where I could quietly lodge for a month or two in the year; to take up <hi rend="italic">house</hi> there, and begin life <hi rend="italic">again</hi>,&#x2014;this, always when the extreme pressure of bilious misery is withdrawn, seems a quite unwise thing to me. The &#x201C;Dungan&#x2019;s Lodge&#x201C; place, of which she gives no new explanation, seemed to me the likeliest. Alas, alas, it is a terrible pity one hadn&#x2019;t a body that would stand tear and wear a little!</p>
<p>Tonight John Chorley and I are to go to the <hi rend="italic">Society of Arts</hi> in the Adelphi, to hear Adams the Coachbuilder (who is eager about my going) &#x201C;lecture on Railway Extension.&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Bridges Adams lectured on &#x201C;Railway Extension and Influence&#x201C; at the fifth ordinary meeting of the Society of Arts.</note> [&#x201C;]<foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [Well and good].&#x201C; Poor Adams, I learn, is fallen utterly bankrupt, and his Stratford Establish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> has vanished: poor fellow; one reason more to make me go and countenance him.&#x2014; We had <pb id="pg-25-312" n="25:312"/>Wilkinson of Highgate (Hampstead!) here lately, with one O&#x2019;Doherty, a blethering Irish-French socialist, without sense;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Tho&#x2019; I have hardly half a minute, and am in bad case otherwise, I will write you a word before the Post go.&#x2014; Three days since, I addressed some lines to you at Scotsbrig, enclosing a Letter from Alick which had arrived: I hope they have used the freedom to open that at Scotsbrig, and read before forwarding it. Alick reported himself well, with the exception of some rheumatism; and had nothing else of very interesting to say.</p>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>The Christmas Box has duly arrived, an hour or two after your Note: all <pb id="pg-25-315" n="25:315"/>safe and right;&#x2014;opulent in wholesome sapid materials; a friendly memento of one that is kind to us always on his distant coast; to whom be all thanks for this and much other goodness! How can this, or anything else I have ever experienced from that friendly shore of the Bristol Channel, awaken <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than kind thoughts? Nothing that was not worthy of recognition and admiration ever met me from that quarter. A &#x201C;patience&#x201C; especially which had no limits, dwells most in my memory at present. I declare I feel often ashamed. For indeed I was as near the <hi rend="italic">nadir</hi>, last time, as I have almost ever been in life; and probably you never did communicate with a creature more sick and heavy-laden of body and of soul than I was, and proved myself now and then to be, on my last visit to you. Oh, Heaven! But I will try to grow better;&#x2014;at any rate I will pray to have friends as tolerant as the Boverton one; and be thankful, under my dark sky, for this and the other kindly-shining star!&#x2014; That green lawn, little Dumpy&#x2019;s excellent hot coffee, the morning and evening sun, the very chanticleers and jackasses: all is getting quite a beautiful, and pathetic and poetic colour with me, in that Welsh &#x201C;scene of memory.&#x201C; Soft fall the weather on it, and nothing but good be there, whether I come back or not! Llanntwit, St Donat&#x2019;s, the green network of intricate lanes, the mouldering dumb ruins, vigorous living vegetations good and bad; the vacant stony shores watched by Billy Jones, and big Ocean-melody that sings and groans forever: how can I ever forget these things?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I continued very sickly after leaving you, and got little but endless chagrin, and misery too sensible only to myself, all the time I staid in Scotland, and after it, during other excursions I had to make on my way homewards, and beyond home,&#x2014;for my wife was absent when I first came here, and I had to join her for three weeks among gay people in Hampshire; and did not get <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> home till towards the end of <date when="1850-09">September</date>; <hi rend="italic">as</hi> sick, according to all indexes of personal sensation, as when I had left. A hopeless thing this of ministering to an Incurable! For many weeks at home I continued the same dreary course; and not till very lately began to feel a decided settlement of turbulences; and a sterner (but not less beautiful) kind of <hi rend="italic">Cosmos</hi> beginning to announce itself amid that horrid Chaos again. Cosmos stern as Death itself (for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, in some sense, what they call Death) but beautiful also as Eternity and the inexpugnable Realm of the Gods.&#x2014; &#x2014; Unhappily a wretched &#x201C;Dinner-party,&#x201C; of the most unwholesome and unpleasant sort, the other evening, has for the present quite overset me again; and all is slush and scandalous mud as before, till we rally again! Of such stuff are poor human creatures made.</p>
<p>I do not enter much into the &#x201C;Papal Aggression&#x201C; affair;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I am Protestant enough to view it with equanimity, and even with a kind of goodwill it seems to me the old Pope ought really to be warned that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is out of the game, for one; that after having beaten out his brains for 300 years, with <pb id="pg-25-316" n="25:316"/>Cromwellian and other hammers,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Cromwell (<date when="1485">1485</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1540">1540</date>), earl of Essex, Henry VIII&#x2019;s agent in the dissolution of the monasteries, was known as the Hammer of the Monasteries; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:27.</note> we do expect he will now die! If the poor English people can do this, I shall not be sorry. But if they fail to do it, and whatever they do or fail to do, I shall understand that windbag knocked against windbag will infallibly further the <hi rend="italic">collapse</hi> of things inflated; and so, in any case, the Papal Aggression is grist to my mill.&#x2014; &#x2014; I write nothing in these months, nor have any prospect of writing; but do suppose that, if I live, there may come such a ti<supplied>[me]</supplied> again. <closer><salute>God bless you always, dear Redwood.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>At the winter solstice, when Christmas Carols are about breaking out, and men are remembering old friends, I again write to you. For many months past, I have been too sickly and dispirited to write to any one; indeed, of late, the burden of life falls so heavy on me, and things in this strange epoch are so intricate around and in me, I feel it a kind of necessity to hold my peace, and contemplate the Inextricable without attempting to <hi rend="italic">name</hi> it at all. I do confidently hope to <hi rend="italic">re</hi>acquire the use of speech, and with it much human joy at present very much forborne:&#x2014;in the meanwhile I can say: old friends are only the more dear and sacred to me that I have to look at them as if I were already in Hades,&#x2014;as if they and I had no portion but in Eternity, and our speech to one another, for the present, were as that of Gods, a mute symbolical one! Perhaps you understand all this, out of your own experience too; at any rate, I know you will forgive it, and look kindly on it as you do on all things.</p>
<p>We regularly hear of you thro&#x2019; Miss Wynne and otherwise; we had Berlin visitors not long since, and looked direct upon faces that had lately looked on you. Many kind and pleasant messages have we had, and none that was not kind and pleasant, from Herrn Varnhagen; for all which, accept gratitude if we have nothing better!&#x2014; The other evening Miss Wynne was with us; and we hoped to have persuaded her again tomorrow; but she decides to pass <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Christmas day, the first after her Father&#x2019;s death,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He d., <date when="1850-09-02">2 Sept.</date>, at 20 Grafton St.</note> in solitude and silence. Which also we reckon to be good.&#x2014; You will be rejoiced to learn that, since this final consummation and winding up of her many toils and sorrows, her <pb id="pg-25-317" n="25:317"/>health appears decidedly to begin improving; and friends look forward with assurance towards better days for this excellent and amiable person. Of Milnes, B&#xF6;lte, &#x26;c I say nothing; for I suppose you hear of them much oftener than I do, at this season of the year.</p>
<p>But let me state my special errand before my paper end. I have a favour to ask on this occasion; and I know you will do in it for me what you can,&#x2014;my only apprehension is that you put yourself about to do <hi rend="italic">more.</hi> Beware of that latter extreme; and hear in brief what the matter is. A certain Herr Neuberg, who has lived long in England, and has now revisited Germany (a W&#xfc;rtemburger, I think), is resident at Bonn this winter; and I think meditates some journey to Berlin soon. He is a man of unostentatious but truly superior character; a most pious, clear, resolute, modest and earnest man; with excellent insights and faculties; well acquainted both with our literature and yours, and indeed knows England and English affairs better probably than any stranger you have met. This Neuberg, who was twenty years a merchant in this country, and then, finding himself possessed of a competence and totally without enthusiasm for more, decided to give up business, and live henceforth among intellectual objects,&#x2014;appears to have produced some small volume for the Press (I think it consists mainly of translations from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, &#x201C;upon the subject of Work&#x201C;);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Neuberg was from W&#xfc;rzburg and thus a Bavarian (or Franconian) and not a W&#xfc;rtemberger. He met Varnhagen at Berlin, <date when="1851-06">June 1851</date>, to consult him further about his proposed book, <hi rend="italic">Beitr&#xE4;ge zum Evangelium der Arbeit</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1851">1851</date>). Encouraged by TC, from whom he had &#x201C;heard so much talk of you,&#x201C; he wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1851-01-11">11 Jan. 1851</date>, explaining that the book translated &#x201C;pieces and articles from Carlyle&#x2019;s writing; and in particular such as contain thoughts on <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, and anything which, in a wider sense, has some bearing on it.&#x201C; He hoped to give it some continuity, add an introduction, and expected to make a book of about 150 pages. He wished for advice on publication and even on his German style after being so long in England. Ever since he first knew TC&#x2019;s writings, &#x201C;some twenty years ago now,&#x201C; they had had a significant and beneficial influence on him: &#x201C;The same I know to be true of many of the young generation in England; and I can only believe that in our country, too, there must be a place for the teaching of this great and serious mind&#x2014;especially now when the storms of time have torn open the spirits and prepared them to receive new seeds&#x201C; (MS: Jagiellonian Univ., trans.).</note> and this chiefly is his errand to Berlin at present. In which matter it is naturally clear to him of how much service you, whose works, qualities and position are well known to him as to every one, might be;&#x2014;wherefore he modestly insinuates, not a request, but a hint or wish that I would introduce him. Being a man whom I so much esteem, and who has really so much sense and practicality, and deserves so much esteem, there is no refusing him this favour: accordingly, either by post from Bonn, or more probably direct from hand in Berlin, you will likely soon receive a card of mine introducing Neuberg and his little errand; whom I will only ask you to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> for my sake, and to treat farther according as the circumstances seem <pb id="pg-25-318" n="25:318"/>to yourself to direct. His Manuscript, I believe, is of no great length, and will probably be very clearly written: if you pleased to run your eye over it, and give him any advice, he would be very grateful for it (as should I), and would receive it with a truly intelligent and modest mind. But, once more, let this be, I entreat you, just as the case directs; for neither N. nor I will be so unfair as to make any request about it, or entertain any expectation upon it. With regard to the man himself, I much mistake if you do not find him a rather pleasant incidental acquaintance, with conversation which will entertain you well on various subjects;&#x2014;and as such I will beg you to welcome him; leaving the rest to follow, or not to follow, as the law of the phenomenon prescribes.</p>
<p>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> my dear Sir; with many wishes and regards, suitable at this season and at all seasons. I hope to write again, about many other more interesting matters; I even hope to hear from you again. We are full of &#x201C;Papal Aggression,&#x201C; &#x201C;Chrystal Palace,&#x201C; and other nonsense of which I say nothing just now.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind and entertaining Letter, which arrived this morning, after being long expected. I have just written to Varnhagen a full and particular account of you; said that he would probably see you soon, that you had a <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c; so that, at any time, on presenting the inclosed card, or even on transmitting it by post, you will no doubt be cheerfully received: the <hi rend="italic">perusal</hi> of the Ms. was hinted at, too, but not insisted on,&#x2014;left <foreign><hi rend="italic">wie die Gelegenheit es geben m&#xF6;chte</hi></foreign> [as the favorable moment occurs];&#x2014;and among your other merits, uncommon in a literary character, I did not forget to mention that you were a &#x201C;truly modest and practical man.&#x201C; So I believe you will do very well together; and between you or otherwise, bring the matter to a good issue. Do not forget to write at least, from Berlin; and tell us how matters stand with yourself and that unruly City.</p>
<p>We have heard of you from time to time, thro&#x2019; Wilkinson and others;&#x2014;W. came here last week, one evening, with a Mr O&#x2019;Doherty (or some such name) a French-Irish socialistic philosopher;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified. TC wrote to Neuberg, <date when="1852-05-31">31 May 1852</date>, that &#x201C;the half-distracted Odoherty is gaining large vogue for some Swedish, &#x2018;muscular&#x2019; or other half-distracted form of &#x2018;medicine&#x2019; he has taken on hand&#x201C; (MS: NLS 551.63).</note> he writes since that he has just changed his abode to &#x201C;Sussex Lodge, Finchley Road,&#x201C; which I think is a little <pb id="pg-25-319" n="25:319"/>nearer us than where you lived. He is as full of life and airy speculation as ever.</p>
<p>On the whole, you seem to have found in Bonn all that you could reasonably expect; and if you decided to continue there, whatsoever is wanting might gradually be added as well as in another place: some course of employment for your spiritual <hi rend="italic">shoping</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">capital;</hi> which, wherever you go, will be a restless necessity for you. A man, in all countries, has to &#x201C;wait at the pool&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 5:3.</note> to look out assiduously for opportunities and capabilities; snatching them up as they arise, and diligently having for himself a way thro&#x2019; the abyss by them. For it is an ever-fluctuating, madly boiling abyss, except so far as we can control it and subdue it, to one and all of us. Your perfect knowledge of England and things English seems to offer you some specific possibilities of function among Germans at Present. I doubt not you will keep awake; and do good work yet, while days are granted you.</p>
<p>Old Arndt, in your picture, looks charming; an excellent piece of Old-German stuff.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ernst Moritz Arndt, prof. at Bonn.</note> I am delighted to hear of his vigorous delving and hoeing; but wish withal he would write us another Book: some autobiographic or other selection of his experiences in this world,&#x2014;such as it beseems a &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03C4;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; and &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;, a &#x201C;many-counselled&#x201C; and a &#x201C;much-enduring&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Conventional Homeric epithets for Odysseus.</note> man to give in his old age!&#x2014; I once read a Book of Dahlmann&#x2019;s on the English Civil War,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann, prof. at Bonn, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Englischen Revolution</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1844">1844</date>); see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440927-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>18:223</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1844-09-27">27 Sept. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> which corresponded pretty well to your account of him. Heavy and hard as pig-iron; a solid methodic History of that Event,&#x2014;with the <hi rend="italic">religion</hi>, the soul of the whole business, &#x201C;omitted by particular desire.&#x201C; I remember he ends by saying that the good issue in such contests is so plain &#x201C;a man may hit it, shooting blindfold&#x201C;;&#x2014;a suffrage parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, namely; that is (or was then) the good issue according to Dahlmann.&#x2014; There is a Younger Brandis, blind, who was once here, and taught me a little Danish;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not Christian August Brandis (<date when="1790">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867">1867</date>), but a Danish Brandis or Brandes; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451227-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>20:80</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1845-12-27">27 Dec. 1845</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460207-TC-JAC-01"><sic>122</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-02-07">7 Feb. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> a most ingenious, vivacious, but rather <hi rend="italic">fabulous</hi> man: have you seen anything of him in Bonn?</p>
<p>I went into Wales in the end of last <date when="1850-07">july</date>, then into Scotland, and so, after some uncomfortable roving, back to my own shop here. I was, and still am tho&#x2019; to a less degree, in altogether frightful health; incapable of going farther in my angry dialogue with the world till I have gathered myself a little again. The world, with its Papal Aggressions, Crystal Palaces, and such like, is and remains a great ass.

Dear good Mother, I hope you keep close by the fire, and take every care of yourself, in this grim season of the year. We are now <hi rend="italic">past</hi> the shortest day; and, after many storms, may look forward to brighter shining of the Sun:&#x2014;as in Life itself is not this the case?

<p>Jane and I are both pretty well here; she is out today, for a walk; goes out almost daily, having never yet been disabled by cold: yesterday I went for a long round into the country; had <hi rend="italic">gutta-percha</hi> soles, which secured me against the mud; I took the little dog with me, which amused me by its happy gambollings, and huntings of sparrows; by choosing my road well, I was on <hi rend="italic">three</hi> open heaths, fine green places with trees, whin-bushes, and grazing sheep and <foreign><hi rend="italic">cuddies:</hi></foreign> after several hours of walking I got home in good time for dinner, and feel decidedly fresher today. Indeed I think I am getting fairly clearer and into a quieter state of health than when you saw me last in Annandale, such an <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ettercap</hi></foreign> as I was!&#x2014; The faithless Bookseller has never yet sent your <hi rend="italic">Crookshank;</hi> but no matter, I have got you a good <hi rend="italic">union-dress</hi> again,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461109-TC-HMC-01"><sic>21:89</sic><corr>TC to HMC, <date when="1846-11-09">9 Nov. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> and shall send it (<hi rend="italic">it</hi>, if there be nothing more) in a little while.</p>
<p>We are very quiet in general; many of the people we know best are still in the country; and at present there is little going on here but <hi rend="italic">eating of turkeys</hi>, a business with which we do not much concern ourselves!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC appears to have given JWC a mysterious Christmas present, with the following message: &#x201C;A frugal Luncheon for the best of Poor Men&#x2019;s Wives; may a blessing be on every morsel for her.

We have had almost no frost yet, but much mud and fog. The other night (perhaps it was monday last) on approaching Hyde-Park about 11 at night, I fell in with such a scene of fog as I had never seen before even here. Confused ho-hoing and mournful uncertain sounding men; then some dull flames, occasionally shaking sparks from them, which one recognised to be &#x201C;tar-ruffles&#x201C;: at a distance of few yards they seemed dull <hi rend="italic">deadlights</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A window of heavy, dull glass on a ship&#x2019;s side.

Such a ho-hoing, and melancholy gliding of pitch-lights! Where you saw two or three of them with half-a-dozen black blots, it was a horse that had come down, or was threatening to come. Various horses and scrubby market carts stood wind-bound, waiting a little till they had gathered vigour for the slide,&#x2014;it ran a little downhill at that point;&#x2014;and far and wide, it went on puddling and many-sounding thro&#x2019; the foul darkness of the world. What struck me most was the universal good-humour of the people; not laughing or <foreign><hi rend="italic">jannering</hi></foreign>, but perfectly good-natured, and not speaking or ho-hoing at all except for practical purposes; each of them manfully intent to get his own Omnibus, Cart, or vehicle <hi rend="italic">brought home</hi>, and wishing all his neighbours the like. Next day the darkness and the ice were both gone.</p>
<p>We had a brief Note from Jack the other evening, dated Kirkcaldy; he was to stay with Fergus&#x2019;s people till last tuesday or wednesday (I think), then forward, some 30 miles of railway, to Thomas Erskine&#x2019;s, where are good quarters too and good people: there we suppose him to be at present.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is a real satisfaction to me to be chidden from that side of the Cromwell Controversy; and I am well pleased to read your Letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin noted: &#x201C;It was in the midst of &#x2026; perplexities that I first became acquainted with Carlyle&#x2019;s writings, and, I may almost say, became baptized with his spirit. &#x2026; But &#x2026; I never could surrender my own judgment to even Carlyle&#x2019;s authority; and, on reading with vivid interest his wonderful &#x2018;Life of Cromwell,&#x2019; all my loyalty of heart could not shut my eyes to what to me was and is a serious misreading of Cromwell&#x2019;s conduct on two [unspecified] important public occasions; amounting to a reluctant admission, not merely of disingenuousness, but even of actual untruthfulness. / After pondering long these matters, and my own seeming presumption in coming to such independent conclusions, I at last found courage to write a tolerably full statement of the different view to which I had been led, together with the evidence which seemed to me to clear Cromwell from what I could not help feeling to be a stain on the heroic simplicity of his character&#x201C; (&#x201C;Carlyle, and Mrs. Carlyle&#x201C; 29&#x2013;30).</note></p>
<p>I do not find that essentially we differ at all in our notion about those matters either of the Protectorship or of the Kingship; but if the matter were raised into <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> between us, one knows not how far it might still go! A fact is a fact, and all men that do see it, must see it alike; but what each man will then say upon it, how you, or I, or Oliver, will then see best to <hi rend="italic">name</hi> the fact,&#x2014;there we shall by no means be sure to be &#x201C;alike,&#x201C; but must rest well satisfied with some approximate agreement!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin said that &#x201C;what impressed me most was, that clearly Carlyle was not a man to care to reconsider a judgment once deliberately pronounced&#x201C; (31).</note> Goethe says, with deep insight and meaning, &#x201C;The instant we begin to speak, we are more or less wrong; the first word we utter, there is error in it.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, but cf. <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> pt 1. <date when="1808">1808</date>: &#x201C;<foreign>Es irrt der Mensch so lang er strebt</foreign> [Man will err while yet he strives].&#x201C; Also see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331028-TC-JSM-01"><sic>7:20</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-10-28">28 Oct. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> A truth of which Oliver&#x2019;s great inarticulate history will, at every turn, remind one.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>This Note will be delivered by Mr H. Apel, who is a candidate, one of the six selected Candidates, for the Professorship of German in Owen&#x2019;s College.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heinrich Apel, author of works on the German language and ed. of student German texts, did not receive the appt. Tobias Theodore was apptd. lecturer instead.</note> He is to attend in Manchester, shortly, on the settlement of that question; and as he is quite unknown to any person there, I have taken the liberty, esteeming him a modest meritorious man, to recommend him to your discretions and humanities, for any help you can honestly give him in the case. I rather think you are not yourself one of the Judging Committee but of course all the Judges are known to you, and the condition of affairs is wholly known to you; and whatsoever can be done for bringing a man&#x2019;s fair pretensions (and such Mr Apel&#x2019;s seem to me) into a fair point of view, so that they be decided on with clear evidence, and not with any defect of clear evidence,&#x2014;this I may request you, for Mr A.&#x2019;s sake, and my own, and that of the Institution itself, to endeavour a little, according to your own good judgement to see done. More than this neither Mr A. nor any friend of his can or should request.</p>
<p>I wrote no Testimonial for Mr A.; indeed my personal knowledge of him was not sufficient to authorize such a step: I know him only by two or three interviews, in which certainly he appears to general advantage; and by the favourable report of friends, whom actual experience, and trial of his services, has interested in him;&#x2014;I have not, except very cursorily, examined any of his Books. But it is easy enough to see, or confidently surmise, that here is a man of general intelligence, good sense, diligence, fidelity, and excellent modest conditions, which are the root of good performance in all departments whatsoever;&#x2014;and my decided impression is, he would evince himself a well-informed, clear-headed Philologer, and an expert, methodic and really superior Teacher of German to Englishmen:&#x2014;altogether a very likely man for this Professorship in the Manchester College. That is my unbiassed impression; and I can give no more. If there be among the Six a <hi rend="italic">likelier</hi> man for the Professorship, let that one be preferred; but let it be on complete evidence, not on incomplete;&#x2014;and in that case I think I may add, let the new College esteem itself not unlucky in this one department.</p>
<p>In short, my dear Sir, you see very well what is to be done, if indeed anything can be done,&#x2014;and so I will trouble you no farther with words at least.</p>

<p><salute>Dont the years get to gallop so fast dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell that it seems no longer worth while to take note of them?</salute> Since last new year to this one, I seem to have hardly had time enough for one good long sleep! To those however, whom the winter finds with no money in their pockets to buy fire and food, the new winter may not look short! I wonder if to old Mary,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note> for example, time seems to fly in this way, with ever increasing velocity?&#x2014;do you think she takes any satisfaction in her life? if so; what shame to some of us! Poor old soul! as long as the life is in her I fancy she will like a bit of <hi rend="italic">finery</hi>&#x2014;especially if sent from London! and so the <hi rend="italic">scarlet</hi> scarf(!) I send her however preposterous a present <hi rend="italic">you</hi> may think it, wont have been so ill judged&#x2014; I wish I were nearer her, I could give her plenty of old <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> things, that poor people here hardly thank me for, and <hi rend="italic">pawn</hi> generally for drink&#x2014;but the carriage of such things costs more than they are all worth&#x2014;and such trifles as can be easily sent by post are not adapted to the wants of a poor old woman&#x2014;yet I am sure she likes <hi rend="italic">something</hi> coming from <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014;better than she would like the money to buy a new years trifle to herself&#x2014;so tell her with my kind regards to twist this scarf <hi rend="italic">several times</hi> round her old throat, and to be sure and not strangle herself with it&#x2014; There is a ribbon for Margaret<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone.</note>&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">ugliest</hi> I must say that I ever set my eyes on&#x2014;but I sent my Maid to buy it&#x2014;having got a little cold today&#x2014;and this was her notion of the becoming! I must put in a cap-border with it to <hi rend="italic">carry it off</hi>&#x2014; The sovereign please to distribute for me according to your discretion&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-25-326" n="25:326"/>Things are going on well enough with us for the present&#x2014; There has been no winter hitherto to give me a chance it getting myself laid up&#x2014;(for my cold today is nothing to speak of) and my headachs have neither been so frequent nor so severe latterly&#x2014; But I met with a <hi rend="italic">horrid</hi> accident some weeks ago&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">banged</hi> my right breast against the end of the sofa&#x2014;and for three weeks the pain continued&#x2014;and so, not being able to get the thing forgotten I was frightened out of my wits for the possible consequences&#x2014;especially as my Brother-in-law wrote from Scotsbrig that I was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go to any D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with it&#x2014;&#x201C;London D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> being so unsafe for making <hi rend="italic">a case</hi> out of everything and any <hi rend="italic">meddling</hi> with such a thing as this being in his opinion positively injurious&#x201C;&#x2014; There! what does D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell say to such views of the medical profession! The pain is quite gone now however&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to think no more about it&#x2014;but it may be excused to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, all things recollected, that I have suffered a good deal of apprehension from this accident&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have also been bothered to death with servants this Autumn&#x2014;have had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> in quick succession&#x2014;the first new one roasted fowls with the <hi rend="italic">crop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bowels</hi> in them! and that mode of cookery was not to our taste&#x2014;the second a really clever servant, and good girl came to me, with a serious disease upon her and had to be soon sent to the Hospital where she is still, after two months&#x2014;the third and last, thank heaven, suits capitally but I had best not praise her too much&#x2014;it is &#x201C;a tempting of Providence&#x201C; to &#x201C;cry before one is out of the wood&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>Kindest regards to your Father and Husband&#x2014; Tell me about your health and &#x201C;the smallest <hi rend="italic">news</hi> will be gratefully received<supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Closing quotation marks omitted.</note></salute></closer></p>
