<p>Volume 40 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> includes 242 letters and covers the period from <date when="1864-01">January</date> to <date when="1864-08">August 1864</date>. There are 169 letters by Thomas Carlyle, 62 by Jane Welsh Carlyle, and 11 by Maggie Welsh on behalf of JWC. JWC wrote far fewer letters than usual to friends, and during the worst of her time in St. Leonards she did not even write to TC, although her cousin Maggie Welsh was writing letters for her. It was not until late March that there were any letters from JWC in her own hand, with only 18 before she went to Scotland in mid-July.</p>
 <p>This volume is characterized by JWC&#x2019;s continuing and extreme illness. The tone is set in the very first letter&#x2014;TC wrote to Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;My poor wife made me promise to write you a word,&#x2014; &#x2018;one word of acknowledg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2019; whispered she passionately, &#x2018;for all these continual kindnesses&#x2019;. &#x2026; We (that is, she) are still in very great distress. &#x2026; She has no sleep, can get none&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640102-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1864-01-02">2 Jan. 1864</date></ref>). JWC had suffered during the second half of the previous year from a painful right arm, diagnosed by Dr. Quain as &#x201C;neuralgia&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630916-JWC-MR-01"><sic>39:186</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-09-16">16 Sept. 1863</date>]</corr></ref>); she then fell in the street, <date when="1863-09-22">22 September 1863</date>, hurting her left side and leg. She initially appeared to recover, but then became ill with influenza, late <date when="1863-11">November 1863</date>; TC wrote to Lady Ashburton at the end of the year: &#x201C;the Doctors call it mere &#x2018;influenza wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has kindled into <hi rend="italic">a general paroxysm</hi> all the neuralgias, hurts &#x26;c&#x2019;;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">they</hi> are agreed. &#x2026; I never saw a being in such continuous agony!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631221-TC-LLA-01"><sic>39:258</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1863-12-21">21 Dec. 1863</date></corr></ref>). Throughout <date when="1863-12">December 1863</date> and into <date when="1864-01">January 1864</date>, JWC remained very ill and sleepless, and her cousin Maggie Welsh was sent for to act as sick-nurse, coming direct from Liverpool where she had been nursing a sick nephew.</p>
<p>There seems no clear consensus as to what was actually wrong with JWC. She herself called it various things, telling first her Welsh aunts: &#x201C;The malady is in my womb. &#x2026; It is the consequence of that unlucky fall&#x2014;no disease there the Drs say, but some nervous derangement&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640305-JWC-AG-01">JWC to A, G, &#x26; EW, [<date when="1864-03-05">5 March</date>]</ref>), then Mary Russell: &#x201C;the misery has been &#x2026; an everlasting torture in my <hi rend="italic">womb</hi>&#x2014;it is not a cancer or any such thing&#x2014;the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say, only a nervous affection&#x2014;but all the same the suffering attending it is beyond all words to tell&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640531-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [ca. <date when="1864-05-31">31 May</date>]</ref>). Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell, <date when="1864-02-14">14 February</date>: &#x201C;poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill. &#x26; nobody knows what is the matter with her&#x2014;the doctors declare that it is all on the nerves&#x2014;but I &#x26; her Cousin who is nursing her fear that she injured herself in her <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> &#x26; that there is a <pb id="pg-40-xii" n="40:xii"/>cause for all the pain &#x26; terrible restlessness. she suffers dreadfully &#x26; her restlessness is worse than the pain&#x201D; (Mantell); and TC wrote to his sister Jean Aitken, early March: &#x201C;I cannot for my life <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> anything ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> her disorder: since people keep asking, one is obliged to say something, &#x2018;Better,&#x2019; &#x2018;Worse,&#x2019; &#x2018;much the same&#x2019;; but really <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know whether her sad calamity (and mine) is on the way of mending or on the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> way&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640306-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, [<date when="1864-03-06">6 March</date>]</ref>). In April, in a reply to TC quoting Dr. Barnes&#x2019;s and Dr. Blakiston&#x2019;s use of the word &#x201C;morbid,&#x201D; JWC wrote: &#x201C;It is no &#x2018;morbid despondency&#x2019;&#x2014;it is <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> physical torment day and night&#x2014;a burning throbbing maddening sensation in the most nervous part of me ever and ever&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640419-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-04-19">19 April</date>]</ref>). She often wrote of &#x201C;irritation&#x201D; so bad that she had to take to bed in the afternoon (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640802-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-02">2 Aug.</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640808-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-08">8 Aug.</date>]</ref>); ten days later: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Irritation</hi> has been less distressing, and that is the most important item of improvement; for I could bear all the rest patiently if I were but delivered from <hi rend="italic">that</hi>!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640818-JWC-MCA-01">JWC to MCA, [<date when="1864-08-18">18 Aug.</date>]</ref>). It is sometimes unclear whether she was referring to a purely physical irritation, or irritation of the mind and spirits, a feeling of restlessness and unease, what we might now call anxiety attacks. But it was not only &#x201C;irritation&#x201D; as, after one of these attacks, she reported: &#x201C;Something I said about my bowels &#x2026; put [Dr. Russell] on ascertaining with his own eyes and the result was a discovery that I was excessively bilious&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640808-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-08">8 Aug.</date>]</ref>). At the same time she referred to having to get up during the night, for unspecified reasons: &#x201C;Eight times I was awake and out of bed&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640810-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-10">10 Aug.</date>]</ref>); &#x201C;I was out of bed <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> times during the night&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640831-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-31">31 Aug.</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>Her biggest fear was of going mad, either from pain or from sleeplessness; throughout this illness, for almost a year, she apparently had barely a single night&#x2019;s proper sleep: &#x201C;If sleep would come; I think I should <hi rend="italic">recover</hi>!&#x2014;the first time I have had this hope seriously&#x2014;but&#x2014;if it wont come&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> break down sooner or later &#x2026; and I fear horribly for&#x2014;not my life&#x2014;but my reason&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640805-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-05">5 Aug.</date>]</ref>). The fear of madness, as well as of death, becomes a common refrain in her letters. TC later wrote:</p>
<q>A hideous pain of which she used to say that &#x2018;common honest pain, were it cutting of one&#x2019;s flesh or sawing of one&#x2019;s bones would be a luxury in comparison,&#x2019;&#x2014;seemed to have begirdled her, at all moments and on every side. Her intellect was clear as starlight, and continued so; the clearest <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> among us all; but she dreaded that this too must give way. &#x2018;Dear,&#x2019; said she to me, on two occasions, with such a look and tone as I shall never forget, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">promise</hi> me that you will not put me into a mad-house, however this go. Do you <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> me, now?&#x2019; I solemnly did. &#x2018;Not if I do quite lose my wits?&#x2019; &#x2018;Never, my Darling; oh compose thy poor terrified heart!&#x2019; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 169)<sic>.</sic></q>
 <p><pb id="pg-40-xiii" n="40:xiii"/>A feminist analysis might be that JWC&#x2019;s many illnesses arose from a constant repression of her real self, in order to conform to Victorian social mores, and her own construct of herself as the &#x201C;wife of a man of Genius&#x201C;: &#x201C;Sooner than speak out her thoughts, JWC bodied them forth in tumultuous illness&#x201D; (Norma Clarke, <hi rend="italic">Ambitious Heights</hi> [<date when="1990">1990</date>] 130). She was very angry and bitter when John A. Carlyle told her in <date when="1864-07">July 1864</date> that if she had ever had any work, she would not be so ill, writing to TC: &#x201C;He [John] has been very hard and cruel&#x2014;and mean inconceivably! &#x2026; Fancy his telling me in my agony yesterday that &#x2018;if I had ever DONE anything in my life, this would not have been! that no poor woman with work to mind had ever had such an ailment as this of mine since the world began!!!&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640723-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1864-07-23">23 July</date></ref>). But this was not the first time that such a thing had been suggested to her, and she herself had frequently considered it. As early as <date when="1833">1833</date>, John A. Carlyle had said something similar, as JWC reported to her friend Eliza Miles: &#x201C;He told me yesterday, &#x2018;Could I give you some agreeable occupation to fill your whole mind, it would do more for you than all the medicines in existence&#x2019;&#x201D; (6:410&#x02013;11). TC wrote to JWC in <date when="1842">1842</date>: &#x201C;My prayer is and has always been that you would rouse up the fine faculties that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> yours into some course of real true work, which you felt to be worthy of them and you! Your life would not then be happy; but it would cease to be miserable, it would become noble and clear, with a kind of sacredness shining thro&#x2019; it&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-14/lt-18420409-TC-JWC-01"><sic>14:134</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-09">9 April 1842</date></corr></ref>). Her friend Geraldine Jewsbury encouraged her to write a novel. And JWC herself often lamented her own lack of a role. In a letter to Charles Gavan Duffy in <date when="1845">1845</date>, she wrote: &#x201C;I have sometimes thought that in a Civil War I should possibly find my &#x2018;mission&#x2019;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">moi!</hi> But in these merely <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> times, a poor woman knows not how to turn herself; especially if, like myself, she &#x2018;have a Devil&#x2019;&#x2014;always calling to her &#x2018;March! March,&#x2019; and bursting into infernal laughter when requested to be so good as specify; <hi rend="italic">whither!</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450915-JWC-CGD-01"><sic>19:197</sic><corr>JWC to CGD, <date when="1845-09-15">14 [15] Sept. [1845]</date></corr></ref>). Less than a year later, in a letter to Jeannie Welsh, she commented on her sense of the part she constructed for herself to play, while regretting her lack of &#x201C;hard work,&#x201D; and with a clear understanding of the damage such a lack could do:</p>
 <q>By and by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macready who is in the family-way began to talk of the dreadful &#x201C;depression of spirits&#x201D; she occasionally laboured under&#x2014;&#x201C;Ah said I, everyone I suppose has their own fits of depression to bear up against if the truth were told.&#x201D; &#x2026; &#x201C;Oh no surely!&#x2014;some people are never out of spirits&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> for example I really believe you do not know what it is to be ever sad for a minute!!! one never sees you that you do not keep one in fits of laughter!&#x201D; I made no answer&#x2014;but congratulated myself on having played my part so well&#x2014;I wish I could find some hard work I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do&#x2014;and saw any sense in doing&#x2014;If I do not soon it will be the worse for me. (<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460519-JWC-JW-01"><sic>20:194</sic><corr>JWC to JW, [<date when="1846-05-19">19 May 1846</date>]</corr></ref>)</q>
<p><pb id="pg-40-xiv" n="40:xiv"/>In a letter to John Stodart in <date when="1849">1849</date> she wrote a heartfelt affirmation of the value of work:</p>
<q>You tell me you have lost your fortune, and are obliged to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> for your bread. Well! to speak truly, I feel no sorrow over this. If your heart <hi rend="italic">ache</hi>; <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, above all, obligatory work is the only remedy worth trying. Oh don&#x2019;t I know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> a privilege is that of sitting, with folded hands, thinking over a past that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> past, because in the present and future all is too dark&#x2014;ailment and sorrow overclouding the present and the future without hope or object! Oh depend on it, dear John, the loss of fortune or whatever it be that curtails one of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> privilege is a thing to thank God for, is perhaps the one interposition that has saved one out of madness! (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490930-JWC-JRS-01"><sic>24:258&#x02013;59</sic><corr>JWC to JRS, [<date when="1849-09-30">30 Sept. 1849</date>]</corr></ref>)<sic>.</sic></q>
 <p>Presumably JWC, like many a woman before and since, found housework both time consuming and physically tiring, without being in any way mentally stimulating or intellectually satisfying. Both John A. Carlyle and TC speak of her needing an occupation for her &#x201C;whole mind&#x201D; and &#x201C;fine faculties,&#x201D; and this is what she too is aware of lacking. JWC several times referred to herself as being too educated for her eventual position in life, writing in <date when="1833">1833</date> to Eliza Stodart: &#x201C;for to say the truth my whole life has been a sort of <hi rend="italic">puddling</hi> [muddle] as to health, Too much of schooling hadst thou poor Ophelia!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-07/lt-18331109-JWC-EA-01"><sic>7:32</sic><corr>JWC to EA, [<date when="1833-11-09">9 Nov. 1833</date>]</corr></ref>). Caroline Fox later remembered: &#x201C;She talked of her own life and the mistake of over-educating people. She believes that her health has been injured for life by beginning Latin with a little tutor at five or six years old, then going to the Rector&#x2019;s school to continue it, then having a tutor at home, and being very ambitious she learnt eagerly&#x201D; (Caroline Fox, <hi rend="italic">Memories of Old Friends</hi> [<date when="1882">1882</date>] 219&#x02013;20).</p>
<p>JWC knew several women who used their education, mostly as writers, but they tended either to be single, like Geraldine Jewsbury or Harriet Martineau, or widowed, like Margaret Oliphant. Elizabeth Gaskell, with a husband and family, was unusual, and JWC did not entirely approve of her. George Eliot, with her irregular domestic life, might have written books that JWC loved, but JWC would not socialize with her. Much of the time JWC exhibited conventional Victorian views about appropriate roles for women, married and unmarried, and she did not exempt herself from these assumptions. While she excelled at satire at the expense of everyone, male and female, herself and TC, she was neither particularly feminist nor radical in her approach to social roles for women.</p>
 <p>TC may have said that he wished JWC could find some work to do, but he expected her main role to be that of wife and helpmeet, running his house <pb id="pg-40-xv" n="40:xv"/>and attending to his many needs. He too was often ill, usually with some form of digestive upset. He needed absolute peace and quiet in which to work&#x2014;which involved JWC in protecting him from household difficulties, from environmental noises, and from too many visitors; and his absorption in his work and his absolute need of several hours exercise a day, either riding or walking, meant that she spent much time on her own. Running a house was an arduous task. Early in their marriage they were often very short of money, and JWC was required to do much of the actual housework as well as all the organizing. JWC undoubtedly believed that it was truly her duty and role in life to look after TC in every way possible to enable the writing of his great works for the benefit of mankind. She believed this in the same way that she believed that making a loaf of bread was as worthwhile as making Cellini&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Perseus</hi>, as she told Mary Smith in <date when="1857">1857</date>: &#x201C;it is not the greatness or littleness of &#x2018;the duty nearest hand,&#x2019; but the spirit in which one does it, that makes one&#x2019;s doing noble or mean!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570111-JWC-MS-01"><sic>32:70&#x02013;71</sic><corr>JWC to MS, <date when="1857-01-11">11 Jan. 1857</date></corr></ref>). The tragedy is that such a role could not be fulfilling to a mind as agile and inventive as hers.</p>
<p>Living as we do in the twenty-first century, in a world where every aspect of a person&#x2019;s health, from birth to death, through disease, accident, mental illness, childbirth, and old age, is highly medicalized and professionalized, it is interesting to step back into the lives of people for whom most of these episodes were treated at home, with the assistance of relations and friends, and with little or no help from &#x201C;professionals.&#x201D; Illness in the nineteenth century was very common, very real and very dangerous; recovery often took a long time. Medical science, both in diagnosis and treatment, was still fairly haphazard, and it is arguable that doctors killed more than they cured. Remedies centered largely on varieties of sedatives and pain killers, or on digestive remedies; other than that the only cures were rest and time. Certainly none of the treatments the doctors offered JWC in <date when="1864">1864</date> seemed very effective; this was certainly TC&#x2019;s view: &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Neuralgia</hi>&#x2019;. &#x2026; &#x2018;Disease of the Nerves&#x2019; (poisoning of the very <hi rend="italic">channels</hi> of sensation): such was the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> the Doctors gave it; and for the rest, could <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing further with it; well had they only attempted nothing! I used to compute that <hi rend="italic">they</hi>, poor souls, had at least <hi rend="italic">reinforced</hi> the disease to <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> its natural amount; such the pernicious effect of all their &#x2018;remedies&#x2019; and appliances, opiates, etc. etc.; which every new one of them (and there came many) applied anew,&#x2014;and always with the like <hi rend="italic">inverse</hi> result&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 168). JWC was attended in her illness by four regular doctors (five if we include TC&#x2019;s brother Dr. John A. Carlyle, who although he did not actually treat her, certainly made many suggestions as to her treatment). Between them they prescribed either sedatives and pain killers, in the forms of opium, laudanum, morphia, camphor, hops, henbane, cannabis, alcohol, and quinine, or digestive remedies, such as the terrifying <pb id="pg-40-xvi" n="40:xvi"/>&#x201C;blue pill&#x201D; or the more modest rhubarb and magnesia. None of these appear to have had any effect for more than a few days, and often just led to a worsening of her condition.</p>
<p>What becomes strikingly clear in the story of these eight months is that JWC was cured by nursing rather than by doctoring, and nursing by family, friends, and servants, not by professionals. She was cared for first by her cousin Maggie Welsh, who lived in Fife, but who came to stay with JWC, initially in London and then in St. Leonards, and only left because she had to return to Liverpool to nurse the dying child of her brother Alex Welsh. Geraldine Jewsbury regularly offered her help, but JWC, still feeling very estranged from Geraldine, instead asked Mary Craik, the daughter of an old friend, to come from Ireland. These women, all single, obviously saw nothing strange in offering or being asked to leave home to come to nurse JWC. When she felt that staying in London was doing her no good, she accepted an offer from Dr. and Mrs. Blakiston in St. Leonards to stay with them. Mrs. Blakiston was JWC&#x2019;s former servant Bessie Barnet, recently married to a doctor, with whom JWC had a pleasant visit in <date when="1863-06">June 1863</date>. They accommodated JWC, her maid Mary, and her cousin Maggie Welsh, presumably at some inconvenience and cost to themselves, but refusing all payment. They provided not only a kind home, but both doctoring and nursing. However, after a month or so JWC felt that she had outstayed her welcome with the Blakistons, and not wanting to return to London, she found a house to rent in St. Leonards, where TC eventually joined her. Maggie Welsh returned to Liverpool, and Mary Craik came to take her place.</p>
<p>In July, still very ill, JWC finally went to Dumfriesshire, first to her sister-in-law Mary Austin, and then to the home of Mary Russell, her mother&#x2019;s old friend, and also her own friend for many years, who she knew would care for her and nurse her, and whose husband was also a doctor. She wrote to TC: &#x201C;nowhere on Earth would I be better off <hi rend="italic">externally</hi> than I am here. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell is a nurse like my own mother&#x2014;I have had no such nursing. &#x2026; Then the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> seems to me to have more sense. &#x2026; He says, like you, that my illness is only to be acted on thro&#x2019; the stomach but does not make light of my <hi rend="italic">nervousness</hi>&#x2014;does not say slightingly that &#x2018;nervous pain does <hi rend="italic">not kill</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640725-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-07-25">25 July</date>]</ref>). The peace and quiet, the familiarity of her surroundings, the feeling of being loved and cared for, and of her illness being taken seriously, all helped effect, if not an actual cure, at least a great improvement in her condition. Her appetite returned, she gained weight, and she even reported to TC a re-found capacity to laugh out loud, inspired by one of Dr. Russell&#x2019;s dry remarks to his wife (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640819-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-19">19 Aug.</date>]</ref>). She began to be able to think about returning home, enlisting the help of Eliza Forster in getting her bedroom redecorated, and sending TC detailed instructions about house cleaning. After her return to Cheyne Row at the end of September, JWC wrote to <pb id="pg-40-xvii" n="40:xvii"/>Mary Russell to thank them for their care of her, ending her letter: &#x201C;I shall always feel as if I owed my life chiefly to your Husband and you, who procured me such <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> as I could have had nowhere else in the world&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-41/lt-18641003-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1864-10-03">3 Oct. 1864</date></ref>; MS: NLS 608.684<sic>; vol. 41</sic>).</p>
 <p>As well as friends and relations, servants also played a large part in helping to nurse their employers. The greatest part of the care required by sick people was assistance with essential daily activities&#x2014;eating, dressing, personal hygiene, help with moving about&#x2014;and much of this could be done by servants. During a spell of illness the previous year JWC wrote to her former maid, Charlotte Southam, thanking her for a gift of violets: &#x201C;their sweet smell reminded me somehow of your kind nursing in my long Influenza. No one has nursed me as kindly and as cleverly since!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18630329-JWC-CSO-01"><sic>39:103</sic><corr>JWC to CSO, <date when="1863-03-29">29 March 1863</date></corr></ref>). At Thornhill JWC was particularly appreciative of the thoughtfulness of Mary Russell&#x2019;s young servant Mary (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640803-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-03">3 Aug.</date>]</ref>). But usually with a sick person in the house, especially if that person was used to doing some of the domestic chores herself, the servant would already have more than enough to do dealing with the daily household tasks, so extra help had to be brought in. The Carlyles had tried hiring a professional nurse, a Catholic &#x201C;sister of mercy,&#x201D; but this ended disastrously when she tried to pray over JWC (<ref target="volume-39/lt-18631229-TC-JAC-01"><sic>39:261</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1863-12-29">29 Dec. 1863</date></corr></ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 170&#x02013;71). Friends and family were more reliable and easier to have around.</p>
 <p>JWC herself had often gone to a lot of trouble to care for others, and she seemed always to have an innate understanding of people&#x2019;s troubled minds. She wrote in <date when="1843">1843</date> of her friend Joseph Henry Garnier: &#x201C;Poor Garnier walked in at five and staid till after nine. &#x2026; Poor fellow they may all abuse him as they like; but I think and have thought and will think well of him&#x2014;he has a good heart and a good head, only a nervous system all bedevilled&#x2014;and his external life fallen into a horribly <hi rend="italic">burbled</hi> [confused] state about him&#x2014;I gave him tea&#x2014;and took him a walk&#x2014;and lent him some music&#x2014;and soothed the troubled soul of him&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-17/lt-18430821-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:73</sic><corr>JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-21">21 Aug. 1843</date>]</corr></ref>). When another friend, Richard Plattnauer, had a mental breakdown in <date when="1844">1844</date> and disappeared, JWC went searching for him, and found that he had been committed to Wandsworth Lunatic Asylum; she visited him there, and then brought him home to stay at Cheyne Row. She wrote about him to her cousin Jeannie Welsh: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> do not consider him by any means <hi rend="italic">sane</hi>. &#x2026; I know that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can keep him from any new crisis so long as he is beside me. &#x2026; [N]o madman will ever hurt a hair of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head&#x2014;I have too much <hi rend="italic">affinity</hi> with them&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-18/lt-18440829-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:195&#x02013;96</sic><corr>JWC to JW, [ca. <date when="1844-08-29">29 Aug. 1844</date>]</corr></ref>), a sentiment she often repeated. She comforted the bereaved, apologizing in <date when="1858">1858</date> to Mary Russell for not having written to her: &#x201C;The fact is, I have been belated in &#x2026; everything this week&#x2014;by having had to give from <hi rend="italic">two to three hours</hi> EVERY DAY (!) to a man [John George Cooke] who has unexpectedly lost his Mother &#x2026; he has fled away from everybody to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, who wasn&#x2019;t aware before that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was his particular <pb id="pg-40-xviii" n="40:xviii"/>friend the least in the world!&#x2014;But I have always had the same sort of attraction for <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi> people, and for <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> people that <hi rend="italic">amber</hi> has for <hi rend="italic">straws!</hi>&#x201D; (<sic>34:257&#x02013;58</sic><corr><ref target="volume-34/lt-18581230-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1858-12-30">30 Dec. 1858</date></ref></corr>).</p>
<p>Another major event in the Carlyles&#x2019; lives in this volume was the death of Lord Ashburton, <date when="1864-03-23">23 March 1864</date>. He had been a significant part of their lives for 25 years, and both Carlyles were deeply attached to him. So much attention has been paid to both TC and JWC&#x2019;s relationship with the first Lady Ashburton, it is sometimes forgotten how important was their relationship with Lord Ashburton. His obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Citizen</hi>, <date when="1864-03-26">26 March</date>, ended: &#x201C;There will be many sorrowing friends now to whom the Grange was a home, but to none of them will the loss be so irreparable as to our great country man, the author of &#x2018;Sartor Resartus.&#x2019; &#x2026; No two men knew and loved each other better than they&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640326-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-26">26 March</date></ref>). Lord Ashburton had been ill for some time and his death was expected the previous year, with the Carlyles&#x2019; anxiety about him mentioned frequently in their letters. In <date when="1864">1864</date>, however, with JWC&#x2019;s ongoing illness their primary concern, they were less voluble about their worries for Lord Ashburton. When they heard in February of the recurrence of his illness, JWC asked Maggie Welsh to write to Lady Ashburton, giving &#x201C;her very dear love &#x26; to tell you what a grief it has been to her &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to hear that Lord Ashburton has been so very ill of late&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640206-MW-LLA-01">MW to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, [<date when="1864-02-06">6 Feb.</date>]</ref>). And some days later Maggie Welsh wrote to Lady Ashburton again, reporting JWC&#x2019;s feeling that she &#x201C;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">would</hi> like to live a little longer to thank you for all your great kindness &#x26; thought for her.&#x2019; &#x2026; [S]he said it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so thoughtful in the midst of all your own sad trouble&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640218-MW-LLA-01">MW to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, [<date when="1864-02-18">18 Feb.</date>?]</ref>). TC and JWC had both become very attached to Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s second wife, Louisa, and felt deeply sympathetic to her loss. TC immediately wrote his condolences to Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;Alas, dear Lady, here is the end then; come suddenly on us; and all is over &#x2026; the shock to me, this morning, is great. To me also an Epoch is closed. &#x2026; He was always always beautifully noble, concerned for others beyond himself&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640324-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1864-03-24">24 March</date></ref>). It is characteristic of JWC that when she heard of his death, she roused herself to write a letter of sympathy to Lady Ashburton, the first letter of <date when="1864">1864</date> in her own hand: &#x201C;Oh God Comfort you! if ever there was a man ready to pass from this sorrowful earth to be an angel in Heaven it was he! My spirit flies to your dear side, while my poor body is chained here with a cruel malady that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> believe will prove fatal&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640325-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, [<date when="1864-03-25">25 March</date>]</ref>). Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s last act of friendship was to leave TC &#xa3;2000, privately through Lady Ashburton rather than specified in his will, to save paying tax. TC wrote to thank Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;Strange, yet simple, beautiful; so <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the Doer of it:&#x2014;the last finish to 20 years of friendly acts and offices on his part,&#x2014;all done in the same gentle, quiet and fine way&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640411-TC-LLA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1864-04-11">11 April</date></ref>). There were also <pb id="pg-40-xix" n="40:xix"/>several other deaths in these months, mentioned in the Carlyles&#x2019; letters, if not of people close to them, then close to their friends&#x2014;John Ruskin&#x2019;s father, Henry Larkin&#x2019;s baby daughter, JWC&#x2019;s cousin&#x2019;s child Jackie Welsh, Moncure Conway&#x2019;s son, and Charlotte Southam&#x2019;s adopted father.</p>
<p>Throughout this volume TC was still working on <hi rend="italic">Frederick The Great</hi>, still struggling, still suffering, determined to finish it at last. Volume 4 was published at the end of February, and by the end of March volume 5 had gone to the printer. With our modern sensibilities, it is easy to see TC as being so busy with his book that he had no time for his wife&#x2019;s illness. He did not stop work to help care for her, and although he did accompany her on her journey to St. Leonards, and then visited a couple of times, he chiefly remained in London working. And when he did decide to move down to stay with her, it was only on condition that he could continue working, writing to his brother John: &#x201C;there was speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> thereupon of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coming down too, and I suppose that also to be likely,&#x2014;if I can possibly contrive to take my <hi rend="italic">Work</hi> with me: tho&#x2019; I absolutely must not otherwise.&#x201D; He wrote this in the same letter in which he described JWC as: &#x201C;always on the edge of crying: full of hysterical pains and emotions, refuses to have any comfortable hope&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640405-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1864-04-05">5 April</date></ref>). While in St. Leonards he spent time with her once a day on a short drive, the rest of the time he worked. It was his brother John, come to offer what support he could to both Carlyles, who took JWC out driving, sometimes several times a day, and it was John who finally accompanied her to Scotland and delivered her into the care of their sister Mary Austin at The Gill, where she stayed for a week before moving to the Russells at Holmhill. TC himself admitted he was no use in a sick room, nor was he expected to be. He inhabited his own sphere, and left the world of domesticity and sickness to the women. Even at her worst JWC knew she could not take him from his work: &#x201C;Oh my Husband! I am suffering torments! &#x2026; Oh I would like you beside me,&#x2014;I am terribly <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>&#x2014;But I dont want to interrupt your work&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-40/lt-18640425-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-04-25">25 April</date>]</ref>). When TC read JWC&#x2019;s letters after her death, it was statements of care for his needs such as this that induced TC&#x2019;s feelings of guilt about his treatment of her; but JWC knew that until <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> was finished there could be no rest for TC, and little time for normal human relationships.</p>
<p>Nonetheless TC&#x2019;s letters to JWC in this period were unfailingly kind and sympathetic, positive and encouraging; his apparent optimism and absolute belief in JWC&#x2019;s inner strength contrasts markedly with his pessimism about himself and his work, particularly in his letters to other people. It is arguable that he saw this ongoing positive support as the most helpful thing he could do for her. These months from <date when="1864-01">January</date> to <date when="1864-08">August 1864</date> were miserable for both Carlyles, and their letters reflect this; they are predominantly sad, painful, anxious, and frightened. However their deep affection for each other did <pb id="pg-40-xx" n="40:xx"/>not waver, and was constantly expressed; it is this affection, together with the love and practical help and support of so many of their friends and relations, which makes what might at first seem rather a gloomy volume, both heartwarming and even uplifting.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1864-01">January</date></hi>. JWC has been ill since autumn <date when="1863">1863</date>, and her health continues to give serious cause for concern. TC tells Lady Ashburton that JWC is taking &#x201C;morphine, Camphor, Henbane &#x2026; no sleep follows them, only increase of misery&#x201D; (<date when="1864-01-02">2</date>). He writes to Elizabeth Downes offering her ailing husband &#xa3;50 from a fund &#x201C;set apart for the aid of some &#x2018;meritorious Literary man in distress&#x2019;&#x201D; (<date when="1864">9</date>), and subsequently pays her this sum following its acceptance (<date when="1864-01-13">13</date>). Writing to Lady Stanley, TC states &#x201C;I never saw her [JWC] (nor indeed anybody) in such suffering, and continual misery night and day&#x201D; (<date when="1864-01-13">13</date>). By the end of the month, however, TC writes to the duchess of Argyll that &#x201C;[o]f late weeks &#x2026; there seems to be &#x2026; some real progress towards improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. &#x2026; We are ordered to Hastings &#x26; the Sea-side&#x201D; (<date when="1864-01-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1864-02">February</date></hi>. JWC&#x2019;s cousin Maggie Welsh, who is helping to nurse her, writes on her behalf to Lady Ashburton &#x201C;to tell you what a grief it has been to her &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to hear that Lord Ashburton has been so very ill of late&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-02-06">6?</date>]), and later thanks her for the &#x201C;beautiful jelly &#x2026; along with several other kind gifts&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-02-17">17?</date>]). TC writes to his sister Jean Aitken of JWC&#x2019;s continuing health problems, and of his growing despair at her lack of real improvement: &#x201C;Darker disease, or with less help from medicine, I was never concerned with&#x201D; (<date when="1864-02-27">27</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1864-03">March</date></hi>. Drs. Quain and Barnes, as well as other doctors occasionally, attend JWC, even making &#x201C;a trial of &#x2018;Animal Magnetism&#x2019;&#x201D; (<date when="1864-03-01">1</date>). TC struggles on with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, writing to Neuburg for help with sources ([<date when="1864-03-06">6</date>]). JWC decides to take up the Blakistons&#x2019; invitation to stay with them at St. Leonards-on-Sea. TC writes to Emerson, introducing Edward Stanley and sending him volume 4 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1864-03-08">8</date>). JWC travels to St. Leonards in a &#x201C;sick carriage&#x201D; resembling a hearse, her cousin Maggie in attendance; TC goes with her to see her settled, then returns to Chelsea (<date when="1864-03-08">8</date>). He writes every day to JWC reporting his progress, or lack of it, on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>; he thanks Lady Stanley for an invitation and reports that &#x201C;[t]he Hastings news are favourable&#x201D; (<date when="1864-03-14">14</date>). But JWC&#x2019;s progress continues to fluctuate. TC tells JWC of a visit to Ruskin (<date when="1864-03-15">15</date>), whose father has just died, and a ride with Maud and Kate Stanley (<date when="1864-03-17">17</date>), that he has finished volume 5 &#x201C;in a way,&#x201D; and dined at Forster&#x2019;s with Robert Browning and Alexander Dyce (<date when="1864-03-20">20</date>). Visitors continue to disturb TC at his work, asking for reports of JWC. News arrives (<date when="1864-03-24">24</date>) of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s death (<date when="1864-03-23">23</date>); <pb id="pg-40-xxx" n="40:xxx"/>TC immediately writes to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1864-03-24">24</date>), as does JWC ([<date when="1864-03-25">25</date>]); she also writes despairingly about her health to William Dods in Haddington and to her aunts in Edinburgh, &#x201C;my Dr has hopes of my recovery. but I myself am not hopeful, my sufferings are terrible&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-03-25">25</date>]). TC attends Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s funeral (<date when="1864-03-31">31</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1864-04">April</date></hi>. TC reports an emotional day at the funeral, also the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">loss of my dear old black velvet cap</hi>&#x201D; (<date when="1864-04-01">1</date>). JWC sends birthday wishes and a gift of a gold seal to Forster (<date when="1864-04-02">2</date>). TC reports a &#x201C;hostile&#x201D; review of volume 4 in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> (<date when="1864-04-04">4</date>). He visits JWC and on his return reports to his sister Jean that JWC had put on a dress &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time since November last! She walks tolerably with a stick&#x201D;; she has suggested that TC might join her in St. Leonards, which TC is considering, as he is &#x201C;in so low a way with the botherat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> I have had&#x201D; (<date when="1864-04-04">4</date>). He writes complaining to his brother John A. Carlyle about Robson&#x2019;s delays, and that Larkin and Neuberg have both &#x201C;fallen useless,&#x201D; and encourages him to come and stay for a couple of weeks to cheer him up (<date when="1864-04-05">5</date>). TC&#x2019;s work continues badly (<date when="1864-04-08">8</date>); JWC writes telling him that Lord Ashburton has left him &#xa3;2000 in his will ([<date when="1864-04-08">8</date>]). TC is most indignant that Chapman is trying to pay him less than agreed ([<date when="1864-04-09">9</date>]), but later agrees to new terms (<date when="1864-04-13">13</date>); he declines to attend the celebrations for the tercentenary of Shakespeare&#x2019;s birth (<date when="1864-04-12">12</date>). Visitors continue to call at Cheyne Row (<date when="1864-04-15">15</date>) and TC complains that he is &#x201C;dull, beclouded, downpressed and altogether <hi rend="italic">owlish</hi>&#x201D; (<date when="1864-04-16">16</date>). JWC speaks of going home to die, but instead decides to take a small house in St. Leonards, fearing that she has outstayed her welcome at the Blakistons ([<date when="1864-04-19">19</date>]). TC makes plans to move to St. Leonards (<date when="1864-04-22">22</date>). Maggie Welsh reports that JWC &#x201C;was very poorly all day yesterday&#x201D; and that &#x201C;morphia seems to have lost its effect&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-04-24">24</date>]), and JWC herself writes to TC &#x201C;I am suffering torments! &#x2026; I would like you beside me&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-04-25">25</date>]). &#x201C;Middle of May&#x201D; TC replies ([<date when="1864-04-26">26</date>]). JWC moves to her new house, 117 Marina (<date when="1864-04-28">28</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi>. JWC writes to TC about arrangements for him moving to St. Leonards and invites John A. Carlyle to visit her ([<date when="1864-05-01">1</date>]). TC tells JWC of his visitors, Rose Greenhow, Geraldine Jewsbury, and Robert Tait (<date when="1864-05-02">2</date>). John returns from his visit to report JWC&#x2019;s &#x201C;great distress and feeling of dispiritment&#x201D; (<date when="1864-05-03">3</date>). TC writes to Jewsbury declining her offer to help nurse JWC (<date when="1864-05-08">8</date>), and to Neuberg to say he will be away, &#x201C;with tools &#x26; goods&#x201D; until the end of <date when="1864-07-09">July (9)</date>. Maggie Welsh returns to Liverpool to help nurse her sick nephew, and Mary Craik comes from Belfast to help JWC. TC moves to St. Leonards (<date when="1864-05-14">14</date>), and reports to Neuberg that JWC is &#x201C;improving and improved&#x201D; and invites him to visit (<date when="1864-05-18">18</date>). TC writes to Larkin requesting books and his woolen shoes (<date when="1864-05-26">26</date>), and then requests that Larkin pay his tax bill (29). JWC replies to an invitation from Mary Russell, &#x201C;Oh <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Mary shall I live to see your dear face again?&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-05-31">ca. 31</date>]).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-40-xxxi" n="40:xxxi"/><hi rend="italic">June</hi>. TC sends Elizabeth Downes, recently widowed, a check for &#xa3;50 from Lady Louisa Ashburton (<date when="1864-06-03">3</date>). He continues to request books and dictionaries from Larkin ([<date when="1864-06-03">ca. 3</date>]) and information from Neuberg (<date when="1864-06-04">4</date>). He writes to Lady Ashburton sympathizing over the Ashburton family dispute regarding Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s will, and hoping that he and JWC might be able to visit her at the end of <date when="1864-07-05">July (<date when="1864-06-05">5</date>)</date>. TC congratulates Woolner on his engagement (<date when="1864-06-11">11</date>). JWC tells Eliza Forster that &#x201C;sometimes I think myself slowly recovering; at other times I despair utterly&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-06-12">12</date>]). TC tells Froude he hopes to be finished with <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> in six months and is saddened by Ruskin&#x2019;s involvement in &#x201C;Table-rapping &#x2026; The most blasphemous, detestable, contemptible <hi rend="italic">subter</hi>-doggery the Sons of Adam ever sank to&#x201D; (<date when="1864-06-23">23</date>). He writes to Lady Ashburton to find out if Addiscombe is empty, as JWC wants to leave St. Leonards but has a horror of returning to Chelsea (<date when="1864-06-25">25</date>); as it has been let, John A. Carlyle suggests she go to Dumfriesshire (<date when="1864-06-28">28</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi>. TC continues to request material from Neuberg and Larkin (<date when="1864-07-03">3</date>) and ([<date when="1864-07-06">6</date>]). JWC leaves St. Leonards, accompanied by John A. Carlyle (<date when="1864-07-12">12</date>), stays one night in the Forsters&#x2019; house in Kensington, then travels overnight (<date when="1864-07-13">13&#x02013;14</date>) to her sister-in-law Mary Austin at The Gill, Dumfriesshire. JWC reports to TC that on the journey to Scotland John was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dreadfully</hi> ill-tempered&#x2014;We quarrelled incessantly&#x201D; (<date when="1864-07-15">15</date>). She tells TC ([<date when="1864-07-19">19</date>]) of the carriage accident which occurred while out driving with James Carlyle and Mary Austin (<date when="1864-07-17">17</date>). TC returns to Chelsea (<date when="1864-07-19">19</date>). JWC arranges ([<date when="1864-07-21">21</date>]) to go to the Russells at Holmhill (<date when="1864-07-23">23</date>), then reports that &#x201C;nowhere on Earth would I be better off <hi rend="italic">externally</hi> than I am here&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-07-25">25</date>]). Mary Craik, who has been helping TC in Cheyne Row, leaves to return to Belfast (<date when="1864-07-26">26</date>). Sleeplessness continues to torment JWC ([<date when="1864-07-27">27</date>]), and Dr. Russell advises her to drink wine during the night; JWC continues taking quinine ([<date when="1864-07-28">28</date>]).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">August</hi>. TC pays John A. Carlyle for expenses incurred at St. Leonards and on the journey north with JWC; he is working on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> in the garden and expects to be into &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Book 21st</hi> (last &#x2018;Book&#x2019; of all!)&#x201D; by the end of August (<date when="1864-08-01">1</date>). He is very low in spirits (<date when="1864-08-02">2</date>). JWC is still sleepless; tincture of hops having failed, henbane is tried ([<date when="1864-08-02">2</date>]), then &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Indian Hemp</hi>&#x201D; is suggested ([<date when="1864-08-02">3</date>]); however her appetite is much improved ([<date when="1864-08-04">4</date>]), and she reports that she has gained &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">five pounds</hi> since D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston weighed me in April&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-08-05">5</date>]). TC visits Ruskin (<date when="1864-08-04">4</date>) and &#x201C;had mainly an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, bad tea, bad talk&#x201D; (<date when="1864-08-05">6 [5]</date>), then visits Forster and feels better for it (<date when="1864-08-07">7</date>). TC&#x2019;s nephew, William, visits from Ontario (<date when="1864-08-11">11</date>). JWC complains to TC about John&#x2019;s meanness, having reckoned her traveling expenses &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to the minutest farthing</hi> &#x2026; Oh mercy, that man is mean, mean!&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-08-12">12</date>]). JWC asks Eliza Forster to send her samples of wallpaper for re-decorating her bedroom in Cheyne Row, as she &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> go back to things <pb id="pg-40-xxxii" n="40:xxxii"/><hi rend="italic">as they were!</hi>&#x201D; ([<date when="1864-08-17">17</date>]). She tells TC that she had &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">laughed</hi>!!!&#x201D; at a remark of Dr. Russell&#x2019;s ([<date when="1864-08-19">19</date>]). TC thanks Lady Ashburton for sending him Thornton&#x2019;s sermon about Lord Ashburton and tells her that both he and JWC have been dreaming about Lord Ashburton (<date when="1864-08-21">21</date>). He tells JWC that &#x201C;[p]lenty of people come asking for you, day after day&#x201D; (<date when="1864-08-22">22</date>). JWC considers taking Charlotte Southam back as housemaid and asks TC&#x2019;s opinion ([<date when="1864-08-23">23</date>]). She tells of her successful shopping trip to Dumfries ([<date when="1864-08-26">26</date>]) and sends detailed instructions about the cleaning and decorating at Cheyne Row to both TC and Eliza Forster ([<date when="1864-08-29">29</date>]) and ([<date when="1864-08-30">30</date>]). TC&#x2019;s spirits are low, &#x201C;want of <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi>, I am ashamed to say, is the source of everything&#x201D; (<date when="1864-08-31">31</date>).</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>My poor Wife made me promise to write you a word,&#x2014;&#x201C;one word of acknowledg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x201D; whispered she passionately, &#x201C;for all these continual kindnesses: I am surrounded, wrapt up and supported on all hands by gifts and actings of hers!&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Louisa and Lord Ashburton were frequently generous with gifts of fruit, flowers, and farm produce from their estates.</note></p>
<p>I promised to write a word; but shall evidently find none in all my vocabulary to express the tenth part of what she meant. She herself (if it be Heaven&#x2019;s will), let us hope, will probably write you many words on or about that subject; but neither will she, I believe, get quite to the bottom of what I are her feelings are<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> upon it. I will therefore say no more; by silence, I believe, you will best understand it.</p>
<p>We (that is, she) are still in very great distress;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC suffered a painful left arm for several months, summer <date when="1863">1863</date> (see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630916-JWC-MR-01"><sic>39:186</sic><corr>JWC to MR, [<date when="1863-09-16">16 Sept. 1863</date>]</corr></ref>); after a bad fall, <date when="1863-09-22">22 Sept.</date> (see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630926-TC-LLA-01"><sic>39:204&#x02013;6</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1863-09-26">26 Sept. 1863</date></corr></ref>), she became increasingly unwell (see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631221-TC-LLA-01"><sic>39:258&#x02013;59</sic><corr>TC to LLA, <date when="1863-12-21">21 Dec. 1863</date></corr></ref>).</note> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say as great as ever,&#x2014;were it not for one small symptom, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps I make too much.

Her mind, singular to say, is clear as starlight, practically cognisant of everything: &#x201C;Stand by the helm,&#x201D; I say to her, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">you</hi> steadily, in this hideous tornado!&#x201D;&#x2014;alas, that is ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all I can do for her.

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I have no very good news to send you, or else I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be prompter ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it. Poor Jane is not to be called worse (so far as I judge), but neither can she be called better: and we are in great confusion and misery as heretofore. No right sleep even for a moment; most nights none of any kind: all the abominat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of drug stuff, after being tried in vain for 3 nights, have been flung into the ashpit ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Night before last she had a severe and tedious attack of bowels (a dismal, tossing night); I was, and still am, in some hope this might have been Nature&#x2019;s own effort to prepare for a little rest: but hitherto little or none has come. She can still eat a little (tho&#x2019; yesterday was languidward); the Doctor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dr. Alfred Barnes, JWC&#x2019;s regular doctor; Dr. Richard Quain also attended her.</note> comes twice a day (since this bilious attack), but still talks hopefully</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, in addit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to all, is quite stolen from me: I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> simply have no consol<hi rend="italic">n</hi> left if I were cut off from a little &#x201C;work done&#x201D;!

 <p>After a very feeble days-work, I have still 3 minutes before going on the <hi rend="italic">jog-jog</hi> (I ride that way to avoid falling, where the roads are hard; you have no idea with what swiftness, and with less disgust than I had at first: jog-g&#x2014;jog&#x2014;jg).<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s horse, Noggs, was not very safe at high trotting, but was fine at jog trotting; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630516-TC-JAC-02"><sic>39:204</sic><!-- 39:128 --><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1863-05-16">16 May 1863</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

You never saw a creature so <hi rend="italic">brashed</hi> to pieces, and extentuated by pain and restless misery. She <hi rend="italic">sleeps</hi> now fairly a little better, perhaps 2 hours altogether in the night, with perhaps addit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of as much, in two or 3 pieces, thro&#x2019; the day. She lies also far quieter; broken down as in utter weariness &#x26; weakness; is ordered 2 glasses of sherry per day, &#x26; &#xBD; glass of Hollands made into punch (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> too I think will do good for a certain reason). She is greatly discouraged, poor soul; but grasps at the idea of still continuing with us, if it <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done in not insupportable suffering.

This goes on since Sunday; even this not very <hi rend="italic">steadily</hi>:&#x2014;and we must accept it as the best that can be got.</p>

In the <date when="1861">1861</date> lecture Gibson noted: &#x201C;The old rhyme claiming pre-eminence of altitude for certain hills on the confines of Lancashire and Yorkshire is well known and often quoted.

Gibson&#x2019;s footnote was that &#x201C;Catsteecam &#x2026; is the proper name of this height. The old rhymester has altered it to make it meet a rhyming emergency&#x201D; (54). Helvellyn is 3,117 ft. (950 m.) and Catstycam 2,920 ft. (890 m.).</note> to my young eyes, were the beautifullest thing I have ever seen, or shall now see.</p>

<p>Miss Anstruther&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s niece Annie Nairn Anstruther; she and her mother, Mary, often helped Lady Ashburton when Lord Ashburton was ill; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18621210-JWC-MR-01"><sic>39:5</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1862-12-10">10 Dec. 1862</date></corr></ref>.</note> kind note reached me this morning, &#x26; I feel very sorry that I have not written to you long ere this, but I thought that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle had been writing to let you know how M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle has been going on. I know he is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> busy at present&#x2014;&#x26; I see that he looks worried, besides having been most sad &#x26; anxious about poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle. She herself begs me to give her very dear love &#x26; to tell you what a grief it has been to her &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to hear that Lord Ashburton has been so very ill of late.&#x2014; Till D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain told her &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle on Thursday they did not know that Lord Ashburton had been more ailing than usual &#x26; sadly distressed they have been to learn it. Most thankful they are to hear even of the slightest improvement, but what a time of anxiety you must have dear Lady. God grant that it may ere long be relieved. I many times think of your kindness the day you came up to see M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle &#x26; I am sure <hi rend="italic">they</hi> both felt it much.</p>
<p>I wish I could give you a <hi rend="italic">sincerely</hi> better report of her but today she is really <hi rend="italic">very</hi> poorly, suffering very great pain, &#x26; she looks, I think, very poorly indeed. Still in some respects she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> undoubtedly better than when you saw her,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s visit late <date when="1863-12">Dec. 1863</date>; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631229-TC-RMM-01"><sic>39:263<!-- 39:262 --></sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1863-12-29">29 Dec. 1863</date></corr></ref>.</note> but in others she seems almost worse. She herself assures me that she never has felt at all <hi rend="italic">really</hi> better &#x26; she is certainly often very very suffering. Still the doctors always say she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> better &#x26; in nervous illness, such as hers seems to be, of course <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can judge far better than others. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain who has been most kind in coming to see her repeatedly, saw her on Thursday &#x26; said that he considered her decidedly very much better. Her appetite is very good &#x26; for the last three nights she has slept a good deal, but truly the sleep, though one knows it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do good, does not seem to be felt so by poor Cousin. She is stronger too I think than when you saw her, in full&#x2014;one feels that she <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be better, but I cannot truly say that she ever seems to me to be <hi rend="italic">really</hi> so. Perhaps I have grown a little disheartened seeing her so constantly suffering &#x26; that may make me less alive to the improvement. Still I do <pb id="pg-40-12" n="40:12"/>not show her <hi rend="italic">I hope</hi> that I do not quite think as the doctors do at least I <hi rend="italic">try not</hi> for I feel <hi rend="italic">&#x26; hope</hi> that I may be quite mistaken. They are very anxious for a Change for her,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC reported to the duchess of Argyll, <date when="1864-01-31">31 Jan.</date>, that they were &#x201C;ordered to Hastings &#x26; the Sea-side.&#x201D;</note> &#x26; we often speak of it, but at times, as today, she looks very unfit for any place but home, though I do not <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> say so to her or <hi rend="italic">look</hi> it either. I will write again if all be well very soon for I know that even with all your cares &#x26; anxieties you are anxious to hear about M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle.</p>
<p>She takes a great deal of food made with milk, &#x26; the cream, which comes in such abundance &#x26; so regularly, is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> enjoyed by her, She many times says &#x201C;how <hi rend="italic">very</hi> kind they are.&#x201D; I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> trust to have better accounts to send you. The doctors are so hopeful that I feel it is scarcely natural or right in me to be less so. Perhaps it is from seeing herself so low, &#x26; always saying she will never get better. Sometimes however she does speak much more hopefully &#x26; says &#x201C;if ever I get better I will do &#x26; &#x2026; &#x2026; .&#x201D; For a time she never even would allow the possibility of ever being better, so this must <hi rend="italic">surely</hi> be a better sign of her strength.</p>
<p>She again bids me give her kindest love</p>

<p>At dusk when I came home from my ride, there was a whirlpool of people in and about the house, one of whom I privately learned was Dr Quain. I retired to the kitchen, to smoke perdue and waylay Dr Quain. Having had a word from him, I stole up to my bedroom for the usual nap of sleep. I had not got to sleep there, when the maid came knocking with &#x201C;a Letter, Sir&#x201D; (your Letter, I did not learn <hi rend="italic">by</hi> whom). I read the letter, with the bad candle and the bad eyes,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">failing</hi> to make out the first line;&#x2014;I conclude it was your man Crawley<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Crawley (b. <date when="1828">1828</date>), Ruskin&#x2019;s valet until <date when="1876">1876</date>.</note> that had bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it; and I sent a verbal ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as if <hi rend="italic">by</hi> Crawley for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! Not till <pb id="pg-40-13" n="40:13"/>half an hour ago, on reading the Note deliberately after dinner, did I ascertain for myself what an unutterable absurdity there had been committed;&#x2014;to my own and especially my poor Wife&#x2019;s very great disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>:&#x2014;with the question still in the rear, Is it forgivable and reparable, or is it?</p>
<p>I at once apprise you, at any rate and beg to make a thousand and a thousand apologies to the kind Dr. for what I unwittingly did.</p>

    <salute>Dear Lady</salute>
    <p>As I think perhaps M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle may not have written lately, for he seems both very busy &#x26; very sad at heart often, I now write feeling sure you will be anxious to hear of poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle. There seems to be very little change since the last time I wrote, but one cannot help fearing &#x26; feeling that as week after week goes on finding no real change for the better, the fear of her strength giving way becomes greater. Still from what the doctors say they have hopes she may yet overcome the illness.</p>
    <p>For the last week she has not been suffering the weary, &#x26; sometimes intense, nervous pain nearly so much; this <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be an improvement; for that constant suffering was most wearing out. How she has stood it so long has been a wonder to me. She is dreadfully thin &#x26; worn out <hi rend="italic">looking</hi>, but she has still astonishing strength in moving herself. She has no apparent dislike to food, but for several days past she has not at all taken it with the same caring. Today I am thankful to see that she has more inclination for it. She bids me give you &#x0201C;her very dear love.&#x0201D; She &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> thank you, she says, for your kind thought of them at <hi rend="italic">all</hi> times.</p>
    <p>Some beautiful jelly came this morning, along with several other kind gifts; also a Charming box of rusks, which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle likes so very much. She too often likes them steeped in milk. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x26; she have been so very rejoiced to hear better news of Lord Ashburton. You must indeed, dear Lady, have had an anxious time for long, and what thankfulness to feel that all your care has been of avail. I have <hi rend="italic">many</hi> times thought of you &#x26; your great anxiety. <closer>

<p>She is feeling <hi rend="italic">much</hi> for you as you can well believe.</p>
<p>I am writing beside her just now, &#x26; she has just told me to say to you that she &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">would</hi> like to live a little longer to thank you for all your great kindness &#x26; thought for her.&#x201D; She was quite touched when we brought her the jelly; she said it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so thoughtful in the midst of all your own sad trouble.</p>

The Dr&#x2019;s letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get last night, brought favourable news of poor Jane&#x2019;s having had 3 consecutive nights of sleep, better in kind and greater in quantity than had been known before;&#x2014;but now we are at the old basis again: Friday night, a very poor allowance of sleep, and last night as good as none at all! Very great depression, weakness and misery the consequence. I strive to suppose it is chiefly the bad <hi rend="italic">weather</hi> (frosty, bitter, snowy, bad for us all);&#x2014;and it is <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> there may be better sleep tonight: but we do not <hi rend="italic">know</hi>. And on the whole you see how uncertain any &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bulletin</hi>&#x201D; is as an indication, in this dark and miserable passage of distress we are in. God only knows what is to become of us and it. We must wait, as patiently as is in our power what the Will of the Supreme is: help <hi rend="italic">we</hi> can give none; comfort in the bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> none can give us.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell, <date when="1864-02-15">15 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I am writing in the drawing room of 5 Cheyne Row Poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> ill&#x2014;&#x26; nobody knows what is the matter with her&#x2014;the doctors declare that it is all on the nerves&#x2014;but both I &#x26; her cousin who is nursing her fear that she injured herself in her <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> &#x26; that there is a cause for all the pain &#x26; terrible restlessness. she suffers dreadfully &#x26; her restlessness is worse than pain it is only very seldom she will see me but I come on the chance of being useful sometimes&#x2014; Mr Carlyle is still in the throes of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> &#x26; is very miserable about his wife no man cd shew more kindness or tenderness&#x201D; (MS: Mantell).</note></p>
<p>I am myself still on foot, tho&#x2019; the frost is very troublesome to me: and my poor <hi rend="italic">Task</hi> (the only one I can see for living at all) is obliged to encounter the dismallest impediments. I had a bit of a gallop today in the silent Country (after three miles of <hi rend="italic">railway</hi> &#x26; suburb abominat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> one does get into the Country): but I was soon obliged to turn, the roads getting more &#x26; more glassy and unsafe. I hope the Frost at least will take itself away. It is my little Horse that keeps me alive, as it were; <hi rend="italic">roadway</hi> for him is a great indispensability to him. Condolences, talk from anybody I see, are distasteful to me: absolute silence, with a little work <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, is my most tolerable posture of affairs.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You understand, without my speaking of it, how infinitely my poor Wife and myself are obliged by your great and constant kindness in this our extremity! We have had, [missing words]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Line torn away; missing words possibly included &#x201C;many doctors.&#x201D;</note> of skill and judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, have been here, with their best endeavours; but all their appliances, <hi rend="italic">opiates</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c have worsened the matter (not in any case producing even temporary <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> or assuagement);&#x2014;and except it be Nature herself struggling towards some recovery, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I flatter myself with seeing symptoms there is not the slightest improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <pb id="pg-40-21" n="40:21"/>traceable otherwise. In fact all the Doctors and I [missing words]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Line torn away.</note> and were unanimous in finding that neither <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, nor in any other part, was the least derang<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, of organ or of function, perceptible;&#x2014;and she herself is convinced there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> none: but that does not help the matter! The Drs (Quain, Farr,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a colleague of Quain&#x2019;s; possibly George Frederick Farr, M.D., 20 West Sq., Southwark. TC wrote later: &#x201C;The doctors were many; Dr. Quain (who would take no fees) the most assiduous; Dr. Blakiston (ditto), from St. Leonard&#x2019;s, express one time;&#x2014;speaking hope, always, both of these, and most industrious to help;&#x2014;with many more, whom I did not even see. When any <hi rend="italic">new</hi> miraculous kind of Doctor was recommended as such, my poor struggling martyr, conscious too of grasping at mere straws, could not but wish to see him; and he came, did his mischief, and went away. We had even (by sanction of Barnes, and indeed of sound sense never so sceptical) a trial of &#x2018;Animal Magnetism;&#x2019; two magnetisers, first a man, then a <hi rend="italic">quack</hi> woman (evidently a conscious quack I perceived her to be),&#x2014;who at least did no ill, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> entirely disappoint (if that were much an exception)&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 172).</note> [missing words].<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Line torn away; the list of doctors probably included Dr. Barnes.</note></p>
<p>This is all I had to say to you; dear Sir, &#x2014;and, in spite of my confusion &#x26; my hurry, I believe you will be able to make out both what I mean &#x26; what I feel,&#x2014;and to discern what you yourself are to do in it,&#x2014;with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my writing another word. My best thanks to Mrs B. &#x26; you I need not add. <closer><salute>Yours sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You will probably apply tomorrow ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at the Post Office; and I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly give you better news than I have&#x2014;if I only could! I must write a baddish word rather than none.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-40-23" n="40:23"/>My poor suffering partner is in great misery last week and still today. Next to no sleep for <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> nights past; &#x26; in some six of them absolutely none! It is heartbreaking even to be near such a thing. She had appointed <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> (day after tomorrow) for Hastings; nor has she yet <hi rend="italic">revoked</hi>: but I doubt if she will go. Her poor heart is worn quite out of her;&#x2014;the thing you generally hear from her, on pressing that inquiry, is something of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">last</hi> release&#x201D; that awaits us all: never before did she know what <hi rend="italic">utter</hi> wretchedness, &#x26; being totally beaten, was!&#x2014; I cannot for my life <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> anything ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> her disorder: since people keep asking, one is obliged to say something, &#x201C;Better,&#x201D; &#x201C;Worse,&#x201D; &#x201C;much the same&#x201D;;&#x2014;but really <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know whether her sad calamity (and mine) is on the way of mending or on the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> way.&#x2014; Last week has been rather hard for me too: I lost a day in <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> &#x26;c ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this of Hastings; but that was a <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> and blessed kind of loss, in comparison. I have lost <hi rend="italic">two nights</hi> by&#x2014;causes <hi rend="italic">not</hi> sacred! In short, I have very great difficulty to keep the plough by the shafts at all; but I strive, strive.</p>
<p>I aim to go on Tuesday, or whenever she goes:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC took JWC to stay with the Blakistons, nr.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has asked me to write in answer to your kind note which he received today, he begs me also to apologize for not writing himself, but he is just at present very much occupied. I grieve to say that my Cousin M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is still very ill. The doctors are most anxious for her to go to the seaside, as they appear to think that a Change of air &#x26; of scene may do great good when many other things have unfortunately failed. I do hope &#x26; pray that she may derive benefit from it. It is decided that if she feel equal to moving we go to St Leonard&#x2019;s-on-Sea <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi>. I feel <hi rend="italic">very</hi> anxious in thinking of the <pb id="pg-40-24" n="40:24"/>journey for she is in a sadly weak state, but as the medical men seem to have little fear but that she will stand the journey pretty well, I try not to feel so uneasy about it, &#x26; would fain hope that once there she may ere long feel some good effect from the pure sea air.</p>
<p>She bids me give her kindest love. Perhaps you will be so very kind as to let Miss Welsh<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s cousin John Amelia (Jackie) Welsh, who also lived in Haddington.</note> know that you have heard from me, for I have of late been so much occupied that I am sorry I have been unable to write to her. I am sorry indeed to hear she is so ailing at present.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my poor little Darling!&#x2014;</salute>You behaved like a heroine yesterday, firm to your purpose; and surely it was a blessing you got the journey done, instead of waiting,&#x2014;till today, for instance. How quiet you were, and clear and calm: my dear little suffering woman!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;About the beginning of <date when="1864-01">January (1864)</date> there were thought to be perceptible some faint symptoms of improvement or abatement; which she herself never durst believe in; and indeed to us eager on-lookers they were faint and uncertain&#x2014;nothing of real hope, except in getting to St. Leonards so soon as the season would permit. &#x2F; Early in March, weather mild though dim and wettish, this sad transit was accomplished by railway; I escorting, and visiting at every stage; Maggie Welsh and our poor patient in what they called a &#x2018;sick carriage,&#x2019; which indeed took her up at this door, and after delays and haggles at St. Leonards, put her down at Dr. B&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s [Blakiston&#x2019;s]; but was found otherwise inferior to the common arrangement for a sick person (two window-seats, with board and cushion put between), though about five or six times dearer, and was never employed again. She was carried downstairs here in the bed of this dreary vehicle (which I saw well would remind her, as it did, of a hearse, with its window for letting in the coffin); she herself, weak but clear, directed the men. So pathetic a face as then glided past me at this lower door I never saw nor shall see! And the journey&#x2014;and the arrival. But of all this, which passed without accident, and which remains to myself unforgettable enough, and sad as the realms of Hades, I undertook to say nothing. &#x2F; Her reception was of the very kindest; her adjustment, with Maggie and one of our maids [Mary] (in fine, airy, quiet rooms, in the big house, with the loving and skilful hosts), I saw in a few hours completed to my satisfaction, far beyond expectation. She herself said little; but sat, in her pure, simple dress, &#x26;c., looking, though sorrowful, calm and thankful&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:192&#x02013;93). Henry Larkin also provided a detailed description of JWC&#x2019;s departure from Cheyne Row: &#x201C;She was decreasing in strength from day to day, and from week to week, and sinking into the saddest despondency and gloom of horror. I suppose no one who really watched her, ever thought to see her leave that bed alive. She herself had long given up all real hope. But one day she astonished me by telling me, she had made up her mind that if she must die, she might just as well die elsewhere as remain where she was, with nothing but the dreariest associations about her. She had consulted the doctors, and they had agreed that, with an invalid carriage, she might possibly still have strength to carry her as far as St. Leonards; and that, in short, she was resolved to try, even if she died upon the road. She then said, that &#x2018;as usual&#x2019; she must depend on me to help her. She had arranged everything. An invalid carriage was to drive up to the door. She was to be lifted into it on a couch. The carriage would then drive to the station, where it would be placed on a kind of truck, and she would thus be taken from door to door, without any further exertion on her part. All she wanted me to undertake was, when all was ready, to carry her downstairs in my arms, and lay her upon the couch; the attendants would then lift her into the carriage. But, she added despairingly, &#x2018;This time, I have insisted on Carlyle keeping out of the way till I am safe in the carriage. I don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;ll find me very heavy.&#x2019; I was there at the time agreed, and carried her down as easily as if she had been a child of twelve years old. I was literally appalled at the shadow to which she had become reduced. After laying her gently upon the couch, I went to the front door to see that the carriage was ready to receive her; when I was still more shocked at the hideous receptacle to which she was, all unsuspectingly, about to be consigned; far more like a &#x2018;hearse,&#x2019; as Carlyle calls it, than a carriage; in which the living corpse was to be slid feet first, through a small door behind! I saw at a glance the whole horror of the thing, as it would strike her; but it was too late to interfere, for she was already being carried from the home. I shall never forget the agony of the stifled shriek which she could not suppress, as they lifted and pushed her in; or the look on her face when she was in, as I stood at the side-door trying to cheer her. I do not know whether such cruelties are still practised on helpless invalids in the name of mercy, but I earnestly hope not. As soon as she had sufficiently recovered herself, Carlyle (who was not before present, as he afterwards imagined) was sent for; and I bade her good-bye, deeply feeling that it was the last poor service I should ever render her. But the end was not yet; for, after many months of suffering, she came back to us seemingly almost herself again&#x201D; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 77&#x02013;79).</note>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Mr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Carlyle bids me give you her dearest love &#x26; to thank you so very much for so very kindly granting her request, &#x26; so quickly!</p>
<p>Just as she was speaking of the Grange this afternoon, the little hamper arrived. She says I am to ask you if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Louisa Mackenzie, Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s widowed sister-in-law, often referred to as &#x201C;Mrs. George.&#x201D;</note>
 will be so very kind as sometimes to write to let her know how Lord Ashburton is, as she has not the same opportunities of hearing here as at Chelsea, &#x26; as you well know how anxious she is to hear. I do think that you may be cheered by seeing continued improvement, for a most anxious time of watching you must have had indeed.</p>
<p>I know you will be rejoiced to hear that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> here. We came yesterday, &#x26; most thankful we were to find that she bore the journey better than we had ventured to hope. She was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> tired <hi rend="italic">of course</hi>, that was truly to be expected. She scarcely slept however at all last night, &#x26; today she is very much the same as she has been for so long. Though they seemed to hope some <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> improvement (at least some did) it was really too much to expect <pb id="pg-40-28" n="40:28"/><hi rend="italic">that</hi>, &#x26; one must hope &#x26; pray that in a little time we really may see some good effect come from the pure air &#x26; the change of scene. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle returned home last evening, &#x26; he means to come again very soon to see how she goes on; he has not been looking at all well himself poor man, for the last week, I dare say he will be the better of the complete quiet at home.</p>

<salute>Dear Madam</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle bids me thank you very much for your last letter &#x26; its better news. She says it will be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> kind if you will again, when you have leisure, send just two lines to say how Lord Ashburton is. She sends her kindest love to yourself &#x26; to Lady Ashburton. Will you please say from her to Lady Ashburton that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle mentions having received another hamper from the Grange containing hares &#x26; &#x26; a large jar of jelly. As he himself never does take either hare or the jelly M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle thinks it is too bad that Lady Ashburton should so mindfully be ordering them to be sent. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle did not like to <hi rend="italic">say this</hi> himself!</p>
<p>I do think I may give you a better report of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle. She is certainly in every respect stronger than when we came, but she herself says that she has suffered for so long now that she feels as if she had but little courage or hope to aid her recovery. Those around her however do in many ways see improvements, more almost than could have been expected in so short a time &#x26; bye &#x26; bye I cannot help hoping she herself will begin really to <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> amendment. She has had several short drives, &#x26; she is eating well. The sleeping too is on the whole better, but she still feels as if it did not refresh her as good sleep should. She bids me say that if kind nursing &#x26; <hi rend="italic">good doctoring could</hi> do good she feels that she should be better. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blakiston are truly most kind in every way.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I am &#x2F; Dear Madam &#x2F; Respectfully yours &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>Margaret Welsh</name></p>
<ps><p>I have quite forgotten to say how very glad M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is to hear a good account of the dear little girl.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Florence Baring.</note></p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle says will you give her dear love to Lord Ashburton.</p></ps>

<p><salute>Alas, dear Lady,</salute> here is the end then; come suddenly on us; and all is over!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton d. Wed., <date when="1864-03-23">23 March</date>, 1:30 <hi rend="small-caps">P.M.</hi>, at The Grange. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1864-03-24">24 March</date>, reported that the &#x201C;melancholy event &#x2026; was comparatively unexpected. His Lordship had almost entirely recovered from the series of pulmonary attacks under which he had recently suffered, but expired suddenly from heart disease, to which he had been subject from youth.&#x201D; Dr. David Christison sent TC the news; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640324-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-24">24 March</date></ref>. David Christison (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x02013;<date when="1912">1912</date>), physician and archaeologist; Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s physician for the last two years of Ashburton&#x2019;s life (Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 99).</note> I had been nursing myself in fond hopes, as perhaps you had;&#x2014;and the shock <pb id="pg-40-40" n="40:40"/>to me, this morning, is great. To me also an Epoch is closed, much, how much, henceforth is forever hidden from my eyes! He could not <hi rend="italic">say</hi> adieu to you; his Last word to you was &#x201C;a smile,&#x201D; &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">smile</hi> never to be forgotten, while remembrance lasts in this world. He was always always beautifully noble, concerned for others beyond himself. I believe you may feel that you have faithfully done your duty to him. I believe you have been the unspeakable blessing of his life during these years now done. This may be a kind of Consolation, when Time shall have softened the first poignancy of your feelings.</p>

<p><salute>Alas, Darling,</salute> here is sad news, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> from Hastings; but to be added to what is there! Poor Lord Ashburton is gone. Perhaps you have heard already? I send you Christison&#x2019;s Letter: it gave a pungent shock to me, when I had done reading Maggie&#x2019;s. That final &#x201C;smile,&#x201D; while making the sudden exit, is a thing one will never forget.&#x2014; I have written a few words to the poor Lady.</p>
<p>Last night was ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> stolen from me, in a scarcely tolerable manner: those two Russells<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640322-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-22">22 March</date></ref>.</note> (tho&#x2019; I had not ans<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at all) came on all the same; and found me with my back to the jamb, just ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> going out for the Ante-<hi rend="italic">tea</hi> bit of walk; it was near 11 before I got rid of the useless creatures. Tonight I have specifically ordered, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">No</hi>body to be admitted&#x201D;; and intend to have a <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> tussel with my sheets.</p>
<p>Maggy does not tell me, the last two times, how <hi rend="italic">much</hi> of sleep you have. Let her always ment<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that, like a good <hi rend="italic">bairn</hi>. I persist in ascribing much of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lowness (<hi rend="italic">how</hi> much I cannot say, but am sure of <hi rend="italic">something</hi> in that item) to the dirty frost-air we have. It is quite wretched even to me who can walk. Oh <pb id="pg-40-41" n="40:41"/>continue <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> what y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor faculty is up to; drink y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> four glasses; drive out daily in the sunshine in the sea-air: <hi rend="italic">Medicine</hi> I do know lies there, if it do not anywhere else!&#x2014; Settle ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> come a week, just as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find it reasonable &#x26; desirable; there is still plenty of time. &#x201C;&#x2019;Oss, Sir!&#x201D;&#x2014; Adieu, Darling: I am very sad;&#x2014;but shall get better in the open air, in company of my little Horse, instead of worse!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir</salute>
<p>My cousin has asked me to enclose her note for you, which I feel sure you will be pleased to see. I fear the account of herself which she may have given will not be very hopeful nor can one wonder after such a long &#x26; trying illness. We came here a fortnight ago, &#x26; I am most thankful to say that we <hi rend="italic">do</hi> think there is <hi rend="italic">some</hi> improvement; more the doctor says than she really feels, at least that, he says, is his impression, I would fain hope he may be correct, &#x26; that ere long we really may see my Cousin stronger. She is able to go almost every day for a short drive, her appetite is good &#x26; she is sleeping on the whole better than for a long time she has done. Still she is in, I fear, a very precarious state &#x26; it will be, at the best, long ere she regain her former measure of health which for so long has been but feeble. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle came with us here but he has returned home. He is to be back ere long for a day or two. Cousin is staying with her friends D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blakiston, who are indeed most kind to us all. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle bids me say to you that she will take it <hi rend="italic">very</hi> kind if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Dodds will sometimes look after Miss Welsh<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s cousin Jackie Welsh.</note> who she fears is very poorly. I wrote to her a short time ago, for she seems so anxious, poor thing, to hear about M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle.</p>

<p>I do think you will all in some measure be pleased to see Cousin&#x2019;s own short letter; I fear the account she may have given you will not be a very hopeful one, nor can I wonder. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston does consider her in many respects better &#x26; I do myself think she is. I confess I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> feel so sanguine of any thing like the recovery he seems to hope for, still I have felt all through her illness that the doctors of course could judge far better than we could of an illness which is so decidedly very much on the nerves. I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> like to see her more hopeful of her own recovery (as being really a better sign of her) but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> feeling also may be a part of the illness. We can but trust &#x26; hope as you <pb id="pg-40-44" n="40:44"/>say, for these things <hi rend="italic">are</hi> in better hands than ours. This morning she has had very sorrowful news.

Taken with its personages, it fills a large place in my memories. I had much in common with him, mainly a failure in public life, which he bore with a dignity and manliness I have never assumed, but which he felt quite as acutely: indeed, in the comparison between himself and other men I think there was more of contempt and self-depreciation than goes with my nature&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 2:122).</note> There is a wild tone of woe in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note!

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>Here am I at home, and have taken a smoke (4 p.m.) with design to have another and some trial for a nap of sleep, and <hi rend="italic">muttonbroth</hi> following it as dinner; but will first write my poor little Jeannie this word for tomorrow morning. All seems right here, and I consigned y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> gift to Hellen, who seemed much gratified and has things in fair order here. No Letters for you, nor for Maggie. We had a nasty three of partners in our carriage; Jewish specimens all of one lot,&#x2014;dirty Jew Father d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> mother, d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> nurse-maid and Baby, for whose sake they half-choked us all, till in the last 30 miles, it became too strong even for them,&#x2014;the nasty creatures, and they had to admit a little through-draft.</p>
<p>Oh my little darling, what a 50 hours of chaotic emotions I have had. How <hi rend="italic">glad</hi>, and yet how sorrowful,&#x2014;the miseries of your poor little heart wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are too real to me; and the steadfast hope and percept<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I have that we are really making progress! Let us thank God; and patiently expect. Oh me, oh me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My time is up, and as I really have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to report, I will not risk being belated so foolishly. John has sent me a <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> with an extremely contemptible <hi rend="italic">review</hi> of Vol. IV<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review was mixed, acknowledging TC&#x2019;s peculiar genius and historical effort, but deploring the fact that &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle is voluminous in his contempt for the writers from whom he has to collect his materials. &#x2026; Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s complaint is &#x2026; to the effect that the minor French and German writers in the middle of the eighteenth century wrote on trivial matters in a trivial but natural way, and that they principally saw the less happy side of the King of Prussia&#x201D; (&#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Frederick the Great,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi>, <date when="1864-04-02">2 April</date>).</note> (hostile if the dirty puppy durst, but <hi rend="italic">favourable</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Chapmans&#x2019;s</hi> purpose,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Chapman would have been pleased by the reviewer&#x2019;s general appraisal of vol. 4: &#x201C;Those who admire Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s genius &#x2026; will probably find that the fourth is equal in merit to its predecessors.

TC might be referring to the fact that Chapman &#x26; Hall only printed 4,500 copies of vols. 3 and 4, rather than the 5,000 copies they had printed of vols. 1 and 2; or perhaps Chapman had already hinted he wanted to withhold part payment for vol. 4 until the whole work was finished; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640409-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1864-04-09">9 April</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;not worth a snuff of tobacco); this and a Note from Jean,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean wrote, <date when="1864-04-01">1 April</date>: &#x201C;I hope you may find her looking more cheery The Forsters w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a bad complication for both of you &#x26; her, but I hope got backed out of that.&#x201D;</note> is all I find here. <closer><salute>God bless thee my own little Woman</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have just got home from Hastings; too late for this days post: but you will get my bit of message on Tuesday night (if you call);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Dumfries Post Office.</note> so I write it without delay.</p>
<p>Poor J as Maggie Welsh w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell you, was in appearance beyond my expectat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> not under it; the Doctor too, who is a rugged decisive kind of man, and not capable of perverting the truth, is quite sanguine ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the matter; and counts the progress made to be highly satisfactory. She <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> quite otherwise, at some moments as if almost well ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; they assure me she eats <hi rend="italic">better</hi>; almost every night gets some considerable allowance of <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> sleep, and once or twice has had a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> night of sleep; she drives out twice aday for most part;&#x2014;in short, I do hope she is evidently mending. On the other hand, her own humour is almost quite <hi rend="italic">despondent</hi>, and the pain and misery she still has is such as to cut one to the heart amid one&#x2019;s joy over her essential improvem<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. The Doctor makes but little of this symptom,&#x2014;&#x201C;natural to the disease,&#x201D; he says:&#x2014;and it does appear the pain she used to complain of is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> at any time so intolerable as it was while here; and it is for an hour or so daily in <hi rend="italic">abeyance</hi>, and twice for almost a day has been off altogether. Yesterday and today she had put on <hi rend="italic">a dress</hi> (for the sake of company calling), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time since November last! She walks tolerably with a stick;&#x2014;speculates on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coming down there to live too. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> really might be the right plan to take, I myself being in in<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated by TC.</note> so low a way with the botherat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> I have had. I mean to send the Doctor a word tonight or tomorrow; but you may as well push this along too. <closer><salute>Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I returned yesterday afternoon from Hastings; quite worn to the ground with what had gone on there (alas I must wait till night: here is warning of &#x201C;the Horse&#x201D; (a wet day too); and I have to write one word to poor Jane!) (<hi rend="italic">Downstairs 11 p.m.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s parentheses were to indicate breaking off and restarting letter.</note> After a furious gallop thro&#x2019; the nastiest plash of sleety rain; after <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, dinner, and a dreary fit of <hi rend="italic">working</hi>,&#x2014;I resume, before going out for my final walk of the day. Jean has probably sent you from Dumfries my brief Hastings report. The Doctor, not at first <hi rend="italic">sanguine</hi> (as his Letter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I always meant to send, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have shewn) was grown quite emphatic about poor Jane&#x2019;s improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26;c; and indeed it was undeniably evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, alas, her suffering is, no less evidently, still very great, and filled me with distress to witness it. She is always on the edge of crying: full of hysterical pains and emotions, refuses to have any comfortable hope. My guess is, she will have to stay yonder all summer; there was speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> thereupon of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> coming down (t.o.) too, and I suppose that also to be likely,&#x2014;if I can possibly contrive to take my <hi rend="italic">Work</hi> with me: tho&#x2019; I absolutely must not otherwise. Oh dear, oh dear! I am hard bested; and do much need all the poor remnant of energy that is left me in this juncture of things. The sea-shore, and absence from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> unblessed element w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> probably do me good: but my need of getting done with the intolerable Book is also intense! The prospect of fronting <hi rend="italic">another winter</hi> like the last 3 or more, with it, makes me tremble. In fact, nothing but my <hi rend="italic">Horse</hi> keeps <pb id="pg-40-54" n="40:54"/>me alive at all, or in the least capacity for doing work. Robson&#x2019;s Printers too plague me with <hi rend="italic">their</hi> delays<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Robson had been involved in bankruptcy proceedings; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640112-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1864-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref></note> (Robson is <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> perhaps tomorrow to fall on new plans with <hi rend="italic">them</hi>); Larkin has fallen useless,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Larkin was probably still suffering from the death at birth of his da., <date when="1864-03-22">22 March</date>; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640325-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-25">25 March</date></ref>.</note> Neuberg d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg suffered recurring episodes of ill-health; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630910-TC-JN-01"><sic>39:181&#x02013;82</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1863-03-10">10 March 1863</date></corr></ref>; he had also recently suffered a bereavement; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640306-TC-JN-01">TC to JN [<date when="1864-03-06">6 March</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;unfortunate mechanics deserting a doubly unfortunate poor old engineer in his extremity! We must and will manage nevertheless. Courage, Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You may judge, dear Brother, what kind of <hi rend="italic">company</hi> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be, if you came to me! I get in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> nothing but mischief at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> out of all the people ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me. I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> even you to come &#x26; front such a scene. But if you liked to come of will for a couple of weeks, and felt y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self in spirits for such a task, of course you might do me benefit, and the sight of cheerful affection affection<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Repeated at top of next page.</note> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a comfort to me. There is a reasonably good maid here; and the House, of course is mostly lying vacant;&#x2014;the Drawingroom here a place for breakfasting in, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> for smoking in (with open windows), unless the garden be more inviting. There will be good weather soon; Erskine &#x26; y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friends will probably be in part leaving you; any work you are at can probably go on here as well as there: on the whole consider it;&#x2014;and let me see you for a couple of weeks if you think it will answer.</p>
<p>Forster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">hospitality</hi> in the Hastings matter was really of the kindest: but it did me a great deal of ill; and I will not try such a thing ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.

In the last week of March (as covenanted) I made my first visit (Friday till Monday, I think). Forster and Mrs. F. went with me, but did not see her. I stayed at Dr. B&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s, they at a hotel, where was dining, &#x26;c. Whether this was my first visit to her there I strive to recollect distinctly, but cannot. I seem to have even seen but little of her, and certainly learned nothing intimate; as if she rather avoided much communication with me, unwilling to rob me of the doctor&#x2019;s confident prognostications, and much unable to confirm them. Her mood of fixed quiet sorrow, with no hope in it but of enduring well, was painfully visible. I had just got rid of my vol. v., deeply disappointed latterly on finding that there must be a sixth. Hades was not more lugubrious than that book too now was to me; and yet there was something in it of sacred, of Orpheus-like (though I did not think of &#x2018;Orpheus&#x2019; at all, nor name my darling an &#x2018;Eurydice&#x2019;!) and the stern course was to continue&#x2014;what else?&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:194).</note></p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> what a mercy to me, Maggies Note is ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> favourable,&#x2014;more so than I ventured to expect, after the flurries and the bad weather It is true there is something of fluctuat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> reported: but we must be prepared for fluctuat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> almost daily; and be thankful to see that the tide, were it only slowly, is <hi rend="italic">making</hi>. That is the real fact, Dear; oh believe it, poor dispirited soul!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am still bird alone; &#x201C;sparrow-like companionless on the housetop,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 102:7.</note>&#x2014;and truly it answers better than any company I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get. Yesterday I had a long swift ride,&#x2014;thro pouring rain, sometimes with a taste almost of <hi rend="italic">sleet</hi> in it: the process was supremely unpleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, but it did me [good];<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted; &#x201C;good&#x201D; inserted in another hand.</note> in another 24 hours I expect to be at par ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Oh that I c<hi rend="italic">d get on</hi>, how<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; these beggarly <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> delays are quite enraging to me. Robson was to call &#x201C;some morning&#x201D; for <hi rend="italic">quickening</hi> measures; but disappoints me <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning; Larkin is grown not worth <hi rend="italic">his lugs</hi>, &#x2014; <pb id="pg-40-56" n="40:56"/>hardly even as an errand man is he good: W<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to Heaven I were honestly <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of this unblessed nearly intolerable thing, with the Life still left in me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are now Housekeepers on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own score. When y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> money is threatening to run low, bid Maggy write, name the sum, and whether I must make to her to you or to Dr Blakiston.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC sent a check a few days later; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640414-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1864-04-14">14 April</date>]</ref>.</note></p>

<p><salute>Alas,</salute> we said we w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be &#x201C;prepared for <hi rend="italic">fluctuat</hi>ns&#x201D;; and here, it seems, is one!

<dateline>5 Warrior Square St Leonard&#x2019;s-on-Sea Friday [<date when="1864-04-08">8 April 1864</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dear Lady</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle bids me write to thank you very much for your letter which she only received <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning. There happen to be two postmen who do duty in Warrior Square &#x26; the letter having unfortunately got into the hands of the wrong man, it has been wandering about till today we suppose.</p>
<p>Cousin says I am to give you her very dear love &#x26; to tell you how much she would like to be able to come to see you at the Grange but she fears that is indeed a far away prospect. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston considers her to be very <hi rend="italic">much better</hi>; she is able to drive out once every day &#x26; often she goes twice, &#x26; is up all the day, at least moving about now &#x26; then &#x26; resting on the sofa. This surely shows that she must be gaining strength. If it were not for the terrible depression from which she suffers &#x26; the almost constant nervous pain which she has for so long complained of &#x26; which only leaves her for very short &#x26; rare intervals, I really should be quite hopeful of seeing her regain by &#x26; bye some of her usual health, which truly at the best is but very delicate.</p>
<p>She is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> hopeless about herself, but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> may be really part of her ailment. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was here from Saturday until Monday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1864-04-02">2</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864-04-04">4 April</date>.</note> &#x26; he said that he thought her looking better than he ventured to hope, so we will hope that milder &#x26; bright weather will help to cheer &#x26; strengthen her. She bids me say to you that &#x201C;she feels as if a little time at this place would do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a great deal of good, for you have indeed had sore trouble &#x26; must be sadly worn out with watching &#x26; sorrow.&#x201D;</p>
<p>She has been most thankful to hear that on the whole you are pretty well, &#x26; most thankful too to hear that the dear little girl<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s da., Mary Florence.</note> is strong &#x26; well just now.</p>
<p>With most heartfelt sympathy dear Lady with all your sorrow</p>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>On Saturday my Wife sent me the Note she had rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> from you. To me it was abundantly affecting, that little trait wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you communicated, of Him whom <pb id="pg-40-62" n="40:62"/>we shall see no more! Strange, yet simple, beautiful; so <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the Doer of it:&#x2014;the last finish to 20 years of friendly acts and offices on his part,&#x2014;all done in the same gentle, quiet and fine way.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s gift of &#xa3;2000, see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640408-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-04-08">8 April</date>]</ref>. Lord Houghton wrote about Lord Ashburton to a friend, <date when="1864-04-01">1 April</date>: &#x201C;I am thankful I went to see Lord Ashburton before he died. I came away without any hope. Altogether he was the noblest and purest-minded man I have ever known. If he had had powers and facilities of expression, he would have been a great one&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 2:123).</note> It makes me sad to the very heart; but shall be sacred, and a beautiful possession to me while I linger my few days or years behind him in this world.</p>
<p>I well conceive y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> desolation; how you find with new astonish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at every turn that the <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> life, what was y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> daily labour &#x26; y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> care and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> joy, is suddenly fled away forever, and has left all vacant! This is sore, sore, while it lasts; but one gradually rallies, finds that are<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> new duties, a life still <hi rend="italic">full</hi> of such, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> can be done (in a measure) as if still under the old dear <hi rend="italic">banner</hi>, and in the name and as if for the sake of those that are away. Courage, Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Saturday gone a week I went down to St Leonards. Poor Jane, in her own sad mind is hardly at all better; and indeed her evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> miseries (only broken off at intervals) cut one to the quick: but it was clear to me that she had made considerable progress; and the Doctor, a rugged effective-looking man, was quite proud &#x26; confid<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> will evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> be needed: we must be patient with delays.</p>
<p>It was talked of, as certain, that I was myself to get down thither with Book, Horse, &#x26; try to write &#x26; live. I too have great need of &#x201C;country&#x201D;; an <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> broken-down old veteran, in the 12th year of his final War!&#x2014; Have you no chance to try Baby &#x26; Self with the sea-side sometime? It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very pretty.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>My heart is sore and <hi rend="italic">wae</hi> exceedingly to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> misery, poor Darling. Too evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that you are loaded with suffering &#x26; dispiritment; and that is a sore element in the Doctor&#x2019;s confident <hi rend="italic">prognosis</hi>,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I do believe in too (tho&#x2019; poor <hi rend="italic">you</hi> cannot): but oh this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a sad drawback to it; and makes one very miserable. And, alas, what can one <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in it! Nothing for us but <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, still hope with confidence in spite of present clouds. Perhaps Maggie will send me something better tomorrow: who knows? Perhaps you y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self will manage me a little Note ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> before long. Oh do, the soonest you can!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get so far as Sinclair&#x2019;s yesterday: at Streatham I had promised to myself to investigate a certain <hi rend="italic">bye-road</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seemed to lead in Norwood direct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>:&#x2014;alas on arriving there, I found it shut by a gate (import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> circumstance not noticed formerly!)&#x2014; Upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, being very sombre of mood, <pb id="pg-40-65" n="40:65"/>I turned for home ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Today, however, I do mean to go (unless quite too nasty), and have a vile bother finished.</p>
<p>Today Chapm<hi rend="italic">n</hi> the elder<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman.</note> <hi rend="italic">came</hi> (see Forster&#x2019;s Note <hi rend="italic">inclosed</hi>); I was very surly with him; but took pity on hearing him out. He is to pay me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> part at once, 3p<hi rend="italic">t</hi> by bill of 6 months, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> by bill of 9. As I don&#x2019;t put the least value on those sinister rumours,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly in relation to Robson &#x26; Levey&#x2019;s bankruptcy proceedings (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640112-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1864-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref>) and perhaps referred to in Forster&#x2019;s (untraced) note.</note> this will cost little inconvenience;&#x2014;and I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not afford to haggle on those outworks. Nay there really was some reason in what he urged.&#x2014; Enough of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Will you let Maggie read to you that Dream in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Citizen</hi>?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Citizen</hi> published a letter entitled &#x201C;A Strange Dream&#x201D; from an anonymous &#x201C;M.D.,&#x201D; <date when="1864-04-09">9 April 1864</date>: &#x201C;The perusal lately of an interesting article on &#x2018;Sleep and Dreams,&#x2019; in the April number of <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, recalls to my mind a curious dream with which I was visited on Monday morning the <date when="1864-03-26">26th of March</date>. In the dream, I was transported to the study of Thomas Carlyle, where I saw the form and features of the grey-haired and many-wrinkled philosopher, as distinctly as next morning I saw the straight form and blooming face of my own wife. The author of &#x2018;Sartor Resartus&#x2019; was standing, I at his side; but there was no conversation&#x2014;silence being apparently the golden rule in this literary-divine vision. While I cannot describe the character of the room in which we were, the one feature of it which attracted my attention was the old lion&#x2019;s writing-desk, on which lay a neatly-piled heap of finished manuscript, which was probably a portion of his &#x2018;Frederick the Great,&#x2019; although I did not seem to know. Now comes the wonder of the dream. While I stood beside the silent T. C., I looking on this heap of M.S., there glided into the chamber a figure as real as, though rather less palpable than, our own. We both knew, and felt assured that we both knew, that this shadowy form was the Deity. Without looking at us, or looking either to the one side or the other, the form moved right up to the desk, and extracted a handful of the M.S. from about the middle of the heap, and at once retired with it. Although this is the wonder of the dream, it did not, in the least, seem to excite either the wonder of T. C. or myself. We did not move from our standing position; and, after what appeared to be an almost imperceptible absence, the same figure quietly returned, and having replaced the M.S. in the exact place from which it had been extracted, retired from our presence as silently and shadowily as it entered. During the continuance of this vision not one word was uttered, and not one touch of wonder felt. I have never seen Thomas Carlyle in the body, and probably never will&#x2014;his great old face being familiar to me only from the recent photograph; but in the dream I was in his house apparently not for the first time, and as if he and I were on the most intimate terms of friendship. To neither of us did the entrance of the Deity seem at all unexpected; and we felt that the visit was as natural as any everyday occurrence. With the disappearance of the shape, which was of course that of a man, with face muffled&#x2014;the whole vision melted into thinnest air. I have always possessed a great capacity for dreaming; and while dreams come to me in multitudes, they are neither the children of wine nor indigestion, I being a person of temperate habits and enjoying good health. For the most part, however, my dreams come like shadows, so depart, leaving little more than the merest wrack behind; but this one, in which such august personages figured, will not easily or soon vanish from my memory. Whatever the dream may mean&#x2014;if anything&#x2014;I hope that it can only portend good to our distinguished countryman&#x2014;both to him and his; and that he may be spared to finish, not only the great work which was thus divinely fingered, but others of ripe wisdom and power.&#x201D; Possibly this was the same &#x201C;M.D.&#x201D; as the correspondent of <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>, <date when="1858-10-30">30 Oct. 1858</date>, who claimed knowledge of JWC&#x2019;s father; identified tentatively as John Burton; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581101-JWC-JC-01"><sic>34:235</sic><corr>JWC to JC, [<date when="1858-11">Nov. 1858</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> It is <pb id="pg-40-66" n="40:66"/>not long; and it excels in loyal Platitude all <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have ever witnessed before.

<p>No sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, my poor little Woman; nothing but bad news on the back of bad! To say truth, I expected nothing better for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day: yesterday when I went out the wind was so cutting and bitter, with clouds of dust whirling in all the ill-watered place, it made my own ride quite comfortless, wretched in the tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> I had. &#x201C;Morphia&#x201D; in any form is a right unwelcome article;&#x2014;may it be long before you try <hi rend="italic">it</hi> a second time! But I hope, ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> hope more than ever. For last night, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midnight, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> notice that the wind had quite fallen (probably <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> &#x26; west-wind not far off), and today is far more temperate and soft:&#x2014;indeed it is almost too warm up here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s attic study.

Totally unimaginable. But that will not bring the money back; I fear there is no hope of that.</p>

God grant that Maggy may send me some Note yet this night, of better tenor, to carry me over the Sunday!&#x2014; I shall be very thankful; but ought to prepare also for disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>.</p>
<p>I have had a baffling totally unsuccessful day; set of <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> coolly defying all that I can do upon them,&#x2014;dull, beclouded, downpressed and altogether <hi rend="italic">owlish</hi> as I am!

Now it is dim-grey, and the East is blowing ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">West</hi> is sure of victory however, and that soon.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear of Mary&#x2019;s recovering her 4 sov<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>: if I were in her place I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> invest them in a Post-Office Savings Bank, where they cannot be stolen.</p>

<p>On considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I see not why I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not <hi rend="italic">send</hi> you that short Note of the Dr&#x2019;s: it will shew you the back of his cards,&#x2014;if you ever suspected they were <pb id="pg-40-71" n="40:71"/>diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, on the side he shewed <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Blakiston&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1864-04-17">17 April</date>, see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640418-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-04-18">18 April</date></ref>.</note> Make my peace with him, if I am doing medically wrong,&#x2014;sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you ever speak to him on the subject, as I reckon it probable you won&#x2019;t; but leave you freedom. Certainly no people have helped us like these Two in our sore time. An obligat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I will never forget.</p>
<p>As to the &#x201C;small House,&#x201D; you know you are <hi rend="italic">Missus</hi> in that question; and that, if it seemed to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> otherwise, and a House <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, and containing a writing room <hi rend="italic">not</hi> with <hi rend="italic">western</hi> exposure (beware of the <hi rend="small-caps">west</hi> for <hi rend="italic">heat</hi>!)&#x2014;I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like it better than anything other. Look ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you therefore; and let me know how you prosper in House-seeking, if you do try it.</p>
<p>I am arranging with all my might to be ready <hi rend="italic">soon</hi> with a mass of work that will be <hi rend="italic">portable</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Proof</hi>-Slips wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> from Book 1 of Vol VI, these can be done with a map &#x26; <hi rend="italic">few</hi> Books); Robson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">shift of place</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Robson, in partnership with one or both of his sons John and Christopher, was now at St. Pancras Road.</note> &#x26; the delay occasioned, fits in too.</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> do not fret y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> little heart, one moment: I believe every word you make Maggie write represents a bit of <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you see and saw, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> <pb id="pg-40-76" n="40:76"/>I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> only guess at from the distance. The getting of the House,&#x2014;deducting merely the flurrying &#x26; fussing you get by it (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, I hope, Maggy will well screen you from, in many points) was the one thing I regretted; to myself &#x26; to all of us otherwise I regard it as a clear improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x26; gain. So be steady, poor Dear, and with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fussing y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor heart, get out of this First Scene into Scene Second &#x26; the new locality. By the way, I think if you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take any charge of her, this Maid Ellen w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prove an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> servant,&#x2014;she really seems to me a cleanly, orderly, correct, swift and handy creature, and might be made by <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014; Well and I believe she will too!

He made a triumphal entry into London, <date when="1864-04-11">11 April</date>, greeted by half a million people, mostly working-class, welcoming him as a champion of the dispossessed and a courageous foe of despotism.

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle</salute>
<p>I can only give you a very poor account of Cousin today I am sorry to say. She was very poorly all day yesterday &#x26; went to bed as soon as she came in from her drive. This morning she went out for an hour but she felt so ill when she came home that she said she could not sit up &#x26; has been in bed all the afternoon. I have just asked her if she has any message &#x26; she says &#x201C;tell him that I feel very ill, &#x26; that often I want him to come, but that I do not want if I can help it to disturb his work; but that some day perhaps I really <hi rend="italic">will</hi> ask him to come to see me.&#x201D; If one could but give her one moment&#x2019;s ease &#x26; make her feel more comfortable it would be a comfort to oneself as well as to her, but one feels utterly powerless to do even that, she seems so completely miserable from pain &#x26; discomfort. It is very miserable truly for her, &#x26; to us to see her so suffering it goes to one&#x2019;s heart. She may be stronger in actual strength, but indeed the amount of suffering to all <hi rend="italic">appearances</hi> is as great as ever it has been in all her illness. How she keeps any strength at all I cannot tell, for whatever they may say it is difficult to believe, when one sees her <hi rend="italic">constantly</hi>, that the suffering is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so great to herself as it appears to others. It would be a comfort to think it if I could. Like other things the morphia seems to have lost its effect. She did not have it last night; the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> thinks it ought not to be given without stopping it for some days.</p>
<p>I am truly sorry to have to send you such a miserable report today but it is no use saying she is better than she <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, in hopes of her feeling <hi rend="italic">really</hi> a little better tomorrow as I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> fain hope she may be.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Yours affect<hi rend="italic">y</hi> &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>Maggie Welsh</name></p>
<ps><p>I am glad to hear your brother is coming to you for a little, you will be glad to have him.</p></ps>
<ps><p>Cousin has just asked me to open my note to say will you please to send a <pb id="pg-40-78" n="40:78"/>cheque for 12 guineas for the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as she thinks the Cheque will be better than the money<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This second postscript was written on a separate slip of paper.</note></p></ps>

<p><salute>Oh my poor little Jeannie,</salute> what is this ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>! Maggie&#x2019;s Note has cut me to the heart; and indeed I am, with this not alone, but with this beyond all other things, extremely miserable. But there is no use mentioning that. I have studied to stick closer to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> all day, as the only resource there is (but a very poor and inadequate resource too);&#x2014;and in my last &#xBC; hour here, must continue to do so.&#x2014; Send for you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably TC meant &#x201C;me.&#x201D;</note> Dearest, any day you like I will come: indeed I begin to feel dimly that if y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> House suit, I shall be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> there; and in spite of the Printer, I perceive I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> bring work. &#x201C;Ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the middle of May perhaps?&#x201D; (i.e. in a fortnight or not much more), that begins to be a speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with me. Oh get better, Dear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have sent you Twenty Guineas; you asked for &#x201C;Twelve&#x201D;; but I think, if you meant that as payment of Bl<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, you must have quite <hi rend="italic">stinted</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own generous feelings (out of love to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>); certainly my own is that it ought to be Twenty. If you <hi rend="italic">don&#x2019;t</hi> mean it as <hi rend="italic">pay</hi>t <hi rend="italic">in</hi> <hi rend="italic">gen</hi>l, but merely as pay<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for something you have counted to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> really &#xa3;12 .. 12, send me back this, and I will burn it, and write you a 12 .. 12 instead.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted: &#x201C;<date when="1864-04-29">29 April 1864</date> &#x2F; Dr. P<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Blakiston &#x2F; St Leonards &#x2F; &#xa3;21. .0. .0 &#x2F; (This was <hi rend="italic">cancelled</hi> flung into the fire as wrong for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753); TC misdated the counterfoil.

<p>Yesterday morning while I sat breakfasting, &#x201C;Dr Carlyle, Sir!&#x201D; as large as life walked in. Poor fellow, he tries to be as gentle regular and accomodating as possible; is evidently very sorry for me and mine: &#x26; had I somebody to <hi rend="italic">keep house</hi>, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a comfort to me in idle hours;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later wrote: &#x201C;In the end of April, brother John came to me. Before this it had been decided (since the B[lakiston]s, who at first pretended that they would, now evidently would not, accept remuneration from us) that a small furnished house should be rented, and a shift made thither; which was done and over about the time John came. I was to remove thither with my work (so soon as liftable). He by himself made a preliminary visit thither; then perhaps another with me; and at his return I could notice (though he said nothing) that he meant to try staying with us there; which he did, and surely was of use to me there&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:194&#x02013;95).</note>&#x2014;but that is not much the case yet.

<p>Maggie&#x2019;s Report is still bad then: alas, what can I do! Blakiston may be exaggerative; indeed, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see he took far too little <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> miseries; and <pb id="pg-40-81" n="40:81"/>perhaps he might also medically underrate them&#x2014;and bluster them away: but I do not consider yet that his medical verdict was mistaken,&#x2014;the less as it agrees with that of everybody who has experience of such things.

<p>See what a long letter I have written!&#x2014; Tomorrow it will probably be the old story&#x2014; I shall get no sleep in the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> bed&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">rubbing in</hi> will no longer avail!

<p>Again a day of comparative comfort! The &#x201C;Linament&#x201D; and rubbing still having the desired effect.</p>
<p>God forgive me that I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be glad and thankful! That I can only expect shudderingly the return of the horrid thing!</p>
<p>I got thro&#x2019; the night in my strange bed&#x2014;better than I had hoped&#x2014;fell <pb id="pg-40-85" n="40:85"/>asleep about three&#x2014; It is a most tidy little house&#x2014;and so clean!&#x2014;and I think quiet&#x2014;</p>

Oh if I might be even as well as <hi rend="italic">this</hi> when you come! but that is too much to hope!</p>
<p>What quantities of things I have to tell you&#x2014;if I had my poor soul freed from the pressure of physical torment.</p>
<p>Oh my Dear my Dear, shall I ever make fun for you again?&#x2014; Or is our life together indeed past and gone?

Jack had, for some reason or other, set his heart on it; went off <hi rend="italic">before</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> surely have held him back till tomorrow. Left me at breakfast; had tried and again tried to entice me with him,&#x2014;but I shrunk from the empty jumble of to &#x26; fro, and have tried to be busy here instead. To get <hi rend="italic">q&#xf9;am prim&#xf9;m</hi> [as soon as possible] down to you for good; that surely is the really wise industry.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The sight of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> handwriting is like manna to me these mornings;&#x2014;in spite of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ill prophecies, there you still are, you see. And surely it is a great fact that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> unbearable misery does become <hi rend="italic">intermittent</hi>,&#x2014;to this <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> extent; for hitherto, I think, there has been no such interval. Courage, oh and <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>, my poor little Dear!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Jack w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell you what a deluge of Greenhow,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rose Greenhow, in Britain as a Confederate emissary. She noted in her diary, <date when="1864-05-02">2 May</date>: &#x201C;With Carlyle, made tea for him. He drank four cups. Talked delightedly, a la Carlyle. Deeply sympathetic with the situation. It warms my heart to hear his enthusiastic praise of my gallant countrymen.&#x201D; She first visited Cheyne Row <date when="1864-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, recording <date when="1864-02-24">24 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Miss [Jewsbury] called upon me. The same evening wrote me sending an invitation from Mr. Carlyle [for] the next day (Sunday). I could not go. &#x2026; The invitation was repeated for Monday. Found him entirely different from what I had expected. He is erect, tall 5 foot 8 or 10 inches, little sinewy figure, full brown beard and slightly grizeled hair. Has a strong Scotch accent in speaking which he uses less when he is animated. Talks a great deal. Is deeply interested in American affairs and a most noble advocate of the South. He asked me a great many questions amongst others, what sort of a looking animal was Lincoln. I endeavored to do justice to his appearance and where upon Mr. C arose from his seat and shook himself like a great dog, and [said] Soulouque the flat nosed negro of Haty and Abraham Lincoln the rail splitter of United States are a worthy pair to stand side by side in history. He asked about our President Mr. Davis and I described him. He placed his fingers over his eyes and said, &#x2018;I see him. God has made the situation for the man.&#x2019; He spoke in strong language of the crimes and imbecility of the North and when I arose to go at a late hour, 11&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock. He said, &#x2018;I will do anything for your country.&#x2019; I said, &#x2018;An article or few words from you, sir, will carry weight and would be deeply gratifying to our President and our people.&#x2019; Mrs. Carlyle is sick of a nervous disease, which makes him very unhappy as he is deeply attached to her.&#x201D; She noted, <date when="1864-04-23">23 April</date>: &#x201C;Spent an hour with Carlyle who is very kind to me. Strong sympathy with the South. My words not lost in a barren soil.&#x201D; She wrote, <date when="1864-06-18">18 June</date>, that she had received a letter from TC: &#x201C;Very kind and sympathetic. Says he wishes to write some thing up on the American war.

<p>You will be glad, I know, to see the poor old handwriting again; and will infer from it, that I am given back to the living world&#x2014; &#x2014; But you must not be too sanguine about my recovery&#x2014; I am still hanging between Life and death, only, for the last few days I have been freed from the torture that has distracted me these many months back&#x2014; It may return&#x2014;most likely will return and be all the more intolerable by contrast with this breath of ease&#x2014;</p>
<p>So I make haste, while I can still do my own will, to write you these few lines, just to say I have thought of you and loved you always thro these dismal months of silence&#x2014; Have often looked at the picture of Holme Hill<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x2019;s home in Thornhill.</note> on my bedroom wall, and mourned to think I should never be <hi rend="italic">there</hi> again&#x2014;never never&#x2014;</p>
<p>Maggie shall write you the particulars of our life here&#x2014; I have no strength for more</p>
<closer><salute>Love to the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x2F; and believe me &#x2F; living or dying ever &#x2F; your affectionate</salute></closer>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> Tho&#x2019; there was nothing to be said this morning, and no letter c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be expected, I felt as if I had been <hi rend="italic">disappointed</hi>, not to see y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hand ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!</p>
<p>John got home ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 p.m.&#x2014; I am sorry to say, I had been <hi rend="italic">late</hi> with tea, &#x26; had barely done (everybody here is <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> to be late, &#x26; I have to take the <hi rend="italic">resisting</hi> in my own hand; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I really do, but with ill success, poor Goody being away)! John told me all he could; but was not very lucid. He had been surprised and touched by y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> great distress and feeling of dispiritment (no wonder!)&#x2014;and kept saying, &#x201C;She will need to be very gently dealt with&#x201D; (yes indeed, Sir)! He said there were &#x201C;5 bedrooms&#x201D;; how many stories of the House, he c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hardly say, nor whether there was a likely one for <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>, or for smoking. However, you had been very good to him (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was really good of you, Dearie);&#x2014;and I have tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of coming down <hi rend="italic">with</hi> him next Friday or Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> to look with my own eyes. Won&#x2019;t that do? Tell me however.</p>
<p>I am getting on a little with work; but there is no right progress possible while the Printer stands chained. It is like that of &#x201C;keeping time&#x201D; (above spoken of): there is nobody but my own poor self to push forward in any depart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of the business; everybody &#x26; everything is willing to sleep if only I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Oh Darling, Oh my own poor little Jeannie, tell me tomorrow that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> remedy still holds out;&#x2014;and that you <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> to believe, and look up! Such <hi rend="italic">intermittency</hi> I surely augur well of; but I know well too what abysses of woe my poor suffering one has been long plagued in. Adieu; my blessings on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, if I had any!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>John&#x2019;s report of you for yesterday, after I left you in the rain, is satisfactory: but I long much to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sleep last night. This day ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is cold enough but there is no wet, only cold grey wind.&#x2014; I returned safe from my journey: safe, but sad and wearied;&#x2014;I lay down &#x26; slept an hour as the first thing.

<p>This morning since 8 I have been afoot; in the thick of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> since.

<p><salute>Darling,</salute> you &#x201C;are miserable enough,&#x201D; John reports to me; but nothing positively worse: I will be thankful,&#x2014;and hope to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you soon. Maggie as you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> learn arrived just on the stroke of 4;&#x2014;I was shocked to learn that you had been <hi rend="italic">disappointed</hi> of my Letter! I gave it to y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> Silvester,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably William, grandson of John Silvester, livery stable owner.</note> who <hi rend="italic">ran</hi>, fearing we were already <hi rend="italic">close</hi> on the time (&#xBC; to 5), and he had been a <hi rend="italic">minute</hi>, or half one, too late. I took better precaut<hi rend="italic">n</hi> yesterday, and will today.</p>
<p>We are all up to the throat in litter; working what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> we can to be ready for Saturday, I still count on it, and am doing my very utmost.</p>
<p>Yesterday <hi rend="italic">just</hi> when Maggie came, &#x26; I had hardly done with my dinner, Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and Miss Baring<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Louisa Baring, Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s elder sister.</note> got in. I had to go down, tho&#x2019; they only asked for Maggie. Very kind: Lady <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> coming in july or sooner;&#x2014;speaks of running down to you for a few hours to see for herself. This ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I am to call; and that I hope will end it.&#x2014; I am dreadfully ill off for <hi rend="italic">punctuality</hi> here: no Goody now to keep me to the Sun-dial; everybody <hi rend="italic">wanting</hi> to be unpunctual here if I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> let them. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Craik bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> is all right, it seems; beautifully set agoing with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> fuss: very good. Maggie, I perceive, was almost or altogether <hi rend="italic">desirous</hi> to go on if the Craiks had failed: she is now prompt and ardent to return and be with you <pb id="pg-40-98" n="40:98"/><hi rend="italic">till</hi> the Craik; I urged that it was quite needless &#x26; superfluous, but doubtless she has written and you yourself can decide. I, for my own share, feel greatly obliged to Maggie&#x2014;and, alas, I know well, it is not I that was in bitter misery beside her, or have to pardon her any shortcomings! Be as tolerant of her as you can.</p>
<p>Past 3 a fair way ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>! I am tumbled out in a hurry <hi rend="italic">to ride</hi>, &#x26; get myself <hi rend="italic">jumbled</hi> for the whole night after; no nap, no &#x26;c.&#x2014; Thank John for his Letter: take care of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor self,&#x2014;<closer><salute>God be with you</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<p>Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was at home last night; gave <hi rend="italic">tea</hi> (at 5&#xBD; p.m.) what I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have; and detained me far too long. She is coming down to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on Monday; that seems to be her resolution:&#x2014;I think I will bring Maggie at <hi rend="italic">any</hi> rate? For the rest, we will keep the Lady mostly altogether <hi rend="italic">off you</hi>, if you are afraid or averse.</p>
<p>But I must down stairs, &#x26; see whether <hi rend="italic">no</hi> dinner is coming on any terms. Thank John for his two Notes; let him have the <hi rend="italic">groom</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> waiting tomorrow!</p>

With this <pb id="pg-40-100" n="40:100"/><pb id="pg-40-101" n="40:101"/>Book whatever it be we will rest satisfied on the Joseph head: it &#x26; y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Hormayr<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kaiser Joseph II and Joseph Hormayr; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640509-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1864-05-09">9 May</date></ref>.</note> (if I had it here) and two others of old date, then shall suffice. Thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> care in this matter.</p>
<p>My Wife goes out twice daily, &#x26;c &#x26;c; and is said by the Doctors, and even believed by myself, to be improving and improved: but she is still utterly weak and very miserable; unable to seize any firm hold of <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, and easily struck down by the least agitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> or exertion. I, for my own poor share have at last got my writing closet refurnished;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;With a violent effort of packing and scheming (e.g., a box of books with cross-bars in it, and shelves which were to be put in, and make the box a press, &#x26;c. &#x26;c.), in all which Larkin and Maggie Welsh assisted diligently, I got down to Marina on one of the first days of May [Sat., <date when="1864-05-14">14 May</date>]. Dreary and tragic was our actual situation there, but we strove to be of hope, and were all fixedly intent to do our best. The house was new, clean, light enough, and well aired; otherwise paltry in the extreme&#x2014;small, misbuilt every inch of it; a despicable, cockney, scamped edifice; a rickety bandbox rather than a house. But that did not much concern us, tenants only for a month or two&#x2014;nay, withal there were traces that the usual inhabitants (two old ladies, probably very poor) had been cleanly, neat persons, sensible, as we, of the sins and miseries of their scamped, despicable dwelling-place, poor, good souls! &#x2F; In a small back closet, window opposite to door, and both always open, I had soon got a table wedged to fixity, had set on end my book-box, changing it to a book-press, and adjusted myself to work, quite tolerably all along, though feeling as if tied up in a rack. One good bedroom there was in the top story, looking out over the sea&#x2014;this was naturally hers; mine below and to rearward was the next best, and, by cunning adjustments curtains improvised out of rugs and ropes were made to exclude the light in some degree and admit freely the air currents. We made with our knives about a dozen little wedges as the first thing to keep the doors open or ajar at our will, their own being various in that respect! To put up with the house was a right easy matter, almost a solacement, in sight of the deep misery of its poor mistress, spite of all her striving. &#x2F; The first day she was dressed waiting my arrival, and came painfully resolute down to dinner with us, but could hardly sit it out; and never could attempt again. With intellect clear and even inventive, her whole being was evidently plunged in continual woe, pain as if unbearable, and no hope left; in spite of our encouragements no steady hope at all. On the earth I have never seen so touching a sight!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:198&#x02013;99).</note> and today (what is the one effectual comfort I can have) have got a bit of writing done: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Potatoe-War</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The War of the Bavarian Succession, <date when="1778">1778</date>&#x02013;<date when="1779">79</date>; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:189&#x02013;222.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been a bother to me for a week past.

<p>I flatter myself poor Jane is really improving; really tho&#x2019; in a slow and fluctuating manner.

She goes out twice daily in one of their vehicles here; has <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> a few yards of walking, more than once; but could not make much of that: she is utterly weak (as if <hi rend="italic">broken on the wheel</hi> for six months long!)&#x2014;and naturally has sunk into great depression; tho&#x2019; I hope that also is abating. I myself make desperate attempts, day after day doing my very utmost, to get some little work effected;&#x2014;&#x26; shall, I expect, succeed at last; tho&#x2019; the deluge of incoherencies that rushes daily in on me from all points of the compass (all <hi rend="italic">abutting</hi> on unhappy me, and my poor Enterprise) is hitherto very great.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1864-05-11">11 May</date>: &#x201C;Mr. Bass&#x2019;s Bill is very short. &#x2026; [I]t proposes to enact that any householder, personally or by his servant or by a police-constable, may require any street musician or singer to depart from the neighbourhood of the house; and a penalty of 40s. is imposed on every one who, after being so required to depart, sounds or plays upon any musical instrument or sings in any thoroughfare near any such house.&#x201D; Bass spoke in the Commons, <date when="1864-06-29">29 June</date>: &#x201C;Mr. Charles Dickens was in favour of the Bill, and he had letters from the Poet Laureate, Mr. Carlyle, all the leading artists, and between 300 and 400 of the first musicians of the day, who declared that the interruption caused by street bands rendered it quite impossible to carry on their profession. &#x2026; Mr. Tennyson wrote that he was driven from London by street bands, and the late Mr. Thackeray used to say that he had often been glad to take refuge in the fields&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 176:472).

<p>The air, the sea, the green land, and fine old-fashioned Country Hamlets, the rides by shore and silent lanes white with hawthorn: all is beautiful here;&#x2014;on one&#x2019;s first egress, such a sky as is <hi rend="italic">miraculous</hi> to London eyes, every morning.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I have done y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Samaritan errand:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A check for Elizabeth Downes; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640603-TC-EDOW-01">TC to <sic>ED</sic><corr>EDOW</corr>, <date when="1864-06-03">3 June</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I did not receive Mrs Downes&#x2019;s 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Letter (the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> was to make sure of her <hi rend="italic">Address</hi>) till this morning, otherwise I ought to have been quicker. It will be a very great benefit to the poor bereaved fellow-sufferer (widow of an honest and deserving man); and will be a solace to your own kind heart, and thus not want &#x201C;its reward.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John Gay, &#x201C;Epistle to Methuen,&#x201D; line 42.</note></p>
<p>I also forwarded the Two Letters according to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> order. They point to a painful Chapter of affairs; painful to me to read, how much more to you to be active part of! Distressing, and even disgusting,&#x2014;as I can well perceive. But there is one remedy, and I think only one, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I think you might adopt: To <hi rend="italic">be off</hi> with all these people, and their afflicting ideas; to retire into cold politeness, and <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> in regard to that and the like subjects. My Wife says, &#x201C;You do not really care for any of them except Louisa&#x201C;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring, one of Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sisters. The dispute between Lady Louisa Ashburton and members of the Baring family was escalating as a result of accusations made by Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s brother the Rev. Frederick Baring (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">68</date>), rector of Itchen Stoke, Hampshire, and repeated by his sister Lydia Emily Baring (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">68</date>), that Lady Louisa wrote a codicil to her husband&#x2019;s original will without his knowledge, allowing her to remove family busts, paintings, and other items from both Bath House and The Grange. In May, Lady Louisa&#x2019;s solicitor sent her the instructions for the codicil given him by Lord Ashburton and written in his own hand. In the original will, written <date when="1863-07-16">16 July1863</date> , Lord Ashburton left Bath House and its pictures and busts to her for two years, after which ownership was to revert to the holder of the title. On <date when="1863-12-09">9 Dec. 1863</date> he added a codicil to the will in which he left the leasehold of Bath House, its pictures, busts, and his chattels to his wife absolutely, as well as all the pictures at The Grange, without exception. Lord Ashburton had also wished that Melchet Court, bought from Frederick Baring for her (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18611111-JWC-LLA-01"><sic>38:8</sic><corr>JWC to LLA, [<date when="1861-11-11">11 Nov. 1861</date>]</corr></ref>), be furnished from the Grange. Upset by the accusations that she was acting unethically, Lady Louisa decided to follow the wishes of her husband in his original will and to return Bath House and its pictures and busts after two years. For details of the dispute, see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 106&#x02013;10. The <hi rend="italic">Leeds Mercury</hi> reported, <date when="1864-06-13">13 June</date>, &#x201C;The will of William Bingham Lord Ashburton, dated <date when="1863-07-16">July 16, 1863</date>, with a codicil, dated <date when="1863-12-09">Dec. 9, 1863</date>, was proved at Doctors&#x2019; Commons on the <hi rend="italic">1st</hi> instant, and the personalty was sworn under &#xa3;180,000. He bequeathed to his widow, Lady Ashburton, &#xa3;10,000, and his furniture and personal effects, except his collection of pictures and statues at Bath House, which is left to the title upon certain conditions. His London residence is left to Lady Ashburton, with the enjoyment for two years of the pictures, which are afterwards to go with the title. His Devonshire and Cornwall estates are settled upon his only child, a daughter, and her issue. His American personalty is settled in like manner. Melchet Park, in Hampshire, and his residuary real and personal estate are given to Lady Ashburton. The principal landed estates were settled by the first Lord Ashburton on the title, and go to Francis, now Lord Ashburton, and his male issue. Certain furniture and effects in some of the residences on the settled estates are bequeathed to the title.&#x201D;</note> never mind <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of them, <pb id="pg-40-114" n="40:114"/>therefore, except <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. I really advise this course, as the peaceable and safe one. Lawyers &#x26;c are there for the purpose of doing all the rest.</p>
<p>We are fluctuating forward here; have our ups and downs from day to day; but I really hope, are making progress. Jane was very low three days ago (no sleep at all, night before); but, for the last 2 days has seemed conspicuously better,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; we are not permitted to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it, so despond<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is she always, poor little soul. At the end of july, if able at all, she will be right willing to come to you,&#x2014;and I with her, with a heap of Books &#x26;c hanging to me!&#x2014; The Addiscombe Hamper is a daily blessing here; such butter, such cream, unprocurable by money:&#x2014;I ought to be ashamed of myself; but am actually going to ask the Lady Bountiful for <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> in addit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>! Bread here is bad; unwholesome too, I sometimes doubt; the Sick Dame and I eat of <hi rend="italic">home-baked</hi> (when we can get it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> here is not possible) &#x201C;less than 1lb daily&#x201C;:&#x2014;that is Two Halfquartern loaves in the week (with a a<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC repeats &#x201C;a&#x201D; with a line above it, at turn of page.</note> margin over):&#x2014;these are the exact facts: I cover my face, and disappear in haste!</p>

<p><salute>Thanks,</salute> Darling for your kind and pleasant letter. I wish I could answer as you deserve but I am not yet up to letter-writing&#x2014;indeed it were hard to say what I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> up to!

<p>My handwriting will show that I have no great increase of strength&#x2014;­indeed the <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> which both my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Mr Carlyle celebrate is a very little thing&#x2014; I am certainly better than when I was carried away from Chelsea but I still suffer terribly, and have no particular hope that I shall ever recover! I wish to live&#x2014;wish to have a future granted me for showing my gratitude to all those who have been so kind to me during my long illness&#x2014; But it is difficult at my age, worn down with eight months of torture, to see the bright side of things&#x2014;and indeed life is not to be desired on the <hi rend="italic">present terms</hi>.</p>
<p>Now I must stop.&#x2014;</p>
<p>God bless you! Dear and all of yours&#x2014;</p>
<p>write to me again&#x2014;tho I cannot write letters I am glad to read them</p>

<p>Your Letter from The Grange, last Sunday, was naturally very interesting to us! My poor Wife is still too weak for writing, almost ever: but both she and I, and she bids me say so, are delighted to hear of your getting an eligible young Wife,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alice Gertrude Waugh.

Froude&#x2019;s second wife, wrote to Woolner, <date when="1864-06-07">7 June</date>: &#x201C;The children returned from their walk yesterday reporting that they had seen &#x2018;Mr. Woolner walking with a tall young lady&#x2014;oh! <hi rend="italic">so</hi> pretty &#x26; we think he must &#x2018;be beloved to her&#x2019; (their expression for such matters)&#x2014;for we passed him quite close &#x26; he never saw us!&#x2019; &#x2F; Your note explains this sad neglect of your former friends &#x26; I am delighted to think that the surmises of the youthful minds were so correct&#x201D; (Woolner 249).

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>I am not up to writing letters yet. I cannot steady my hand nor my head&#x2014;nor my heart&#x2014; But the nice girl who has succeeded to Maggie Welsh is too shy for writing letters for me to strangers; so I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> scrawl a few lines to ask news of you, which it seems I am not to have without asking.</p>
<p>What are you doing? How are you? and where and how is your Husband? and why has he never appeared here according to promise?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote, <date when="1864-05-06">6 May</date>: &#x201C;I have been made very happy, my dear <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> Mrs Carlyle, by somewhat better news of you lately. I shall be thinking of you continually while I am away, and hoping at my return to see you. &#x2026; I have work that will detain me about three weeks&#x2014;and after that I have work that will take me, for a couple of days at least &#x2026; to Hastings! So, mind and be sure to go on improving.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">My</hi> Husband gets along well enough&#x2014;considering&#x2014;</p>
<p>For myself&#x2014; I have made little way since Maggie told you about me. I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> weak and suffer horribly&#x2014;but with breaks in my suffering&#x2014; Sometimes <pb id="pg-40-117" n="40:117"/>I think myself slowly recovering; at other times I despair utterly.

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
<p>I have nothing that can be called good news to send you. In sanguine moments I persuade myself that my poor Wife is actually recovering; but at all times I have to own that the process is slow, very slow; and there are continual fluctuations (as at this moment, and for days past), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> drive one into gloomy enough misgivings, and too evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> indicate immense suffering on the part of my poor Patient.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle reported to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1864-06-21">21 June</date>: &#x201C;Your aunt has ups &#x26; downs &#x26; does not get on so steadily as we could hope for. From Friday last till yesterday she was much depressed &#x26; had much of her old pain. Last night she has slept well &#x26; looks much better this morning. Her disease is one that comes &#x26; goes unaccountably. It might entirely cease at any time. On the whole I think she does make progress. Your uncle &#x26; I are as well as usual&#x2014;both working hard each at his own task&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>&#x2014; As my one consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I try diligently to extort something of Work Done from this sad Hurlyburly; but, as you may fancy, it is unclear baddish condit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, and does not go so well as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wish. Thank God, &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Torgau</hi>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Battle of Torgau, <date when="1760-11-03">3 Nov. 1760</date>, where an outnumbered Prussian army led by Frederick defeated the Austrians; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:296&#x02013;330.</note> is this day corrected for the last, or as good as the last time;&#x2014;it is the finis of Friedrich&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Battles</hi>; &#x26; I can trust in Heaven never to have another of those Phenomena to describe, in this world or in any other! If I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> six months, and the decks approximately clear, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> finish this Book after all; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, to my poor self if to no other, will be little short of a miracle, were it once here. <hi rend="italic">Esperons</hi> [Let us hope].</p>
<p>The air, the sea, the sky are all beautifully pure, fresh and wholesome here; my rides, so soon as I get into the green silent country-lanes, among the queer old Hamlets, low-lying Farms and Cottages, all in the innocent old <hi rend="italic">South-Saxon</hi> type (as they were when <hi rend="italic">Wilhelmus Conquest</hi>r first saw them), are of a charming quality,&#x2014;something almost of a <hi rend="italic">devotional</hi> character, to be left alone with the Earth and the Universe, instead of being driven delirious with Cockneydom &#x26; its squealings &#x26; sooty canailleries. My little Horse likes the steep descents (almost precipitous in places) very ill, &#x26; I think w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> prefer London on the whole,&#x2014;where he gets <hi rend="italic">beans</hi>. I had a view of Rye this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; Rye, Winchelsea, Dungeness, Romney Marsh, Dover Cliffs all visible where I was.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;I rode far and wide, saw strange old villages (a pair of storks in one), saw Battle by many routes (and even began to understand the Harold-William duel there. Strange that no English soldier, scholar, or mortal ever yet tried to do it). Battle, town and monastery, in the calm or in the windy summer gloaming, was a favourite sight of mine; only the roads were in part distressing (new cuts, new cockney scamped edifices, and railways and much dust). Crowhirst and its yew, that has seen (probably) the days of Julius Caesar as well as William the Conqueror&#x2019;s, and ours. But that is not my topic. In the green old lanes with their quaint old cottages, good old cottagers, valiant, frugal, patient, I could have wept. In the disastrous, dust-covered cockneyfying parts my own feeling had something of rage in it, rage and disgust. It was usually after nightfall when I got home. Tea was waiting for me; and silently my Jeannie (as I at length observed) to preside over it (ah, me! ah, me!), directly after which she went up to bed. Hastings, St. Leonards, Battle, Rye, Winchelsea, Beachy Head, intrinsically all a beautiful region (when not cockneyfied, and turned to cheap and nasty chaos and the mortar tubs), and yet in the world is no place I should so much shudder to see again&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:199&#x02013;200).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>We apply to you in every extremity, well knowing that y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Highland Heart will ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, if Fate permit!</p>
<p>The poor Wife has fallen into almost utter sleeplessness ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (as have others of us that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be named, in consequence of her): I persuade myself it is not a <hi rend="italic">relapse</hi> into the old misery, but a kind of <hi rend="italic">stage</hi>, tho&#x2019; a perverse one, in the slow fluctuating process of &#x201C;recovery&#x201C;:&#x2014;enough, she has got quite wretched in noisy Marina,&#x2014;is in horror even at the Sea; and we must all, evidently, march ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; if we will know whitherward. I myself have no resource (or had till <hi rend="italic">she</hi> spoke, poor soul, who has always such a practical clearness left),&#x2014;no resource except back to Chelsea, where <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know of sleep, but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> remembers only horrors of the 5 last months:&#x2014;but in a word she suggests, &#x201C;W<hi rend="italic">d</hi> na perhaps the Lady let us go to Addiscombe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburton estate nr. Croydon, Surrey.</note> and try it?&#x201D; I eagerly assent, if the place be empty &#x26; the thing otherwise possible. And that is the purport of my hurried Note (to save post) this morning.</p>
<p>There w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be three of us; Miss Craik (an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> wholesome quiet little woman) besides Jane &#x26; me. We sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take our Maid, both or one, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> for ourselves with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> troubling yours: y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Farmer w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take care of my little Horse (as in days long past!)&#x2014;my Books are in <hi rend="italic">boxes</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> become <hi rend="italic">presses</hi> with shelves, when set up); I know well what room I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> settle in for writing, if you <pb id="pg-40-123" n="40:123"/>permitted. It is within a ride of London<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Addiscombe was about 10 mi. (16 km.)

<p>Answer, pray, in one word by return. And <hi rend="italic">forgive</hi>, do forgive even if you have to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> No.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>You are the kindest of friends: a thousand thanks, and regrets for troubling you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Addiscombe had been let; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640628-TC-TWO-01">TC to <sic>TW</sic><corr>TWO</corr>, <date when="1864-06-28">28 June</date></ref>.</note> The poor Wife, at first, seemed to grasp at the possibility of The Grange; but on reflexion, saw that, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> absence, or even in your presence just now, it fairly w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not do. She is too weak and miserable to produce herself as company anywhere (regularly <hi rend="italic">refuses</hi> to see visitors, of whom there have been three from London, who got no farther, except the first of them, than my little workshop down here);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;We had various visitors&#x2014;Forster, Twisleton, Woolner&#x2014;and none of these could she see; not even Miss Bromley, who came twice for a day or more, but in vain&#x2014;except the last time, just one hurried glimpse. Nothing could so indicate to what a depth of despair the ever-gnawing pain and boundless misery had sunk this once brightest and openest of human souls. The B[lakiston]s continued with unwearied kindness doing, and hoping, and endeavouring; but that also, even on the Doctor&#x2019;s part, much more on her own, began to seem futile, unsuccessful; good old Barnes came once (fast falling into imbecility and finis, poor man), said: &#x2018;Hah! instrinsically just the same; however, the disease will burn itself out!&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:200).</note> and to organize ourselves, as a house within a house, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> big Establishment, was felt to be, in present circumstances, too difficult a problem. We tried for furnished houses in Bexhill (a beautiful inland village<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bexhill was 3 mi. (5 km.) W of St. Leonards.</note> where somebody said they were), but found none, nor the likelihood of any in such places.</p>
<p>Back to Chelsea, the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of it was horrible to her.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;About the middle of June (lease was to end with that month, and her own house, especially her own room there, had grown horrible to her thoughts) she moved that we should engage the house till end of July; which was done. But, alas! before June ended things had grown still more intolerable; sleep more and more impossible, and she wished to be off from the July bargain&#x2014;would the people have consented? (which they would not)&#x2014;so that the question what to do became darker and darker&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:200).</note> My Brother, observing <pb id="pg-40-124" n="40:124"/>how much good a long drive into the country did, proposed that, leaving me for Chelsea, the rest of them sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> move off in a wandering way, by short stages, for Dumfriesshire, where many friends, and kindly conveniences and possibilities are; thence to return in Autumn, if strength enough had returned. This project she liked; but found it questionable in her pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> weakness,&#x2014;­impossible till after some preliminary <hi rend="italic">experiments</hi> in railwaying to <hi rend="italic">short</hi> distances. In the interim a little of broken sleep had come back:&#x2014;it was resolved, on the whole, to continue here (she in the <hi rend="italic">land</hi>ward side of the house, sea inaudible if she like to be silent from it), and to go upon the above program:&#x2014;first journey, or long drive, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been <hi rend="italic">today</hi>; but rain came, and it had to be given up.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;She drove out at lowest three or four times a day&#x2014;ultimately long drives (which John took charge of to Battle, to Bexhill regions seeking new lodgings&#x2014;alas, in vain!). Her last, daily drive from four to half-past five was always with me, my day&#x2019;s work now done. She was evidently thankful, but spoke hardly at all; or, if she did for my sake, on some indifferent matter, naming to me some street oddity, locality, or the like; those poor efforts now in my memory are the saddest of all, beautiful to me, and sad and pathetic to me beyond all the rest. On setting her down at home I directly stepped across to the livery stable, and mounted for a rapid obligato ride of three hours: rides unlike any I have ever had in the world; more gloomy and mournful even than the London ones, though by no means so abominable even, one&#x2019;s company here being mainly God&#x2019;s sky and earth, not cockneydom with its slums, enchanted aperies and infernalities&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:199).</note> That is how we stand; once more in a fixed condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> better or worse. I do not think there is in the world a wholesomer place than this,&#x2014;provided there were to be had a <hi rend="italic">house</hi> one could <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in. But such bedrooms; such houses altogether,&#x2014;rickety rotten abominat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, that ought to be flung into the Sea the instant they are built,&#x2014;I find the above condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> cannot be complied with.&#x2014;&#x2014; You will write to us from Bath, if not sooner; I wish you had said how the bonny little Bairn is, and also how her Mother? Courage; there are better days coming, surely!</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Woolner</hi>,</salute>
<p>You were right as to Addiscombe; next morning we heard it was let. Various projects were canvassed, other kind possibilities there still were, but all had their difficulties: the end was, We are to stay here till July is out; by which <pb id="pg-40-125" n="40:125"/>time, it is hoped, a slow journey toward Scotland may be undertaken&#x2014;my Brother superintending; I returning then to Cheyne Row, and waiting,&#x2014;with Work and Silence as company. This is what suits me best; and her too, I really think.</p>
<p>There has been a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> more of sleep (not at all a <hi rend="italic">much</hi>) since you were here; and aspects are slightly brightening again.

<salute>My dear long ago friend</salute>
<p>I have been wishing and meaning to write to you every day for the last week but I have been in such torture that it was impossible. Today I have a slight respite, and I hasten to thank you from the bottom of my sorrowful heart, for the blessing you have granted me in dear Mary,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For a photograph of Mary Craik, probably taken around this time, see <sic>opp.</sic><corr>above.</corr></note> and to implore you to leave her to me yet a while; till we see whether I am to die or live.</p>
<p><figure><graphic url="volume-40-129-07.gif"/><p>Mary Craik, n.d.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Courtesy of Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Columbia University</hi></p></figure></p>
<p>It may be a great inconvenience to you doing without her&#x2014;must be&#x2014;so helpful and good as she is!&#x2014;but you are a good and merciful man, and a true friend, and you will put up with her absence when I assure you that the loss of her dear kind attentions would make my life at present even more terrible than it is&#x2014;</p>
<p>I cannot write as I would&#x2014;my hand shakes like a drunkards&#x2014;only best love to you and Georgy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His youngest da., Georgiana.</note></p>

Twelve successive nights of burning summer, totally without sleep; morning after the eleventh of them she announced a fixed resolution of her own, and the next morning executed it. Set off by express train, with John for escort, to London; would try Mrs. Forster&#x2019;s instead of her own horrible room; but would go (we could all see) or else die. Miss Bromley, who had again come, she consented to see in passing into the train; one moment only, a squeeze of the hand, and adieu. With a stately, almost proud step, my poor martyred darling took her place, John opposite her, and shot away&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:201). John A.

I am to call &#x26; see Jane at ten o&#x2019;clock or eleven in the forenoon. I hope to get some sleep as I am in my old room.

Carlyle wrote, <date when="1864-07-14">14 July</date>: &#x201C;We were fortunate enough to get a compartment to ourselves all the way to Carlisle last night, &#x26; Jane stood the journey quite well, suffering much less than she has often done of late from one night of sleeplessness. Mary had a comfortable carriage to meet us with at Cummertrees. The rooms here look very nice &#x26; tidy. &#x2026; Jane looks better today than I have seen her since April&#x2014;partly perhaps owing to her having accomplished the long journey so successfully. Let us hope that she may now make more rapid progress, &#x26; let us also be thankful that she has got through last night&#x2019;s fatigue so satisfactorily. &#x2026; Mrs Forster had provided Jane with sandwiches sherry &#x26; champagne for the journey when I went to Palace Gate House last night; &#x26; all were very useful in making her journey comfortable.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mary is all that mortal could wish as hostess, nurse and Sister&#x2014; She has had something of the sort herself and her sympathy is <hi rend="small-caps">intelligent</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am <hi rend="italic">gone in</hi> for milk diet took porridge and buttermilk, <hi rend="italic">in quantity</hi> last night!!!! and slept with few awakings all night&#x2014;had a tumbler of new milk at eight and <hi rend="italic">got up</hi> to breakfast at nine!!!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later: &#x201C;The Gill, sister Mary&#x2019;s poor but ever kind and generous <hi rend="italic">human</hi> habitation, is a small farmhouse, seven miles beyond Annan, twenty-seven beyond Carlisle, eight or ten miles short of Dumfries, and, therefore, twenty-two or twenty-four short of Thornhill, through both of which the S.W. Railway passes. Scotsbrig lies some ten miles northward of the Gill (road at right angles to the Carlisle and Dumfries Railway): passes by Hoddam Hill, even as of old&#x2014;and at Ecclefechan, two miles from Scotsbrig, crosses the Carlisle, Moffat, or Caledonian Railway&#x2014;enough for the topography of these tragic things.&#x2014;T.

She will likely soon go to Mrs Russell at Thornhill, who has invited her several times. &#x2026; It is likely that [TC] will soon return to Cheyne Row, though he has the house taken till the end of this month, for the weather was getting very hot at St Leonards, &#x26; he wanted more books which are not to be had from home. &#x2F; I have to go back to the Gill by the forenoon train again tomorrow &#x26; stay till four in the afternoon&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>&#x2014; I am very sorry for you with those idiot Servants&#x2014; Mary<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Servant now (privately) in a bad way, as turned out!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:203).

<p><salute>My dear,</salute> good, kind, patient Mary! I should have been more unhappy at leaving you, if I had not renounced all idea of Scotland, and looked forward to your joining me in London.

<p>The first night I had an excellent sleep&#x2014;last night I have also <hi rend="italic">slept</hi>, not so well of course being not so <hi rend="italic">worn</hi> out, but much better than at Marina&#x2014; I eat such a supper of porridge and butter milk as is better than all the morphia in the world!&#x2014;and I drink new milk three times a day&#x2014; My horrible ailment has been much abated&#x2014;but I dare not trust to its continuing so, I am so <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi> still! Enough of that</p>
<p>How I do pity you in all that packing and worrying and how thankful to Heaven I am that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has such kind help&#x2014;while I am fit for nothing</p>
<p><pb id="pg-40-137" n="40:137"/>I found Mary<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary the servant.</note> most provoking&#x2014;and augur ill for the help <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will give&#x2014; I left with her all the keys sealed up&#x2014;recollect there will be no clean sheets but those you bring with you&#x2014;and recollect to seek in my drawers for the blue moire dress I spoke of&#x2014;and wear it for my sake&#x2014;</p>
<p>For heaven&#x2019;s sake dont be robbed of my leather box! it contains <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of valuable and precious that I have in the world!</p>

<p>The carriage was all crumpled into dry rot! Jamie&#x2019;s arm was sore hurt but he got up, and ran after the horse with the wheels driving it mad! It was upset some three miles off and its hind legs sorely cut&#x2014;it was Jamie of Scotsbrig&#x2019;s horse&#x2014; Mary and I sat in the ruins of the carriage more than an hour&#x2014;when a flock of children arrived from Cummertrees with news for us that James Austin was bringing the Minister&#x2019;s Gig.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably belonging to George Gillespie (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">1870</date>), Church of Scotland minister of Cummertrees <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">70</date>; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560807-TC-JWC-01"><sic>31:154</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1856-08-07">7 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> And we returned home in <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x2014; A nice sleeping draught&#x2014;nevertheless in spite of all I slept some, in virtue of having slept <hi rend="small-caps">none</hi> the night before&#x2014;but yesterday I was terribly nervous&#x2014;and today I am not better&#x2014;had little sleep and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> very <hi rend="italic">painful</hi>&#x2014;my feet are swelled worse than ever and I cannot walk out&#x2014; I wanted to write you a nice letter but I can&#x2019;t&#x2014; I am terribly out of spirits&#x2014;the worst of being here is that I am so much alone alone and nothing but dismal thoughts</p>

<p>Oh what a fool I was to dream that by putting myself on a railway I could get whirled away from my misery! or that there was any place quiet enough for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to sleep in but the grave! I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not write a line yesterday&#x2014;and perhaps no news was better than the bad news I might have sent.

<p>Last night I got a little sleep towards morning all the animals are shut up on the premises but the railway screechs and roars all thro the night,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The railway between Annan and Dumfries passed within 200 yds.

<p>I mean to go to Holme Hill tomorrow but what better will it be there than here? Oh I am a miserable wretch&#x2014;my burden is greater than I can bear!</p>

<p>I find if I do not write today no letter will reach you till Tuesday&#x2014; So just two lines to say I have arrived safe and got your note.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">They</hi> met me at the station and are kind kind&#x2014;as indeed many are&#x2014; John <pb id="pg-40-147" n="40:147"/>offered to accompany me here but I declined<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1864-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;Jane was looking much better yesterday when I saw her at the station here, &#x26; said she had had more sleep the night before. &#x2026; I was all ready to go with her to Thornhill, &#x26; had offered to do so the previous day, but she thought it better for me not to go, as Mrs R might make a fuss in preparing some formal dinner if I went.&#x201D;</note>
&#x2014; I have not had so much pleasure in him as to prolong our intercourse a moment beyond what I could help&#x2014;</p>

John commented, <date when="1864-07-28">28 July</date>: &#x201C;She will have ups &#x26; downs at Holmhill as elsewhere; but at no other place will she have so good a chance of getting back to her usual old state of health; for the quiet there is perfect, the kindness of Mrs R unquestionable, and D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell&#x2019;s patient &#x26; firm &#x26; quiet skill will help her greatly to keep herself in order &#x26; free from such unwholesome rudeness as she has been liable to fall into with her own relations.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am not so ill today but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was of course&#x2014;movement&#x2014;change&#x2014;change&#x2014;! and I have but one wish&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">stay still</hi>&#x2014; I slept last night the <hi rend="small-caps">first</hi> part of the night&#x2014;and awoke at <hi rend="italic">four</hi>&#x2014;better than the other way of it lying awake till morning</p>

<p>This morning I had slept too long; and Oh what relief it was to find, on coming down stairs, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor Little Letter on the table; and tear it open for news, as I hurried along! Thank God it is a little better: I have had such a two days since the last sad Note, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last night but one, at The Gill. &#x201C;Sleep <hi rend="italic">till</hi> four&#x201D; is a very poor allowance; but it is better, as you always feel, than <hi rend="italic">after</hi> four:&#x2014;and the pain is a little gone. We must hope; we must not complain. Oh that I may hear good news tomorrow; there are now two nights,&#x2014;surely the very change <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have done something!</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t be discouraged, Darling; the <hi rend="italic">brae</hi> is steep, but you have set a stout little heart to many <hi rend="italic">braes</hi> in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> time. Yes, we have had a sore <hi rend="italic">spiel</hi> together, many a time; and never did my little woman fail me.&#x2014; You did evidently well to omit John; unless when absolutely needed, he is not good. It was <hi rend="italic">cruelly</hi> absurd of him to say that thing to you; cruel and absurd both:&#x2014;oh dear! Perhaps if he had stood to his &#x201C;Work&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">as</hi> well as you have done to <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, he might have been far ahead of where he now is! But never mind him. He really does desire to help, I believe, and tries, and flatters himself with succeeding: but his sympathy is dull and coarse;&#x2014;and he has great vanity. Poor ill-less even <hi rend="italic">well</hi>-meaning soul,&#x2014;keep <hi rend="italic">not</hi> too close to him!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This is miserable paper; and I am writing <hi rend="italic">after</hi> dinner (sleep given up; I had en<hi rend="italic">ough</hi> of it last night):&#x2014;let me hasten with the essential. Yesterday I called on Lady Stanley and Lady W<hi rend="italic">m</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady William Russell.</note>&#x2014;feverish and ill, the latter; seems to have intermittent daily fever in the afternoons; is still unable to walk at all, seldom or never gets out; has been &#x201C;two years in that room.&#x201D; The Stanley Rosalind Husband Elect,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rosalind Stanley m.

Home slowly thro&#x2019; the Park, in grey dusk, to tea &#x26; a night of such <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> as was quite rare; sorrowful, but solemn and good for me.

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> writing letters to you is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> disheartening work. I have so little to tell that will do anything but make you sorrowful. But if I dont write at all, you would be thinking me even worse than I am. Know this at least for your comfort, that nowhere on Earth would I be better off <hi rend="italic">externally</hi> than I am here. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell is a nurse like my own mother&#x2014; I have had no such nursing&#x2014; Mary Austin is kind kind but knows not what to do and has not <hi rend="italic">means</hi>. Then the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. James Russell, Mary&#x2019;s husband.</note> seems to me to have more sense, if not more skill, than any of these fine D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>&#x2014; He says, like you, that my illness is only to be acted on thro&#x2019; the stomach but does not make light of my <hi rend="italic">nervousness</hi>&#x2014;does not say slightingly that &#x201C;nervous pain does <hi rend="italic">not kill</hi>.&#x201D; that people can <hi rend="italic">live</hi> without sleep</p>
<p>My first night here was passed wide awake&#x2014;not one wink of sleep again&#x2014;and of course a day of <hi rend="italic">pain</hi>&#x2014;last night he made me bathe my feet in hot water, and I slept&#x2014;very brokenly but still I slept&#x2014;oh thank god! I go on with the warm milk in the morning, which I think has a good effect on my bowels&#x2014; I have taken physic only <hi rend="italic">once</hi> since I left St Leonards but <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi> after breakfast is indispensable&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mary Craik will go today and you will be <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>&#x2014;with these maids! And if I were there I could but add to your troubles&#x2014;we are sorely tried&#x2014; And god alone knows what the end will be&#x2014; It is no wonder if my stock of hope and courage is quite worn out&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear kind Mary</salute>
<p>When I said I would send you word &#x201C;next day,&#x201D; we both forgot that &#x201C;next day&#x201D; was sunday, when no post leaves Thornhill&#x2014; All the better&#x2014;for again I never closed my eyes all night&#x2014;and got up most miserable&#x2014; Last night I had sleep, thank God&#x2014;restless and broken&#x2014;but oh so much better than none!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Thank you and Jamie for all your kindness&#x2014; I was very sensible of it though I had to fly away from it so soon&#x2014;and could look nothing but what I was&#x2014;utterly wretched with constant suffering</p>

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> It was well they kept their Pharisaic Sabbath, and prevented y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> telling me, what w<hi rend="italic">d not</hi> have lightened the gloom of mind. Oh dear, oh dear;&#x2014;and but little <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> yet, in spite of all the chances, and all the kindnesses! Nevertheless hold on to y<hi rend="italic">r milk</hi>, to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> dietings, to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bathings,&#x2014;under Dr Rs.&#x2019;s direct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and the kind lady&#x2019;s nursing. What strange old days (sunk like old ages) you look out upon from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> windows there, my poor little heavy-laden Woman! Yes: but it is for ever <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, &#x201C;The Eternal rules above us,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Goethe, &#x201C;Novelle&#x201D; (<date when="1832">1832</date>); see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:495.</note> and in us and round us; and this is not Hell or Hades, but the &#x201C;Place of Hope,&#x201C;&#x2014;the Place when what is <hi rend="italic">right</hi> will be <hi rend="italic">fulfilled</hi>! And you know that too, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> way, my own little Jeannie;&#x2014;and you will not, and must not forget it: forgetting it, one might grow mad.</p>
<p>I think with you of Dr Russell, that his advice is probably worth <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than that of all the Doctors you have yet had. A sound-headed honest-hearted man passing his life in silent company with <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>; earnestly studying Disease at a thousand <hi rend="italic">bedsides</hi>, with an eye only to knowing <hi rend="italic">it</hi> and helping it,&#x2014;what a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> man from one, or from a thousand <hi rend="italic">ones</hi>, who are always &#x201C;on the stage,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-40-151" n="40:151"/>and have no time to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of anything, except of claptrap &#x26; how they shall get a reputat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in a totally stupid world! I beg him very much to survey and investigate your case; and throw what light on it for us he can. <hi rend="italic">Darkness</hi> he will not throw on it;&#x2014;I suppose there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> but little &#x201C;light,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 1:3.</note> except what our own common-sense might bid us to? &#x201C;Time and the hours,&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> wear out the roughest day,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 1.3.</note> are what I have looked to mainly, from the first.</p>
<p>This morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at 8 Miss Craik stole out, softly as a dream,&#x2014;I heard her, having been awake and smoking, but said nothing. She has been perfect, poor little soul; nevertheless I am glad to be in perfect solitude rather. I intend to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> with double energy; no other resource for me, to keep the demons chained in their caves. I have this Note from Craik<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x2019;s father, George Lillie Craik; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640801-TC-GLC-01">TC to GLC, <date when="1864-08-01">1 Aug.</date></ref></note> since she went,&#x2014;can hardly read it. I had given her the Bank <hi rend="italic">viaticum</hi> [travel expenses] last night; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she protested was too &#x26;c &#x26;c: but all in a modest natural way.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Today I have no news at all; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> obviously cannot mean <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news: alas, no!

I must do my best ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> these demons of Uncertainty; and say to them, &#x201C;I will not believe <hi rend="italic">you</hi>!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Miss Craik went away yesterday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>: since wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there is silence, is solitude, like the grave. I like it better so; than with people jostling me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>: I must, as the one resource, grapple, beak &#x26; claws, to my Work; and push <hi rend="italic">it</hi> on, <pb id="pg-40-152" n="40:152"/>on: that I have found to be curative ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.&#x2014; The little <hi rend="italic">Irma</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irma Otthenin.</note> running ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the world is one small item of my interruptions (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, as you know, are manifold): Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I had asked Miss Jewsb<hi rend="italic">y</hi>; and Miss Craik had set the House in order;&#x2014;but it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not do you see (by the Inclosed).

<p>I suppose you have not yet been up to Thornhill; and know not that you can do much good by going.

<p>Not to be ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> disappointed, as I have already <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> been, I take you the first thing, and will write to you the necessary word <hi rend="italic">before</hi> going farther.</p>
<p>I am very much obliged by your punctuality in writing, in doing whatever is helpful to me in this time of extremity. I consider y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> consultations and Dr Russell&#x2019;s to be based on sound insight into the facts of the Case; and do generally hope (tho&#x2019; at times there are the gloomiest misgivings) that my poor little much-afflicted Partner may be restored to me before very long,&#x2014;able to <hi rend="italic">help</hi>, as heretofore continually, in this final part of the rather thorny pilgrimage I have thro&#x2019; Existence.

<salute>Dear Craik,</salute>
<p>Ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3 hours before your Note was handed in to me, your excellent Mary had glided away,&#x2014;vanished from me softly as a Dream. You can tell her from me that I hold, and shall hold, the remembrance of her fine quiet ways and her, as of one of the wholesomest phenomena I have seen for long years, in this tumultuary dog-kennel of what they call a world. You may depend on it, her behav<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in all points (to my poor Wife first of all) was exemplary; of kindness unsurpassable, modesty, good sense, quiet helpfulness her <pb id="pg-40-160" n="40:160"/>characteristics throughout. Make much of the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Mary, I advise;&#x2014;and think y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self rich indeed in having such a Daughter ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Old Age.</p>
<p>The news from Scotland are none of the best; but do perhaps seem slowly mending. The address now is, &#x201C;Dr Russell &#x26;c &#x26;c, Thornhill <hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi>shire&#x201D; (for there is one in Stirlingshire too),&#x2014;if Mary sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think of writing.</p>
<p>Tell her I sit in the back Area here, under shade &#x26; air, with clean cool flags under my feet; and, if it be not the yellow <hi rend="italic">Organ</hi>-demons, suffer little interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Better off than perhaps <hi rend="italic">she</hi> thinks with my two fools of maids. I employ all moments at my unutterable rubbish-continent of a Task,&#x2014;really not far from half-thro&#x2019; the last volume (7-years War just ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to <hi rend="italic">close</hi> to all Eternity); and, I do think, were chance given me, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> finish altogether before Winter quite return. In wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> case, we may hope to meet ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Craik; all good be with you and yours. And we will <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> always, in this &#x201C;Place of Hope&#x201D;!&#x2014;</p>

I have nothing to say ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the two poor sluts (never you bother y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> little heart ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> them at all). The one thing wrong <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is, I can get no work done this day: <hi rend="italic">none</hi>, tho&#x2019; I have stood, or <hi rend="italic">sat</hi>, to it, since an early hour. Yesterday I probably was too obstinate; <hi rend="italic">w</hi>d not quit till I had finished,&#x2014;put off dinner; finished (in a sort); had half-an-hour of sleep <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner;&#x2014;and on the whole, walked out, for my exercise, at 7 p.m. Wild windy sky; streets (thank God) nearly empty; rain threatening (none came till after midnight, &#x26; then very little): my walk was gloomy, <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> as death, but not <hi rend="italic">provoking</hi>, not so miserable as many. Gloom, sorrow, as of death; but instead of rage, suppressed-rage (as too often, pious grief, heavy but <hi rend="italic">blessed</hi> rather). I read till midnight (not <hi rend="italic">study</hi>, merely &#x201C;Macmillan&#x201D;),&#x2014;then out ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, solitary as a ghost; and to bed ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1. I see nobody, wish to see nobody; have <pb id="pg-40-161" n="40:161"/>had four or five paltry little Notes to write this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> too, or mainly, has been the ruin of my work);&#x2014;&#x26; now, dinner <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>, write this <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, the only one I had the least wish to write. So it goes on.&#x2014; &#x2014; Miss Bromley I shall probably not see; unless you order me <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Thursday. Her &#x201C;choosing of paper&#x201D; is a thing any of us can do: Geraldine, who was here the other night (but <hi rend="italic">went</hi> loyally, when my tea was done), will be too happy.

<p><salute>Alas, poor Darling,</salute> what an outlook today.

She desired me to say that she did not intend to write to you by this day&#x2019;s post. &#x2F; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell had wished to give her some medicine at bed-time last night, &#x26; I spent most of the time I saw her in trying to convince her that her best plan would be to take whatever he ventures to give her, and without asking him about either name or dose. He knows all the particulars of the case now, at least as far as she herself or I can tell him; &#x26; he is most cautious &#x26; prudent in giving medicines of any decided power. She knows all this herself even better than I do, &#x26; I hope she will see her way in the matter more clearly than she seems to have done yesternight.&#x201D;</note>
 but of course, what can <hi rend="italic">he</hi> know of what he only looks at from the safe distance? <pb id="pg-40-162" n="40:162"/>Alas, alas.

<p>Plattnauer was here this morning; but I did not let him in; sent him y<hi rend="italic">r Address</hi> out, &#x26; word that you were very poorly indeed. I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> got one nasty bit of bother (in my Book) put by;&#x2014;but there are so many.

&#x2014;still worse&#x2014; The quinine did much good in some respects but I had an idea it helped the excitation.&#x2014;that prevented me going to sleep&#x2014;and much to John&#x2019;s disgust, who said that &#x201C;I, being <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the thing, could not <hi rend="small-caps">see my way</hi>&#x2014;whereas D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R was a man of great <hi rend="small-caps">candour</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201C;&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell himself thought it best to discontinue the <pb id="pg-40-163" n="40:163"/>quinine&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> being my idea&#x2014;and last night I had what, for me, may be called a good night with no aids but utter exhaustion and Gods mercy. I had to take to bed yesterday afternoon, the <hi rend="italic">irritation</hi> was so terrible&#x2014;so it was <hi rend="italic">time</hi> to get some sleep!&#x2014; Today I feel better of course. but <hi rend="italic">the night will come</hi>, and experience has taught me to expect sleep only from <hi rend="italic">utter</hi> exhaustion&#x2014; It is well I am out of your way&#x2014;well for you and myself too.</p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I write today less unwilling, for, thank God, I can report a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> night with <hi rend="italic">some</hi> sleep in it. not much; nor sound; but to have <hi rend="italic">slept at all</hi> two nights running is a blessed novelty in my life. There had been grave consultation between D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell and me, whether I should try that <hi rend="italic">Indian Hemp</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Cannabis sativa</hi>, used for easing pain and inducing sleep; unlike opium, it does not cause constipation or loss of appetite.</note>&#x2014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain had given it me in the winter without result; but D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell judged from its having been given twice or thrice during the <hi rend="italic">day</hi>, that the trial had not been fairly made&#x2014;it should be taken he says in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> dose at bedtime. Still he would not press it on me, tho&#x2019; evidently alarmed at this sleeplessness;&#x2014;­because, tho&#x2019; he had seen excellent effects from it in several cases, he had not seen and could not positively predict its effects on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. I must decide for myself. and I decided to appeal to Nature once more&#x2014;the day of comparative ease, which had yesterday followed my night of comparative sleep, having strengthened my mind to make a decision&#x2014;and I was rewarded by Nature with a not intolerable night<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1864-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, reporting Dr. Russell&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1864-08-03">3 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;He says of Jane &#x2018;Having slept pretty well she looked much refreshed yesterday morning, &#x26; enjoyed her drive very much. Mrs Russell thought yesterday one of her best days, if not <hi rend="italic">the</hi> best, since she came to Holmhill. She would have taken the Hemp&#x2019; (Indian hemp w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R. &#x26; I had recommended) &#x2018;in the evening if I had pressed her, but was very anxious to trust nature for another night.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell is in raptures&#x2014;I &#x201C;shall soon be all right now&#x201C;&#x2014;am &#x201C;getting like myself again&#x201D;!&#x2014; Ah! she has not seen enough of me yet, to know how soon these gleams of wellness fade away, and I am plunged again into torture and despair</p>
<p>These maids<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cheyne Row servants Mary and Helen.</note> are perfectly disgusting&#x2014;when I compare them with the servants <hi rend="italic">here</hi> who wear no crinolines, and have heads that they <hi rend="italic">make use of</hi>, I am impatient that I have no power to set all that to rights</p>
<p>One night it was windy and the open window of my dressing closet rattled&#x2014;having no wedges I made it firm with four or five different bundles of paper&#x2014;next day the papers had been removed, when the window was thrown up&#x2014;but at night great was my admiration to find my paper-wedges all stuck back exactly as I had put them&#x2014;and without a word said to, or by, the little <pb id="pg-40-166" n="40:166"/>housemaid!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary at Holmhill.</note> this has been done every night since!&#x2014;the same attentive thoughtfulness marks her whole service&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a long lovely drive every day and when <hi rend="italic">the pain</hi> is not too great I enjoy the sight of these old beautiful places&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now I have written as much as I am up to&#x2014;resting my hand firmly on the paper to keep it sort of steady&#x2014;which makes my writing more legible, I flatter myself&#x2014;. God help you and me</p>

<p><salute>No line from you today Dear,</salute><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1864-08-03">3 Aug.</date> was sent via Edinburgh and took an extra day; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640803-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-03">3 Aug.</date></ref></note> and you had had a pill and a bad night&#x2014; I fear you are not better&#x2014; The time had been when such a fear would have started me off, right home!&#x2014; but <hi rend="italic">now</hi>! what help or comfort could <hi rend="italic">I</hi> bring to any mortal?</p>
<p>Last night was bad&#x2014;but not the worst sort. I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> sleep&#x2014;a little&#x2014; Fell asleep about four o&#x2019;clock, in the midst of rather <hi rend="italic">wild</hi> wakefulness, as if stunned by a sudden blow; and slept off and on&#x2014;from two to three hours, I should think, putting all the bits together&#x2014; All this while I have refrained from trying that <hi rend="italic">Hemp</hi>&#x2014;considering that an hour of natural sleep is more desirable than a whole night of it by artificial means. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell seems to be of the same mind. This wakefulness is now my Disease&#x2014;but for that, I should be getting better&#x2014; After a tolerable sleep&#x2014;of which indeed there have been few for the last two months <hi rend="italic">the pain</hi> is comparitively slight&#x2014;and the darkness around me is lightened&#x2014;but a waking night crushes me down into the depths again&#x2014;as today.</p>
<p>There is one positive improvement since I came to Holme Hill; I eat about twice as much as I was doing at Marina&#x2014;where I had to order my own food, and often to order in vain!</p>
<p>Will you tell Mary to be sure and not have M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cook&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The laundry woman.</note> washing-baskets carried up stairs but to take the clothes out of the basket, <hi rend="italic">below</hi>&#x2014;and before putting them (the clothes) by to examine them carefully&#x2014;in case of <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi>. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster told me she would be obliged to give up M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cook because she had sent home as many as <hi rend="italic">four bugs</hi> with the clothes at different times It would be, you may tell Mary, a rather disgraceful as well as vexatious result of a Mistress&#x2019;s illness to let bugs get into the house&#x2014; In <hi rend="italic">my</hi> time I never let the baskets go up</p>
<p><pb id="pg-40-168" n="40:168"/>Helen&#x2019;s quarter wages have been due since the end of June, I think, if not paid since I left&#x2014;ask her the day&#x2014; She has higher wages than she works for&#x2014; I paid Mary&#x2019;s last quarter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the servants&#x2019; wages, see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640405-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1864-04-05">5 April</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640416-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-04-16">16 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I hope to hear tomorrow that you are better</p>

<p><salute>It was that accursed b&#x2014;, my Darling;</salute> I cannot get her<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen, the maid.</note> to take away the letters in time: yesterday, I had to get into a fury (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> cost me my nap of sleep),&#x2014;today I will take surer methods. Never was I concerned with a creature so incurably careless,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she has good qualities too. I have paid her no wages (since you last ordered me); some day, it is very possible, I may suddenly pay her; and bid her walk. This of forgetting y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter (or neglecting to go till she was decorated to the due pitch) is, considering my posture in writing it and hers in carrying it, the intolerablest thing she has yet done. Never mind the <hi rend="italic">canaille</hi> [wretch].</p>
<p>Bullock met me with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter this morning (an hour earlier),&#x2014;you may judge how welcome! Really, Dearest, things are looking up; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things, if only <hi rend="italic">this</hi> thing will continue. John copies me a bit of Dr Russell&#x2019;s Letter to him; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is very rational, and quite of favourable tenor. Don&#x2019;t I hope!&#x2014; That is an immense point too, that of the better eating. Has y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> wine <hi rend="italic">come</hi>. I don&#x2019;t pay till I hear. I think (and privately <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>) you &#x26; Dr R. will sneer at that &#x201C;Oxygen&#x201D; of Craik&#x2019;s: I confess I have no faith, nor ever had, except in the course you are now following. Oh Heavens, to get on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> feet ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, even in a weak way!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, out of <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi>, feeling poor &#x26; desolate, I went to Ruskin; found him and his old mother,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Ruskin.</note>&#x2014;had mainly an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, bad tea, bad talk, <pb id="pg-40-170" n="40:170"/>desultory, insincere;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC lost some of his earlier regard for John Ruskin after the latter took up spiritualism; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640623-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1864-06-23">23 June</date></ref>.</note> came uncomfortably home at a quick pace,&#x2014;shortly before eleven.

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
<p>Your reading of the omen was, alas, far too favourable. It was not continued improvement (of which there has been some), but the reverse that hurried us away from St. Leonards. About the middle of June, <hi rend="italic">want of sleep</hi>, which I now discover to be the sole malady (one of long continuance, but brought suddenly to a crisis last year), suddenly returned; would not yield to any treatment, but in a fluctuating way grew always worse,&#x2014;till in the beginning of July, my poor Patient, desperate by two successive nights, suddenly made off for London (under escort of my Brother, a Doctor of some skill, who never would <hi rend="italic">practice</hi>, but who has come to us <hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi> [for better or worse]); she went to Mrs. Forster&#x2019;s; horror-struck at the notion of her own room, and of the miseries suffered there: slept very little, found she would next night <pb id="pg-40-172" n="40:172"/>do still worse; and instead of trying,&#x2014;shot off by express train, travelled all night with her escort above said; and next morning, was 30 miles beyond Carlisle (330 from here), in the cottage of a sister of mine (innocent Farmhouse by the shore of the Solway); slept there two nights in succession: so that my first accounts were triumphant,&#x2014;had they not so soon altered their tone! For the last two weeks or more, she has been deeper into Dumfriesshire,&#x2014;in the House of an Ex-Doctor, an honest skilful man, whose wife is a special intimate. The accounts have mostly been bad; but, for two days past, seem (to myself) to indicate something of real improvement. I am always very sanguine, in the matter;&#x2014;but get the saddest rebukes, as you see. God only knows what is to become of it all. But I keep as <hi rend="italic">busy</hi> as the Fates will allow; and in that, find the summary of any consolation there remains to me. My progress, partly owing to the Printer just now, is as it has always been, frightfully slow; but if I live a few months, I always think I shall get the accursed millstone honourably sawed from my neck, and once more revisit the daylight and the dry land; and see better what steps are to be taken. I have no company here but my Horse, indeed I have mainly consorted with my Horse for 8 years back;&#x2014;and he, the staff of my life otherwise, is better company than any I could get at present in these latitudes; an honest creature that is always candid with me, and actually useful in a small way, which so few are!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Wish me well;&#x2014;and return, the sooner the better. How well I remember the last night you and Mrs Froude were here:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Froudes visited the Carlyles <date when="1863-11-23">23 Nov. 1863</date>; see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18631206-TC-JAC-01"><sic>39:254&#x02013;55</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1863-12-06">6 Dec. 1863</date></corr></ref>.</note> it was the last night I had of my poor little Life-Companion still afoot by my side, cheerily footing the rough ways along with me, not overwhelmed in wild deluges of misery as now. <hi rend="italic">At spes infracta</hi> [but hope is unbroken]; this is the Place of Hope!</p>

<p>Again the enforced silence at the end of the week has been an advantage.</p>
<p>If I had written to you on Saturday what a letter it would have been! For my wakefulness had reached a height! Friday night had been the counterpart of the preceding night:&#x2014;about half an hour of <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> unconsciousness, after seven in the morning.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-40-173" n="40:173"/>Still I was not the least <hi rend="italic">tired</hi>; only wild, and <hi rend="italic">the irritation</hi> dreadful, so I took to bed in the afternoon. Something I said about my bowels, which I had assured D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R all this time were in a charming state, put him on ascertaining with his own eyes and the result was a discovery that I was excessively <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi>, and needed four grains of blue pill!! (He wouldnt have me take one of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Balkiston&#x2019;s mild compound articles)&#x2014;and he was justified by my <hi rend="italic">falling asleep</hi> soon after, and sleeping thro&#x2019; the whole night!! I woke some twenty or thirty times&#x2014;but just to think; &#x201C;Oh God! what a mercy this is!&#x201D; and go to sleep again. Much bile was got rid of yesterday, and I was sanguine enough to expect another such night&#x2014; But not so&#x2014;last night I lay awake, very restless till half after two&#x2014;then I took a glass of wine, and calmed down into what I call <hi rend="italic">waking sleep</hi>, which continued till seven. How it will go on I cannot predict I only feel sure if I had tried narcotics on the top of all that bile, it must have produced a brain fever&#x2014;and also; that until this terrible wakefulness of the last two months is quenched, there can be no <hi rend="small-caps">real</hi> basis for hopes of recovery&#x2014; Oh my Dear! I am very weary! My agony has lasted long!</p>
<p>&#x2014;I am tempted to take a &#x201C;long cry <hi rend="italic">over myself</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and no good will come of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>! I will go and get ready for my drive.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Russell reported to John A. Carlyle, [<date when="1864-08-08">8 Aug.</date>]: &#x201C;Mrs. Carlyle had one of her bad days on Saturday. She did not suffer positive pain, but great uneasiness &#x26; unhappiness, having slept but little the preceding night. Towards evening she complained of Acidity in the stomach, and had no appetite for her supper. I persuaded her to take a Blue Pill (5 grains). After that she slept, I think well. Indeed she said it was the only night she had slept <hi rend="italic">soundly</hi> since she came here. Last night she had a little Rhubarb and Magnesia and slept tolerably. To day she has had a long drive which she speaks of as having enjoyed it much. On the whole I am inclined to think her some better. &#x2F; I will be glad to see you up any of these days that you have an opportunity of comparing her present with her previous state&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1775B.292).</note></p>

<p>I stopped Bullock on the Street, and got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter: Oh what a deliverance to the loaded heart of me! One ought not to be so desperate; but I was too early awake again&#x2014;and flesh is weak. Oh I am so sad, my Dear; sad, sad, but have often been far more <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi>, far. The sorrow has <hi rend="italic">forgiveness</hi> in it; reconciliat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to all men and things, especially to all men; not secret <hi rend="italic">rage</hi> and vain struggle as too often. Oh do but get better for me, my own <hi rend="italic">Schatz</hi> [Darling]; we shall have good days yet, please God.&#x2014; I am pushing on famously with my Book; really <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> in comparison&#x2014;(for the last few days!)&#x2014;I shall certainly, unless accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> befal, have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with it in <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>, before Winter quite come! <hi rend="italic">Esperons esp&#xE9;rons</hi> [Let us hope]!&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>It was not the Goose<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen the maid.</note> that wronged y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter of <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>; it is the Post people (and indeed it was they the former time,&#x2014;shooting round &#x201C;by Edinburgh,&#x201D; the fools!)&#x2014; Goose always goes now, <hi rend="italic">during</hi> my dinner, Mary to bring up the &#x201C;second course&#x201D; forsooth); so that there is no danger.</p>
<p>Today I have come up to my old garret ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">gain</hi> of ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 15 or 20 <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> in regard to getting work thro&#x2019;; and a great comfort to me,&#x2014;if it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> but last, and <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> to be cool enough. How I love my old solid Table,&#x2014;y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father&#x2019;s contriving (I often think, with a variety of <hi rend="italic">pious</hi>, or not impious feelings, tho&#x2019; pride I fear is a part of them): &#x201C;An <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> manful article produced <pb id="pg-40-179" n="40:179"/>by <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Father (who has given to such, as my own was),&#x2014;and, by the Eternal, may not one still do some honest work at it, in spite of the Earth! And if it be forgotten, as better has been, let the blockhead world forget it too,&#x2014;by Allah! And the brave shall be all blessed; <hi rend="italic">are</hi> all blessed!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be time enough for not you only but for the Line to Milnes, the Line to &#x26;c: and already it is past 4, and dinner is waiting, &#x26; time not. Adieu Darling; oh send me good news tomorrow!&#x2014; T.C.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi> not to be forgotten. Give Mary Huddlestone a sov<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from me. I remember her well poor worthy soul; her and her two bits of orphan children: what a blessing one of them has come up to take care of its mother. I decided on this Sov<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as I read y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter (from Margaretta to Cook&#x2019;s Ground<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaretta Ter. was two blocks from Cook&#x2019;s Grounds<corr>,</corr> which led into Cheyne Row.</note>).

<salute>Dear Lord Houghton,</salute>
<p>I fear you overrate any real improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there is in my poor Wife&#x2019;s situation: she is still almost continually in very great suffering;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I think the prospect does now clear up a little to myself (and also to her, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is still more import<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) by the better insight one now has of what the real ailment is. Want of Sleep, want of Sleep,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been going on, gradually on the increase, for long years back; and has now reached some crisis or consummation:&#x2014;that is the root of all the mischief, the one thing wrong; and for that, it is now evident enough (even to herself that Medicine in any form or degree can do nothing; tho&#x2019; carefully studied regimen, with the aid of time and nature perhaps still may. The accounts from Scotland are changeful and fitful, oftenest extremely miserable to me; but they do rather improve than otherwise. God be ­merciful!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to myself, night and day every moment of my time (for her sake as my own) is religiously devoted to getting that frightful millstone of a Book sawed off the neck of me, in some not dishonest way;&#x2014;and in the Universe there is nothing but working at it that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be any consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me in pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

<p><salute>Again your two letters are come together, Dearest.</salute> Both having the Post-mark London <hi rend="italic">10</hi>&#x2014;so if the first was posted on the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, it must have been too late.&#x2014; The delay of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> letter was caused by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russells mistake in supposing it all the same whether we put in the letters in Thornhill Postoffice or the one at Closeburn, which we were passing in our drive.</p>
<p>John Carlyle appeared last evening to tea&#x2014;he plays the part of <hi rend="italic">consulting Physician</hi> here which I find a farce&#x2014; When I needed his help&#x2014;if he had had any, at the Gill, he only aggravated me with brutal impertinence. As I was more even than usually <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> with my <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> last evening, he kept assuring me I &#x201C;looked well&#x2014;fuller in the face&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle reported, <date when="1864-08-11">11 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Jane looked better &#x26; rather more cheerful. She says that she slept unusually well on the Sunday night after taking a blue [pill] by Dr Russell&#x2019;s recommendation, then on Monday night hardly at all, &#x26; on Tuesday night moderately well. Dr Russell who speaks cautiously says he thinks she is better at least for the time. At Holmhill the quiet continues perfect, &#x26; she has long drives daily. &#x2026; She has gained, I think, nine pounds in weight since she has left Dr Blakiston&#x2019;s in April. In all respects she has the best possible chance of getting back to her usual health under the judicious management of Dr Russell &#x26; his household. &#x2026; Dr R. told me yesterday that Jane, so far as he could learn, does not seem to have had any positive pain of late.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last night was bad, but not the worst sort&#x2014; I tossed about&#x2014;till two&#x2014;then took my wine and after that, <hi rend="italic">waking sleep</hi> till six. It is the strangest thing this sleep in all my sick experience! I believe I sleep it with my eyes open; for when I wake wide up, there is no difference in <hi rend="italic">what I am seeing</hi>&#x2014;the chinks in the shutters &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;</p>
<p>We drove to Durisdeer yesterday and I looked at the monument<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the marble monument to James Douglas (<date when="1672">1672</date>&#x02013;<date when="1711">1711</date>; <ref target="volume-40/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7897"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 2d duke of Queensberry, and his wife, Mary, b.

N of Thornhill; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 127. The piece consists of life-size figures of the duke and duchess under a great baldachino supported by four Corinthian columns, all in white marble. Or possibly the small monument in the churchyard (erected <date when="1836">1836</date>), marking the spot where Daniel McMichael, Covenanter martyr, was shot <date when="1685">1685</date>; it had the inscription: &#x201C;Sacred To the Memory of Daniel M&#x2019;Michael Who Suffered Martyrdom here By Sir John Dalziell.

<p><salute>Just one line Today Dear.</salute> The letter you inclosed was from my Aunt Grace,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh, one of JWC&#x2019;s three paternal aunts, living in Edinburgh.</note> and <hi rend="italic">needs</hi> an answer; and being up to little writing, I must take off you what I give to her. last night was much like the two preceding ones. awake and wildish till after two o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;then the wine&#x2014;then a sort of sleep&#x2014; Last night or rather this morning&#x2014;for it was after seven&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">dreamt</hi> about the Blakistons, and&#x2014;my Mother was in it! All thro&#x2019; this weary illness I have hardly dreamt at all and <hi rend="italic">never</hi> about my Mother before. I could not help regarding her return to me this morning as a good sign&#x2014;yet I was doing something to vex her&#x2014;going away with D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blakiston when she expected me <hi rend="italic">home</hi>.</p>
<p>I shall be glad to take <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sovereign to Margaret Hiddleston. The day I called (my only <hi rend="italic">call</hi> for near twelve months) I gave her five shillings. You need not send any check just now&#x2014; You know I was to get money from John. He paid my travelling expenses&#x2014;which reckoned up by him at the Gill, <hi rend="italic">to the minutest farthing</hi>, amounted to five pounds five shillings. I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> think that in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> place I would not have charged for &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">half the breakfast</hi>&#x201D; at Carlisle considering how long he had been breakfasting with us, without paying for it&#x2014;nor suddenly bethought myself of a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sixpence</hi> for peppermint drops got for you at Dumfries&#x201C;&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was the sum&#x2014;he gave me the change of ten <pb id="pg-40-182" n="40:182"/>pounds&#x2014;four pounds fifteen&#x2014;so it is ten pounds you owe him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For John A.

<p>Yes, my Dearest, you are evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> mending; &#x26; ought to think so, if you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>! That increase of weight is itself an undeniable symptom. And as to the weakness,&#x2014;is it not even this: that the coming <hi rend="italic">back</hi> of sleep, long wanting, makes us <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> weaker than ever. How often have we spoken of that bit of experience! On the morrow of y<hi rend="italic">r sleepless</hi> night, you are twice as strong &#x26; clever as usual; on the morrow of y<hi rend="italic">r successful</hi>, only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the comon allowance. That, <hi rend="italic">I believe</hi>, is really it. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R. does well to make you <hi rend="italic">try</hi> (not over-much); but never fear, continue to gather weight &#x26; to sleep better, and you are very sure to get back the use of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> feet!&#x2014; Oh my Darling, and may I really think that the vengeful Furies are abating, going gradually to <hi rend="italic">their</hi> home;&#x2014;or that my poor little Eurydice<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Greek mythology Eurydice was brought back from the dead by Orpheus, then lost forever, as he turned to look at her before they were out of the underworld.</note> will come back ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and make me rich!

<p>Yesterday in the Physic way, as I intimated, was quite successful: I had to <hi rend="italic">miss</hi> my ride after haggling ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it,&#x2014;c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have any sleep either, when I tried.

 showed him to be deficient not only in medical skill, but in common sense!&#x2014; It did not need an M.D to ones name, to have perceived in that extraordinary <hi rend="italic">Wellness</hi>, after such fatigues and agitations, neither more nor less than a terrible <hi rend="italic">flare-up</hi> of bilious excitement! accordingly, in a day or two, the sleeplessness returned more inveterate than ever, and after one week at the Gill, I rushed from there just as I had rushed from &#x2018;Marina&#x2019; with a pack of Furies at my heels. This Place had been all along my destination. The Dearest Friend I have in Scotland lives here&#x2014; There is <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, and beauty, and new milk, and kindness&#x2014; Oh <hi rend="italic">such</hi> kindness!&#x2014; And there is Medical skill too; for the Master is a Doctor greatly esteemed&#x2014;tho&#x2019; retired from practice a few years ago&#x2014; No where in the wide world could I be so well situated under the present circumstances of my body and mind.</p>
<p>I have gained <hi rend="italic">three pounds</hi> in weight, since I have been here&#x2014;and am for the last week getting a few hours of sleep every night&#x2014;my Friend says I &#x201C;dont look nearly so <hi rend="italic">haggard</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wild</hi>&#x201D; as I did when I came&#x2014; Perhaps I shall actually be restored to Life after all! Perhaps my Life will cease to be a burden for me! Oh I am afraid to <hi rend="small-caps">hope</hi>! My Hope and my Courage have been ground down in me by a whole year of suffering! But all the D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> say &#x201C;there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> reason why I should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> get well&#x201C;&#x2014;as I have no trace of organic disease&#x2014; Ach! one may suffer terribly without organic disease it would seem!</p>
<p>My rooms are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> papered! I was too ill to answer Miss Davenport <pb id="pg-40-190" n="40:190"/>Bromley&#x2019;s letter about patterns before she had to leave town. Besides; tho&#x2019; I considered her too highbred a woman to do anything in such bad taste, as to do <hi rend="italic">my</hi> commission <hi rend="italic">at her own expense</hi>, still your suggestion had made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>If you are still in London and would send me some snips of nearly <hi rend="italic">white</hi> papers<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote later on MS in blue pencil: &#x201C;they were <hi rend="italic">sent</hi>,&#x2014;&#x26; used, to perfect<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.&#x201D;</note>

It is some days however since he was here; and I daresay I <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> know better how I am, myself, than anybody else does!&#x2014;however sagacious!&#x2014; So I will write a few lines tonight, there is never any time in the morning for any writing but the daily letter to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, as we go for a drive at 12, and are absent two or three hours, which brings one close on post time. I really think I have been better for the last week. I have had no <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> sleepless night, and the few hours of sleep I have had every night has been less <hi rend="italic">unearthly</hi>! I have returned to dreaming&#x2014;a habit discontinued since this illness&#x2014;. I continue the new milk in the morning and the porridge at night, and the same plentiful supply of pudding and cream that I took at the Gill, and so well does this diet agree with me that when I was last weighed, I was found to have gained a pound and half in ten days!! <hi rend="italic">The Irritation</hi> has been less distressing, and that is the most important item of improvement; for I could bear all the rest patiently if I were but delivered from <hi rend="italic">that</hi>!</p>
<p>Oh my God! if I am after all to be restored to <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>!&#x2014;and not only that but Life without torment; shall I ever be able to show gratitude enough for such unlooked for mercy! I dare not let myself go to this novel feeling of <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>&#x2014;for fear of preparing worse disappointment for myself!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-40-191" n="40:191"/>I was very glad indeed to learn from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle that your Husband continued to feel no bad effects from his fall.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the carriage accident, see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640719-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-07-19">19 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I have such a horror of <hi rend="italic">falls</hi> now! with good reason! I wish the weeks did not pass with such terrible speed, I shall have been here a month on Saturday!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC arrived at Holmhill Sat. <date when="1864-07-23">23 July</date>; Sat. <date when="1864-08-20">20 Aug.</date> was four weeks later.</note> and every week brings me nearer Chelsea and winter!&#x2014;both of which I <hi rend="italic">dread</hi> more than I can tell. But I am putting the thought of my departure as much out of my head as possible, and the unspeakable kindness of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell helps me in doing so.</p>
<p>All good be with you dear kind Mary&#x2014;love to Jamie</p>

<p>The fact is; <hi rend="italic">one</hi> letter per day is as much as I am up to, and yesterday I wrote to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster, whom I had not thanked for her hospitality when I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">passed thro</hi>&#x2019;,&#x201D; or for the letter she had written to me since.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC did not thank Eliza Forster explicitly for either the hospitality or the letter; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640817-JWC-EF-01">JWC to EF, <date when="1864-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>Last night, the fullness of time had arrived for a blue pill; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R thought&#x2014;as yet, it has not succeeded like the former one. I slept rather more in quantity, but much worse sleep in quality. dreaming horrid dreams which I started awake out of every five minutes. I had a great deal to do with Lord Ashburton, whose face, I remarked, was become as pure and transparent as waxwork. <hi rend="italic">Mine</hi>, he said, &#x201C;would be as transparent when my illness was over.&#x201D;</p>
<p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russells small harvest is almost over. My drives have not been stopt for <hi rend="italic">it</hi>; an open carriage and horse and driver being procured every day from the Inn. I am out in it, with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell, from two to three hours, starting at half-past twelve.

<p>Nothing from you today at all;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, alas, I fear will mean nothing of good! I am in a poor <hi rend="italic">cheepy</hi> humour (physically); prone to apprehension; but resist as well as I can. The <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> of the &#x201C;Two Notes at once&#x201D; will have settled itself, any way.</p>
<p>There is not the least vestige of tidings to send. Absolutely nothing has happened; not even <hi rend="italic">a Proofsheet</hi> come in,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I sent <hi rend="italic">out</hi> (my one joy yesternight) a bundle of them. And ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 minutes ago, came upon a most import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> (forgotten) clipping; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in the hurry of Tuesday Night, Mary had handed me as <hi rend="italic">blank</hi>, for writing and adding the Weeks items upon! I happened to <hi rend="italic">turn</hi> the clip where I had put it (being very punctual, you observe) and saw&#x2014;The Printer has now got it (marked in red-pencil &#x201C;Grocer&#x201D; so-much, &#x201C;Baker&#x201D; &#x26;c,&#x2014;and on the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> side Epic-Historical!);&#x2014;and my poor Goody will never see that partic<hi rend="italic">r red-jotting</hi> (the rest are all in their Clip yet), to give me a little praise for it. Ochone, ochone, when will this <hi rend="italic">boiling</hi> of the dead-dog chaos end, and hide itself forever from my weary eyes?&#x2014; Mary &#x26; I are very punctual however, you see. I was stringent the first week; and since, the thing goes itself. The creature Mary seems perfectly honest, can give clear acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of everything;&#x2014;frugal too, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> judge (week <hi rend="italic">per</hi> is from 30/ to 25/, never higher), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, apart alto<hi rend="italic">gr</hi> from the unmomentous <hi rend="italic">money</hi>, is a very pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> circ<hi rend="italic">e</hi>.</p>
<p>The weather is dry, parched as Sahara; but for the last 2 days grown almost <pb id="pg-40-193" n="40:193"/>cold:&#x2014;rain <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come, and gentler air a<hi rend="italic">gn</hi>. Meanwhile I am aloft here, under roof, not the sport of winds; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great advantage. Expect confidently to have my Book 20&#xB0; <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> (and all <hi rend="italic">War</hi> dismissed forever more!) before Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> quite depart. At lowest I am aiming dreadfully that way!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesternight I had hardly gone out when Fuz it seems called; said he had a Letter under way for me,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came after tea. Read it here. I also found the <hi rend="italic">Green</hi>w.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter from Rose Greenhow that TC was unable to find the day before; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640817-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-17">16 [17] Aug.</date></ref></note> and send it,&#x2014;but dispense you with reading.</p>
<p>Oh Darling, what a humiliated, broken-down, poor <hi rend="italic">cheepy</hi> wretch I am (today, most days),&#x2014;condemned to dwell among the pots, and live upon unclean blockheadisms, and hug foul creatures to my bosom (coaxing them to tell me what they know), these long years past,&#x2014;till I feel myself become foul &#x26; blockheadish! On, on, to get it pitched away from one, into the Bottomless Pool!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Darling, Darling, get better for me; and all will be forgotten,&#x2014;all will be <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> yet. God send thee well; or at least <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, to the supportable degree. <closer><salute>I am ever my poor true Jeannie&#x2019;s</salute></closer></p>

Was it left with anyone &#x201C;in particular&#x201D; at St Leonards?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The kitten (see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640311-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-11">11 March</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640414-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1864-04-14">14 April</date>]</ref>) that Mary Craik gave to the maid at Marina; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640825-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-25">24 [25] Aug.</date></ref></note> or was it brought back to Chelsea? Surely Mary Craik would secure its Future?</p>
<p>Something occurred here last evening between the hours of 8 and 9, which produced an extraordinary sensation! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell has not got over it yet! My Dear, <hi rend="small-caps">i laughed</hi>!!! &#x201C;the first time I had laughed since I came&#x201D;! And it was no feeble attempt; but a good loud hearty laugh!&#x2014; Perhaps you will wonder what could have produced an effect so startling? The cause was a nothing&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell had been telling of a row M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ewart at Nith Bank had had with her servants.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alicia Ewart, b. Yorston (b. ca. <date when="1789">1789</date>), widow of Thomas Ewart (d. <date when="1831">1831</date>), m. <date when="1828">1828</date>; she lived with her elder sister, Agnes Lawson (b. ca. <date when="1778">1778</date>), at Nithbank, Thornhill. They had three servants: Catherine Maxwell (b. <date when="1830">1830</date>), Mary Hunter (b. <date when="1833">1833</date>), and Violet Cowan (b. <date when="1834">1834</date>).</note> Hearing some disturbance in the room where her Maids slept, <pb id="pg-40-194" n="40:194"/>she got out of bed to see what it was, and found a stranger man in one of their beds. &#x201C;Only think what a terrible thing! said M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> R&#x2014;and a <hi rend="italic">great big</hi> man!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;My Dear,&#x201D; said the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in his quiet, dry way; &#x201C;would it have been any better had it been a <hi rend="small-caps">little</hi> man?&#x201C;&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t know why this tickled me so much&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">laughed</hi>; and if I had <hi rend="italic">cried</hi> I couldn&#x2019;t have surprised them more&#x2014;or so much!</p>
<p>Along with Forsters letter to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, there is come this morning a kind little letter from Forster to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Nobody else has written to me for long.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to JWC, Eliza Forster at least had written to her; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1864-08-18">18 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> which makes me feel sometimes as if I were officially dead. Curious that Geraldine, above all, who made more protestations of undying love to me than all my other friends put together, does not see what &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a bad</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">effect</hi>&#x201D; such inconstancy would have <hi rend="italic">in a</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">novel</hi>!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Again</hi> I have not lain awake all night; tho&#x2019;, for the rest, my sleep was as little satisfactory as <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, at all, could well be. The blue pill has done &#x201C;neither good nor ill&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> this time, I think. Perhaps because I had not such dreadful need of it!</p>
<p>You are quite right about Mary&#x2014;honesty and frugality are her ostensible virtues. She has some <hi rend="italic">latent</hi> ones besides, especially goodheartedness&#x2014;but these are sadly overlaid with a constitutional apathy, and a morbid self-conceit.</p>
<p>I read in <hi rend="italic">Forster&#x2019;s Essays</hi> the other day a charming paragraph about <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>. After telling the story of Frederick making Zeitern<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hans Joachim von Ziethen (<date when="1699">1699</date>&#x02013;<date when="1786">1786</date>), Prussian general; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590211-TC-JN-01"><sic>35:31</sic><corr>TC to JN, 11 Feb. 1859</corr></ref>. The anecdote is untraced; it is unclear whether JWC refers to an essay by John Forster, or one by Friedrich F&#xF6;rster, German historian and biographer of Frederick; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620618-TC-JN-01"><sic>38:100</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1862-06-18">18 June 1862</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 add a line to his letter to his wife, to the effect that &#x201C;next day at two o&#x2019;clock he would be <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>.&#x201D; Forster remarks; there are people who have called in question the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of this incident; but it accords so well with the cruel tyrannical disposition of the man, than if it did not actually take place it might have done so!!</p>
<p>There&#x2014;you have a long letter today, tho&#x2019; I am rather <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>&#x2014;for you will get no more till Tuesday&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your ever aff<hi rend="italic">te</hi></salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I got the poor little <hi rend="italic">Sermon</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Thornton&#x2019;s sermon, see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640819-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref></note>
 two mornings ago; and read it with many feelings: thank you much for sending it. There is something infinitely affecting in it to me: so small, and the topic so big; ah me, ah me! But really it is very honest, simple, true; and does Mr Thornton credit, so far as it goes. My poor Wife had been writing to me two or three days before, that she had met <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> in her Dream; &#x201C;his face was all transfigured, grown <hi rend="italic">pellucid</hi>; he said to her, Yours will be so too, when <hi rend="italic">you get out of y</hi>r <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi>!&#x201D; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> see, she interpreted in a sad sense for herself). I have had him in my Dreams too:&#x2014;what a &#x201C;dreaming&#x201D; one has, not by night only; and how one&#x2019;s Life altogether is like a Dream!</p>
<p>I know not if you are still at Melchet;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton was presumably at The Grange, as the letter was forwarded there.</note>
 but it is my likeliest Address. The news from my Wife (still at Thornhill with Dr &#x26; Mrs Russell) become really <hi rend="italic">better</hi>,&#x2014;or I do flatter myself so,&#x2014;for the last two weeks. I am busy to a degree; struggling with my last strength to &#x201C;have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> before winter come!&#x201D; Do not forget to warn me when you come to Bath House. Adieu dear Madam; and a kiss to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> little Jewel of a Mary,&#x2014;who w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> shriek if I tried it <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi> than symbolically or by proxy!</p>

<p>The weather has grown absolutely cold. I am for a bit of fire tonight! Yesterday there was a plunge of rain and thunder, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hoped had softened the air, but it has not. Stiff north-wind and sky of grey.&#x2014; &#x2014; I had hoped to be <hi rend="italic">thro</hi>&#x2019; that Burble of a <hi rend="italic">Neubergism</hi> (not poor N.&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">blame</hi> either, poor soul); but in that hope too I must consent to disapp<hi rend="italic">t</hi>: have had to leave off <hi rend="italic">sticking in the middle</hi> till a new day.</p>

<p>I do not get up to breakfast. After the two first mornings at the Gill, I gave over that audacious attempt; so as I breakfast in bed at nine, having had warm milk at eight (!) it is after ten before I get myself dressed.

<p>You would perhaps hear of me from the consulting Physician this morning.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1864-08-21">21 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I went up to Thornhill yesterday [Sat., <date when="1864-08-20">20 Aug.</date>] &#x26; found Jane looking decidedly better and more cheerful, though she had not slept well the night before. The thing she feels most want of now is power to walk, &#x26; it does not seem that there is any improvement in that respect though she walks more or less every day. The injury she got by the fall last year may perhaps have something to do with this defect, but she is not in the least degree lame &#x26; walks what she can walk without any visible check. When she was at Holmhill two or three years ago she often walked to Templand or Thornhill &#x26; back, though she is now so far from being able to attempt such a thing. &#x2026; Neither D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell nor I think that any thing beyond her present regimen &#x26; diet&#x2014;which in other respects seems to have had so satisfactory effects&#x2014;can be attempted for the defect in walking. &#x2026; Please do not say aught to Jane herself about the reports you get from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell or me, for that only annoys her.&#x201D; By road Thornhill was about &#xBD; mi. (1 km.) and Templand about 1&#xBD; mi. (2.5 km.) from Holmhill.</note> As he came up to dinner on Saturday.

<p>I have sat this half hour with my writing-apparatus before me waiting for your letter. I knew it would come tho&#x2019; the Postman was so long beyond his time. And it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> come&#x2014;all right!</p>
<p>Along with it a letter from Charlotte Southam, in great woe, poor little soul!, telling me her &#x201C;Father&#x201D; (Uncle)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Southam and his wife, Elizabeth, Charlotte&#x2019;s uncle and aunt, adopted her in childhood.</note> is dying.</p>
<p>Should you like to have Charlotte back, as housemaid, valet, and Ladys maid&#x2014;in place of Helen who will never I fear be made into a satisfactory Servant. I think Charlotte, in spite of her bad behaviour of old, is deeply attached <pb id="pg-40-202" n="40:202"/>to both you and me, and she had in her the making of a capital Servant, and she must have had good training since. I don&#x2019;t <hi rend="small-caps">know</hi> that she would like returning to &#x201C;the middle classes,&#x201D; after having been in &#x201C;the family&#x201D; of a Marquis;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640808-JWC-CS-01">JWC to <sic>CS</sic><corr>CSO</corr>, <date when="1864-08-08">8 Aug.</date></ref></note> but I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> she has so much respect for <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> and personal regard for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> that it would be worth while to give her the chance&#x2014;if you see as much hope in the arrangement as I do. Tell me your mind quite truly, without reference to my perhaps too romantic idea of her.</p>
<p>Last night was badish&#x2014;but better than I expected after the bustle of yesterday; (for besides the &#x201C;Happy Family&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Happy Family&#x201D; was the name given to a collection of small animals (including cats, mice, rabbits, owls, pigeons, and hawks) kept in a cage in Trafalgar Sq., all supposedly living together in harmony; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610415-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>37:150</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, [<date when="1861-04-15">15 April 1861</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> accompanying me in my drive, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gladstone<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Steuart Gladstone (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x02013;<date when="1882">82</date>) and his wife, Elizabeth, b.

<p>I can quite sympathize with you too under your cruel separation from him, and your poor &#x201C;Mother,&#x201D; in these last days of his Life.

<p><salute>Dear, Dear,&#x2014;</salute>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters are become a balm to me; a cheerful morning-light in these dark times, so gloomy and troublous for a year back. Oh continue to grow better for me, to send news that you are still on the improving hand! Slowly; I will be content with any rate of progress; <hi rend="italic">some</hi>, visibly <hi rend="italic">some</hi>, in such a blessed novelty.</p>
<p>I am ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as hurried as ever: the whole day long, every available minute from breakfast-time to 1 a.m and bed, I toil and moil among these <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> (and get <hi rend="italic">well</hi>ish on, ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Neubergisms</hi> quite vanquished and left):&#x2014;I must tell you the <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> if nothing more. Charlotte was here, as her Letter intimates (what amazing <hi rend="italic">spelling</hi>, worse than Betty&#x2019;s,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid, JWC&#x2019;s old nurse.</note> and <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t any fun in it),&#x2014;but she did not see me, and I always forgot when writing to you since. This day I sent to ask for poor old Southam: &#x201C;No hope, the Dr desperate&#x201D; (his poor Wife too, sitting up every night, has bad ailments):&#x2014;and now as to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> dear little Plan ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Charlotte?</p>
<p>Well, Goody, <hi rend="italic">thrice</hi>&#x2014;well,&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like. But as to me I cannot pretend to have knowledge either of Charlotte or of Lond<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi>-Girl-ism, to give any solid advice at all. You know I always <hi rend="italic">liked</hi> little Charlotte beyond anything of her kind that ever was in the House; and was very sorry when she had to be packed away. Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> think the maxim, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t take a serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> back,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">is</hi> practically inapplicable here? Possibly it may,&#x2014;nay <hi rend="italic">probably</hi>, when I consider <pb id="pg-40-205" n="40:205"/>everything (for the creature has a finer head as well as disposit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and may have learned &#x26; repented;&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">know</hi> at all. One thing can be said: If you decide to try her, and do find it ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> a failure, it is small <hi rend="italic">loss</hi>, extremely small! I confess myself totally sick of Serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi>-Girl-ism as practiced here; really quite driven to a <hi rend="italic">nonplus</hi> by it; and only submitting (with continual disgust &#x26; protest) because I cannot help myself at all. This Helen is an incurably careless creature, and I perceive, never will essentially mend. She is honest, cheerful, respectable; and can work well, but won&#x2019;t or doesn&#x2019;t. The things she neglects for me from day to day are manifold;&#x2014;she has also a tendency to disobedience, to <hi rend="italic">choice</hi> of work; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have got her turned into the street, on the moment, twice or thrice before now, had not we been situated as we are. She is now all for civility, flattering obsequiousness of manner,&#x2014;but she does my poor bit of work no better; and <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the kind of &#x201C;valet&#x201D; I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly bid adieu to at any time!&#x2014; If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find Charlotte feasible in any real measure, try her ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> by all manner of means. I can keep the term <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> from this individ<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, till we are within a <hi rend="italic">month</hi> of it, and then&#x2014;! Oh how glad we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be, and I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be, of a right little servant&#x2014; &#x201C;But we can <hi rend="italic">dow</hi> without her too!&#x201D; as a deft Scotsbrig man said of the moon.</p>
<p>Hoity-toity! it is close on <hi rend="italic">five</hi> o&#x2019;clock, and Helen will have to make for <hi rend="italic">Sloane Square</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To post the letter; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640817-TC-JWC-01">TC-JWC, <date when="1864-08-17">16 [17] Aug.</date></ref></note></p>

I dreamt I was going down a hillside to join some people on the road below&#x2014;and I was <hi rend="italic">running</hi>! and there were steps on to the road and I cleared <hi rend="italic">them</hi> at a bound! I thought oh how delightful to be able to <hi rend="italic">run</hi> again! and awoke&#x2014;to find a bad pain in my knee! Today I am as stiff as a crutch!&#x2014; The frost I suppose acting on the neuralgia about my legs.</p>
<p>I liked M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Thorntons Sermon<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640819-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;for the true and loving appreciation it showed of Lord A&#x2019;s character&#x2014;there was nothing <hi rend="italic">else</hi> to like in it&#x2014;&#x201C;no Gospel&#x201D; (my Aunts would say).

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>If any one in the world is capable of sympathizing with you under that terrible infliction, <hi rend="italic">bad nights</hi>; it surely must be <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! I have experienced every degree and every description of <hi rend="italic">bad night</hi>! I have been nearly driven mad with <hi rend="italic">bad nights</hi>!&#x2014; I don&#x2019;t know if it will be any comfort to you to say it; but I have arrived at this conclusion; that the sleeplessness proceeding from incidental pain, is much less distressing than the sleeplessness <hi rend="italic">proceeding from sleeplessness!</hi> and much less dangerous! So I hope to hear that the pain is gone out of your head, and, your sleep come back in the course of nature.</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">i</hi> go on mending. I make no great hand of sleeping yet; but I do sleep more or less every night. And I have returned to my old habit of <hi rend="italic">dreaming</hi>, discontinued ever since I fell ill. (for I do not count my horrible opium visions as <hi rend="italic">dreams</hi>!)</p>
<p>I now <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> a little as well as sleep a little every night. Last night I dreamt that I was <hi rend="italic">running</hi>! and that I cleared some steps of stairs at a bound! &#x201C;Oh the delightful sensation, I thought; to be once more able to <hi rend="italic">run</hi>!&#x201D; and I awoke with the joy of the thing! to find the air frosty and my legs stiffer than usual!</p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t be in the least hurry about my commission.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To choose wallpaper for Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640817-JWC-EFO-01">JWC to <sic>EF</sic><corr>EFO</corr>, [<date when="1864-08-17">17 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> I trust in God that I shall not have to return to Chelsea this good while yet!&#x2014; But I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> want the <hi rend="italic">Drawingroom</hi> papered as well as my bedroom and dressingroom&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">no oil painting</hi> of course&#x2014; I should like the papers or paper of a small pattern. and nearly white&#x2014;and some sort of <hi rend="italic">border</hi> in the Drawingroom&#x2014;</p>
<p>I should like Mr C not to be troubled about it, till the great affair is just ready to come off!

<p><salute>Dearest,</salute> I am living in hope of good news from you tomorrow;&#x2014;I will not expect <hi rend="italic">too</hi> good: Heaven grant I be not disappointed altogether! Jean sent me a Letter this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (the only one I had or c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> expect) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> testifies how <hi rend="italic">chatty</hi> and pleasant you were, and what a change for the better. Old &#x201C;despair&#x201D; quite gone out of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> face: evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> all <hi rend="italic">improved</hi>,&#x2014;&#x201C;except the walking, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seemed no better at all.&#x201D; Never mind the walking for a while; no hurry ab<hi rend="italic">t it</hi>,&#x2014;if you only gather weight, and keep well to windward of &#x201C;despair.&#x201D; Oh my poor little Jeannie, poor little soul!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Horse rode with me <hi rend="italic">like mad</hi> on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night (in fact, I think they are giving him too much of <hi rend="italic">beans</hi>); but for him I sh<hi rend="italic">d not</hi> have had so tolerable a sleep,&#x2014;conveying me into the blessed silence of Sabbath. Nobody loves his Sabbath as I do! There is something quite divine to me,&#x2014;in that cessat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of barrel-organs, pianos, tumults and jumblings (few of them <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> much); I easily do a better day&#x2019;s work than on any other of the seven; and (if left alone) have a solemn kind of sadness, a gloom of mind wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> tho&#x2019; heavy to bear is not unallied with sacredness &#x26; blessedness.</p>
<p>Yesterday I hoped to <hi rend="italic">get done</hi> with Seven-Years War (<hi rend="italic">done</hi> with such an enemy, only think of it),&#x2014;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5 p.m. however, I magnanimously left off, &#x201C;wait till a new day!&#x201D; And it has taken me every minute of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day, as fast as I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go;&#x2014;and there will be a good deal of Printer&#x2019;s-devilling still (little else all this week perhaps): but at the week&#x2019;s end, surely I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> see myself in Book 21st and <hi rend="italic">last</hi>;&#x2014;half the volume <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> gone; and an easier half ahead! Nay it is <hi rend="italic">all in type</hi> here, after a sort,&#x2014;but such a &#x201C;sort&#x201D;! Well, well.&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>I wish Dear,</salute> that the religious embargo<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the collection of letters in many parts of Scotland on Sundays.</note>
 had lasted a few days longer; for tomorrow or next day might perhaps find me in better spirits for writing. I have had bad nights (tho&#x2019; not <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> sleepless) and bad days too since I wrote last. &#x201C;The change of weather&#x201C;&#x2014; Perhaps!&#x2014; But what have I to expect when the real winter comes, if a change like <hi rend="italic">this</hi> acts so distressingly on me? My legs are both painful and useless, my feet (both of them) <hi rend="italic">swelled</hi> again; and I seem to have &#x201C;got a general <hi rend="italic">jandy</hi>&#x201D; (as John Hunter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably John Hunter (<date when="1795">1795</date>?&#x2014;<date when="1858">1858</date>) of Tynron, uncle of JWC&#x2019;s cousin Janet Pott, b.

And what is to become of me when I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> back, with my warm milk, and my nursing and my doctoring taken away? Oh I am frightened!&#x2014;frightened!

Besides the unreasonableness of inflicting such a burden on &#x201C;others&#x201D;; it would be too cold and damp for me here in this valley of the Nith, which mists are already overhanging.</p>
<p>And so, Dear, tho&#x2019; I would fain spare you this, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> troubles with me, I must go back to the subject of the <hi rend="italic">papering</hi>. and you must forgive what may <pb id="pg-40-214" n="40:214"/>strike you as weakly fanciful in my desire to have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a new colour</hi> about me&#x201D;! you must consider that I was <hi rend="italic">carried</hi> out of these rooms to be <hi rend="italic">shoved into a sort of Hearse</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640309-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1864-03-09">9 March</date></ref>.</note>
 and (to my own feelings) <hi rend="small-caps">buried</hi> <hi rend="italic">out of that House</hi> for ever.

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>Such is the severe observance of the Sunday in these regions that the letters posted in the South on Saturday are detained at Carlisle till monday; and so I have your letter only today. And I couldn&#x2019;t make up my mind about the paper till after post time. I have now come to the conclusion that the pattern I return will do for both the Drawing room and bed room (with closet) There is a striped white one among the patterns marked &#x201C;for Drawingroom&#x201D; which I like better, that is, think prettier&#x2014;but one must study a certain consistency, and I fancy that one would be too <hi rend="italic">fine</hi>, for a room with otherwise no pretensions to finery. I do not admire any of the borders&#x2014;the one I return is the best&#x2014;but rather too marked a contrast I think.</p>
<p>I have written to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to tell him you would be down upon him with a paper-hanger!

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>I have been long in answering, which is a bad sign of me&#x2014;a sign of having nothing of a comfortable nature to say; for when I <hi rend="italic">have</hi>, I like nothing better than to say it. My improvement lasted so long as the fine weather lasted; but the frequent rains seem to have been much against me; at least I know of nothing else, to which my backgoing can be feasibly imputed. My nights have been more restless (they had never got to be good) my appetite weaker, and worst of all, the <hi rend="italic">special ailment</hi> to which all other ailments are as nothing in comparison, and which had been wonderfully in abeyance for two or three weeks, has been tormenting me at least a <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of every day. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell says that <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> is the worst sort of weather for neuralgia pains; so it is to be hoped when the Heavens dry up again, I make take to improving again.</p>
<p>After all; if I compare my present condition of body with what it was at St Leonards; instead of, as I am too apt to do, comparing it with what it was before my illness; I have reason to be deeply thankful; and I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> thankful; though poor human nature longs and prays for something more!</p>
<p>I have not fixed the time for going home yet; but it cannot be put off much longer. I must wait only for a blink of good weather.</p>
<p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell says &#x201C;the fatalest thing for me in my present state would be to catch a cold and cough on the top of all.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I hope <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have not been hurt by the fatigue of the harvest; and that the work is all successfully over. There is little grain left in the fields hereabouts; and only in the fields of sluggards.</p>
<p>God bless you all.</p>

<p><salute>Alas, my Dear,</salute> this is bad news ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x2014;and unwelcome salutat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, but sent from Heaven, like the rain that was falling when I got it (in Cheyne Walk, by fav<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of Bullock). You take it easy: thank you for such spirited procedure:&#x2014;I wish it had not been there to take! I am very dreary, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it and other misgoings and traverses, in my solitude here. <hi rend="italic">Send</hi> me better news, as you promise, poor soul; oh do, for tomorrow!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did not bethink me till this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> that I might at least go and <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> Mrs Forster that the &#x201C;rooms were ready here, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> she and you were ready&#x201C;: I will do that this afternoon. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> bedroom vent<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The chimney.</note> does not need sweeping (was swept since you left it); drawing-room, since this morning, is getting rapidly dismantled, discarpeted, and I think will be ready also (<hi rend="italic">sweep</hi>-work and all) before tomorrow Noon. <hi rend="italic">My</hi> bedroom, not to increase the flurry, I think I will keep untouched: all <hi rend="italic">is</hi> clean, cool, quiet there;&#x2014;a bedroom wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I count among my earthly <hi rend="italic">invaluables</hi>,&#x2014;due to my poor Goody who has none near <hi rend="italic">like</hi> it herself.

Indeed I often feel, if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> sit down and <hi rend="italic">greet</hi> for a whole day, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be an infinite relief to me. But one&#x2019;s eyes grow dry;&#x2014;what a quantity of <hi rend="italic">greeting</hi>, too, one used to do in the beginning of life!&#x2014; No wonder, you have a shudder at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> rooms, my poor Dear; but they are the one Nest we have for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>;&#x2014;after a three or four months (Book <hi rend="italic">once done</hi>), I care not ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> leaving (in fact, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> infinitely prefer a more silent, quiesc<hi rend="italic">t natural</hi> kind of country for growing old and ending in): but for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> there is no remedy.

<p><salute>A little better today, Dear;</salute> but very nervous, and discouraged! I had got to be too hopeful! More hopeful than there was solid grounds for. Yesterday &#x201C;the Despair&#x201D; was in my heart again as well as in my face. Perhaps it is a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> sign that one night of pain and total wakefulness should have taken such serious effect on me. It must have been worse when such nights left no feeling of fatigue&#x2014;worse because unnatural. There was no return of the neuralgia (&#x201C;spasms in the Diaphragm&#x201D; (?) D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> R said) last night. And tho&#x2019; I was out of bed <hi rend="italic">fourteen</hi> times during the night, I got good mouthfuls of sleep between whiles. But I do not feel refreshed by my sleep&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">shaky</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">low</hi>, and terrified for the return of <hi rend="small-caps">the</hi> pain. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> had been quite in abeyance for a fortnight or so, and therefrom came my new hope and bright spirits. Oh anything but <hi rend="small-caps">that</hi>! Last evening again I had to take myself to bed at seven with the intolerable <hi rend="italic">irritation</hi>.</p>
<p>I am provoked at Marys stupidity in employing Shakespear about the carpets. I was obliged to take the job out of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> hands years ago. He had no <pb id="pg-40-222" n="40:222"/>proper apparatus for beating, and no clean ground to beat them in, and no conscience about getting the dust out. The carpets came back <hi rend="italic">torn</hi>, <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dirtied</hi>. The little Carpenter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Parsons or Frederick Freure.</note> does them capitally; so if the Drawingroom carpet, and my bedroom one (also Brussels) is still to do, pray let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> have them.</p>
<p>The rent is paid into Coutt&#x2019;s Bank, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">For the Trustees of Alfred Oldridge</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">from Thomas Carlyle</hi>&#x201D; The amount eight pounds fifteen shillings, when paid in full. But each half year an income tax has to be deducted&#x2014;varying&#x2014;I think when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had to do with it last, it was thirteen and sixpence&#x2014;Larkin would know what sum was last paid&#x2014;as a receipt would be given for it&#x2014; I always got a receipt to keep me in mind.</p>
<p>I can not think of anything else particularly needing to be said just now&#x2014;and I am too dull for spinning yarns</p>
<p><closer><salute>God keep you ever yours</salute></closer> <name>Jane WC</name></p>
