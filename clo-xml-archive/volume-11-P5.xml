<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The inclosed Letters have just arrived from Jack,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which I lose no time in sending off to you. He does not seem to have expected that I would send you more than the Letter addressed to yourself; but one frank will carry them all, and you will see better thereby how matters go. The whole travelling party has got safe to Naples; that is the main piece of intelligence as yet. Jack seems not to be in the best spirits with himself; but I impute this principally to the fret and anxiety of seeking lodgings, making arrangements, &#x26;c, and partly also to a dissatisfaction, which I am not sorry to observe increase with him, at this roving life of his generally: he finds it unfruitful, unsuitable; for which what remedy is there, except that he gather himself together, and put an end to it by settling down somewhere? His affairs, where he is, seem all to go on as well as possible: his Duke and Duchess<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Buccleuch.</note> full of civility and good nature to him, his voyage well concluded, in short all progressing in a very handsome manner. I have not written in answer to this Letter, having despatched a Letter as he directed me before, and not being ordered to do more. We shall probably hear from him again in some three weeks; then I will write: you shall have due notice. I have <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> no Newspapers as yet, fancying that the Duke would get the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> himself, and that another would be superfluous. I will send the <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi> now, however, to him and not to Scotsbrig, till he give me contrary notice.</p>
<p>By the bye, no <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> came here last week: what can be the meaning of that? I have speculated often, Jane always bidding me be at rest for that it is nothing; I will continue to hope and believe that it is nothing: however, I should have liked better to <supplied>[see]</supplied> the two strokes actually <hi rend="italic">come</hi>. Indeed there is a special cause of uneasiness: that fierce storm you have had in the North country. Mrs Welsh, alone of all our friends, has sent us a Newspaper to indicate that nothing befel her in the many disasters of Liverpool; but you had it in Dumfriesshire too, <pb id="pg-11-4" n="11:4"/>and many persons seem to have suffered everywhere.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The widespread and devastating gale was especially strong in the west and north. It began on Sun. night (<date when="1839-01-06">6 Jan.</date>). Liverpool suffered particularly; ships were wrecked, hundreds of buildings destroyed, and many people killed (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-01-09">9</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-01-14">14 Jan.</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi> (repr. <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1839-01-09">9 Jan.</date>) described it as like an &#x201C;African <foreign>simoom</foreign> or West Indian tornado.&#x201D;</note> Let the readiest writer take a pen immediately, and tell me what is becoming of you. Here in London we had a tempest too, but of no consequence; Jane the next morning complained of the loud roaring in the chimney tops and augured that the storm had done damage, but I never heard it, and the Liverpool Newspaper was the first messenger of the mischief to us.&#x2014; I will hope, till I hear otherwise, that nothing very wrong has happened among you. Indeed I think, lazy as my correspondents are, some one of them would have made a point of writing, had it been otherwise.</p>
<p>There is nothing new in this household of ours; all goes on smoothly, and in a way we ought to be thankful for. Jane does not fall into coughing; on the contrary, is able to move about; goes out every good day; indeed last night, was out at dinner, some four or five miles off this, and does not seem to have suffered by it. The people took her up in their carriage, and sent us both home in it; which is a great accommodation. They are people called Reierson,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Reierson (d. <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) and family, of 34 Upper Harley St. and Woodhill, nr. Ripley, Surrey.</note> rich merchant people, a mixture of Danish, Scotch, Russian and German; who have &#x201C;wrought <hi rend="italic">on</hi> us&#x201D; this long time so that at last we were obliged to go, and it did well enough &#x201C;after all.&#x201D;&#x2014; I dare say I mentioned last time that I was not intending to work any farther at present in the Westminster Review, but to write by and by something more to my mind than that sort of stuff. I have my face turned partly towards Oliver Cromwell and the <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi> time in England and Scotland, and am reading books and meaning to read more on the matter (for it is large and full of meaning); but what I shall make of it, or whether I shall make anything at all; it would be premature to say as yet. The only thing clear is that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> again some notion of writing, which I had not at all last year or the year before; a sign doubtless that I am getting into heart again, and not so utterly bewildered and beaten down as I was on the conclusion of my &#x201C;Revolution&#x201D; struggle. Anything that I wrote now would sell better than former things, and I think indeed be pretty sure to bring in a certain trifle of money in the long run.&#x2014; Another object that engages me a little in these last weeks is the attempt to see whether a Public Library cannot be got instituted here in London; a thing scandalously wanted, which I have suffered from like others. <pb id="pg-11-5" n="11:5"/>There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be some stir made in that business now, and it looks really as if it would take effect: meanwhile I can &#x201C;do either way&#x201D;; for the Cambridge people have in the kindest manner offered to get me books out of their University Library, and send them hither to read; a very kind, and one may hope, a very useful thing.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Through Douglas Heath.</note> Indeed all the people are very kind to me; which is rather surprising, considering what a sulky <supplied>[fel]</supplied>low I am. There will be Lectures too to think of&#x2014;ah me! But for the present I keep all that out of my head. So you may picture us sitting snug here, most evenings, in &#x201C;stuffed-chairs&#x201D; in this warm little parlour; reading, or reading and sewing, or talking with some rational visiter [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] that has perhaps dropped in:&#x2014;in a state, which, as states go, one ought to be thankful for. Some people say I ought to get a <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> with my American money, before Lecture-time, and ride, that I might be in better bodily condition for that enterprise: I should like it right well <hi rend="italic">if it were not so dear</hi>. We shall see how things go: this, at any rate, is no season for riding.&#x2014; Among our other benefits, I should tell you the Ferguses of Kirkcaldy<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John, Elizabeth, and Jessie.</note> have sent us two big <hi rend="italic">Barrels</hi>, one filled with the best of potatoes; the other with carrots and a bag of oatmeal; the produce of their Fife Farm! The potatoes are a great blessing (how glad would many a poor person be of the like this year!) for here they are too generally altogether bad: as to the oatmeal, which tho&#x2019; good is not equal to the Scotsbrig, we have put it into another barrel, and mean to <hi rend="italic">bake</hi> it, or more probably make presents of it!</p>
<p>These news, dear Mother, are not worth writing I doubt; yet I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> doubt you will read them with interest when written. How gladly would I read a whole stock of the like out of Annandale. We conclude you to be with Mary at present, and are very anxious to hear how matters go there. Give our love to Mary and her household, our kindest wishes for her now and at all times. We hope to hear good news soon.&#x2014; Alick gives a most melancholy picture of affairs in Ecclefechan; want of work, want of provision, want of hope or good conduct!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1838-12-23">23 Dec. 1838</date>, Alick had said: &#x201C;The crop is turning out miserably ill and farmers are naturally poor and heartless, while the wretched labourer is being nearly half starved. Meal 2/4 per 14 lbs and potatoes hardly to be had at any price.&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></ref>, for further description by Alick of disturbances in Ecclefechan.</note> Tell him I know not which of us two ought to write at present; but that if he do not before long, I will. We hope nothing is wrong at Scotsbrig, no <foreign><hi rend="italic">rick</hi></foreign> whirled away with wind or the like, also that Isabella and her child are prospering. Perhaps it was some <hi rend="italic">visit</hi> from the Dumfries people <pb id="pg-11-6" n="11:6"/>to you that caused the delay or loss of last week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier?</hi> That would be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> interpretation!&#x2014; Dear Mother, you see my paper is done and I can get room for no inquiries; of which, if I were beside you with power of <hi rend="italic">speech</hi>, I should have thousands to make! I wish your work were well over at Annan, and that I knew you home snug at your own <foreign>ingle-cheek</foreign> [fireside] again. It is wonderful the tossing and tumbling you do stand; yet surely you ought to take no liberties, to use all care. Jane says &#x201C;she will write you a letter <hi rend="italic">legible</hi> from top to bottom,&#x201D; and one to Jean also thanking her for the braid caps,&#x2014;&#x201C;soon.&#x201D; Meanwhile her love and mine to Mary and you all! <closer><salute>Good be ever with you dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your messenger found me engaged, with people about me; so that, for the moment, I made out only part of what he meant. A few minutes after he was gone, I discovered that the four beautiful volumes were not a loan but a gift!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably vols. 2&#x2013;4 and 6 of the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet Cyclop&#xe6;dia</hi>.</note> If the former would have been a favour, right welcome to me at present, the latter may well be a thing to be proud of, to be grateful for. Accept my best thanks for so handsome a <pb id="pg-11-8" n="11:8"/>gift, so handsomely bestowed. Surely I will keep these Books in a place of honour, and value them both for their own sake, and as a distinguished mark of your kindness to me. And now, in these fine Russia coats, brushed of all Lardnerism,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rebound and showing no traces of Dionysius Lardner (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), initiator of the <hi rend="italic">Cyclop&#xe6;dia;</hi> see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:86</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> ye Hampdens and Elliots,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hampden (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>), statesman and parliamentarian, and Sir John Eliot (<date when="1592-00-00">1592</date>&#x2013;<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>), patriot, dealt with in vols. 3 and 2 of the <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi>.</note> have at you!&#x2014; I will not criticise <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> at present; but say only, what I can well do, that I think I have got more insight out of it than out of all the other Lives of Cromwell. You surely take the right plan with those things;&#x2014;faithfully endeavour to <hi rend="italic">body forth</hi> the matter, and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it before speaking of it. Far other than the common plan; the results of which we see daily!</p>
<p>I also rejoice heartily that you take up this Library Scheme with such prompt zeal. Your help in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> will be of <hi rend="italic">first-rate</hi> value. In that, before all other places, it ought to be advocated; and you surely are the man to do it. I will request you therefore to get ready with your best word for us, the sooner the better. I consider your ready acceptance and adherence as the best omen; and indeed, joining it with other promising things that have occurred, am disposed to believe already that we shall and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> succeed. Sir James Clark warmly declares himself a supporter and furtherer, this morning; approves of our List of Leading Men, but thinks it ought to be enlarged to 20 &#x26;c: I am to see him very soon, and consult. Mr Rogers has a dozen Prospectuses, and is making applications with little doubt of succeeding. So soon as these Names are obtained, they will be printed at the end of the announcement you already have, and directions given then to some general place of signing. Before this day week, I hope it will be all ready for talking of with names and specialties; and that a word from you next Examiner will give it a proper lift.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, do you not think some vague note of preparation, in the actual pass we are at, might do some good, have a quickening influence on our Signers, and otherwise? Here is a crude thing I jotted down two or three weeks ago: if you could in any way pare it into shape, altering, adding, subtracting; and thought the insertion of it useful,&#x2014;since there is nothing of your own to be looked for this week?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1839-01-27">27 Jan.</date>, pp. 53&#x2013;54, printed TC&#x2019;s para. announcing the new venture: &#x201C;Its grand feature is that the books are to be lent out among the shareholders.&#x201D; Repr. in Harrison 8&#x2013;11.</note> I leave it with you, to your own good judgement. Remember only that for next week you are yourself engaged.</p>
<p>The writer of the Prospectus is Mr. Spedding, a neighbour of <pb id="pg-11-9" n="11:9"/>yours, whom you perhaps know. I will desire him to send you a few more copies of the Paper, to do good with as you have opportunity.</p>
<p>Finally, might I not hope to see you, some lucky day before long? Chelsea is not unknown to you, nor one of the Cheyne Rows. Or cannot I try Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields myself, and take chance of finding you.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This letter arrived from Jack yesterday morning; I had been expecting it partly for a week, as I doubt not you have been: I send it off therefore by the earliest opportunity. All seems to go well with Jack; his patrons good and civil to him, his patients doing well, nothing wrong anywhere: and yet he seems to have a sort of secret grudge, and does not like the thing so much as he might. The truth is, I believe, he is tired of being abroad at all, as I said last time; a symptom which he can get the better of whenever <hi rend="italic">he</hi> likes, and which therefore we will reckon favourable rather than otherwise. Or perhaps, as Jane says, he may be like the Irishman in a Ballinacrazy:</p>
<lg><l>There lived a man in Ballinacrazy,</l>
<l>Who <hi rend="italic">wanted a Wife to keep him unazy!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> 917.</note></l></lg>
<p>Let him get one in that case, and see whether he do not succeed!&#x2014; But seriously, we ought to be very thankful for the good Doctor&#x2019;s sake; and rejoice that all has gone so right with him hitherto: he is safe in the land of summer yonder, and will do very well, we may hope, till the season for moving come. I have sent him off various <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi>, since you heard of me last; I will write to him on Monday; his answer shall not linger here when it arrives.</p>
<p>As for you, my dear Mother, I know not well where to guess you as being. A Newspaper from Mary with one stroke on it seemed to indicate that she had got well thro&#x2019; her business; I wish I had more precise certainty of so desirable an event.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The birth of her daughter.</note> Except a Newspaper from Alick, and the weekly Courier from Dumfries, there have been no <pb id="pg-11-10" n="11:10"/>tidings for a long while. Some of them must write; I am entirely out of news. How are you; what are you doing? How is Isabella; how is everybody? I will fancy you back at Scotsbrig, in your own upper story: ah me, if I had a <hi rend="italic">wishing-carpet</hi> to ride on, I could come and have a smoke with you at that fireside before long! But we cannot manage that; let us be thankful that so much <hi rend="italic">is</hi> in our power. I will hope my dear Mother is tolerably well in spite of the wild winds and weather: keep yourself warm, get abundance of warm clothing; there are good knit spencers for women, very warm; one of which I meant to get you, or rather a pair of which, but I thought you could purchase it better for yourself with cash (tho&#x2019; I forgot to say so); therefore I insist on your getting it or something equivalent and above all, one way or other, that you must <hi rend="italic">defend</hi> yourself from cold, and simply determine <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be cold. Do you ever get yourself any beer now? This is the time for a little keg of it; in the winter it keeps so well. O dear Mother, what a blessing for us all that you are spared in the midst of us. Surely we are bound all of us, to do whatever is in our power to keep you comfortable. So far as money will go, let nothing be wanting. I am no longer so poor as I was; and as for Jack, he with his solid purse and &#xa3;500 a year, is absolutely rich.</p>
<p>My hand is like to give Isabella, or whoever reads this, a task for once! I have been splitting up one of the Kirkcaldy barrels this morning, in the back area; a task you may fancy, when I tell you that I had nothing to do it with but an old screwdriver, a nail-hammer and a spade! It was a work of <foreign><hi rend="italic">brashing</hi></foreign> [attacking] and smashing, till I made all <foreign>reek</foreign> [steam] again, and thawed the very snow (or snow-<hi rend="italic">glass</hi>, on the flags) with my violence. And now you see how my hand shakes, and will not steady again for hours. I must make it do; and drive on, nothing doubting.</p>
<p>We go along very well here, everything considered. Jane has not been so brisk for several winters; no coughing, fewer headaches even than usual. She does not venture out in the very sharp days, yet very frequently takes a little run, or somebody drives her, or she can drive herself in an omnibus for sixpence. Mrs Welsh too is come; she arrived late last night by the railway; was sitting here whole and well when I came home from the Wilsons&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane and Thomas.</note> where I had been to dinner. Jane has fitted up a special room for her, far up stairs; she is resting this day and sorting, and I have not seen her yet. Mrs Austin is in town again this winter (with a husband very sick), flourishing greatly among high people: we see a little of her, but more of others usefuller to us, and have plenty of society, and the best reception from it. Chelsea lies, as <pb id="pg-11-11" n="11:11"/>I often say, at a wholesome distance withal: there is a racket in some households in the town districts here, that would drive me mad.</p>
<p>There is still no message from America about the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, which Fraser is very anxious for. I imagine we shall soon get word of that Book, and doubt not in the mean time that it is going on well enough. It will be welcome come when it may. Since my last Letter I have not put pen to paper; but I have been diligently reading (and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write so<supplied>[me]</supplied> time or other); on Monday morning I am to mount up to my own library-room, and then most probably take to scribbling in better earnest: If my <hi rend="italic">liver and stomach</hi> would but stand true, I should have every reason to be happy: but what then? We know <hi rend="italic">them</hi> of old; they will not stand true: we must just try to be content <hi rend="italic">without</hi> them. However, I do mean to try to get myself some horse-exercise (tho&#x2019; it is very expensive) some kind of arrangement for two or three rides in the week before the Lecturing business begin, and while it lasts. One has no fair play at all with one&#x2019;s nerves in such a state. Jane eagerly urges me, many people urge me; and truly it might prove good <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi> were it nothing more. The Review Editor<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Robertson, acting ed. of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>.</note> and I, as I said last time, are partly <hi rend="italic">off</hi> at present,&#x2014;the man being a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gowk</hi></foreign> [fool]; tho&#x2019; I might still write for him if I liked: but there are other things in the wind which will probably answer better, if they come to maturity; you shall then hear of them. One great thing that is going on at present is the consultation and speculation about that Public Library I spoke of. You would perhaps notice the paragraph in the last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> about it, and perceive that it was by me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Some of the para. is obviously by TC: &#x201C;To all readers the buzz and bustle of a public room is an importunate distraction; to this waste of faculty add waste of time in coming and going; waste of patience in waiting; add discomfort, perturbation, headache, waste of health. &#x2026; There does not exist here any library whatever, worthy of the name of library, from which a reader can borrow books; nothing but &#x2018;circulating&#x2019; heaps of ephemeral rubbish &#x2026; &#x2018;libraries&#x2019; which, for real purposes of knowledge, would be held contemptible in a sixth-rate provincial town!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1839-01-27">27 Jan.</date>).</note> They have copied that into other Papers; and in short are making a kind of stir about the thing, which I do believe may come to a head one way or other. But indeed, as for me I need care little about it: the Cambridge people (men whom I never saw with eyes!) have last night sent me a whole Trunkful of their books in answer to a catalogue of mine: I have not in my whole life met with anything more civilly done.&#x2014; So goes it with us, dear Mother. God grant us a grateful humble heart; that is the one thing needful!</p>
<p>But I must not crowd the sheet which is to be the cover of all.&#x2014; I will write a few words to Alick, to tempt him to an answer. Good be with you dear Mother, for this time. Jane sends kindest regards: she <pb id="pg-11-12" n="11:12"/>cannot yet write the &#x201C;legible letter&#x201D;; I am to say that she has &#x201C;sewed about a quarter of a mile of seam and driven about a quart of tacks&#x201D;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Refurbishing her dressing room and &#x201C;little French bed&#x201D; for her mother&#x2019;s use.</note> how can anybody write in those circumstances? Health and Good to you all, dear <foreign>Bairns</foreign>! <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear Mother: I will write again before long; franks are more plentiful now.&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>This is a mere <hi rend="italic">scrape of a pen</hi> sent to provoke an answer from you. You will read in my Mother&#x2019;s letter &#x201C;a full and particular account&#x201D; of all that we are doing here: but from Annandale to me ward there is a great dearth of news; which I am very anxious you should put an end to as soon as possible. We have not heard a word since before that great wind-storm, which has laid Woodcockair<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A copse two mi. SW of Ecclefechan.</note> all flat, it seems, and covered the whole country with havock: I can only infer by your <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> that no very material damage was done any of you by it. But one would like to know by special statement. Pray write to me as soon as you can gather yourself.</p>
<p>Our last Letters, I think, crossed on the road, or nearly so. Your account of poor Ecclefechan was very dismal; nor, I fear, can there much improvement have taken place since then: it is a dismal winter for the poor everywhere. One hopes there may be this single good in the scarcity: it may produce a determined universal onslaught on those iniquitous Corn-Laws,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Corn Laws restricting the import of foreign corn were an attempt to regulate the price to a higher level than was possible given fluctuations of the market depending on the harvest. They included Robinson&#x2019;s Act, <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>, and Canning&#x2019;s, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>. Grote, Molesworth, and Roebuck had formed an earlier, unsuccessful association for repeal in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>. Cobden and Bright&#x2019;s Anti-Corn Law League grew out of a Manchester association, begun <date when="1838-09-00">Sept. 1838</date>. Anti-Corn Law meetings all over the country, this winter, culminated in a national gathering of delegates in London in <date when="1839-02-00">Feb.</date>, when many petitions (for and against) were presented to parliament and Brougham and Villiers moved unsuccessfully in both houses (<date when="1839-02-18">18</date> and <date when="1839-02-19">19 Feb.</date>) that evidence should be heard at the bar against the Corn Laws. Their failure persuaded the delegates to set up a permanent Anti-Corn Law League on <date when="1839-03-20">20 March</date> with headquarters in Manchester. The agitation of the Anti-Corn Law League did not succeed until <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>, when a greater belief in free trade, the economic distress of the <date>early forties</date> in Britain, and finally the Irish potato famine, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>, persuaded Peel to repeal the Corn Laws.</note> and abolish or modify them. There is like to be great disturbance otherwise, and great distress any way.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-13" n="11:13"/>Meanwhile &#x201C;ply away&#x201D; there, my man, and do the best possible. &#x201C;Better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than no <foreign>bield</foreign> [shelter].&#x201D; Times <hi rend="italic">must</hi> mend: and it is, in all cases, the quietly industrious and prudent-minded man that profits by the time. I long to hear how your meal speculation promises to answer: for I conclude you have started it, and are doing more or less in it. My light on the matter is as good as none; yet one would think such a thing were likely at present. Tell me about this, and about all things; especially things of your own household, and how all prospers with great and small there. Jane I suppose is a clever <foreign>lassie</foreign>, able to do up a parcel by this time, in case of need. As for Tom he is a greathearted fellow, according to my judgement, and must continue <hi rend="italic">growing</hi> in all senses, in stature, in talent of reading, and every other way. Good be with them, poor little things. They are got into a troublesome toilsome world, and will have to fight thro&#x2019; it as we are doing.</p>
<p>I have had for some time a small set of books and pamphlets for you, with some old raiment which perhaps would suit Mary best; but am always waiting for some <hi rend="italic">opportunity</hi>. The railway people cannot frank it farther than Birmingham; and I doubt whether the carriage after that might not cost you more than it is all worth. I think I shall send it by steam to Edinburgh,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By steamboat.</note> or <hi rend="italic">off</hi> at any rate in some way before long, if no free conveyance occur.</p>
<p>We have snow on the ground three inches deep at present, and the chief frost of the winter. The poor people beg, sell <foreign><hi rend="italic">spunks</hi></foreign> [touch-wood], struggle on. I do not think they are so ill off as in Lancashire: but indeed the miserable part of London is some miles out of our quarter.&#x2014; My paper is done, even if my time were not. You will take charge of getting the news I now send conveyed to Dumfries and Annan? The fault found with you last time <supplied>[on]</supplied> that head, seems to have been totally unjust; my Author, I suppose, was Jean. I meant to write her a word too this time, but it will not do. I am also bound to write to Manchester;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Janet Carlyle Hanning.</note> and will before long.&#x2014; The general conclusion, dear Alick, is <hi rend="italic">that you must write</hi>. Jane affectionately salutes you all. Luck be about the house, and about all your houses! Tell Grahame I mean him a letter too, before long.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever Your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Without loss of time I proceed to answer the second of your Letters; the first, most welcome on its arrival, did not demand any answer. We had wearied a little for this last, as no doubt our good Mother did in a still higher degree: however it too is off to Annandale, and I hope and compute they may be reading it at Scotsbrig this monday morning about this very hour. No Newspaper, or other token except these Letters, has arrived from you. I hope you have got some <hi rend="italic">Couriers</hi> by this time; none were <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> till your first Naples Letter warned me; I had fancied the Duke would get both <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Dumfries weekly papers. Buccleuch was a major landowner in Dumfriesshire.</note> and that perhaps the expence of a second copy might outrun the profit for you. They will be forwarded now till you countermand them.</p>
<p>There has not a written word of intelligence got hither from Annandale since I wrote last. They are slow writers; a weighty correspondence, with the reciprocity all on one side! But I know the difficulties they labour under, and keep writing along as I best may. The great tempest of which, M&#x2019;Diarmid still keeps jargoning,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>.</note> appears not to have injured any of them very sensibly; at least so I infer from Newspapers with strokes that have arrived from Manchester, Dumfries, Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and Annan: no articulate word gives me farther assurance. From one Annan Newspaper with a special mark on it I infer that Mary has been safely brought to bed, that probably our Mother is gone thence to Scotsbrig again. Nothing more is known to me in that quarter. I hope and believe, all is tolerably well. Poor Wull Brown!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381211-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1838-12-11">11 Dec. 1838</date></ref>.</note> He clings to my thoughts here, in a way he never did while near me and alive. There is a strange sacredness in Death; the meanest gets venerable when enveloped in Eternity: that last night among the rude peat-bogs of Linbrigford will not out of my thoughts.</p>
<p>In Chelsea all goes along with an equable motion, wherein little is to be noted since you last heard. Jane continues much better than she was last year; never yet coughing; able to go out any fine day; indeed better I think than she was wont to be for some years back. On Friday last her Mother arrived from Liverpool; well in health, and in spirits as <pb id="pg-11-15" n="11:15"/>yet; not sorry I dare say to escape from the tumultuous complexities of Maryland Street. John Welsh&#x2019;s Partner<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Leishman (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) of Leishman &#x26; Welsh, coppersmiths, 4 Vulcan St., had d. on <date when="1839-01-29">29 Jan.</date></note> is dead suddenly in these days; a serviceable man, whose loss will occasion new sorrow and increase of trouble. Mrs Welsh lodges up stairs in the front room which was Jane&#x2019;s dressing-room; the little French bed has been equipped in the most ingenious and elegant way; a new (old) chest-of-drawers, with improvements of various kinds, are in the room where you lodged, which is now mine. I have this morning, for the first time, got a fire once more in my old Library, am writing at my old table, with my books all round; and mean to be very busy henceforth. Till now I have sat down stairs, reading, reading; not idle, yet with no very visible result of my working. I have read a good many volumes about Cromwell and his time; I have a good many more to read. Whether a book will come of it or not, still more <hi rend="italic">when</hi> such will come, are questions as yet. The <foreign>pabulum</foreign> this subject yields me is not very great; I find it far inferior in interest to my French subject: but on the whole I want to get <hi rend="italic">acquainted with England</hi> (a great secret to me always hitherto), and I may as well begin here as elsewhere. There are but two very remarkable men in the Period visible as yet: Cromwell and Montrose.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Graham, 5th Earl and 1st Marquess of Montrose (<date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1650-00-00">50</date>), Scottish military leader; fought with the Covenanters, <date when="1638-00-00">1638</date>&#x2013;<date when="1639-00-00">39</date>, against Aberdeen, which supported episcopalianism and Charles I. In <date when="1641-00-00">1641</date> he changed sides; after a series of victories with a predominantly Highland army against the Covenanter-dominated Scots army, <date when="1644-00-00">1644</date>&#x2013;<date when="1645-00-00">45</date>, his royalist army was defeated at Philiphaugh by the Scots under David Leslie (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:240). Returning from Europe in the service of Charles II in <date when="1649-00-00">1649</date>, he was captured and executed, <date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>. TC refers to him briefly as &#x201C;the Hero-Cavalier&#x201D; in his &#x201C;Hero as King&#x201D; lecture (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:229). In his Journal, <date when="1839-02-06">6 Feb.</date>, TC wrote: &#x201C;Montrose I have dreamt at times, might be good for a Tragedy? I cannot write tragedy however; it stands too much <hi rend="italic">embossed</hi>, at <hi rend="italic">too great a distance</hi> from the reality of the event. &#x2026; But now &#x2026; to make out a ground scheme of these &#x2018;troubles,&#x2019; or some beginning of one.&#x201D; After reading Mark Napier, <hi rend="italic">Montrose and the Covenanters</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), TC wrote seven closely written sides called &#x201C;Gropings about Montrose,&#x201D; dated &#x201C;<date when="1839-02-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1839</date>.&#x201D; It has been pbd., in part, by Coleman Parsons, <hi rend="italic">Englische Studien</hi> 71 (<date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>): 360&#x2013;71, from MS: NLS 1798 (ii), the unpbd. part being his reading notes from Napier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Montrose</hi> and notes of books for further reading. Characteristically, it is an attempt to find a subject through &#x201C;groping&#x201D; at it (or defining by writing), the subject being the Civil War and its leaders: &#x201C;Are there more than two great characters in the English Civil Wars? I find not more than two,&#x201D;&#x2014;Montrose and Cromwell. In addition, TC seeks a narrative line and more information. He already finds an interest in them as heroes, and has nearly grasped that the way for him to understand Cromwell is through his speeches. The essay (if it can be called that) is, as TC notes, &#x201C;written <foreign>currente calamo</foreign> [offhand],&#x201D; and in the middle of the jottings toward the end, he inserts &#x201C;Ah me! what unhappy faltering is all this! To work! to work with some impetus!&#x2014;&#x201D; By <date when="1839-02-22">22 Feb.</date>, he commented in his Journal: &#x201C;I have been fishing and excerpting from a horrid rubbish-mass, by one Mark Napier, whatsoever had direct reference to a Picture of Montrose and his Life. My languor has been shameful; my success small; I have just now ended. How little is or can be known about that man! Most probably it will be poor policy to try writing on him? On the whole that subject does not grow more promising.&#x201D;</note> 
<pb id="pg-11-16" n="11:16"/>The rest verge towards wearisomeness; indeed the whole subject is Dutch-built, heavy-bottomed; with an internal fire and significance indeed, but externally wrapt in buckram and lead. We shall see. In the meanwhile, I have got a large <foreign>Portmanteau</foreign> of Books about the thing from Cambridge University Library: here they actually stand; sent me by persons whom I never saw; a most handsome and encouraging phenomenon! They came on Friday too (the day of your Letter), which we may account a lucky day. The visible agent in the business is one Douglas Heath, a promising young Barrister, who sometimes comes here, is a Cambridge man, and a zealous reader of mine.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Precisely at this point arrives the Postman with a Newspaper and strokes from Alick (all well there); and a Letter from Emerson at Concord enclosing a draught for &#xa3;100! Their Boston Edition of the F.R. is all sold out, and this is the money-produce, so far as liquidated yet. Was any braver thing ever heard of? A hundred and fifty pounds from beyond the salt sea, while not a sixpence could be realised here in one&#x2019;s own country by the thing!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC expected to earn nothing from the 1st British edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>, but see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390413-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1839-04-13">13 April</date></ref>. In his Journal, <date when="1839-02-06">6 Feb.</date>, he wrote: &#x201C;This American cash is so welcome <hi rend="italic">because</hi> I am so poor. Had I been rich I could not have had that true pleasure.&#x201D;</note> I declare, my American friends are right fellows, and have done their affair with effect. The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> are at press since about Christmas; will be over here by and by; greatly to Fraser&#x2019;s satisfaction, who is announcing then what he can. It seems I am going to make some cash after all by those Books of mine. The second English edition of the F.R. must now be set about; I must see how to combine that with the American demand, make vigorous bargain with the printing people, and see what can be done with it. This Postman delivery will give you a glad feeling too. Unhappily two American men (one Summer whom you will perhaps see in Italy, and another)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Sumner and Joseph Coolidge.</note> arrived just on the skirts of Postie, and have held me clattering ever since; above an hour; till my nerves are all in a flutter, and this sheet of yours must suffer.

That was the question, as far as I can explain it in this compass. I answered, the thing might be done as to Goethe and others, tho&#x2019; the general scheme of the &#x201C;Analytical&#x201D; concern did not look very smiling to my judgement, and with Useful-Knowledge men, I thought, must necessarily prove <hi rend="italic">ligneous</hi> [wooden]: however, as to me and a volume or two volumes extracted out of Goethe and bound together in some supportable way, the proposal depended altogether on <hi rend="italic">what cash will you give?</hi> and with a rational offer on that head, I was ready to give rational answer. There accordingly it stands; Knight, as I understand it, beating up for <hi rend="italic">men</hi>. He has already got Lord Brougham, and Leigh Hunt (for Spenser); there is to be no &#x201C;editing,&#x201D; or beggarly superintendance of any kind. The possibilities are that it really may come to something; I calculate it will be better than Robertson-review work; easier, quieter, thriftier, every way preferable. As to Robertson finally, he and I have got or are now getting, according to my view, into the right permanent posture: my Note about <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> seems to have cut him to the quick, far deeper than I meant;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></ref>.</note> but I have laid a little unguent on, so that we shall come to stand in a quietly polite and more distant attitude; ready for nearer reapproximation if it suit at any time, and with no risk of ass-caperings or the like if it do not. Mill is supposed to be on the way to Italy or in Italy; but nothing has been heard of him since Paris: his Brother-in-law a Dr King of Maddox street here has died,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas King, m., <date when="1837-00-00">ca. 1837</date>, Wilhelmina Forbes Mill (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), of 6 Maddox St., had d. in Norwich, <date when="1839-01-10">10 Jan.</date></note> in sad circumstances, since Mill went. Robertson is not a man to be dealt with, except afar off and with a cowskin in your hand: fools, as you say, are the <hi rend="italic">uncanniest</hi> of 
<pb id="pg-11-18" n="11:18"/>all creatures; and if there ever was a fool this is one.&#x2014; Of course there will a time come for some appearance as a <hi rend="italic">Lecturer,</hi> I suppose: but of all this I think not as yet. The only item rather clear to me is that if I do lecture, I ought to have a horse during the process and a month prior to it. Dyspepsia, rousing me in the frosty darkness of morning, and shattering my poor frame of body all to pieces, is a terrible millstone hung about me; I feel as if it were the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> thing I had to complain of now; and withal as if it needed only a little help to reduce it under moderate subjection, and leave me much quieter and healthier than I have been for a dozen years past. Fraser cannot give me the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of his horse, I think; but Jane has actually consulted Chancellor the Stabler here,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Chancellor, 1 Cheyne Row.</note> and there is a kind of hope of feasibility in it, which I shall look more strictly into, had the dry weather come. At present<supplied>[,]</supplied> we are in frost, and stormy fluctuation: as the Yankee said, &#x201C;first it friz, then it snew, then it blew, then it <supplied>[thew,?]</supplied> then it friz again.&#x201D; There is a terrible noise about Corn-laws, which <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to be abrogated or modified this hung<supplied>[ry]</supplied> winter;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390202-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1839-02-02">2 Feb.</date></ref> Even the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> was editorializing against the Corn Laws (<date when="1839-01-18">18</date>, <date when="1839-01-22">22</date>, <date when="1839-01-23">23 Jan.</date>). Greville noted, <date when="1839-01-24">24 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;The question of absorbing interest is now the repeal and alteration of the Corn Laws, and the declaration of war against them on the part of the &#x2018;Times&#x2019; has produced a great effect, and is taken as conclusive evidence that they cannot be maintained, from the rare sagacity with which that Journal watches the turns of public affairs&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> 4:120).</note> great distress everywhere among the poor: a confused unpleasant time, outwardly and inwardly.

Charles Buller was busy drawing up his Canada Report when I saw him last, ten days ago.<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC seems to add support to the view that Buller wrote the <hi rend="italic">Report on the Affairs of British North America</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi> [<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>] 17). Brougham once said that Durham&#x2019;s only contribution to it was his signature, and that it was written by Buller on Wakefield&#x2019;s principles. As Durham&#x2019;s principal secretary, Buller contributed much of the raw material and presumably his views to Durham. Buller himself wrote that it was &#x201C;a groundless assertion&#x201D; that Durham was not the <hi rend="italic">Report&#x2019;s</hi> author (<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> 85 [<date when="1847-04-00">April 1847</date>]: 390).</note> The Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is just at hand; the Durham prospects hardly so bright as they were.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> was published by the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1839-02-08">8</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-02-11">11 Feb.</date>, possibly leaked by Wakefield, forcing Melbourne&#x2019;s government to introduce it for consideration to parliament, <date when="1839-02-11">11 Feb.</date> Upper and Lower Canada were united in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, but its other recommendations were not adopted until <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.

The other night I met with a French <foreign><hi rend="italic">lionlet</hi></foreign>, one Comte de Vigny, a Carlist literary dandy; civil; Parisian; with a long Roman nose, and next to no chin.<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Comte Alfred Victor de Vigny (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), poet, novelist, dramatist; <hi rend="italic">Cinq-Mars</hi> (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>); <hi rend="italic">Po&#xE8;mes Antiques et Modernes</hi> (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>); <hi rend="italic">Chatterton</hi> (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>).

Later his wife&#x2019;s cousin sent him TC&#x2019;s works as they came out.</note> I have also breakfasted with old Rogers; the occasion was a mighty project&#x2014; no less than that of instituting a Public Library here from which books might be <hi rend="italic">borrowed</hi>. I have <hi rend="italic">preached</hi> upon it till people take it up; Spedding has promulgated a Prospectus; Rogers approves, Hallam and a list of official Lords are expected; your friend Sir James Clark <hi rend="italic">zealously</hi> approves; and now the Newspaper engine is set a-blowing: slight thunder from the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi><note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1839-01-26">26 Jan.</date>, concluded its description of the proposed library by saying that &#x201C;the experiment seems at least to be worth trying.&#x201D;</note> a fierce blast (from me) in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> &#x26;c: it really looks as if the thing would take effect in one shape or another.

In his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> Charles Darwin describes &#x201C;a funny dinner&#x201D; at Erasmus&#x2019;s, about this time, &#x201C;where amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of whom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing during the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner Babbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very interesting lecture on silence&#x201D; (F. Darwin, <hi rend="italic">The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin</hi> [London, <date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>] 1:77).</note> A mixture of craven terror and venomous-looking vehemence; with no chin too: &#x201C;cross between a frog and a viper,&#x201D; as somebody called him; forever loud on the &#x201C;wrongs of literary men,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has his &#xa3;20,000 snug! I advise men to keep off that man. I have also seen&#x2014; But enough of that and more than enough. I go out but little this winter hitherto, and find a very little all that is good for me. Yet withal I get inured to <pb id="pg-11-20" n="11:20"/>it, and can be quiet in a racket much more successfully than at first. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tout va bien ici, le pain ne manque pas</hi></foreign> [All goes well here, bread is not lacking].</p>
<p>Your tone, dear Jack, is not over happy; yet every outward thing seems to go prosperously with you. I can well understand that you are <hi rend="italic">vacant</hi> at heart in that business, tho&#x2019; it must be owned to be one of the best situations, or the very best, of that kind that could be found. Rejoice that you do prosper in it. Doubtless you will study to perform your service like a faithful man; and, as I think, indeed there is good prospect of advantage lying in it. Your people seem humane, honest people after their fashion; you have a real work to do for them. Beside had you once got to reading and other internal employment, the feeling of langour will leave you, and many discontents along with it. Hold out, my brave fellow. We are not to be entirely beaten in the battle yet. The worst of our days are perhaps past! Ah me, that was a saying of poor Irving&#x2019;s,<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving&#x2019;s toast; see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 134.</note> whose good days and evil were too suddenly past.&#x2014; If you come to Switzerland I will really make an effort to come and meet you there. Think what a <hi rend="italic">ploy</hi> that will be! But we must not anticipate.&#x2014; Jane has gone out; cannot send you her love in words. Craik, the innocent <foreign><hi rend="italic">haver-meal</hi></foreign> [oatmeal] mortal, expressly charged me with kind remembrances for you. He and I walked to Wimbledon yesterday thro&#x2019; the copious slush of snow: he laughs loud, has a fair common-sense limitation both of head and of heart; a man pleasanter to walk thro&#x2019; snow-slush with than many a cleverer man. Mrs Welsh sitting alone down stairs (I fancy) would not forgive me if I failed to send some token of her remembrance. She has been speaking about you much since she came, and in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> letter before that. I have stuck up your Coleridge<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified print.</note> by a pin against the wainscot; the thermometer and it on the end wall between the two maps. Your old <hi rend="italic">dressing</hi>-room is papered, and altogether smart: God grant you were there again safe my Boy! We will hope, we will trust. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. Yours ever and ever</salute></closer></p>

Her engagement to John Forster, <date when="1835-00-00">ca. 1835</date>, was supposedly broken off on this account, and her marriage to George Maclean, gov. of Cape Coast Castle, <date when="1838-06-00">June 1838</date>, was apparently caused by her desire to escape from the rumors.

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Your welcome little Letter, with the astonishing inclosure, arrived safe four days ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1839-01-13">13 Jan.</date>, enclosing &#xa3;100 from sales of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution,</hi> which had been sold out for a month (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 210&#x2013;11). In his Journal, <date when="1839-02-06">6 Feb.</date>, TC had written: &#x201C;Already &#xa3;50 had come; this is &#xa3;150 in all; not a farthing having yet been realised here by our English bibliopoly.&#x201D;</note> right welcome, as all your Letters are, and bringing as these usually do the best news I get here. The miraculous <pb id="pg-11-22" n="11:22"/>draught<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 5:4&#x2013;9.</note> of Paper I have just sent to a sure hand in Liverpool, there to lie till in due time it have ripened into a crop of a hundred gold sovereigns! On this subject, which gives room for so many thoughts, there is little that can be said, that were not an impertinence more or less. The matter grows serious to me, enjoins me to be silent and reflect. I will say at any rate, there never came money into my hands I was so proud of; the promise of a blessing looks from the face of it; nay it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> blessed. So I will ejaculate, with the Arabs, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah akbar</hi></foreign> [God is great]!&#x201D; and walk silent by the shore of the many-sounding<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the &#x201C;loud-resounding&#x201D; sea of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> 1:34&#x2013;35.</note> Babel-tumult, meditating on much. Thanks to the mysterious all-bounteous Guide of men, and to you my true Brother, far over the sea!&#x2014; For the rest, I shewed Fraser this Nehemiah document;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Nehemiah&#x2019;s covenant to make due offerings to God, see Neh. 9:38 and 10:35&#x2013;39. No doubt TC was also thinking of the exactions and usury of publishers; see Neh. 5:7&#x2013;10.</note> and said I hoped he would blush very deep;&#x2014;which indeed the poor creature did, till I was absolutely sorry for him.</p>
<p>But now first as to this question, what I mean?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson, puzzled by TC&#x2019;s question &#x201C;If you in America wanted more also&#x2014;?&#x201D; of a 2d edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381202-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-12-02">2 Dec. 1838</date></ref>), had asked, &#x201C;Could you send us out a part of your edition at American prices, &#x26; at the same time to your advantage? I wish I knew the precise answer to this question&#x2014;then perhaps I could keep all pirates out of our bay&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 210).</note> You must know poor Fraser, a punctual but most pusillanimous mortal, has been talking louder and louder lately of a &#x201C;second edition&#x201D; here; whereupon, as labour-wages are not higher here than with you, and printing-work, if well bargained for, ought to be about the same price, it struck me that, as in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> so here inversely the supply of both the New and the Old England might be profitably combined. Whether aught can come of this, now that it is got close upon us, I yet know not. Fraser has only 75 copies left; but when these will be done, his prophecy comprehends not&#x2014;&#x201C;surely within the year!&#x201D; For the present I have set him to ascertain, and will otherwise ascertain for myself, what the exact cost of <hi rend="italic">stereotyping</hi> the Book were, in the same letter and style as yours; it is not so much more than printing, they tell me: I should then have done with it forever and a day. You on your side, and we on ours might have as many copies as were wanted for all time coming. This is, in these very days, under inquisition; but there are many points to be settled before the issue. I have not yet succeeded in finding a Bookseller of any fitness, but am waiting for one always. And even had I found such a one, I mean an energetic Seller that would sell on other terms than forty per cent for his trouble, <pb id="pg-11-23" n="11:23"/>it were still a question whether one ought to venture on such a speculation: &#x201C;quitting the old highways,&#x201D; as I say, &#x201C;in indignation at the excessive tolls, with hope that you will arrive cheaper in the steeple-chase way!&#x201D; It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> clear however that said highways are of the corduroy sort, said tolls an anomaly that must be remedied soon; and also that in all England there is no Book in a likelier case to adventure it with than this same,&#x2014;which did not sell at all for two months, as I hear, which all Booksellers got terrified for, and which has crept along mainly by its own gravitation ever since. We will consider well, we shall see. You can understand that such a thing, for your market too, is in agitation; if any pirate step in before us in the meanwhile, we cannot help it.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your swift attention to the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had said: &#x201C;The 3d &#x26; 4th vols are now printing: tis a fortnight since we begun. You shall have 250 copies. I am not quite sure you can have more &#x26; bound &#x26; <hi rend="italic">entitled</hi> &#x26; directed as you desire at least according to the best ability of our printer, as far as the typography is concerned, and we will speed the work as fast as we can. but as we have but a single copy of Fraser&#x2019;s magazine we do not get on very rapidly&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 210).</note> poor Fraser is in great haste to see them; hoping for his forty-per-cent division of the spoil. If you have not yet got to the very end with your printing, I will add a few <foreign><hi rend="italic">errata</hi></foreign>; if they come too late, never mind; they are of small moment: <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> (page 24, of the separate Copy; of the Magazine I know not what page) <hi rend="italic">delete</hi> the Note about &#x201C;the Palais Royal Garden&#x201D; at the bottom of the page;&#x2014;I think I have since discovered that the date of that is wrong, and it can be dispensed with there. <hi rend="italic">Walter Scott,</hi> p. 296 I pointed out one error already, a line to be <hi rend="italic">deleted;</hi> p. 300, just after &#x201C;beatified ghost-condition&#x201D; occurs a short sentence &#x201C;Let it be so&#x201D;: that is an editorial superfactation, pray delete that: again; p. 335 last line but one, <foreign><hi rend="italic">rondo</hi></foreign> (in the Note about Giotto) instead of <foreign><hi rend="italic">t</hi>ondo</foreign> (it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> t, and the editorial broadhoof changed it into r): p. 343, just before the extract from Scott&#x2019;s Diary, &#x201C;a hint (from Byron&#x2019;s Ravenna),&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">read</hi> &#x201C;on hint.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The note in &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 15 (<date when="1837-02-00">Feb. 1837</date>): 176, was deleted. No sentence was deleted from &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; p. 296, but &#x201C;Let it be so&#x201D; was deleted from p. 300. <foreign>&#x201C;Rondo&#x201D;</foreign> was corrected to <foreign>&#x201C;tondo,&#x201D;</foreign> &#x201C;a hint&#x201D; to &#x201C;on hint&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> 4:278&#x2013;79, 284, 333, 345). Stearns Wheeler, correcting the vols. for the press, was confused, and wrote, &#x201C;I cannot make out for the life of me whether we are to print the <foreign>tondo</foreign> or <foreign>rondo</foreign>. I should think, were it not for the parenthesis, that <foreign>rondo</foreign> was the right word&#x201D; (<date when="1839-04-12">12 April</date>, Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 213).</note>&#x2014; I will not add a word more; but leave myself with my faithful correctors, to whom be all furtherance. Out upon it! my paper once more is all but done, and not a syllable of sense said.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>This foggy Babylon tumbles along as it was wont; and, as for my <pb id="pg-11-24" n="11:24"/>particular case, uses me not worse but better than of old. Nay there are many in it that have a real friendliness for me. For example, the other night, a massive <foreign>portmanteau</foreign> of Books, sent according to my written list, from the Cambridge University Library, from certain friends there whom I have never seen; a gratifying arrival. For we have no Library here, from which we can borrow books home; and are only in these weeks striving to get one: think of that! The worst is the sore tear and wear of this huge roaring Niagara of things on such a poor excitable set of nerves as mine. The velocity of all things, of the very word you hear on the streets, is at railway rate: joy itself is unenjoyable, to be avoided like pain; there is no wish one has so pressing as for quiet. Ah me, I often swear I will be <hi rend="italic">buried</hi> at least in free breezy Scotland, out of this insane hubbub, where Fate tethers me in life! If Fate always tether me;&#x2014;but if ever the smallest competence of wordly means be mine, I <supplied>[will]</supplied> fly this whirlpool as I would the Lake of <hi rend="italic">Malebolge,</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inferno</hi> 18.</note> and only visit it now and then! Yet <supplied>[perhaps]</supplied> it is the proper place after all, seeing all places are <hi rend="italic">im</hi>proper: who knows? Meanwhile I <supplied>[lead]</supplied> a most dyspeptic solitary self-shrouded life; consuming, if possible in silence, my considerable daily allotment of pain; glad when any strength is left in me for working, which is the only use I can see in myself,&#x2014;too rare a case of late. The ground of my existence is black as Death; too black, when all <hi rend="italic">void</hi> too: but at times there paint themselves on it pictures of gold and rainbow and lightning; all the brighter for the black ground, I suppose. Withal I am very much of a fool.&#x2014; Some people will have me write on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> which I have been talking about. I do read on that and English subjects, finding that I know nothing and that nobody knows anything of that: but whether anything will come of it remains to be seen. Mill the Westminster friend is gone in bad health to the Continent, and has left a rude Aberdeen Longear [Ass], a great admirer of mine too, with whom I conjecture I cannot act at all: so good-bye to that. The wisest of all, I do believe, were that I bought my nag <hi rend="italic">Yankee,</hi> and set to galloping about the elevated places here!</p>
<p>A certain Mr Coollidge (?),<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Coolidge, Jr. (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>), Boston merchant. His son Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, later a financier and diplomat, attended a boarding school in London.</note> a Boston man of clear iron visage and character, came down to me the other day with Summer; he left a newspaper fragment, containing &#x201C;the Socinian Pope&#x2019;s denunciation of Emerson.&#x201D;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrews Norton on the <hi rend="italic">Divinity School Address</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Boston Daily Advertiser,</hi> <date when="1839-08-27">27 Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381107-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-11-07">7 Nov. 1838</date></ref>.</note> The thing denounced had not then arrived, tho&#x2019; often <pb id="pg-11-25" n="11:25"/>asked for at Kennet&#x2019;s;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bookseller.</note> it did not arrive till yesterday, but had lain buried in bales of I know not what. We have read it only once, and are not yet at the bottom of it. Meanwhile, as I judge, the Socinian &#x201C;tempest in a washbowl&#x201D; is all according to nature, and will be profitable to you, not hurtful. A man is called to let his light shine before men;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 5:16.</note> but he ought to understand better and better what medium it is thro&#x2019;, what retinas it falls on: wherefore look <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. I find in this as in the two other Speeches<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Phi Beta Kappa Oration</hi> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371208-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:361</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-12-08">8 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>) and <hi rend="italic">Dartmouth College Address;</hi> see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380925-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-09-25">25 Sept. 1838</date></ref>.</note> that noblest self-assertion, and believing originality, which is like sacred fire, the <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> of whatsoever is to flame and work; and for young men especially one sees not what could be more vivifying. Speak therefore, while you feel called to do it, and when you feel called. But for yourself, my friend, I prophecy it will not do always, a faculty is in you for a <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> of speech which is itself <hi rend="italic">action,</hi> an artistic sort. You <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> us with piercing emphasis that man&#x2019;s soul is great; <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> us a great soul of a man, in some work symbolic of such: this is the seal of such a message, and you will feel by and by that you are called to this. I long to see some concrete Thing, some Event, Man&#x2019;s Life, American Forest, or piece of Creation, which this Emerson loves and wonders at, well <hi rend="italic">Emersonised,</hi> depictured by Emerson, filled with the life of Emerson, and cast forth from him there to live by itself. If these Orations baulk me of this, how profitable soever they be for others, I will not love them.&#x2014; And yet what am I saying? How do I know what is good for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, what authentically makes your own heart glad to work in it? I speak from <hi rend="italic">without</hi>, the friendliest voice must speak from without; and a man&#x2019;s ultimate monition comes only from <hi rend="italic">within</hi>. <closer><salute>Forgive me, and love me, and write soon. <foreign><hi rend="italic">A Dieu!</hi></foreign></salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>My Wife, very proud of your salutation, sends a <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> return of greeting. After a winter of unusual strength, she took cold the other day, and coughs again; tho&#x2019; she will not call it serious yet. One likes none of these things. She has a brisk heart and a stout, but too weak a frame for this rough life of mine. I will not get sad about it.&#x2014;</p>
<p>One of the strangest things about these New England Orations is a fact I have heard but not yet seen, that a certain W. Gladstone, an Oxford crack scholar, Tory M.P. and devout Churchman of great talent and hope,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ewart Gladstone (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>), statesman.

Later he became a great Liberal prime minister.</note> has contrived to insert a piece of you (<hi rend="italic">first</hi> Orat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> it <pb id="pg-11-26" n="11:26"/>must be) in a work of his on &#x201C;Church and State,&#x201D; which makes some figure at present!<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Having read the <hi rend="italic">Phi Beta Kappa Oration</hi>, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June 1838</date>, Gladstone quoted four sentences in <hi rend="italic">The State in its Relations with the Church</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) 30.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have just returned home from a large breakfast-party all <supplied>[noisy]</supplied> with Political and other notabilities, my head and nerves considerably &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">dadded abreed</hi></foreign> [worn to pieces]&#x201D;; from which, however, I have realised you a frank, and now I must endeavour in such hasty fashion as I can to throw you a word of thanks for your long full Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> a most welcome messenger to me. It is the first word I have got out of Dumfriesshire since the great storm, which threatened to have laid you all in ruins; I had not heard of your little stranger at all, and of Mary&#x2019;s only by hint and implication.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both had daughters.</note> Happily I find you still all hanging together, and faring along better or worse in the old wholesome way. It is pity you are so harrassed with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign>, rioting round you in that way; otherwise it would not be such a job to write to me, and I should hear oftener. Nobody gives a more authentic account of all public and private things than you do; one sees that it is naked truth by the very face of it. I sent your Letter on to Jenny at Manchester; judging that she too was most probably labouring under dearth of news, and a frank would take your word along with mine without trouble. They had <pb id="pg-11-27" n="11:27"/>heard nothing from me, nor have I heard anything from them, since the morning I left their house for London.</p>
<p>Your account of Craigenputtoch shews us a scene of desolation, tho&#x2019; happily in the safe distance only, and capable of being clouted up again. Thank James very cordially for his trouble in that matter, and encourage him to persist in that charitable work. It is, I daresay, a luck, as you remark, that the woods were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> weeded last year; tho&#x2019; it will be very ruinous to leave them in their present state for another year. We are glad also to think of Corson inhabiting the poor mansion;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381211-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1838-12-11">11 Dec. 1838</date></ref>.</note> there will be <hi rend="italic">peats</hi> enough for him to keep out the damp with; and [corner of MS torn] to understand the necessity of <hi rend="italic">not corresponding</hi>. More than once I have consider<supplied>[ed with]</supplied> a sort of mischievous interest what a <hi rend="italic">swash</hi> that huge chimney would give <supplied>[in the]</supplied> dead of night as it came thwack down upon the rigging there;&#x2014;right happy <supplied>[there]</supplied> was nobody one cared for under it! James has taken the right way: to get a slater and stick in the blown slates, keeping out wet in the rough and ready way; the place is not worth, nor like to be worth, much trouble for us now. The bricks, I hope, are all piled up safe <hi rend="italic">on the ground</hi>, the chimney head consisting of a few courses only: let it stand in that state <hi rend="italic">till we want it again!</hi> Corson and the peats will make a brave shift; and Heaven go with him, honest man!</p>
<p>Most likely you have seen the Naples Letter I sent off to Ecclefechan rather before you wrote: if not, send for it; I need not write the news a second time. Jack was well and doing well, tho&#x2019; seemingly feeling Naples a little <hi rend="italic">tedious;</hi> that is the smallest fault one could expect such a place to have. Since that date I have had nothing from his side of the world; only I understand John Mill (the Westminster Editor an old associate of mine) to be at Naples now,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill was on medical leave of absence until <date when="1839-07-01">1 July</date>. He had left Paris with Harriet Taylor, <date when="1838-12-30">30 Dec. 1838</date>, travelling via Pisa and Rome to Naples by <date when="1839-02-00">Feb.</date>, there &#x201C;passing about three weeks pleasantly&#x201D; (Mineka 13:395). Although he and Harriet Taylor stayed at the same hotel at Naples, they were very discreet. In <date when="1839-03-00">March</date> he spent time with John Sterling in Rome without mentioning that she was with him.</note> and probably Jack&#x2019;s patient, certainly if there his visitor and comrade more or less. Mill has been getting more and more dyspeptical, nervous and unhealthy, for the last four years; till now the Doctors have ordered him abroad, a thing they usually do when they know not what farther to advise: he will be a kind of resource for Jack; being a good intelligent man, and disposed to like him well, tho&#x2019; otherwise he is not the most amusing of men.</p>
<p>Of our own household and procedure in it there is little new to be <pb id="pg-11-28" n="11:28"/>said except this that Jane, almost the very day I wrote, <hi rend="italic">took cold</hi>, for the first time this winter, and gave us a considerable alarm. She had overworked herself, making ready for her Mother, who is now here. For a day or two she had a tendency to cough considerably, and we did not like it; but she is now considerably better again, and indeed at this moment has decided on going out to the pavement of our sunny sheltered street, to enjoy the spring air a little;&#x2014;for it is about 2 o&#x2019;clock and we have a bright <date when="0000-02-00">February</date> blink of weather. Her Mother voted against such a step; but the female mind is obstinate, and I ventured to sanction it. This is not good news; but I hope the business is mostly over for this bout, and that nothing will come of it. Another piece of news, however, you will call decidedly good: it is, that on Monday gone a week there arrived an American Letter, announcing that our F. R<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was all sold off there two months ago, that our <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> volumes were at press, all in order; and enclosing&#x2014;what think you&#x2014;a draft for &#xa3;100 as clear profit on our Revolution book! Is not that brave work? &#xa3;150 in all from that farther side of the ocean; not a copper as yet realised in one&#x2019;s own country. I have written to say that I never had money I was prouder of than that American money, sent me one might say almost by miracle. I shewed the thing to Fraser, and told him I hoped he would blush very deep. The poor creature did blush: but what could that serve? He has done with his Edition too all but 75 copies, he said: above &#xa3;1,000 have been gathered from England for that book, but none seems to belong to the writer, it all belongs to other people? The sharks! But we will try them on a new tack with the second edition. They charge above 40 per cent, I find, for the <supplied>[mere]</supplied> function of <hi rend="italic">selling</hi> a book, the mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] of handing it over the counter: ask Jam<supplied>[es if]</supplied> he ever heard of such a thing in Commerce. It is a thing which must be altered; <supplied>[and]</supplied> I if I can, ought to begin altering. We shall see.&#x2014; For the rest, I am writing nothing but reading, reading. I was obliged to fling the Westminster substitute of Mill off to a certain distance from me: he is an Aberdeen Scotchman, a good kind of fellow, but rough and rude as an Ass in <foreign><hi rend="italic">rashy-rope</hi></foreign> [rope made of twisted rushes]; you cannot do with the like of him,&#x2014; unless bound to it by dire Necessity worse than the slavery of Algiers. Thank Heaven, I am no longer in that fearful case; but can take my breath a moment, and write or not write.&#x2014; If I had a <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi> somewhat better, we should be all right. But alas, the stomach will just stay as it is, and one must struggle on with it. I do think however of getting me a little <hi rend="italic">horse-exercise</hi> this spring, especially if I lecture, which seems the likeliest of the two ways.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-29" n="11:29"/>I rejoice from my heart that James finds his accounts point the right way; that he is able to pick his steps, and make progress in that confused system of affairs, where so many can only run to wreck. It is manfully done, and a great triumph. Let him persist and prosper more and more. I know no prosperity better than that kind of it; no course of life, among all the courses I have seen, that is more desirable for a wise man. Be wise and faithful, both of you; there is no fear of you, I think.&#x2014; It often causes me regret that poor Austin and Mary cannot get a little farm they could live in. I have a great confidence they could do well if they were fairly tried. Will you explain to Austin, if he still do not understand it, that he is to please <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> in getting of a farm; that if he could find one to his own mind, Jack and I would be very happy to help in setting him into it. I suppose they are difficult to find; difficult, but not impossible surely. Mrs Welsh had a notion of getting them to Templand if she took a new lease of that: it would be a very snug place; but it is almost two years off yet, and very uncertain-looking as yet. Let them do their best: we will hope a good issue, one way or another.&#x2014; People have been here interrupting me, my paper too is done, for that double letter of Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s consumes my ounce. You can send it by Watson<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Watson, carrier from Dumfries to Thornhill and Sanquhar.</note> on Saturday, I think. Before long I will write again to my Mother or Alick: I had a Newspaper from <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, but no written word yet. Poor Isabella I hope is getting better; it is an uncomfortable Scotsbrig doubtless till then: but one must be patient. Give my affection to all; Jane bids me say she would write to you were the cold gone. Take care of the young woman, and be good <supplied>[to her.]</supplied> Send my dear Mother word of me. God bless you all!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Eve<supplied>[r your affe]</supplied>ctionate&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x2014;</salute> &#x2026; As for the question of Autobiography, I think you have yourself put it on the right footing; and anything I have to say can only be confirmatory of what is already your own view. Autobiography, if well done, is the most universally interesting of all things; any man&#x2019;s life will interest us if he tell it with insight, with candour and simplicity, without self-conceit; in a word, wisely and not foolishly. A man, moreover, who has cut his way from a jungle of confusions, in which he first found himself imprisoned and bewildered, he is precisely the man we wish to hear on such a matter.</p>
<p>As to the time when, this is as you rightly feel a question of circumstances; not to be decided absolutely, but by judicious appreciation of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pro</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">contra</hi></foreign>. At a later age one&#x2019;s view is clearer, as you say, but then one&#x2019;s interest is faded, perhaps altogether gone. Benvenuto Cellini says, &#x201C;Every man who has accomplished aught virtuous or resembling virtue ought to write his own life; but not to begin so fine an enterprise <hi rend="italic">till he be past forty&#x201D;:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See the opening sentence of <hi rend="italic">The Life of Benvenuto Cellini written by himself,</hi> trans. Thomas Nugent (London, <date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>); also cited by TC in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, &#x201C;Goethe&#x2019;s Works&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:403).</note> this is Cellini&#x2019;s judgement, which however is binding upon nobody. I should say rather, &#x201C;Let him not begin so fine an enterprise till he <hi rend="italic">feel that he is ready for it</hi>.&#x201D; A man, I think, is <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> to write on a thing when he perceives that he has got above it, that he has shaken it off from him, and can survey it without egoism, spleen, exaggeration, or other perversion; for bad writing, what is it in any case but untrue writing, a writing of the thing which is not,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Swift, <hi rend="italic">Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</hi> bk. 4.</note> painting <pb id="pg-11-33" n="11:33"/>of a picture which resembles not God&#x2019;s Truth and Reality but our own poor Falsehood and Hallucination? Stupid writing there is too, which does not even resemble a Hallucination but only a Stupidity and Bungling; like a canvas covered with lampblack and water; most melancholy: of that we speak not.&#x2014; I say therefore, when one sees the thing as it is, feels that one has got <hi rend="italic">it</hi> under his eye, then one can speak of it, on due impulse. For the rest, on this as in all other questions I have the greatest faith in a genuine instinctive desire. What you do in sincerity wish to attempt, what your heart will be glad in performing, that attempt to perform, then and there. Only be careful to ascertain that it is a sincere internal wish, not a superficial extrinsic one, for great errors are made on that head! Johnson used to say, &#x201C;Read the book you wish at the time you wish it; the effect it produces is deepest then.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> 303&#x2013;4.</note> I apply this rule to almost all things,&#x2014;to Autobiography and your case; and find few rules so good, if one apply it honestly.</p>
<p>Thus my advice, you perceive, is mainly that you well advise with yourself. At all events, why not <hi rend="italic">try</hi> the undertaking; you will then see best of all whether you have a call to it. The written record can at least do no ill, to yourself it will infallibly do good; and though written, it need not be printed till you see cause otherwise. Nay I think at any rate it will do you no good to have the public much in your eye in writing such a thing; write what seems lucid, beautiful or significant to your own mind, and believe always that the public will adjust itself to that, or at worst that you can do nothing else for the public. Life in Paisley, in the workshops, at the firesides of the poor, this ought to be fully given; as a thing little known to readers, and a thing well deserving to be known&#x2014;perhaps of all others the most important thing in these days: and as for your own feeling about it, I greatly mistake you if those young Scottish years, with their thrift and rigour and necessitous affection and endeavour, are not the dearest to your heart of all you have seen or hope to see. Let a man &#x201C;stand always by his own order,&#x201D; I say! It is the oldest order of all; and derives <hi rend="italic">its</hi> patent, as a great member of it said, &#x201C;direct from Almighty God.&#x201D;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We are very unlucky in meeting. I did not go out yesterday till near 3 o&#x2019;clock; but of course had despaired of you a good while before that. Generally I am at home till two; you shall be right welcome to me any morning when you can get so far.</p>
<p>With regard to the Copyright Bill,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The copyright bill, to extend copyright to sixty years from the date of publication, was first introduced by Talfourd, <date when="1837-05-18">18 May 1837</date>, and reintroduced by him in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, and <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. Hume, Grote, Molesworth, and Macaulay all opposed it until Macaulay produced a compromise bill in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. Passed on <date when="1842-07-01">1 July 1842</date>, it extended the period of copyright to include the author&#x2019;s life plus seven years, or forty-two years from publication, whichever was longer. It remained in force until <date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>.</note> I will desire you to assure Sergeant Talfourd,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Noon Talfourd (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:262</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></corr></ref>), M.P. for Reading, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>.</note> if he yet need assurance, that no person more heartily or gratefully approves of his exertions in that matter than I; or would, as in duty bound, be readier to do any thing and all things that could forward it. But as to Petitioning in my own name, it does appear to me, after all the consideration I can give it, that neither my age, my position nor pretensions could authorize such a step on my part. <pb id="pg-11-35" n="11:35"/>Ridicule, it seems to me, and the general inquiry, Who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> this pretentious &#x201C;Single Person&#x201D;? would be the too probable result. It is indeed a tragical enough sort of game I play, and have played, with the world; no other than this: &#x201C;O world, I will say something thou shalt listen to perhaps, some day, in spite of thy teeth; or be starved to death for it.&#x201D; Rather a tragical game; but one which any <hi rend="italic">description</hi> of, to Parliament or others, would tend much to render farcical. Do you not think so, looking at it under the light of prose and reality?</p>
<p>My notion therefore decidedly is that our brave Sergeant ought to stand by Wordsworth, Southey and the other acknowledged <foreign><hi rend="italic">Patres Conscripti</hi></foreign> [Senators];<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Talfourd in his speech to the House, <date when="1839-02-27">27 Feb.</date>, mentioned several distinguished petitioners, David Brewster, Archibald Alison, etc., and quoted Southey &#x201C;who has thought the statement of his case might have more effect than a petition&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hansard,</hi> 3d ser. 45 [<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>]: 919&#x2013;33).</note> carefully excluding any meaner sort of man, whose appearance in the cause could only weaken and deface the impression of those reverend veterans. I heard an Official person, the other night, speaking with a kind of awe, and tone of solemnity, of &#x201C;having seen the Petition of William Wordsworth.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wordsworth had been campaigning for a copyright bill since <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, but this was his first petition. Talfourd quoted extensively from &#x201C;your veteran petitioner Wordsworth&#x201D;; for example, &#x201C;this bill has for its main object to relieve men of letters from the thraldom of being forced to court the living generation, to aid them in rising above slavish taste and degraded prejudice, and to encourage them to rely on their own impulses.&#x201D;</note> It is better to keep by that, and &#x201C;say ditto to Mr Burke&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Said after one of &#x201C;Mr. Burke&#x2019;s eloquent harangues&#x201D; at an election by the American Henry Cruger (<date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), Edmund Burke&#x2019;s fellow member for Bristol, <date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>&#x2013;<date when="1780-00-00">80</date> (James Prior, <hi rend="italic">Life of Burke</hi> [London, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>] 181).</note> is it not?</p>
<p>As for me, all the opinion I have on the subject, and the only Petition I would rationally set forth, is embodied (I believe) in that atrabilical cynical Utterance which I sent the Sergeant last summer,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> as I think I mentioned to you when we met. If Mr Talfourd still have that, it really contains all I have to say. You may print it in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> and indicate in any fit way, whose it is if you like: it really is my whole judgement, and in as fit a dialect as I could put it into; the promulgating of this, which I do not recommend, but also as you see do not prohibit, were really the producing of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the effect I could pretend to, in or out of Parliament, on this business.</p>
<p>I write this Note, in case you do not come, which in spite of Mr Hunt&#x2019;s message I doubt is not likely today. I want to see you otherwise about that poor &#x201C;Library&#x201D; which I am afraid is like to stick forever on the stocks, unless you can give it a shove, and launch it. Once fairly floating in the water, I should have good hopes of it; but there it sticks <pb id="pg-11-36" n="11:36"/>for the present, motionless, or moving at the rate of an inch in the week.</p>
<p>Have you in any of your Books a Narrative of Jenny Geddes&#x2019;s &#x201C;Flinging of the Stool&#x201D; at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on the <date when="1637-07-23">23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of July 1637</date>, with her, &#x201C;Out thou foul thief!

There is no contemporary evidence for the story. For TC&#x2019;s note covering the same ground as this passage, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:96&#x2013;97.

The twirl of her stool, what a stroke was that! The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> stroke in an infinite bout of single-stick, broad-sword, artillery, Pulpit, Parliament and other tongue-fence and hand-fence; one of the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> strokes of which was struck in front of Whitehall by the axe of a man in mask!&#x2014; Yet Jenny remains unsung; only Burns named a riding mare after her.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the execution of Charles I.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Let it by all means be <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you quit London! Where we may be when you come back, is known only to the Fates. I now find we are here on Tuesday evening, and also Wednesday evening;&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> not to Sumner! There is a choice in men and Americans: all men are not equally washy and dreary and benevolent&#x2014;thank Heaven!</p>
<p>My Brother is in Liverpool; the letters from home are a hard stroke today, in the confusion I am otherwise in.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am right glad to have this opportunity for writing to you again. It is a weary time since I heard a word from yourself now,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had not yet received MAC and AC to TC, [<date when="1839-03-06">6 March</date>].</note> a long time since I even wrote anything direct to you: of late days I have been of mind to write a line to you even without any Italian news to go along with it; but here this morning comes the expected Epistle from Naples,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> and now I have a call and command to write. How have you been all this time? What are you doing; what becomes of you in this bitter March weather; what is all Scotsbrig and Annandale doing? These are questions which daily arise; but to which I can shape no answer except by hope and by guess. Many a time does the shine of your little up-stairs Fire in the winter night rise clear before my imagination, among the little specks of Light and Life (the dearest of them all to me) that the great canopy of Darkness covers; and I wonder with myself what you are doing even then. I can know only that both of us are under One&#x2019;s keeping, and trust always that He will do all things well. But really, dear Mother, you must write to me, write without loss of time.</p>
<p>I sent a Letter to Mary,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> in which was one inclosed for Alick. There had been a Letter for Jean before that, in answer to one she had sent me; the only articulate tidings I have had for months. Mary sends a Newspaper to indicate that her Letter arrived; which is good so far. I wrote also to Jenny at Manchester; but from her too I receive nothing for a long while.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s situation at Naples seems to be altogether favourable. He prospers in his work; he likes the people, they like him. I think I mentioned to Alick, in writing last,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in the letter enclosed with Mary&#x2019;s, written <date when="1839-02-25">25 Feb.</date>, when TC dined with the Barings.</note> that we had tidings here (thro&#x2019; the Sterlings, who probably had it from Dr Hume the Physician that recommended Jack) of all going right in that matter of Naples, how the Duke&#x2019;s people were well satisfied with their Doctor, &#x26;c &#x26;c. In short, we have every reason to be content in respect of our poor wandering Doil, and to hope that all is proceeding in a very good course for him. He gets no Dumfries Papers, it seems, tho&#x2019; I have duly despatched a <pb id="pg-11-39" n="11:39"/><hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> weekly, ever since it ceased to come to you; some eight or nine now, I think I will write to him tomorrow, however; all the faster for that disappointment. It is a long way to come and go, and no delay should be made. Did Alick ever write yet? I fear, not. Tell him that he is a lazy fellow to all appearance, and that I mean to have my revenge of him yet.</p>
<p>Jane had a cold last time I wrote, but it is gone now, and she is not unwell at all considering what weather we have. This week past it has been bitterer with frost snow and east-wind than we ever had it in winter; and today still the world is all lying white in a coat of snow, and the venom not out of the air yet. How do you <foreign><hi rend="italic">fend</hi></foreign> [manage], dear Mother, in your still worse climate? Did you ever get yourself a set of right woollen spencers? I hold good &#x201C;fleecy-hosiery&#x201D; to be one of the wholesomest things; one way or other one should <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> on being warm enough, and not rest till that is attained. Jane complains continually in these days of the bitter cold; her Mother and she sit down below, blowing the fire, endeavouring to fence themselves against the inclement season, and rarely venture out. Mrs Welsh had a bad cold for three weeks, but in spite of the weather she is nearly got out of that again. She seems to indicate that she is not to stay long with us; her Brother is poorly in health at Liverpool, she wishes to be there again that she might be of some help to him. Hitherto she has taken far more quietly to London than on any other occasion, and seemed to enjoy it more,&#x2014;or if that is too strong a word, to suffer from it less. We are very quiet in general; yet the other week, Jane audaciously got up a thing called <foreign><hi rend="italic">soiree</hi></foreign> one evening; that is to say a Party of Persons who have little to do except wander thro&#x2019; a room or rooms, and hustle and simmer about, all talking to one another as they best can. It seemed to me a most questionable thing for the <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi> this; however she was drawn into it insensibly, could not get retracted: so it took effect; between 20 and 30 entirely brilliant bits of figures;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;personnages&#x201D; above &#x201C;figures.&#x201D;</note> and really it all went off in the most successful manner: at midnight I smoked a peaceable pipe, praying that it might be long before we saw the like again.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently the only <foreign>soir&#xE9;e</foreign> of the kind ever given by the Carlyles, held on a Thurs., probably <date when="1839-02-21">21 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390216-JWC-FW-01">JWC to FW, <date when="1839-02-16">16 Feb.</date></ref> For TC&#x2019;s later description, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 167&#x2013;68.</note> There is enough of that at this season without seeking for it; enough and to spare. That day I wrote to Alick I was bound outwards to dine at 8 o&#x2019;clock (the real hour was nearer 9), and wrote to him in doleful humour on that account. For the same reason too I forgot your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, which I had carefully folded up and laid under a big Book <pb id="pg-11-40" n="11:40"/>to smooth it; on Thursday morning, lifting the Book, I was astonished and shocked to find the Examiner still there! I doubt you would be astonished too why it did not come. As for the Dinner itself I got thro&#x2019; it, tho&#x2019; not without damage sensible for several days after. It was one of the most elevated things I had ever seen; Lords, Ladyships and other the like high personnages, several of them auditors of mine in the last Lecturing season. The Lady of the House, one Lady Harriet Baring, I had to sit and talk with specially for a long long while; one of the cleverest creatures I have met with, full of mirth and spirit,&#x2014; not very beautiful to look upon.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the first meetings between TC and Lady Harriet Baring (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>). In <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date> she had m. William Bingham Baring (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), 2d Baron Ashburton from <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>. TC did not become a frequent guest at the Barings&#x2019; London home, Bath House, Piccadilly, until <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. Later he and JWC would visit the Barings as part of a company of distinguished guests in the literary, political, and religious world at their country homes: Addiscombe, their nearby Surrey villa; Bay House, nr. Alverstoke; and The Grange, in Hampshire, nr. Winchester. TC greatly admired both Ashburtons, the nature of his regard for Lady Ashburton having been the subject of considerable debate. It is enough, for the moment, to say that his admiration for her was deep and genuine and that it seems to have caused JWC much pain.</note> Between 12 and 1 I got home to my bed. There is but little good for me in all that; only a small proportion of good rather expensively purchased; wherefore I endeavour to escape it for most part.</p>
<p>They told you, I have no doubt, how my brave American Friends had sent me another lot of money (&#xa3;100) for the poor Revolution Book. It was really a magnanimous feat. Fraser tells me he too has money for me which he hopes &#x201C;will be satisfactory&#x201D;; we shall see that, before long, for I understand him to be getting ready his books for a settlement with me; being very desirous for a <hi rend="italic">second edition</hi> with me, which will be needed soon. The &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; we hope will be here before long, probably in a month or so (tho&#x2019; that is merely guessing): I imagine I shall make a little penny out of them too, by and by. One ought to be thankful for keeping <foreign><hi rend="italic">mall in shaft</hi></foreign><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18290305-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:9</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1829-03-05">5 March 1829</date></corr></ref>.</note> on any terms.&#x2014; But now the grand object of consideration is, what are <hi rend="italic">the Lectures</hi> to be, and when and how? I cannot yet say <hi rend="italic">what</hi>, but I am thinking of it daily; I have decided meanwhile that there are to be but six, this year; it seems also that the best time for commencing will be <date when="1839-04-23">Tuesday April 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi></date>; for three weeks after that, I shall probably be busy! So soon as I have drawn up any Prospectus and got it printed, I will send you a copy,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; you cannot attend me, I doubt! On the whole, I am not nearly in such a flutter about the thing, as I was in last year; thro&#x2019; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] probably it will be bad enough when it actually arrives. However, <pb id="pg-11-41" n="11:41"/>we do hope to be borne thro&#x2019; as before &#x201C;with an honourable through-bearing.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351026-JWC-TC-01"><sic>8:243</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1835-10-26">26 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I would ask innumerable things about you, about Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan, Dumfries, Annan, and Annandale generally; I want to know so many things, and do know almost nothing of it all. How is poor Isabella? I hope, she has got on her feet again; it will have improved Scotsbrig and its business for all of you.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella had still not recovered from the birth of her son Tom. <date when="1838-11-00">Nov. 1838</date>, though by <date when="1839-03-00">March</date> she could &#x201C;stir a little out on fine days&#x201D; (AC, [<date when="1839-03-06">6 March</date>]).</note> And Jamie, how does he find his crop turn out, how does he get along this winter generally? I have no tidings from Alick either; how his meal-trade and other business prosper. Had not his Jenny too to be <hi rend="italic">unwell?</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken Carlyle (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924-00-00">1924</date>) had been b. <date when="1839-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, &#x201C;a fine thriving little fellow.&#x201D;</note> I hope she too will be borne thro&#x2019; honourably.</p>
<p>A man came in (from Dumfries with a Letter of introduction from M&#x2019;Diarmid, a very good kind of young man, named Pagan);<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the son of William Pagan, gentleman, of Carriestanes, Dumfries.</note> he has taken up all my time, and put all my ideas to flight. You must take this scrawl as the best I can afford.&#x2014; Remember me at Dumfries; say I expect Jean still to stand true, as one of the best strings of my bow in that matter of sending news.</p>
<p>Jane has been out a little while, and is come in again, complaining of the damp cold. She sends her love to you all; but I hear no tidings of any letter yet: I suppose her ideas are quite frozen up at present. I beg you, dear Mother, to take all care of yourself. Alas, I wish I could do you any good, be of any service to you; but I am far off and can do nothing. All I can or could do is always richly due to you.&#x2014; Mrs Welsh will be for seeing you when once she gets to Templand; but that, I fancy, is a little way off yet. Good b&#x2019;ye My dear Mother for this time. You will hear from me again before long. I commit you all to the Good Guardian; praying and wishing from the bottom of my heart that a blessing may be on you all.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter of the <date when="1839-02-21">21st Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> is at Scotsbrig, I hope, this morning. It came here on Friday last, after being long looked for; and was despatched to be franked that same evening. I have lost no time in responding: it seems there are only two post-days for Naples weekly, one on Tuesday, one on Friday, so that this cannot go till tomorrow night (if my Postman was <hi rend="italic">correct</hi>; however, I will ask at Charing Cross today): I write in any case to save whatever chance there may be. We are too far apart to loiter; the <hi rend="italic">overlapping</hi> system does not suit, and almost five weeks have to intervene on the other plan, let us be as speedy as we will. What a pity your Newspapers do not come! I have sent one off duly every week since you first spoke of it, directed &#x201C;Duke of Buccleuch&#x2019;s, Naples&#x201D; in the legiblest hand I could write; on Friday last I put the address of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> h&#xF4;tel on the cover (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Satuario</hi>,&#x201D; or what is it?); and shall continue to send you a <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, received or not received, till you write again about it. I think there have some ten or nine gone now. No Italian Newspaper has got hither since you left us.</p>
<p>Alick, it seems, wrote to you from Ecclefechan about a month ago; you probably have his Letter safe before now some ten days. I had not heard from them here for a long while, and was getting impatient: but the very night your Letter had left me while it was not yet out of London, I received a considerable sheet from our Mother and Alick; bringing up the news to the middle of last week. Alick&#x2019;s Jenny has a new son, whom they have named &#x201C;John Aitken Carlyle&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1924-00-00">1924</date>); became a carpenter after leaving Alick&#x2019;s farm in Canada; m. Helen MacVicar (d. <date when="1927-00-00">1927</date>), sister of his brother Thomas&#x2019;s wife and of his brother Alexander&#x2019;s 2d wife.</note> in honour of a certain Doctor in foreign parts; both Jean and Mary had already had daughters; Isabella is still very weakly, and Jamie has been obliged to get a nurse for the infant, but they say she is now able to stir out a little, and seems to be in the way of improvement. Poor Jamie must have had a heavy time of it all this winter. Our good Mother writes in a cheery spirit as she always strives to do; she has had cold and tooth-ache, and does not appear to be entirely right yet, tho&#x2019; she professes to be nearly so. Alick had got her a barrel of ale; or rather her and himself. There had been no settlement effected yet as to rents, beyond <pb id="pg-11-43" n="11:43"/>what took place in your time; but Dillick professes that all is now in readiness for one, or very nearly so. James Austin had better employment than usual this winter. The whole country seems to be in great dearth, poverty and distress. Alick does not say how he has prospered with his meal speculation or indeed whether he ever yet entered upon it; he signifies that his business is enlarging rather than falling off, but that his customers generally are near starvation. Poor wretches! There is a fearful problem to be solved in that North country; the North presses on towards a solution faster than even the South, and what will come of it God alone knows. The Northern Operatives generally are understood to be getting arms, pikes, pistols and muskets; they have a &#x201C;Convention&#x201D; sitting here somewhere in Fleet-Street at present (Douglas, once of Dumfries, is Birmingham member); they have turned tail on the Corn Law, of which accordingly it appears nothing at all will be made this year: their loaf is dear, their heart bitter, their head hot and dark; may Heaven pity them!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The People&#x2019;s Charter had been pbd. on <date when="1838-05-08">8 May 1838</date>, and the Birmingham Political Union&#x2019;s national petition, drafted by R. K. Douglas (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320114-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:93</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1832-01-14">14 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>), on <date when="1838-05-21">21 May 1838</date>. A great rally at Birmingham, <date when="1838-08-06">6 Aug. 1838</date>, was a significant step in the concentration of working-class discontent with and hope for the Chartist movement. At this meeting Feargus O&#x2019;Connor first introduced the idea of &#x201C;physical force&#x201D; in Chartism. For the next six months mass meetings were held all over the country to adopt the petition and charter and to select delegates for a national convention. Advocacy of violence increased, particularly in the north of England, fostered by O&#x2019;Connor and J. R. Stephens. Stephens was arrested and released on bail in <date when="1838-12-00">Dec. 1838</date>, was tried and sentenced in <date when="1839-08-00">Aug.</date> Differences with the more moderate Chartists of Birmingham and London were clear. The General Convention of the Industrious Classes had begun in London, <date when="1839-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, with Douglas as first chairman, in the same week as the opening of the new session of parliament and of the Anti-Corn Law Conference. Its meetings were held at Bolt Court, Fleet St. It was unanimous in rejecting the Anti-Corn Law movement, if in little else. Its more violent speakers led to a withdrawal of some moderates in <date when="1839-03-00">late March</date>; it was to back the right of the people to bear arms in <date when="1839-04-00">April</date>; and the convention moved to Birmingham, <date when="1839-05-00">May</date> to <date when="1839-07-00">July</date>.</note>&#x2014; I believe the Parliament to be dull as ditch water this season too, when all the world expected it was to shew violence of some kind: I read none of their debates, and hear as little of the whole thing as possible. Pray tell me what Newspapers you do get in Naples (I mean, the Duke gets). Talfourd&#x2019;s speech on his Copyright Bill, a Bill of uncertain fate as yet, is the only one I have had even an abstract of this winter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390227-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1839-02-27">27 Feb.</date></ref></note> Let us quit the Public, take to the Private</p>
<p>Our Mother and the rest had been very impatient for your last letter as well as we: it will give them all great pleasure by the good news it brings. Your situation seems altogether to improve, to be in fact a very eligible one. A certain air of domesticity breathes out of <pb id="pg-11-44" n="11:44"/>that household, such as we could never trace in the Clare one; the old Earl and you over your tumbler of whisky-punch, with narrative of hare-hunts and moving passages by flood and field, has a quite pleasant air; the Duke reading his chapter is also very good. Continue to stand peacably and steadfastly to your post there, and it will do excellently well; in itself a good thing, and perhaps the beginning of other good things. I can hear no word of Lady Clare; her not writing is no good sign. I inquired for her one night, but found I had applied to the wrong quarter, the Lady (Lady Harriet Baring) being, as it seemed to turn out by and by, the Niece of her <hi rend="italic">husband!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fitzgibbon, 2d Earl of Clare (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-TC-AC-01"><sic>5:343</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>), had separated from Lady Clare in <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date> after three years of marriage. Lady Harriet Baring, the eldest da. of George, 6th Earl of Sandwich, and Louisa, da. of 1st Earl of Belmore, had extensive connections with Irish, Scottish, and English aristocracy, but no relationship to John Fitzgibbon has been traced.</note> She had been in Italy and Rome while you were there, but &#x201C;did not see <hi rend="italic">her</hi> then&#x201D;; understood now that she was &#x201C;gone somewhere, in bad health.&#x201D; Sterling talks occasionally of seeing &#x201C;the Earl of Clare, a devilish good fellow.&#x201D; I suppose, on the whole, her poor Ladyship is in a feeble way, but not materially worse, or one would hear of it.

The truth is, I thought it a risk and rash, but she would go, partly for her mother&#x2019;s sake. She is not strong, but much stronger than last year; she had a kind of cold for a few days last month, but it soon went, and it has hitherto been all. Mrs Welsh has also had a cold almost ever since she came; but this too in spite of the bitter frost and eastwind, is nearly gone. She does not get on so badly here this time as heretofore. Yet I think she will not stay long; but probably return to Liverpool, where her brother is not in a very good way, having lost his Partner too, soon after the loss of his wife.<note n="27" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Welsh had d. in <date when="1838-10-00">Oct.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-11-00">Nov. 1838</date>, and James Leishman in <date when="1839-01-00">Jan.</date></note> Alas my dear Brother this sheet is done!

<ps><p>Jane gave a <foreign>soiree</foreign>, no less, two weeks ago; an actual <foreign>soiree</foreign>! She is complaining of headache today; or she would have told you how brilliant it was, in spite of Darwin&#x2019;s prophetic banter and mine.

It is a mad and unhappy business that; one cannot see any reason in it at all, or even any right unreason: for I do believe the whole thing is strictly Platonic still! You, so far as you may be concerned in it, will act as you find suitablest; if called at all to act. For me I have never whispered to Mill anything about it; I have had no call to go minutely into that or other affairs of his: if you see the lady herself, you will find her very clever, <pb id="pg-11-50" n="11:50"/>but not at all attractive as I judge; a most morbid piece of brilliancy. Poor Mill! if you can in any way do anything for him, it will be right well to do it. He is one of the most transparent, most honest of men, according to his insight. But his position too, seemingly so favourable to him, is too hard for him!

<p>Our Library is not desperate, yet it does not get on like conflagration either. We had a meeting last week; finally settled our scheme, and agreed to persevere. This Foster is likely to be useful in that, with his zeal, with his Newspaper machinery. It was that that brought him hither first.</p>

L. Craik, at about this time. Of a meeting on <date when="1839-03-04">4 March</date>, he writes: &#x201C;A little before seven Craike [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and I set out to visit Carlyle. &#x2026; Found Carlyle at his <foreign>siesta</foreign> in a <hi rend="italic">house</hi> dress of striped plaid from head to foot, the surcoat being in the form of a long dressing gown. His wife and her mother joined us almost immediately and we had tea and much interesting talk. He is a very extraordinary personage, full of originality and genius, with profound reaches of thought which sometimes seem to sound the innermost depths of our nature, but almost always lost themselves among its mysteries, from a defect, I think, in the very highest powers of imagination. He has what Coleridge wanted, great power of concentration and <hi rend="italic">vigour</hi> of <hi rend="italic">talent;</hi> but on the other hand he wants what Coleridge had beyond all other men, the plastic power which gave form and consistency to his most etherial speculations and subordinated the various and wonderful operations and speculations of his understanding and reason. The two men blended would have made the most perfect Philosopher that ever lived. One singular defect in Carlyle&#x2019;s mind has obtruded itself on my attention every time I have met him&#x2014;<foreign>viz.</foreign> the entire want of all perception of grace and beauty in outward form or expression, and a consequent disbelief in the existence of a &#x2018;seat of grace within the mind&#x2019;. &#x2026; But apart from this I hold Carlyle to be one of the most wonderful men of his day. He is evidently not happy however. His speculations have not led him to any firm ground and his immortal longings and high aspirations are dashed and thwarted by the vain struggle he is always making to solve the riddle of the world&#x2014;&#x2018;the hidden mystery,&#x2019; the discovery of which is to make its agonies and miseries, its glories and promises, its capabilities and disappointments intelligible and consistent. This knot his power cannot untie and he gnaws at it, gnashes his teeth, and feels tempted to &#x2018;curse God and die.&#x2019; So at least it seems to me. His powers are not in harmony with each other. This however does not always appear outwardly, and of course there are times when he forgets or passes by the darker regions of speculation &#x2018;on fate, freewill, foreknowledge absolute.&#x2019; This evening, for instance, we had much delightful talk, intermingled with bursts of laughter which made his lungs crow like chanticleer. He gave us, among other things, a very graphic and even terrible account of the life of &#x2018;a poor player&#x2019; a being who lived upon the shouts and applauses of the multitude, and glare of excitement and noise, who having nothing else to fall back upon when that miserable <foreign>pabulum</foreign> grew scarce and was gradually withdrawn, was left shivering and naked in utter darkness and lonliness [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to stagger to the fag end of his existence, with no corner or refuge to fly to but the brandy-bottle.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>The Letter from Jack was out of my hand to be franked, but not gone out of London, when yours and our Mother&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1839-03-06">6 March</date>.</note> arrived here greatly to my satisfaction by the evening Mail,&#x2014;for we have two Mails daily from the North now, thanks to the railway. I hope my Mother&#x2019;s cold is not aggravated by this frightful weather we have had; I am sorry she had such a thing for such a time. Encourage her to be careful; <pb id="pg-11-52" n="11:52"/>thanks for getting the <hi rend="italic">ale;</hi> I hope you will not let her want for that, so long as she likes it at all. I must also bid you congratulate Jenny, and offer my respects to the young John A. Carlyle! Good speed to them all, poor creatures.&#x2014; You do not tell me anything about your meal speculations, or whether you have had any such this winter. I desire to know all that you are busy with, and your outlooks whatsoever they are.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had said: &#x201C;Selling more, I believe, than when I last wrote, yet still far from having a proper sort of customers&#x2014;the main bulk of them being on the very point of starvation&#x2014;needy and greedy beyond conception.&#x201D; He had difficulty collecting the rents of Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s houses in Ecclefechan because &#x201C;the creatures are poorer than they ever before were. &#x2026; The very picture of starvation, in short looking out of them.&#x201D; About a farm for the Austins he said: &#x201C;I believe at bottom James &#x26; I are accused (unjustly) of negligence in this matter.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>In consequence of what you said, I have applied to Mr Elliot (that is his name) the Government Agent, on the Australia business for the Eaglesfield Emigrant.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Elliott was from Eaglesfield, a village ca. three mi. from Ecclefechan. Remembering that TC knew T. F. Elliot, the govt. agent, Alick had asked on G. Elliott&#x2019;s behalf for &#x201C;authentic information &#x2026; and assistance if possible. &#x2026; Poor Geordie seems much reduced and has moreover procured himself some sort of wife and a child or two, to increase his embarassment.&#x201D;</note> That small Note for George Elliott with the Printed Paper will show him what the answer was. For your own perusal I send you the original itself; which you need not shew to Geordie except need be: but it will enable you to instruct him if he is still dark about anything. A Letter will be written to him, from Greennock [<hi rend="italic">sic:</hi> Greenock] probably (if &#x201C;Eaglesfield&#x201D; is not his address still, he must mention it to the Postmaster); he will likely get a free passage (which is a very desirable advantage every way), but must not make himself sure of one till he see.&#x2014; I think Australia will do very well for Elliott and that he has every chance to better his situation by going thither. It seems a good scheme for him. But it is of no service to incur the responsibility of <hi rend="italic">advising</hi> him to go; let him take his own judgement as the adventure is his own. I have accordingly written to him in a cautious strain; as the &#x201C;Agent General&#x201D; prescribes to me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Frederick Elliot (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380618-TC-JOST-01">TC to <sic>JCA</sic><corr>JOST</corr>, [<date when="1838-06-18">18 June 1838</date>]</ref>) was responsible as agent gen. for coordinating the administration of assisted emigration. He and his agents supervised shipping arrangements, attempted to ensure the safety and health of emigrants on voyages, and provided information about assisted emigration. Total departures for Australia had risen from 3,124 in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> to 15,786 in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, and emigrants to New South Wales alone had risen from 1,721 in <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> to 10,549 in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> (see Peter Burroughs, <hi rend="italic">Britain and Australia, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date></hi> [London, <date when="1967-00-00">1967</date>] 384&#x2013;85). TC was also friendly with such parliamentary radical supporters of further assisted emigration as Buller and Molesworth (see also <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:10&#x2013;11</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>).</note> Your task in it is merely to convey the Note and the Printed Paper to Geordie without delay, and give him afterwards any interpretation and explanation you can which he may heed, if he need any.</p>

He is one of my Lecture people, and likes me very well. The &#x201C;creation&#x201D; he talks of in his postscript is a grand musical performance, which I am to be at on Friday night; the Wilsons had got tickets for Jane and me both, but Jane declines, on account of the hot crowd and the cold weather. I was there once already: above 3,000 people, and some 500 musical performers!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Sacred Harmonic Society, founded <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, gave regular performances of choral works in Exeter Hall, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>. TC had probably heard Mendelssohn&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">St. Paul</hi> on <date when="1839-03-01">1 March</date>. &#x201C;Not a single unoccupied seat in the great room &#x2026; and one continuous mass of heads. &#x2026; The performers were about 500 in number, and &#x2026; the choruses &#x2026; sang with their usual precision and power&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-03-04">4 March</date>). The &#x201C;Creation&#x201D; was presumably Haydn&#x2019;s oratorio (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>), to be sung on <date when="1839-03-15">15 March</date>.</note> You never heard anywhere such a tempest of music. I do not count on going a third time.</p>
<p>Tonight I am to be at Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s hearing him read a new Play to certain private friends. He has read it often, poor fellow; but could never get it acted yet, and has had endless trouble with it.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Macready&#x2019;s rejection of <hi rend="italic">A Legend of Florence</hi>, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380727-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-07-27">27 July 1838</date></ref>. Arriving first with Mrs. Weir, &#x201C;whose husband [William; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:318</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>] was over head and ears with Corn-Law matters,&#x201D; John Hunter described the reading in his diary, <date when="1839-03-13">13 March</date>: &#x201C;Afterwards arrived Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle, Thornton and his wife [Catherine Gliddon] and wife&#x2019;s sister, Percy, a lad named &#x2018;Charlie,&#x2019; and last of all Mrs. Hunt, whom I had never seen before, and whose manner and appearance are anything but prepossessing. &#x2026; Immediately after tea, Hunt began his tragedy, which he read at first with considerable effort; but as he got into the stream of it, he kindled up, and gave it with amazing force and effect. I have seldom been more touched. &#x2026; When he closed our faces told him that he had found the way to our hearts. Carlyle, Craik, and I simultaneously rose and shook hands with him; on which he said, &#x2018;I am satisfied with my verdict. &#x2026;&#x2019; Carlyle spoke earnestly and candidly of it; told him it was a piece of right good stuff, solid and real, with a pulse of life and play of passion in every scene and line, and capitally dramatised. The only thing like objection was, that we all thought the conclusion might be better brought out in <hi rend="italic">action</hi>, so as to have more of <hi rend="italic">dramatic</hi> interest than as it is at present, by a long, but most admirable and indeed Shakespearian, speech from a Cardinal giving judgment as to the divorce. Hunt at once acquiesced in this&#x201D; (from MS, Mrs. H. Watt; pbd: <hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi>, 23 [<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>]: 101). See also JWC&#x2019;s comments on the play at an earlier reading, <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380918-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-09-18">18 Sept. 1838</date>]</ref>.</note> He is in a very poor way; living, I believe, on some allowance weekly which certain benevolent persons have subscribed to afford him. He has only been once here, these ten months;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the evening of <date when="1839-03-04">4 March</date>; see John Hunter&#x2019;s diary entry, <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March</date></ref>.</note> he has a kind of mixed affection and terror for me, and keeps rather out of my way; a plan I too think good. Nothing can exceed the improvident wastefulness of his poor household <pb id="pg-11-54" n="11:54"/>and self, except their misery. I can do them no good, and get no good of them.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jack on Monday; he must have got your Letter a fortnight ago, very soon after he wrote to me.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both Alick and Mrs. Carlyle had expressed surprise at not hearing from Jack.</note> He speaks of writing again soon by some Ambassador&#x2019;s conveyance; I will endeavour to forward the Letter without losing time. We have great cause to be thankful for Jack&#x2019;s sake, I think: he seems to be in a good position; comfortable, successful, and with the best outlook he could expect in that department.&#x2014; My good Mother asks me whether I am not coming to Annandale this summer. I cannot answer yet; I only feel that I will not spend the hot weather <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> that I do design to have my <hi rend="italic">fill</hi> of green country and fresh air somewhere: but all is indeterminate beyond that; and till the Lectures &#x26;c are over, nothing can be determined. I sometimes think I ought to run over to Switzerland for a while; and indeed Jack and I had a kind of project for meeting there: but that again depends, even on his side, on his Duke&#x2019;s motions: on the whole nothing can be settled about it. I still have thoughts of getting a horse; the rather now as the weather seems to promise mending. Nothing can yet be decided as to the arrangement of the Lectures, or what subject they are to be on; tho&#x2019; I am studying at that most of all in these days.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They were to start on <date when="1839-05-01">1 May</date>.</note> You will hear by and by, I trust, that it is all going right.&#x2014; Cavaignac tells me they are for translating our Revolution Book into French: it will make strange French, I trow!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> was not trans. until <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>, by E.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter by the <hi rend="italic">Royal William</hi> reached me yesterday. The Book it referred to had not then arrived. But strangely enough, Kennett, the dilatory Kennett, inspired by I know not what good genius, had in those same hours bethought himself, and set his messengers in motion; and so, returning from a friend&#x2019;s late last night, I found your Packet lying safe in waiting for me! Mrs Austin and Miss Martineau are both in Town; they shall have their copies, if they have not already got them. Mrs Jameson is gone to Germany and Dresden some days ago; so that hers, I suppose, must lie till her return, which was not expected to to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] be very distant. Such a volume would have been a welcome thing to carry round with her to Weimar: however, it will doubtless find its way thither by and by, and be welcome arrive when it may.</p>
<p>For myself I thank you very cordially for this Gift; for the copy specially assigned me, and for the kind Inscription prefixed to all the copies.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dwight had dedicated the book: &#x201C;To Thomas Carlyle, as a slight token of admiration and gratitude, this volume is respectfully inscribed by the Translator.&#x201D;</note> It is good news that any one esteems us; better and better when our favourer is one whom we ourselves can esteem. Of course, I <pb id="pg-11-57" n="11:57"/>have not yet been able to give your volume such an examination as I well design for it: but I have looked here and there, read largely here and there, read your Notes nearly altogether; and know tolerably whereabouts you are. It seems to me a volume creditable to New England, to yourself and all your coadjuters [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]; well worthy of the creditable Publication it forms part of. With great pleasure I recognise in you one merit, the rarest of all in Goethe&#x2019;s Translators, yet the first condition, without which every other merit is impossible: that of <hi rend="italic">understanding</hi> your original. You seem to me to have actually deciphered for yourself, and got to behold and see the lineaments of this great mind; so that you know what it means, and what its words mean. I have heard from no English writer whatsoever as much truth as you write in these Notes about Goethe; I might say nowhere else at all among English writers any thing but partiality, misapprehension, non-vision, gleams of insight bewildered in a mass of hallucinations; leaving no image for us but at bottom that of a vague large blameable&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">Impossibility</hi>. Interpretation of detached pieces, in such circumstances, is hopeless; in the contrary circumstances there may be hope in it. I like many of these versions very well. Your Songs seem to me the best; far better than one has seen hitherto, than one could have expected to see. The Epigrammatic Aphoristic matter too is sometimes wonderfully successful; at other times, the quaint felicity of the expression is lost (I know nothing in writing more difficult to preserve), but the sense even in these cases is there. Schiller was much easier to do. On the whole, I must congratulate you on getting thro&#x2019; so handsomely; it was an enterprise wherein failure to a very high degree need not have been dishonourable. Among your helpers I notice my old acquaintance Channing; and greatly approve of his <hi rend="italic">Kennst Du das Land</hi> [Know&#x2019;st thou the Land].<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s trans. of Goethe&#x2019;s poem, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:176, or <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230708-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:396</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-07-08">8 July 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>How the Public will receive your Book is perhaps very doubtful; perhaps not very momentous. One great acquisition you have infallibly made, far beyond what any Public could do for you; the acquisition of a Teacher and Prophet for yourself! Alone of men, very far beyond all other men, Goethe seems to me to have understood his century, to have conquered his century, and made that too for himself a portion of Universal Time, a portion of Eternity. Glory to the strong man, say I; joy over all the race of men! Such a man is as a Prometheus, who in a time of midnight and spectres miraculously brings fire and light out of Heaven itself; and his sacred urn is burning here among us still for long generations,&#x2014;whereat the rest of us can, according to <pb id="pg-11-58" n="11:58"/>our need, <hi rend="italic">Kindle</hi> lights.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 160, where Harrold refers to Goethe&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;Prometheus,&#x201D; and 225.</note> What all this means I believe you know. It is now long that I have ceased to speak much about such things; but they are not forgotten for all that. There is a time to speak of them; there comes also a time to be silent of them, and if possible do better than speak.</p>
<p>Your scheme of activity pleases me well. Taken up in singleness of heart, with modesty, with cheerful courage to do and to endure, it cannot but lead you towards a good goal. Neither must poverty depress you overmuch. Poverty is no bad companion for a young man; no degree of poverty whatever can permanently hold down a man in wrong courses; nay the best and highest course for a man, where his duty and blessedness do lie, is often enough one of great and greatest poverty. Heed not poverty. Speak to your fellow men what things you have made out by the grace of God. A far fataller enemy than Poverty is one to which not many of us but all of us are liable, in this career: the thrice cursed sin of Self-conceit,&#x2014;bred oftener by riches than by Poverty! God deliver us all from that; send us whatever of &#x201C;ill fortune&#x201D; is needful to deliver us from that!</p>
<p>I write in great haste; but with little prospect of speedy leisure, and therefore today rather than tomorrow. Pray thank Mr Ripley for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> valued Book,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had received George Ripley&#x2019;s &#x201C;much to be approved of&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Discourses on the Philosophy of Religion</hi> (Boston, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) and some pamphlets by <date when="1837-06-01">1 June 1837</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370601-TC-RWE-01"><sic>9:219&#x2013;20</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1837-06-01">1 June 1837</date></corr></ref>) and had immediately lent them to Harriet Martineau, who was a friend of Ripley&#x2019;s. Ripley&#x2019;s &#x201C;valued book&#x201D; might refer to the <hi rend="italic">Discourses;</hi> Ripley&#x2019;s next book of trans. from Cousin, Joufroy, and Constant, <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Miscellanies</hi> (Boston, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), vols. 1 and 2 of <hi rend="italic">Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature</hi>, was probably not pbd. soon enough to have lain &#x201C;nearly a year hidden.&#x201D;</note> which lay nearly a year hidden somewhere, but did appear in fine.</p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Grant<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace Grant.</note> assures me that a word of mine will be welcome to you in your foreign wanderings; and proposes, yesterday, by a solemn message thro&#x2019; the Threepenny Post, that I should take for that end the first <pb id="pg-11-59" n="11:59"/>section of a Sheet which he is about despatching. I willingly comply with so fair an offer. I ought to have written on my own footing, indeed, and meant to do it; yet perhaps but for Grant&#x2019;s helpfulness it might have remained still a mere pious purpose,&#x2014;one of those unfortunate substances, with which, it is said, a certain place is &#x201C;paved&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300112-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:58</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-01-12">12 Jan. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> My life is indeed altogether barren at present, so far as speech goes; my indolence is great. I write to nobody except on the clearest compulsion: once a month to my Brother, and about as often to my Mother and kindred in Scotland.</p>
<p>Last time my Brother wrote, he mentioned having seen you, just arrived at Naples, and how you had sat with him for two hours. You must have been a Godsend to the man in that noisy solitude, where inaction and want of rational human communion seem to be his main sufferings hitherto. He did not report very flourishingly of your health; but it was with and [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] old date that he compared the actual aspect of matters; I think, he did not see you at all in England last year, or indeed know you before otherwise than in the state of perfect strength. You will doubtless profit by the gentler winter, by the many interesting things you enjoy and lay up for enjoyment: nevertheless if your disease be not subdued, nay if it were not much alleviated, I would still charge you to entertain no discouragement for that. Dyspepsia is an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> friend of mine; I know it pretty well now, by a daily and hourly acquaintance of twenty years. Of its virtues, its vices and severities, of the jewel which like the toad it bears in its ugly head (with a pest to it!) I have much to say, not admissible here: but there is one thing I have got a great clearness in, That Doctors can in general do little for it; that a man learns to be his own Doctor, and finds a far worse case than I take yours to be, quite manageable at last. It is <hi rend="italic">the nervous-system</hi> of people that write and think, above all, that feel, which is <hi rend="italic">too weak</hi> for the work. You must lay less work on it; one must learn to lay less. On the whole, as a worthy Scotch friend of mine said, last year, in speaking of the Duke of Wellington: &#x201C;One must be sorry for a man that is unhappy, and yet if he is not unhappy,&#x2014;I fear we must be still sorrier for him!&#x201D; I do believe so. Fineness of organisation, nerves injurable, nerves injured, nearly sure to be injured: this I must apprehend to be the primary condition of all talent, of all spiritual worth whatsoever. And yet withal I say it is miserable and <hi rend="italic">criminal</hi> to continue unhealthy; one positively ought to get healthy, cost what it may or can!&#x2014; From all which I infer that perhaps the best thing will be to get <hi rend="italic">half a horse</hi> along with me, by and by, from some benevolent stallmaster hereabouts, and take to riding!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-60" n="11:60"/>My existence here as I told you is outwardly as good as barren at present. I lie altogether fallow; and am even right thankful that I can do so. I have been reading a variety of things; books about Cromwell and the England of his day: some people will have me write some delineation of that. We shall see, we shall see; but for the present it does not look at all promising. I fancy I shall write something by and by. But as yet my soul&#x2019;s first wish is silence, silence. You will understand that better by and by. For the rest I have on hand a new Course of Lectures in these weeks; not audible to you, this year,&#x2014;be thankful you. They are but six: &#x201C;On Modern Revolutions&#x201D; (I think): Protestantism; English Commonwealth (Puritanism); French Revolution (Girondism, Sansculottism); we shall cobble up some kind of story about it, I have little doubt. It is judged expedient to keep the ground open in that department of industry till we see farther; tho&#x2019; I cannot say I have any liking for it at all; only less aversion than for writing in the mood I am in. Besides, this year I shall care far less about it; I mean likewise to get a horse, and be in better health: I am better than formerly, much <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi>. The Americans have sent me a handsome purse of money as the produce of their Edition of the Revolution Book: is not that a smart thing? It was Emerson&#x2019;s doing. Our English Edition is just about out too; for which Fraser, blushing at the sight of the Yankee Bills (he actually blushed), says he will have cash to give me also, which he &#x201C;hopes will be satisfactory!&#x201D; I wait to see <hi rend="italic">this</hi> before settling about a <hi rend="italic">re</hi>print for England and Yankeeland together. On this side all is well; and both you and I, we must admit, are handsomely out of the affair. Your review of it was very bold; second only to the boldness of writing such a thing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review had been in <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 5 and 27 (<date when="1837-07-00">July, 1837</date>): 17&#x2013;53. Mill had described <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> as &#x201C;not so much a history, as an epic poem; &#x2026; and on the whole no work of greater genius, either historical or poetical, has been produced in this country for many years&#x201D; (17).

<p>I have hardly seen Buller once since you went away. He is quite silent till once Easter be past, and the Canada affair come specially on.

<salute>Dear Mr Mylnes,</salute>
<p>That Book <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, I am sorry to say, is not discoverable. Search has been made within the house and without, hitherto in vain. Somebody has it; but I know not who, and see not at present much hope of knowing. Perhaps Kennett of York Street Covent Garden has it on sale: if not, and if (as the probabilities indicate) I cannot unearth it here, what chance is there? It seems an &#x201C;irreducible case.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A term in algebra referring to cubic equations whose root cannot be expressed. TC had first mentioned Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> to Milnes the previous summer when he thought John Sterling had a copy (<ref target="volume-10/lt-18380713-TC-RMM-01">TC to RMM, <date when="1838-07-13">13 July 1838</date></ref>).</note></p>
<p>I give you two fractions of an American Book-catalogue, where you find a Notice of <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> and Notices of one or two other things perhaps <pb id="pg-11-62" n="11:62"/>related to your enterprise.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; As to the immortal <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> Book, I am not altogether sure but the piece of truth I communicated to you may have given you a wrong impression of the whole truth. Come therefore into the centre of the business (<foreign><hi rend="italic">me duce</hi></foreign> [under my guidance]), since you have got within the circumference. The American Edition was of 1000, price 2 dollars, and is all sold off; my share of the profit &#xa3;150. American Booksellers sell at 15 percent; that is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> share of the retail price of a Book you give them to sell for you. The English Edition, of 750, price 31/6, is also all sold off except a score of copies; my share of the profit hitherto <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the Bookseller tells me he has cash for me, the colour of cash, &#x201C;which he hopes will prove satisfactory,&#x201D; were his books once balanced!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had probably spoken irritably to Milnes sometime in <date when="1839-02-00">Feb.</date>, as he had in his Journal and letters (<ref target="volume-11/lt-18390204-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <sic><date when="1839-02-08">8 Feb.</date></sic><corr><date when="1839-02-04">[4] Feb.</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390208-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <sic><date when="1839-02-02">2 Feb.</date></sic><corr><date when="1839-02-08">8 Feb.</date></corr></ref>), at the contrast between the money from America received by <date when="1839-02-00">early Feb.</date> and the lack of money from the British edn. This letter is an attempt to set the record straight after Fraser had announced in <date when="1839-03-00">early March</date> that once he balanced his books, there <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be some money for TC (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390308-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1839-03-08">8 March</date></ref>, <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March</date></ref>, <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390323-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <sic><date when="1839-03-27">27 March</date></sic><corr><date when="1839-03-23">23 March</date></corr></ref>, where Fraser&#x2019;s same phrases are quoted).</note> English Booksellers sell at the rate of 42 per cent or so (I find); and are generally reckoned to be knaves more or less besides. It is a commercial phenomenon, their business here at present. I prepare to print a second edition for England and America <hi rend="italic">together</hi>. This is the veritable complete state of the case; more fit for a Threadneedle Street Accountant than for a West-End Poetical Critic;&#x2014;which however I impart to you in confidence, that what you do see good to say on the subject may be said with entire knowledge of it. My notion is that it is all a <foreign><hi rend="italic">mis&#xE8;re</hi></foreign> [trifle], worthy to be left in profoundest secrecy. Unless perhaps you will recommend one to swallow keys (like your friend <hi rend="italic">Stello</hi>), and die with a &#x201C;Pen in one hand and crust in the other&#x201D;? Is not that a beautiful attitude for dying, now,&#x2014;and one often practised in hospitals? Gilbert Sansculotte!&#x2014;I will desire you also to present my compliments to Kitty Bell when you next buy bunns from her.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred de Vigny&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Stello</hi> (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March</date></ref>) is a long dialogue between Stello, who wishes to partake of the life of action, and a realistic doctor, who tries to convince him that it is the poet&#x2019;s duty to follow his sacred mission and remain a solitary, removed from daily life. Among the anecdotes told by the doctor to illustrate the correctness of his advice is one concerning Nicolas-Joseph-Laurent Gilbert (<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>&#x2013;<date when="1780-00-00">80</date>), a French poet of promise who attacked the Enlightenment philosophers and died poor; hence TC&#x2019;s reference to him as &#x201C;Sansculotte,&#x201D; meaning poor and revolutionary. Another poet referred to is Thomas Chatterton (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770-00-00">70</date>), whom the doctor says was loved and cared for by (the fictitious) Kitty Bell, who sold cakes and buns nr. parliament.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Mrs Welsh wants that Note forwarded to Mary her maid; whereupon I think of inclosing it to you; the frank will carry you a few words as it passes. Andrew Watson, on Saturday, if I remember right, is on your pavements; so that there will be no delay according to this method.</p>
<p>We have been in a pining way here, at least Jane and her Mother have, owing to the bitter March weather. We are all now a little better; our two dames are gone out today, up to town in an omnibus; a sign of improvement. I myself have not ailed much: yet in these last days I had a decided onslaught of cold, which however, meeting it with promptitude, I think I have driven back. Mrs Welsh goes off to Liverpool tomorrow. In spite of her sickliness, she has enjoyed London rather more than on former occasions; not altogether like a fish out of water this time, but taking a kind of hold of some things. She is to stay some little time in Liverpool, I fancy; her Brother there is not very well.</p>
<p>As for me my <hi rend="italic">Lecture</hi> season approaches again, and all my care bent in that direction at present. I have fixed what is to be the subject: &#x201C;The Revolutions of Modern Europe&#x201D; (Protestantism two Lectures; English Revolution, two; French Revolution, two); six Lectures in all; for I mean to give only <hi rend="italic">six</hi> this year, and charge <hi rend="italic">one</hi> guinea. We are to be in the old room.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At 17 Edward St. Portman Sq. For TC&#x2019;s complaints about it, see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380510-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1838-05-10">10 May 1838</date></ref>.</note> I begin on <hi rend="italic">Mayday:</hi> Wednesday the <date when="1839-05-01">first of May</date> at 3 o&#x2019;clock; so onwards on the Wednesdays and Saturdays till three <pb id="pg-11-64" n="11:64"/>weeks are over and the thing done. How it will succeed I of course know not; neither indeed do I care much, for it is a business of endless <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fike</hi></foreign> [fuss and fret], and shatters my nerves in a really frightful manner; and besides I am not driven by absolute poverty this year, but can manage for a while independently of all things. I have got no horse yet, but still make some effort that way; I am pretty sure it would do me good. But fancy what the charges are! A riding horse for one hour here is 5/, and half a crown for each after; one ride I find would cost me, with ostlers, messengers and other trash, 8 shillings of money! At <hi rend="italic">that</hi> rate I will not ride&#x2014;extensively. Last year, in Lecture time, John Sterling and I determined on a scamper on horse-back, for health&#x2019;s sake; we had two good horses, 10/6 each for the day; we cantered round by Hampstead and other high lying villages, had to pay tolls, grooms &#x26;c; and I think, if memory record correctly, our ride for those middle hours of the day cost us 15/ each. A man with money can do all things here; but without money&#x2014;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the whole, I believe myself to be growing healthier, in spite of much detached sickliness and depression; simply by dint of <hi rend="italic">being quiet</hi>. Providence, I feel sometimes, has been very gracious to me; just as a farther battle had grown intolerable, I got to a kind of <hi rend="italic">slack</hi> in the controversy, and was allowed to take my breath a little. I am still taking my breath;&#x2014;God be thanked! For the rest all goes on well with me; many a thing is <hi rend="italic">planted</hi> (so to speak) in this circle of mine; and grows whether I heed it or not.</p>
<p>Jeffrey is here; grown very grey and small. His daughter is married to a man of fifty, a literary man whom I know, a very worthy, rational, rather wearisome man; and has brought and will bring him great store of money. She is a strange silent awkward creature; and for all her youth and her husband&#x2019;s antiquity, could not that I see have done better.</p>
<p>Doubtless you saw the Letters from me that my Mother and Alick got, not long since; the Letter from Jack that was in the first of these. No farther tidings have yet come from him; somebody read in the Newspapers that his Duke was actually gone to Malta, on the sailing excursion we heard tell of; so that Jack is most likely alone at Naples superintendent of the children and house there. We hear that they like him very well; and he seems from his Letters to take more and more to them. Mill and Sterling are both in that quarter of the world at present; but are to return in two months or so.</p>
<p>Dear Jean, I have room for no more; and hitherto I have said nothing! You had a Letter from me (had you not?) since you wrote last. With <hi rend="italic">two</hi> <foreign>bairns</foreign> I fear your writing hand will be still more hampered. <pb id="pg-11-65" n="11:65"/>Yet you must not give it up; I cannot do without your despatches from time to time. I must learn how all fares with you, and the rest of them; put the children to bed, and then put&#x2014;pen to paper that night! My affectionate regards to James: I am very well pleased to think of your quiet honest course of life and industry together there. It requires talent to manage that in these times; but, managed, I think it is the luckiest existence of all. Ah me, what a scene is <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, in comparison!</p>
<p>My dear Mother&#x2019;s Letter spoke of cold and toothache, but added that they were mostly gone. I do trust it continues so; I should be right glad to hear that they were entirely gone and not to come back. You will send them word of me. I had a Newspaper from Manchester, and sent one in return. Good be with you all <foreign>bairns</foreign>; my kindest love to all of you!</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>James&#x2019;s Pipes still hold out, and Alick&#x2019;s Tobacco; a right good smoking equipment. I have daily cause to remember them both.</p>
<p>Today I am to dine with one Macready, the chief of theatrical persons here; who has sent me a free ticket to his Theatre these two years,&#x2014;which, alas, I have only used <hi rend="italic">once</hi> this year.

<p>To the Honourable the Commons of England in Parliament assembled, the Petition of Thomas Carlyle, a Writer of Books,</p>
<salute>Humbly sheweth,</salute>
<p>That your petitioner has written certain books, being incited thereto by various innocent or laudable considerations, chiefly by the thought that said books might in the end be found to be worth something.</p>
<p>That your petitioner had not the happiness to receive from Mr Thomas Tegg,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Tegg (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), of 73 Cheapside, bookseller and publisher of cheap reprints of popular works, opposed Talfourd&#x2019;s copyright campaign with three pamphlets, beginning with <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the speech of Serjeant Talfourd on &#x2026; the Laws relating to the Copyright</hi> (London, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>).</note> or any Publisher, Republisher, Printer, Bookseller, Book-buyer, or other the like man or body of men, any encouragement or countenance in writing of said books, or to discern any chance <pb id="pg-11-67" n="11:67"/>of receiving such; but wrote them by effort of his own and the favour of Heaven.</p>
<p>That all useful labour is worthy of recompense; that all honest labour is worthy of the chance of recompense; that the giving and assuring to each man what recompense his labour has actually merited may be said to be the business of all Legislation, Polity, Government and Social Arrangement whatsoever among men;&#x2014;a business indispensable to attempt, impossible to accomplish accurately, difficult to accomplish without inaccuracies that become enormous, insupportable, and the parent of social confusions which never altogether end.</p>
<p>That your petitioner does not undertake to say what recompense in money this labour of his may deserve; whether it deserves any recompense in money, or whether money in any quantity could hire him to do the like.</p>
<p>That this his labour has found hitherto, in money or monies&#x2019; worth, small recompense or none; that he is by no means sure of its ever finding recompense, but thinks that, if so, it will be at a distant time, when he, the labourer, will probably no longer be in need of money, and those dear to him will still be in need of it.</p>
<p>That the law does at least protect all persons in selling the production of their labour at what they can get for it, in all market-places, to all lengths of time. Much more than this the law does to many, but so much it does to all, and less than this to none.</p>
<p>That your petitioner cannot discover himself to have done unlawfully in this his said labour of writing books, or to have become criminal, or have forfeited the law&#x2019;s protection thereby. Contrariwise your petitioner believes firmly that he is innocent in said labour; that if he be found in the long-run to have written a genuine enduring book, his merit therein, and desert towards England and English and other men, will be considerable, not easily estimable in money; that, on the other hand, if his book proves false and ephemeral, he and it will be abolished and forgotten, and no harm done.</p>
<p>That, in this manner, your petitioner plays no unfair game against the world; his stake being life itself, so to speak (for the penalty is death by starvation), and the world&#x2019;s stake nothing till once it see the dice thrown, so that in any case the world cannot lose.</p>
<p>That in the happy and long-doubtful event of the game&#x2019;s going in his favour, your petitioner submits that the small winnings thereof do belong to him or his, and that no other mortal has justly either part or lot in them at all, now, henceforth, or for ever.</p>
<p>May it therefore please your Honourable House to protect him in said happy and long-doubtful event; and (by passing your Copyright <pb id="pg-11-68" n="11:68"/>Bill) forbid all Thomas Teggs and other extraneous persons, entirely unconcerned in this adventure of his, to steal from him his small winnings, for a space of sixty years at shortest. After sixty years, unless your Honourable House provide otherwise, they may begin to steal.</p>
<closer><salute>And your petitioner will ever pray.</salute></closer>

<p><salute>Dearest Mother&#x2014;</salute>It is a week past on Thursday since you went away,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1839-03-28">28 March</date>.</note> and really that one week looks longer than all the time you were here. Parting is one of the few hardships in this world which one does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;use to&#x201D;; indeed the last time seems always the worst. It was quite heart-breaking leaving you in that tremendous apparatus,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The train to Liverpool; see also <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360716-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:10&#x2013;11</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1836-07-16">16 July 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> given up as it were to an irresistible destiny; to be shot away from one like an arrow into space! I cried all the way home; and then sat down so <foreign><hi rend="italic">dowie</hi></foreign> [sad] by the fire, indisposed to speak to any son or daughter of Adam. But Helen was determined I should not despond for lack of a little of her Job&#x2019;s comfort;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Job 2:11.</note> so she broke the silence by an announcement that we were &#x201C;out of <foreign>baith</foreign> dips and moulds.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Candles made by dipping a wick into melted tallow or pouring wax into molds.</note> &#x201C;There,&#x201D; said I, giving her money, and returned to look into the fire. But she lingered as she went, and at the door she made a stand and gave a great sigh, and then broke forth, &#x201C;I declare it&#x2019;s no like the same <foreign>hoose</foreign>, <foreign>sae</foreign> dull and dismal-like, it&#x2019;s just as if a <foreign><hi rend="italic">corp</hi></foreign> [corpse in a coffin] had <foreign>gaen</foreign> <foreign>oot</foreign>! She was so attached!&#x201D; What could one do in such a case but either jump up and fell her, or burst into new weeping? Having little spirit remaining, I chose the latter alternative. Then as if on purpose to keep alive my regrets, ever so many things have turned up, since you went, that I should have liked you to have been present at. The very next evening came the French Catholic Rio, that Carlyle had described to us as such a striking man. He pleased me much, tho&#x2019; resembling the description in no one particular except the duskiness of his complexion. I had fancied him a stern, bigoted enthusiast, whereas he is a sort of French John Sterling; if possible even more voluble and transparent; and his Catholicism sits on him just about as lightly as John&#x2019;s Church-of-Englandism <pb id="pg-11-69" n="11:69"/>sits on him.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexis Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Rio; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March</date></ref>. Rio thought that TC was more of an idealist than most who shared TC&#x2019;s political opinions, and that JWC seemed to maintain and foster this in him. He used to note their conversations in his Journal and, of this visit on <date when="1839-03-30">30 March</date>, wrote: &#x201C;I went to call on Carlyle in his Chelsea retreat, and returned with my heart truly moved by his warm welcome and the trust he had shown me, his Scots accent much less baffling for me than last year. His wife has the most beautiful gaze possible. When I arrived, it was she who received me; her husband had not yet returned from his walk. She told me charming details of their six years of solitude, in Dumfriesshire &#x2026; immediately after their marriage, and little by little the conversation became so spirited and so intimate, that I strongly regretted not having arranged a way of passing more time with this interesting couple already so attractive to me; unhappily I was promised elsewhere, and I had to leave Elysium for Limbo&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Epilogue &#xE0; l&#x2019;Art Chr&#xE9;tien</hi>, trans. 2:334&#x2013;35).</note> I happened to ask him if he knew Cavaignac: &#x201C;Ah, who does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know Cavaignac by name? But <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, you know, am a victim of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> party, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is a victim of Louis Philippe. Does Cavaignac come here?&#x201D; &#x201C;Yes, we have known him long.&#x201D; &#x201C;Good gracious! How strange it would be for us to meet in the same room! How I should like it!&#x201D; &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; I said, &#x201C;he is to dine here on Monday.&#x201D; &#x201C;I will come; good gracious, it will be so strange&#x201D;: and he seemed amazingly charmed with his prospect. Not so Carlyle, who began, before he was well out at the door, &#x201C;Mercy Jane, are you distracted?&#x201D; &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">can</hi> you do with these two men?&#x201D; etc., etc. I assured him it would go off without bloodshed, and began to think of my <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi>. In addition to the boiled leg of mutton already projected for the sake of the capers, I decided on a beefsteak pie; and, that care off my mind, I trusted in Providence that the men would not come to an explosion.</p>
<p>The dinner, however, could hardly be called a &#x201C;successful one.&#x201D; Rio appeared on the scene at half-past three, as if he could not have enough of it. Latrade<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Chassaignac de Latrade (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>), French republican politician; presumably in exile like Cavaignac and Marrast, he also had long-standing connections with <hi rend="italic">Le National</hi> and its campaigns against the French government. After the <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> revolution, he had various political appointments, represented various constituencies in different assemblies, and had a further period of exile, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>.</note> came as the clock struck four. But Cavaignac&#x2014; Alas! Two of his friends were on terms about blowing each other&#x2019;s brains out, and Cavaignac was gone to bring them to reason; and not till they were brought to reason would he arrive to eat his dinner. Now, whether the men would be brought to reason before the dinner was quite spoiled, was a delicate question that Latrade himself could not answer. So, one half hour being gone, and still no appearance of him, I was on the point of suggesting that we should wait no longer, when a carriage drove up and deposited Mrs. Macready and Macready&#x2019;s Sister.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Frances Macready, b. Atkins (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>); she had supported her parents, both incompetent actors according to Macready, from an early age. She had first acted with Macready in Aberdeen in <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>; they m., <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>, and had ten children in all, six of them by <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>. Letitia Macready (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>) had kept house for Macready before his marriage and continued there till her death. She had insisted on Catherine being educated by them for a year before her marriage.</note> Was ever beeksteak pie in such a cruel predicament! There was <pb id="pg-11-70" n="11:70"/>no help, however, but to do the amiable, which was not ill to do even in these trying circumstances, the visitors were such attractive sort of people. Mrs. Macready asked me how I liked Harriet&#x2019;s Book.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Deerbrook</hi> (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s first novel.</note> I answered &#x201C;how do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like it?&#x201D; She made wide eyes at me and drew her little mouth together into a button. We both burst out a-laughing, and that is the way to get fast friends. An hour and half after the dinner had been all ready we proceeded to eat it,&#x2014;Rio, Latrade and we. And when it was just going off the table cold, Cavaignac came, his hands full of papers and his head full of the Devil knows what; but not one reasonable word would he speak the whole night. Rio said nothing to his dispraise, but I am sure he thought in his own mind. &#x201C;Good Gracious! I had better never be in the same room with him again!&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rio described this dinner on <date when="1839-04-01">Monday, 1 April</date>, in his Journal: &#x201C;Spent three short hours at Carlyle&#x2019;s, who, this time, told Cavaignac straight out, without any precautionary speech, that I was a Chouan of <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>, and this title, far from making the wild republican scowl, brought forth the most unexpected compliments on the energy and pride of the Breton character. Cavaignac has a quality of voice that must be very powerful when moved by passion; his chest must resonate like a tom tom. He has something of a lion in his face and his look, noble and calm when nothing excites him; but he would be terrifying in a crisis. For the rest, he was much less interesting to me than my hosts by whom I was more and more enchanted. I do not know any other man in London with conversation as inspired as Carlyle&#x2019;s. I wish I could recall his fine words on Goethe and the painter Hogarth whom he regards as a genius&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Epilogue</hi>, trans. 2:336).</note></p>
<p>But there has been another Frenchman here that I would have
given a gold guinea that you had seen: To-day gone a week<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-03-31">31 March</date>.</note> the sound of a whirlwind rushed thro&#x2019; the street, and there stopt with a prancing of steeds and footman thunder at this door, an equipage, all resplendent with skye-blue and silver, discoverable thro&#x2019; the blinds, like a piece of the Coronation Procession, from whence emanated Count d&#x2019;Orsay! ushered in by the small Chorley.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred, Count D&#x2019;Orsay and Henry Fothergill Chorley.</note> Chorley looked &#x201C;so much alarmed that he was quite alarming&#x201D;; his face was all the colours of the rainbow, the under-jaw of him went zig-zag; indeed, from head to foot he was all over one universal quaver, partly, I suppose, from the soul-bewildering honour of having been borne hither in that chariot of the sun; partly from apprehension of the effect which his man of Genius and his man of Fashion were about to produce on one another. Happily it was not one of my nervous days, so that I could contemplate <pb id="pg-11-71" n="11:71"/>the whole thing from my <foreign><hi rend="italic">prie-Dieu</hi></foreign> without being infected by his agitation, and a sight it was to make one think the millenium actually at hand, when the lion and the lamb, and all incompatible things should consort together. Carlyle in his grey plaid suit, and his tub-chair, looking blandly at the Prince of Dandies; and the Prince of Dandies on an opposite chair, all resplendent as a diamond-beetle,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >South American beetle studded with brilliant points, or any beetle with splendid markings.</note> looking blandly at <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. D&#x2019;Orsay is a really handsome man, after one has heard him speak and found that he has both wit and sense; but at first sight his beauty is of that rather disgusting sort which seems to be like genius, &#x201C;of no sex.&#x201D; And this impression is greatly helped by the fantastical finery of his dress: sky-blue satin cravat, yards of gold chain, white French gloves, light drab great-coat lined with velvet of the same colour, invisible inexpressibles, skin-coloured and fitting like a glove, etc., etc. All this, as John says, is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> absurd&#x201D;;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370829-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:298</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-29">29 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> but his manners are manly and unaffected and he convinces one, shortly, that in the face of all probability he is a devilish clever fellow. Looking at Shelley&#x2019;s bust,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360911-JWC-SS-01"><sic>9:56</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1836-09-11">11 Sept. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> he said &#x201C;I dislike it very much; there is a sort of faces <hi rend="italic">who</hi> seem to wish to swallow their chins and this is one of them.&#x201D; He went to Macready after the first performance of <hi rend="italic">Richelieu</hi>, and Macready asked him, &#x201C;What would you suggest?&#x201D; &#x201C;A little more fulness in your petticoat!&#x201D; answered d&#x2019;Orsay. Could contempt for the piece have been more politely expressed? He was no sooner gone than Helen burst into the room to condole with me that Mrs. Welsh had not seen him&#x2014;such a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">most</hi> beautiful man and most beautiful carriage! The Queen&#x2019;s was no show i&#x2019; the worl&#x2019; compared wi&#x2019; that! Everything was so grand and so preceese! But it will be something for next time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I have heard from Elizabeth (not Countess Pepoli yet). She says of him merely: &#x201C;one of the pleasantest things that has happened to me since I came&#x201D; (the place it seems is horribly dull) &#x201C;has been a most cheerful Letter from Pepoli on leaving the Quadrant.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >65 Quadrant, Piccadilly, from which Pepoli was presumably moving to a new home for his marriage to Elizabeth Fergus on <date when="1839-09-09">9 Sept.</date> Elizabeth had taken one of her sisters to Devonshire for her health; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390620-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-06-20">20 June</date></ref>.</note> He says he does not mean to see you till he has completed his arrangements.&#x201D; &#x2026;</p>
<p>O Mother! only think! poor Mr. Ryerson is dead!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Reierson, who d. <date when="1839-03-26">26 March</date>. The ellipses throughout are in A. Carlyle&#x2019;s text.</note> Died ten days ago, after three days&#x2019; illness. &#x2026; It makes our <foreign>Soiree</foreign> quite a sad sort of remembrance to me.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-72" n="11:72"/>The Coolidges<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph and Ellen Coolidge from Boston.</note> called yesterday to take leave and beg an autograph. I am giving away the whole of the manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, in pages. She (Mrs. Coolidge) asked most politely after you, and was sure I must &#x201C;miss you sadly.&#x201D; Creek<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik.</note> has been but once since you went away: Carlyle was in the midst of <hi rend="italic">Deerbrook</hi> when he came in, and gave such a smack with his teeth as could hardly escape notice, and has produced this amelioration of our lot. Rio has taken up <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mantle, has been three times last week and comes again to-night; but he returns into Monmounthshire<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably to stay with the family of his wife, Apollonia Jones.</note> to-morrow and is making the best of his time.</p>
<p>&#x2026; I hope my Uncle continues improving. My kindest regards to him and the rest.&#x2014; Carlyle sends his kind love. He has been saying up to last night, &#x201C;One misses her much.&#x201D; <closer><salute>God bless you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Many a time I think of you and wonder what you are about in this bitter spring weather. Jean wrote to me from Dumfries lately, and gave an extract from a Letter of Isabella&#x2019;s wherein you were mentioned; but I could gather little from that, except that you were still in a weakly kind of way, &#x201C;suffering rather from rheumatism and toothache,&#x201D;&#x2014;which I like very ill, tho&#x2019; you seemed to be thought a little better, and not in any anxiety about yourself. What can I do? I can do nothing but send my anxieties, my hopes. I have nothing other that I can send; except it be plenty of Letters, which certainly I do not let you want for of late! Plenty of flannel and of fuel; warmth by all and every means: this I should think was the hopefullest remedy. Pray do not venture much out into the air in these East winds; especially never except in the middle part of the day. Attend to your stomach also; that is the root of the whole mischief, I believe; and this venomous wind, continually fretting and obstructing the skin, acts mischievously on every function of life. Here it is the fiercest spring I have seen: poor languishing buds and blossoms, but no sign of general vegetation; the wind <foreign><hi rend="italic">snell</hi></foreign> [piercing] as Greenland, continually from the East or North, and, in the former case, mingled for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> with the smoke of the city which it carries hither ward: one of the ugliest seasons! What are the poor sheep and cattle doing? What are the poor Sons of Toil and Scarcity doing: ah me!&#x2014; On the whole, dear Mother, I must again and again enforce on you the necessity of warmth, regimen and care; the necessity of being careful. What do you live upon? Do not take salt things, or <hi rend="italic">scrap-dinners</hi> of any kind. Buy a hen or two (do this, I bid you); make soup of them,&#x2014;for yourself as you would for me. Have you got any ale? If not, let Alick directly get some. I entreat you to want for nothing. There is <foreign><hi rend="italic">siller</hi></foreign> enough among us, a hundred times over, to meet all that. What end could money serve that were half so blessed to any one or to all of us?</p>
<p>This Letter of Jack&#x2019;s came yesterday, and I lose no time in despatching it, tho&#x2019; with a most hurried accompaniment. Thank Heaven, the good Doctor is still well, and all goes right with him. He seems to have work too, and to be managing it well: this we may say among ourselves, tho&#x2019; we are not to speak of the Duke&#x2019;s illness <hi rend="italic">out of doors</hi>. We ought to be very thankful. For my part, I rejoice much that he has <pb id="pg-11-74" n="11:74"/>done with <hi rend="italic">Clare</hi>dom, and has exchanged into this other field of action; a much more genial and fertile one than that ever promised to be.&#x2014; Jack speaks farther of my going to meet him in Germany this summer. As yet I neither say yes nor no: it would perhaps be not the worst plan; and certainly I feel myself less indisposed for some expedition than I did last year: my mind is far calmer in general; I suppose, in spite of all indigestion &#x26;c, my health of body must really be improved too, and improving.</p>
<p>Arthur Buller, who was out with his Brother and Lord Durham in America, and went over the United States after their return, has a much more surprising expedition cut out for me: he talks at great length with great animation, how I am &#x201C;the most popular author in America at present,&#x201D; how this man said, how that man said;&#x2014;in a word, how I must go out to America and lecture, &#x201C;and make a fortune in six months&#x201D;! Beautiful talk: but as for the fortune in six months, we will leave that hanging by its own head.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scots proverb: &#x201C;every herring must hang by its own head.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; I do think however it might be possible too to clear a handsome little sum of money by an expedition thither some time, as they are all urging me to try to do; the steamers moreover have brought the place so <hi rend="italic">near</hi> now:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The crossing could be made in fifteen days in steamships such as the <hi rend="italic">Sirius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Great Western</hi>.</note> we will let it stand as a resource in the background, and decide nothing for the present.</p>
<p>A weightier concern is that of my London Lectures, fast coming on now! I have printed Prospectuses and Tickets a week ago; in the Examiner next but one there will be an Advertisement:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1839-04-28">28 April</date>. The first two lectures were advertised as &#x201C;on the Reformation,&#x201D; the whole course to cost &#x201C;One Guinea.&#x201D;</note> the thing is all kindled, and must go on according to the nature of it! I do not send a Prospectus for fear of overloading the Frank. We are to be in the old room; we begin on the first Wednesday of <date when="1839-05-00">May</date> (Wednesday come two weeks) at three of the clock; continue on Saturdays and Wednesdays: only six Lectures of them; the subject Modern Revolutions, Protestantism 2 lectures, English Revolution 2, French Revolution 2: would we were well done with it, say I! This year I am not nearly in such an agony as last year; yet I shall be ill enough I suppose, and must just &#x201C;<foreign>welter</foreign> thro&#x2019; it&#x201D; as I best may.&#x2014; A horse would do me good; but there is no buying of a horse here, especially at this season; there is endless <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] in it besides enormous charges. I think I shall hire myself a <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> or two on horseback: one has the ride for so much money, and no more about it. But indeed the weather as yet is never of the <pb id="pg-11-75" n="11:75"/>favourablest for riding; far too cold, cold enough for the swiftest walking. One way or other, surely I calculate on being <hi rend="italic">borne thro&#x2019;</hi>.</p>
<p>Our American <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> have never come, nor do I hear from Emerson, nor of him, except indeed incidentally that he was not well in health,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that again is contradicted or explained. Fraser is very anxious the Book were here, which doubtless it will be, in its own time. Fraser has settled with me, at least drawn up his account of settlement for the French Revolution! He has (who would have thought it?) in clear money resulting from the adventure, &#xa3;130 and odd; but charging me for <hi rend="italic">every</hi> copy I gave away, reduces it to some &#xa3;110, that is clear at any rate. As to the copies charged, he insists, I insist the other way; but I believe I shall yield at last, for there is a kind of shadow of justice in what he says;&#x2014;and besides, <hi rend="italic">any money at all</hi> is beyond my expectation.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TC&#x2019;s comments in <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390204-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <sic><date when="1839-02-05">5 Feb.</date></sic><corr><date when="1839-02-04">4 Feb.</date></corr></ref>, and in his Journal, <date when="1839-02-06">6 Feb.</date> (<ref target="volume-11/lt-18390208-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1839-02-08">8 Feb.</date></ref>).</note> I believe the poor creature Fraser to be as accurate according to the rules of his trade as man could wish; but it is a villainous trade; and what help have we? We have now nearly bargained for printing a new edition of 1500; on the same terms, for Fraser is just as good as any I could get, nay better than almost any, being <hi rend="italic">accurate</hi> in his way. There will be money in this too, if it sell as he confidently hopes, and it costs me <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, not much trouble even, for he engages to have it swiftly printed: then I am to have 500 struck off for the American market, which will cost me almost nothing but the <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> of them, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> will belong all to myself. I think we shall bargain in this manner one of these days.&#x2014; Our <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> has therefore done very well; considering what we expected of it, very well indeed. Praises go for little; but the smallest contribution of <hi rend="italic">solid pudding</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 124.</note> is thankfully received by a man that has it to seek. Yet I have had praises too, of the most amazing not to say ridiculous description. Did not I tell Alick about the Emperor of Dandies, one Count D&#x2019;Orsay, and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> love of me? Well, the man actually arrived here since that, in a chariot splendid as the Sun, that set all the street a-staring; to &#x201C;testify his&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c and really I found him no fool at all, but a man of very considerable faculty in his own fashion; abundant in information, in sarcasm, even in jollity and humour; no bad fellow at all. Jane laughed for two days after at the contrast of me in my plaid dressing-gown, with my grim Presbyterian look, and this beautifullest of tall men, with his velvets, jewels and ambrosial lovelinesses, sitting talking in the friendliest manner to each other!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-76" n="11:76"/>The sheet is done and my time is more than done. I send you that Letter of Mrs Strachey&#x2019;s, the only one I have had from that hand for many years: I hope you will like it better than Jane does, and I do. As for Jane herself, this cold acts severely on her; but she crouches close over the fire; never stirs out, and holds on without damage hitherto. She has been much better all along than in late years. Mrs Welsh writes from Liverpool that she means to be at Templand soon. I suppose you have received the old cloth bag, and wondered over its contents? I had a letter from Grahame of Burnswark, in answer to the Note you had to give him: he seems to have been very unwell poor fellow; I beg the first of you that meets him to present my thanks and kind wishes and remembrances ever as of old.&#x2014; What is become of Geordie Elliott? Alick must tell me both about him, about himself and what concerns you all. Did the Farm of &#x201C;Dykeside&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A farm of ninety acres in Halfmorton parish, Dumfriesshire, advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1839-03-06">6 March</date>.</note> come to anything, or is any other like to do so? Alick said it was a wretched year for farmers; and I can well believe it. Have you been to see Jean yet? I think you will wait, you and Isabella, till the west wind come. I infer that Isabella is considerably better, since she even meditates such a thing.&#x2014; And so here dear Mother I end for today. Remember us in constant affection to all, beginning at Jamie or Tom of Scotsbrig and ending at the farthest outpost. Take care of yourself, dear Mother, and let me hear that you are well again</p>

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>It were much pleasanter to write to you if besides white paper he would leave me something to say. But away he goes, skimming over everything, whipping off the cream of everything, and leaves me nothing but the blue milk to make you a feast of&#x2014; The much best plan for me were to take the start of him, and have the first &#x2018;rush o&#x2019; i tea&#x2019; to myself&#x2014;as I positively design to do in lecture to<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote &#x201C;to&#x201D;; TC crossed this out later with his blue pencil.</note> time when there will be something worth while to tell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I cannot bethink me of one additional piece of news, except that our old friend Jeffrey is made a Grandfather&#x2014; His daughter, <pb id="pg-11-77" n="11:77"/>who, you know, I suppose, is married to a man twice her own age, went to bed the other night after dining out, and before morning had produced a nice little thumping &#x2018;red child&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Empson, b. at 21 Wimpole St., <date when="1839-04-07">7 April</date>, and baptized at Craigcrook, <date when="1839-07-13">13 July</date>.</note>&#x2014;over which of course there is great joy&#x2014; We see Jeffrey often since he came to London and he is very friendly still&#x2014;tho &#x201C;he could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> cut us out of God&#x2019;s Providence.&#x201D; We had a Roman Catholic Frenchman flying about us at a prodigious rate last week but he has left London for the present&#x2014; He told us all about how he went to <hi rend="italic">confession</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and how he had been entirely <hi rend="italic">demoralized</hi> at one period, and was recovered by the spectacle of a holy procession! He seems a very excellent man in his own way&#x2014;but one cannot quite enter into his extasies about white shirts and wax tapers and all that sort of thing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A M. Rio, once very current in London Society; vanished now, many years ago&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390407-JWC-GW-01">JWC to GW, <date when="1839-04-07">7 April</date></ref>, for descriptions of Rio&#x2019;s earlier visits. His final visit was on <date when="1839-04-08">8 April</date>, as described in his Journal: &#x201C;I would like to be able to fix the impressions of my evening at Carlyle&#x2019;s house while they are still fresh. The four hours that I have just spent with him are certainly amongst the best that I have had in London. We have dealt with many grand subjects thoroughly, the Crusades, Dante, the French revolution, the religious future of Europe.&#x201D; Rio then recorded some of these discussions in detail and concluded: &#x201C;He has no sympathy for those who would make of human life a feast and a chain of pleasure. &#x2026; He described to me poetically the effect produced on him by the sight of his birthplace and the bell which had once rung in his infant ears. &#x2026; I spoke to him of my childhood companions, today robust sailors, and with none of the worry or cares that made me weary; &#x2018;that&#x2019;s true,&#x2019; said he, &#x2018;they are the sane beings, solid, and you, you come and wander in their midst like a spectre.&#x2019; / I had not dared ask them the story of their marriage which I had been told was very romantic. It seems that Carlyle was private tutor at her father&#x2019;s house and that their union was strongly opposed by maternal authority. The contrast in the manners and appearance of the married couple and above all in their accent shows, in effect, a disparity in birth. But when the conversation livens up this man with his uneven features, grows like a giant and proves that he belongs <hi rend="italic">to the very first quality of nature&#x2019;s noblemen</hi>&#x201D; [passage trans., but words in italics in English in the original]. Rio&#x2019;s later comment on his friendship with TC was that it was limited by the extreme rarity of TC&#x2019;s visits to the houses that Rio habitually visited (<hi rend="italic">Epilogue &#xE0; l&#x2019;Art Chr&#xE9;tien</hi> 2:334&#x2013;35).</note>&#x2014; I hope you are all well and thinking of me as heretofore with kindness&#x2014;this is cruel weather for Isabella and you and me&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Has anything gone wrong with you? How is it that you do not
write to me?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letters of <date when="1839-03-15">15</date> and <date when="1839-03-19">19 March</date> had not yet arrived.</note> These three or four weeks, I know not whether <hi rend="italic">duly</hi> or not so long, I have been in daily hope of some sign from you; but none comes; not even a Newspaper,&#x2014;open at the ends. The German Translator Mr Dwight mentioned, at the end of a Letter I had not long ago, that you had given a brilliant course of Lectures at Boston, but had been obliged to <hi rend="italic">intermit it on account of illness</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, <date when="1839-03-15">15 March</date>: &#x201C;I advertised, as usual, my winter Course of Lectures, &#x26; it prospered very well. Ten lectures. &#x2026; I designed to add two more, but my lungs played me false with unseasonable inflammations so I discoursed no more on &#x2018;Human Life.&#x2019; Now I am well again&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 217). The lectures were given weekly, with two postponements, from <date when="1838-12-05">5 Dec. 1838</date> to <date when="1839-02-20">20 Feb.</date></note> Bad news indeed, that latter clause; at the same time, it was thrown in so cursorily I would not let myself be much alarmed; and since that, various New England friends have assured me here that there was nothing of great moment in it, that the business was all well over now, and you safe at Concord again. Yet how is it that I do not hear? I will tell you my guess is that those Boston Carlylean <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D;</hi> are to blame. The Printer is slack and lazy as Printers are; and you do not wish to write till you can send some news of him? I will hope and believe that only this is it, till I hear worse.</p>
<p>I sent you a Dumfries Newspaper the other week, for a sign of my existence and anxiety. A certain Mr Ellis of Boston<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Edward Ellis (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>), Unitarian clergyman, historian; pastor of Harvard Unitarian Church, Charlestown, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; first prof. of systematic theology at Harvard Divinity School, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>.

It comes under your address. Nay properly it is my Wife&#x2019;s memorial to your Wife. It is to be hung up in the Concord drawing room.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A print of Guido Reni&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Aurora</hi> (<date when="1613-00-00">1613</date>&#x2013;<date when="1614-00-00">14</date>), on which TC had written: &#x201C;Will the lady of Concord hang this Italian sun-chariot in her drawing-room and, seeing it, think of a household which has good reason to remember hers?&#x201D; Emerson noted in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <date when="1839-06-09">9 June</date>: &#x201C;Guido&#x2019;s Aurora for a morning prayer; so wills and so loves Thomas Carlyle&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Journals</hi>, ed.

<p><pb id="pg-11-80" n="11:80"/>My special cause for writing this day rather than another is the old story, book business. You have brought that upon yourself, my friend; and must do the best you can with it. After all, why should not Letters be on business too? Many a kind thought, uniting man with man, in gratitude and helpfulness, is founded on business. The Speaker at Dartmouth College seems to think it ought to be so. Nor do I dissent.&#x2014; But the case is this, Fraser and I are just about bargaining for a second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi>. He will print 1500 for the English Market, in a somewhat closer style, and sell them here at 24 shillings a copy. His first edition is all gone but some handful; and the man is in haste, and has taken into a mood of hope,&#x2014;for he is weak and aguish, alternating from hot to cold; otherwise, I find, a very accurate creature, and deals in his unjust trade as justly as any other will. He has settled with me; his half-profits amount to some &#xa3;130, which by charging me for every presentation copy he cuts down to somewhere about &#xa3;110; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the lion&#x2019;s share in the gross produce, yet a great share compared with an expectancy no higher than <hi rend="italic">zero!</hi> We continue on the same system for this second adventure; I cannot go hawking about in search of new terms; I might go farther and fare worse. And now comes your part of the affair; in which I would fain have had your counsel; but must ask your help, proceeding with my own light alone. After Fraser&#x2019;s 1500 are printed off, the types remain standing, and I for my own behoof throw off 500 more, designed for your market. Whether 500 are too many or too few I can only guess: if too many we can retain them here and turn them to account; if too few there is no remedy. At all events, costing me only the paper and press-work, there is surely no Pirate in the Union that can <hi rend="italic">undersell</hi> us! Nay, it seems they have a drawback on our taxed paper, sufficient or nearly so to land the cargo at Boston without more charge. You see therefore how it is. Can you find me a Bookseller, as for yourself; he and you can fix what price the ware will carry when you see it. Meanwhile I must have his Title page; I must have his directions (if any be needed); nay, for that matter, you might write a Preface if you liked,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I see not what you have to say, and recommend silence rather! The book is to be in three volumes duodecimo, and we will take care it be fit to shew its face in your market.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This 2d edn. was pbd. in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> by James Fraser, and in Boston by Charles C. Little &#x26; James Brown.</note> A few errors of the press; and one correction (about the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>, which I find lately to be an indisputable falsehood); these are all the changes.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A final para. added to bk. 5, ch. 6 (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 4:242).

I suppose you decipher the matter out of this plastering and smearing; and will do what is needful in it. &#x201C;Great inquiry&#x201D; is made for the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, Fraser says; tho he suspects it may perhaps be but one or two men inquiring <hi rend="italic">often</hi>,&#x2014;the dog!</p>
<p>I am again upon the threshold of extempore lecturing: on &#x201C;the Revolu<supplied>[tions]</supplied> of Modern Europe&#x201D;; Protestantism, 2 lectures; Puritanism 2; French Revolution 2. I almost regret that I had undertaken the thing this year at all; for I am no longer driven by Poverty as heretofore, nay I am richer than I have been for ten years; and have a kind of prospect, for the first time this great while, of being allowed to subsist in this world for the future: a great blessing, perhaps the greatest, when it comes as a novelty! However, I thought it right to keep this Lecture business open, come what might. I care less about it than I did; it is not agony, and wretched trembling to the marrow of the bone, as it was the last two times. I believe, in spite of all my perpetual indigestions and nervous woes, I am actually getting into better health; the weary heart of me is quieter; I wait in silence for the new chapter,&#x2014;feeling truly that we are at the end of one period here. I count it <hi rend="italic">two</hi> in my autobiography: we shall see what the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> is, third there be. But I am in small haste for a third. How true is that of the Old Prophets, &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">word of the Lord</hi> came unto&#x201D; such and such a one!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A common Old Testament opening, as in Jer. 25:3 or Hos. 1:1.</note> When it does not come, both Prophet and Prosaist ought to be thankful (after a sort), and rigorously hold their tongue.&#x2014; Lord Durham&#x2019;s people have come over with golden reports of the Americans, and their brotherly feelings. One Arthur Buller preaches to me, with emphasis, on a quite personal topic till one explodes in laughter to hear him, the good soul: That I, namely, am the most esteemed &#x26;c, and ought to go over and Lecture in all great towns of the union, and make &#x26;c &#x26;c! I really do begin to think of it in this interregnum that I am in. But then my Lectures must be written; but then I must become a <hi rend="italic">hawker,&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott</foreign>!</hi></p>
<p>The people are beginning to quote you here: <foreign><hi rend="italic">tant pis pour eux</hi></foreign> [so much the worse for them]! I have found you in two Cambridge books.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Cambridge books was J.W.

In that letter TC linked Donaldson and Gladstone as both quoting Emerson. Perhaps TC is also thinking here of Gladstone, <hi rend="italic">The State in its Relations with the Church</hi> (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390208-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1839-02-08">8 Feb.</date></ref>), forgetting momentarily that he knew Gladstone was an Oxford man, and that he had not actually seen that book. Otherwise the second book is not identified.</note> A certain Mr Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> M.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There is not a sheet of your large Dumfries paper left; I must write as close as I can, and make you content yourself with this. Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which had been long looked for, came on Friday; it was despatched to Scotsbrig on <date when="1839-04-13">Saturday</date>; and now tomorrow (<date when="1839-04-16">Tuesday</date>) is the Italian Postday again. One requires to lose no time, the letters linger so between Naples and this. Yet the <hi rend="italic">over-lapping</hi> system is not good either. I wish&#x2014;I wish you here nearer hand! But we cannot alter that yet<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>All seems to go well with you, and that not in the passive way, it seems, but in the active. You ought to feel satisfied that you have got so handsomely thro&#x2019; your doctoring business, which seems not to be without complicacy. You did right, I believe, to refuse the &#xa3;20: you are there as House-physician, and have no claim to be paid twice.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;At &#xa3;500 a year&#x201D; (note written on MS by A. Carlyle).</note> As for your Duke and his people, I like them better and better, and think we ought all to rejoice for you at getting into such a position. W. Grahame of Burnswark, writing to me lately, a most copious wide-flowing <pb id="pg-11-83" n="11:83"/>epistle, speaks more golden hopes about the business. Without believing in these altogether, we may well conclude that it is and promises to be a thing good and not evil. You have to do your best and faithfullest in it for the actual day; and let tomorrow take care of itself. Poor Grahame, by the bye, seems to have been very sickly (bad virulent cold &#x26;c) thro&#x2019; winter, and the bitter barren weather still afflicts him, both &#x201C;for self and cattle&#x201D;; I had written a little Note to apologize for my long silence; what more can I do? A Letter from your hand would give the good man evidently great pleasure: a good man tho&#x2019; a wearisome. He sent me no news except from Burnswark: but I had a Letter from Jean not many days since; and yesterday (<date when="1839-04-14">Sunday</date> as it was, for we have an <hi rend="italic">evening</hi> Liverpool mail now, and Postie often pretermits on Saturday night) there came a Newspaper from Alick with strokes on it,&#x2014;to announce, as preconcerted, that a bag of rubbish, containing your old clothes among other things, had arrived safely. So I conclude there is nothing material out of order. Jean described my Mother as having suffered somewhat from rheumatism and toothache, but as &#x201C;mostly out of it now&#x201D;; a vague statement, which I the rather interpret favourably as there was talk withal of Isabella and our Mother coming up to Dumfries so soon as the weather softened. Isabella too must be therefore better. I write about four letters for one that I receive; my tidings are always rather scanty; but one knows how they are situated, poor things. Jean and Jamie Aitken appeared to be getting on in the old favourable way. Austin, who has more work this year, was looking out for a Farm; but had come to no result at that date; Alick says there will be plenty of Farms in another year, so wide is the ruin among that class. Jenny from Manchester complained, Jean says, of the wretchedness, discomfort and distress of Manchester; which acts upon their business too, and renders that horrid chaos unpleasanter to her, unpleasant even to Rob if he could see any outlook elsewhere. The distress indeed I believe to be great and universal in this land at present; and some are beginning to predict now a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> year of dearth, so bleak is our spring hitherto.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The English spring weather was &#x201C;favourable&#x201D; for an &#x201C;abundant harvest&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-04-30">30 April</date>), but Dumfriesshire had just suffered bad snowstorms (<hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Courant</hi>, <date when="1839-04-11">11 April</date>).</note> Many thousands of operatives in the North are getting pikes and pistols,&#x2014;poor wretches, their heart is bitter, their case is hard and hopeless. They have a &#x201C;Convention&#x201D; sitting here, but going fast or perhaps already gone to dissolution and nonentity, I understand.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the convention, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March</date></ref>. On <date when="1839-04-01">1 April</date>, in Edinburgh, the Chartists had taken over a public meeting called to support the government, and, in Devizes, there had been a riot against a Chartist demonstration in the town. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-04-02">2 April</date>, carried reports of the manufacturing and buying of weapons, &#x201C;chiefly pikes,&#x201D; and the carrying of &#x201C;pikes, spears, and fire-arms&#x201D; at a meeting.</note> People ought to bundle that can; <pb id="pg-11-84" n="11:84"/>and leave a Country where blood and confusion seem inevitable before very long. Enough of that.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh left us some three weeks ago; she is still in Liverpool we understand, but bound soon for Templand, whither she wishes us greatly to come for the summer. She got better on here than her wont, tho&#x2019; rather sickly all the time. Jane, in spite of the venom of East wind continually prevailing, still keeps and has kept on foot, tho&#x2019; not stirring out almost at all, till two days ago: she has not coughed; she is evidently much stronger than of late years. As for me, my Lectures are coming on! The first Wednesday of May I begin, in the old place at 3 o&#x2019;clock, then on Saturdays and Wednesdays, till I get six Lectures done. The Prospectuses are out and circulating; I have given away 15 tickets, I think; the number sold, still more the number saleable, is not ascertained yet. The subject is what I described to you: Revolutions of Modern Europe. On the whole my hopes are of the lowest; neither indeed was I <hi rend="italic">forced</hi>, this year, to try the thing, having bread independently of it; however, it would have been improvident not to keep such a resource open. I shall be satisfied with a small success; nay not dissatisfied with no success at all, for I believe I shall get lived otherwise, and the thing is amazingly disagreeable to me. Meanwhile I do not <supplied>[feel?]</supplied> altogether such a despicable shivering of cowardice (the most insupportable feeling I ever had) as attended me last year and the former year: some way or other I doubt not to get thro&#x2019; it; and perhaps it may be for the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> time,&#x2014;at least till I get some inward call to speak. Before the next Naples Letter can arrive, I hope to have &#x201C;weltered thro&#x2019;,&#x201D; and be on dry land again better or worse. Courage! No horse seems to be procurable, the expense is so enormous: two guineas per week for the mere loan of a horse, and you keep him yourself! I mean to hire me a <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> or two, for really I have need of it, even thrift prescribes it. The Eastwinds, <foreign><hi rend="italic">barking</hi></foreign> [drying out] one&#x2019;s poor skin, produce an ill effect even on peripatetic me; I have to swallow pills occasionally, I am sick on that account even now. My life passes in continual considerable pain, yet I do believe I am getting irresistibly into better health; my temper is far quieter, my view clearer, tho&#x2019; as yet a view into mere vacancy and silence. The word <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come to me, I suppose, when its time arrives. I thank God I am no longer hurried on by a panting necessity to speak; I prefer entire silence to any kind of speech offered me at present, and by Heaven&#x2019;s great blessing can <pb id="pg-11-85" n="11:85"/>indulge in silence. Arthur Buller, returned from America and the Durham mission some time ago, preaches loudly the necessity of my going to lecture in America: in all towns he hears from the best judges I am &#x201C;the most popular author they have,&#x201D; I might &#x201C;make a fortune in&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> To which I reply in banter and laughter. Yet if one could make once for all a couple of thousand pounds; and retire to the back of a stiff-trotting horse, to green fields, free air and one&#x2019;s own reflexions, out of this <hi rend="italic">Malebolga</hi> forever and a day? I do not altogether reject the thing as I was wont; all manner of Americans invite me too, and advise me. Could one not write a dozen Lectures (I find I could quite easily) and hawk them like a mountebank for one time and no more in one&#x2019;s life! We shall keep it at least as a resource in the background, ready for any Autumn that may be ready for it. Fraser and I have as good as settled: he has actually money for me; some &#xa3;130, which by charging me 22/6 for <hi rend="italic">every</hi> presentation copy he scrapes down to some &#xa3;110; but actually that does remain! He has sold all to 30 copies; will hold all as sold if I print a new edition with him forthwith. I believe we shall in fact be at press accordingly, before you write again. He offers to do 1500, in a rather smaller size, price 24/, for the English market, at half profits; then I am to strike off 500, which will cost me only paper and presswork, for the Yankee public. I have written to Emerson about it; I find that it will be far more eligible to take this safe ground than venture my own cash in printing an edition of my own; nearly all the cash I have, thrown into an element so treacherous, so foreign to me. Fraser I do understand to be one of the most punctual creatures alive; I will hold by him, I think, rather than go higgling into the world again, with perhaps no better result at last. The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> are not come, nor do I hear of them; Fraser says they are often asked for, that it is not doubtful they will sell. This therefore do all right, and far beyond our calculations, this of the Authorcraft. My heart silently thanks Heaven that I was not tried beyond what I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> bear. It is quite a new sensation, and one of the most blessed in that case, that you will actually be allowed to live <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a beggar! As to the &#x201C;praise&#x201D; &#x26;c I think it will not hurt me much; I can see too well what the meaning of that is, I have too faithful a <hi rend="italic">dyspepsia</hi> working continually in monition of me, were there nothing more. Nevertheless I must tell you of the strangest compliment of all, which occurred since I wrote last: the advent of Count d&#x2019;Orsay to compliment! About a fortnight ago, this Phoebus Apollo of Dandyism, escorted by poor little Chorley, actually came whirling hither, in a chariot that struck all Chelsea into mute dazzlement with splendour. Chorley&#x2019;s under jaw went like the hopper or under-riddle of a pair of fanners, such was his terror at <pb id="pg-11-86" n="11:86"/>bringing such a Splendour into actual contact with such a Grimness; nevertheless we did amazingly well, the Count and I. He is a tall fellow of six feet three, built like a tower, with floods of dark auburn hair, with a beauty, with an adornment&#x2014;unsurpassable on this Planet! Withal a rather substantial fellow at bottom, by no means without insight, without fuss and a sort of rough sarcasm rather striking out of such a porcelain figure: he said in looking at Shelley&#x2019;s bust, in his French accent: &#x201C;Ah! It is one of those faces <hi rend="italic">who weesh</hi> to swallow their <hi rend="italic">chin!</hi>&#x201D; His Mother&#x2019;s cousin was the Madame Crawford of the rue de Clichy, where Marie Antoinette hid her <hi rend="italic">Varennes</hi> Coach, if you remember;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 3:159, although TC there refers to &#x201C;Madame Sullivan&#x2019;s, in the Rue de Clichy.&#x201D;</note> he admired &#x201C;the fine epic&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c; hoped I would call soon, and &#x201C;see Lady Blessington&#x201D; withal!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC met Lady Blessington in <date when="1839-05-00">May</date>.</note> Finally he went his way, and Chorley with reassured jaw. Jane laughed for two days at the contrast of my plaid dressinggown, bilious iron countenance, and this Paphian apparition. I did not call till the other day, I found d&#x2019;Orsay out, or going out, and left my card merely. I refused to dine at Chorley&#x2019;s &#x201C;to meet him&#x201D; this week&#x2014;mindful of my Lectures. I in fact do not see well what of good I can get by &#x201C;meeting him&#x201D; much; or Lady B. and Demirepdom,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I should not object to see it once, and then oftener if agreeable. But the Lectures, the East-winds! I have executed hardly more than one late dinner (it was with Macready; Buller, Fonblanque, Martineau &#x26;c), and it hangs by me <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>, I think, in the fourth week. I went to Lord Northampton&#x2019;s Royal Society <foreign>Soiree</foreign> on Saturday last,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-04-13">13 April</date>. Lord Northampton (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390117-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1839-01-17">17 Jan.</date></ref>) had become pres. of the Royal Society in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>.</note> for the first time (him I had seen at the Marshalls&#x2019;s; a man not entirely unlike Rob Scott the Blacksmith,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Scott of Ecclefechan.</note> but cleaner): some 200 or so, all science and much fashion,&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">vanitas vanitatum</hi></foreign> [vanity of vanities],<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 1:2.</note> not likely to tempt me again. I spoke to Sir James Clark about your Packet; he supposed it was a certain <hi rend="italic">Visi&#x2019;s</hi> medical pamphlet,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> and bade me say he had now <hi rend="italic">got</hi> it from some other Anglo Italian. Sir James has got into a scrape lately and led the Queenkin into one; mistaking the wind and protuberance of a certain maid of honour&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">digestive</hi> apparatus for something in the <hi rend="italic">generative</hi> (<foreign>Gott im Himmel</foreign> [God in Heaven]!), and quite roughly requesting said maid of honour to <hi rend="italic">confess!</hi> The little Queen behaved like a hapless little fool,&#x2014;and indeed looks like one now (very strikingly since last year, to my sense), and

In <date when="1839-03-00">March</date>, newspapers had pbd. letters from Lady Flora&#x2019;s family, which was Tory, proclaiming her innocence as a means of attacking Melbourne and the Whig govt. The Marchioness of Hastings, Lady Flora&#x2019;s mother, had already demanded Sir James&#x2019;s resignation. Victoria&#x2019;s suspicion of her own mother, the Duchess of Kent, undoubtedly contributed to her incapacity to believe firmly in Lady Flora&#x2019;s innocence. She and Melbourne, who also mismanaged the affair, were hissed in public. When Lady Flora d. on <date when="1839-07-05">5 July</date> she was proclaimed, by the Tory <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>, as &#x201C;the victim of the Ladies and Physician of the Royal Household&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-07-08">8 July</date>).

<salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Some four days ago I wrote you a long Letter, rather expressive of anxiety about you; it will probably come to hand along with this. I had heard vaguely that you were unwell, and wondered why you did not write. Happily that point is as good as settled now, even by your silence about it. I have, half an hour ago, received your Concord Letter of the <date when="1839-03-19">19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of March</date>; the Letter you speak of there as &#x201C;written last Saturday&#x201D; has not yet made its appearance, but may be looked for now shortly: as there is no mention here of any mischance, except the shortcoming of Printers&#x2019; copy, I infer that all else is in a tolerably correct state; I wait patiently for the &#x201C;last Saturday&#x201D; tidings, and will answer as to the matter of copy, in good heart, without loss of a moment.</p>
<p>There is nothing of the manuscript sort in Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh&#x2019;s repositories<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forty pages were needed to make vol. 4 the same length (390 pages) as vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Miscellanies</hi>. Emerson could only think of adding &#x201C;Varnhagen von Ense&#x2019;s Memoirs&#x201D; (see below) but &#x201C;Stearns Wheeler dreams that it is possible to draw at this eleventh hour some possible manuscript out of the unedited treasures of Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh&#x2019;s cabinets&#x201D; (<date when="1839-03-19">19 March</date>, Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 219).</note> that would suit you well; nothing at all in a completed state, except a long rigmarole dissertation (in a crabbed sardonic vein) about the early History of the Teutonic kindred, wriggling itself along not in the best style thro&#x2019; Proverb lore, and I know not what, till it end (if my memory serve) in a kind of Essay on the <hi rend="italic">Minnesingers</hi>. It was written almost ten years ago, and never contented me well. It formed part of a lucklessly projected &#x201C;History of German Literature,&#x201D; subsequent portions of which, the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Reinecke Fox</hi>, you <pb id="pg-11-90" n="11:90"/>have already printed. The unfortunate &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Cabinet Library</hi> Editor,&#x201D; or whatever his title was, broke down; and I let him off,&#x2014;without paying me; and this alone remains of the misventure; a thing not fit for you, nor indeed at bottom for anybody, tho&#x2019; I have never burnt it <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1829-08-00">Aug. 1829</date>, William Fraser, in partnership with Whittaker &#x26; Co., had approached TC to write the work &#x201C;for some &#x2018;Cabinet Library&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18291221-TC-DA-01"><sic>5:44</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1829-12-21">21 Dec.</date></corr></ref>); in <date when="1830-01-00">Jan. 1830</date> it was agreed on, and was to be in four small vols. on the history of German Literature (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18300126-TC-DA-01"><sic>5:59</sic><corr>TC to DA, <date when="1830-01-26">26 Jan.</date></corr></ref>); by <date when="1830-05-00">May</date> the first vol. was finished and sent to London; progress on the second vol. was interrupted by the death of TC&#x2019;s sister, Margaret, and he had written only half when the publishing arrangements collapsed (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18300724-TC-WT-01"><sic>5:125</sic><corr>TC to WT, <date when="1830-07-24">24 July</date></corr></ref>). In <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, TC wrote two articles using the unpbd. history, &#x201C;The Nibelungen Lied&#x201D; and &#x201C;Early German Literature,&#x201D; for the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> respectively (which Emerson had printed in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> in vol. 2 of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>). The project was then suggested in <date when="1832-01-00">Jan. 1832</date> for one of Dionysius Lardner&#x2019;s Cabinet series, but this also fell through (<ref target="volume-06/lt-18320110-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:86</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-10">10 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>). TC&#x2019;s tight-lipped account here probably conceals his sharp disappointment; but its collapse had helped him to make the change from German literature to French literature and history; and he was probably correct in feeling that it would not have been wise for him to try to salvage more from the remaining MS. The MS of much of the first vol. survived and is at Yale; see <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Unfinished History of German Literature</hi>, ed. Hill Shine (Lexington, Ky., <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>).</note> My other manuscripts are scratchings and scrawlings,&#x2014;children&#x2019;s <hi rend="small-caps">in</hi><hi rend="italic">fant</hi> souls weeping, because they never could be born, but were left there whimpering <foreign><hi rend="italic">in limine primo</hi></foreign> [on the very threshold]!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 11:423.</note></p>
<p>On this side therefore is no help. Nevertheless, it seems to me, otherwise there is. <hi rend="italic">Varnhagen</hi> may be printed I think without offence, since there is need of it: if that will make up your fourth volume to a due size, why not? It is the last faint murmur one gives in Periodical Literature, and may indicate the approach of silence and slumber. I know no error of the Press in <hi rend="italic">Varnhagen:</hi> there is one thing about Jean Paul F. Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of humour in his <hi rend="italic">speech</hi>, which somehow I could like to have the opportunity of uttering a word on, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">what</hi> word I see not very well. My notion is partly that V. overstates the thing, taking a Berlin <foreign><hi rend="italic">propos de salon</hi></foreign> [society gossip] for a scientifically accurate record; and partly farther that the defect (if any) was <hi rend="italic">creditable</hi> to Jean Paul, indicating that he talked from the abundance of the heart, not burning himself off in miserable perpetual sputter like a Town-wit, but speaking what he had to say, were it dull were it not dull,&#x2014;for his own satisfaction first of all! If you in a line or two could express at the right point something of that sort, it were well; yet on the whole, if not, there is almost no matter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Varnhagen&#x2019;s comments on Richter, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:94&#x2013;95. Nothing was changed or added by Emerson.</note> Let the whole stand there, as the commencement of slumber and stertorous breathing!</p>
<p>Varnhagen himself will not bring up your fourth volume to the right <pb id="pg-11-91" n="11:91"/>size; hardly beyond 380 pages, I should think; yet what more can be done?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson also repr. TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Petition on the Copyright Bill.&#x201D;</note> Do you remember Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine for <date when="1832-10-00">October 1832</date>, and a Translation there, with Notes, of a thing called Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen?</hi> It is by me; I regard it as a most remarkable piece, well worthy of perusal, especially by all readers of mine. The printing of your Third volume will of course be finished before this Letter arrive; nevertheless I have a plan: That you (as might be done I suppose, by cancelling and reprinting the concluding leaf or leaves) <hi rend="italic">append</hi> the said Translated Tale, in a smaller type, to that volume. It is 21 or 22 pages of Fraser, and will perhaps bring yours up to the mark. Nay indeed there are two other little Translations from Goethe which I reckon good, tho&#x2019; of far less interest than the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi>; I think they are in the <hi rend="italic">Frasers</hi> almost immediately preceding; one of them is called <hi rend="italic">Fragment from Goethe</hi> (if I remember); in his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, it is <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Novelle&#x201D;;</hi> it treats of a visit by some princely household to a strange Mountain ruin or castle, and the catastrophe is the escape of a shew-lion from its booth in the neighbouring Market-Town. I have not the thing here,&#x2014;alas, sinner that I am, it now strikes me that the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">two</hi> other things,&#x201D; are this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing, which my treacherous memory is making into two! This however you will find in the Number immediately, or not far from immediately, preceding that of the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi>; along with which, in the same type with which it would give us letter-press enough. It ought to stand <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen:</hi> read it, and say whether it is worthy or not worthy. Will this <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> do, then? I should really rather <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi> to be printed; and had thoughts of putting at the end of the English <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>. The other I care not for, intrinsically, but think it very beautiful in its kind.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Das M&#xE4;hrchen&#x201D; was trans. in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>, <date when="1832-10-00">Oct. 1832</date>, and &#x201C;Novelle&#x201D; in <date when="1832-11-00">Nov. 1832</date> (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18300831-TC-G-01"><sic>5:156</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1830-08-31">31 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320731-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:195</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-07-31">31 July 1832</date></corr></ref>). Emerson printed them in the Appendix to vol. 4 in the order TC suggests.</note>&#x2014; Some rubbish of my own, in small quantity, exists here and there in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>; one story, entitled <hi rend="italic">Cruthers and Jonson</hi>, was written sixteen years ago, and printed somewhere early (probably the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> year) in that rubbish-heap, with several gross errors of the press (ma<hi rend="italic">r</hi>es for maces was one!): it is the first thing I wrote, or among the very first;&#x2014;otherwise a thing to be kept rather secret, except from the like of you!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JFR-01"><sic>5:127</sic><corr>TC to JFR, <date when="1830-08-06">6 Aug. 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note> This or any other of the &#x201C;original&#x201D; immaturities I will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> recommend as an Appendix; I hope the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">2</hi>M&#xE4;hrchen</hi> and <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">1</hi>Novelle</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC indicates the order in which these two works are to appear by placing the numerals over them.</note> will suffice. But on the whole, to thee, O Friend, and thy <pb id="pg-11-92" n="11:92"/>judgement and decision without appeal I leave it altogether. Say Yes, say No; do what seemeth good to thee.&#x2014; Nay now, writing with the speed of light, another consideration strikes me: why should vol. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be interfered with if it is finished? Why will not this <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> do, these <hi rend="italic">Appendices</hi>, to hang to the skirts of Vol. 4 as well? Perhaps better! The <hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchen</hi> in any case closing the rear. I leave it all to Emerson and Stearns Wheeler, my more than kind Editors: E. knows it better than I; be his decision irrevocable.</p>
<p>This Letter is far too long, but I <hi rend="italic">had not time</hi> to make it shorter.&#x2014; I got <hi rend="italic">your</hi> F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and have seen no other:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably one of the American edn. received before <date when="1838-06-00">June 1838</date>; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380615-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-06-15">15 June 1838</date></ref>.</note> my name is on it in your hand. I received Dwight&#x2019;s Book, liked it, and have answered him: a good youth, of the kind you describe; no English man, to my knowledge, has yet uttered as much sense about Goethe and German things. I go this day to settle with Fraser about Printers and a second edition of the Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Book,&#x2014;as specified in the other Letter: 500 copies for America, which are to cost he computes about 2/7, and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Bookseller will bind them, and defy Piracy.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For further details of costs, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390529-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1839-05-29">29 May</date></ref>.</note> My Lectures come on, this day two weeks: O Heaven! <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot &#x201C;speak&#x201D;; I can only gasp and writhe and stutter, a spectacle to gods and fashionables,&#x2014;being forced to it by want of money.

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>Our second lecture <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;transpired&#x201D;</hi> yesterday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-05-04">Sat., 4 May</date>. The lecture was on &#x201C;Protestantism, Faith in the Bible, Luther, Knox, and Gustavus Adolphus,&#x201D; reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1839-05-12">12 May</date>, with the third lecture (on Puritanism and Cromwell); repr. Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:201&#x2013;6.</note> and with surprising success&#x2014;literally surprising&#x2014;for he was imputing the profound attention with which they [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] audience listened, to an awful sympathizing expectation on their part of his momentary, complete break-down, when all at once they broke into loud plaudits, and he thought they must all have gone clean out of their wits!&#x2014; But as does not happen always, the majority were in this instance in the right, and it was <hi rend="italic">he</hi> that was out of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wits to fancy himself making a stupid lecture, when the fact is, he really <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be stupid if it were to save his life&#x2014; The short and the long of it was, he had neglected to take a pill the day before, had neglected to get himself a ride, and was out of spirits at the beginning&#x2014; even I who consider myself a perfectly unprejudiced judge, did not think he was talking his best or anything like his best, but the <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;splendids&#x2019; &#x2018;devilish-fines,&#x2019; &#x2018;most trues&#x2019;</hi> and all that which I heard heartily ejaculated on all sides, showed that it was a sort of mercy in him to come with bowels in a state of derangement, since if his faculties had had full play, the people must have been all sent home in a state of excitment bordering on phrenzy&#x2014; The most practical good feature in the business, was a considerable increase of hearers&#x2014;even since last day&#x2014;the audience seems to me much larger than last year, and even more distinguished&#x2014; The whole street was blocked up with &#x201C;fine yellow (and all other imaginable coloured) deliveries&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Fine yallow <hi rend="italic">de</hi>liveries and a&#x2019;&#x201D;! exclaimed a goosey maid-serv<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at Mainhill, seeing a carriage pass in the distance once (in Little Craw Jean&#x2019;s hearing)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note). The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> remarked: &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle was attended with his usual select audience (though in numbers larger than usual) of literature and fashion, and, assisted with a few memoranda, delivered one of those extempore effusions, full of simple words and strong thoughts&#x201D; (Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:197).</note>&#x2014;and this is more than merely a dangerous flattery to one&#x2019;s vanity&#x2014;the fashionable people here being (unlike our scotch <hi rend="italic">gigmen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gigwomen</hi>) the most open to light (above all to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> light) of any sorts of people one has to do with&#x2014; Even John Knox, tho&#x2019; they must have been very angry at him for demolishing so much beautiful architecture, <pb id="pg-11-94" n="11:94"/>which is quite a passion with the English, they were quite willing to let good be said of, so that it was indisputably true&#x2014;nay it was in reference to Knox that they first applauded yesterday&#x2014; Perhaps his being a Countryman of their favorite Lecturer&#x2019;s might have something to do with it!&#x2014; but we will hope better things tho we thus speak<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Common preacher&#x2019;s phrase in Scotl<hi rend="italic">d</hi>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>You will find nothing about <hi rend="italic">us</hi> in the Examiner of this week&#x2014; Leigh Hunt who writes the notices there did not arrive at the first Lecture in time to make any report of it<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The London edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1839-05-05">5 May</date>, which they had not seen, printed a review (quoted above), presumably by John Forster, on the first lecture: &#x201C;Europe till the <date>Sixteenth Century</date>&#x2014;Catholicism&#x2014;Monarchism&#x2014;Institution and Innovation&#x2014;and the beginnings of Protestantism&#x201D; (Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:197&#x2013;201). John Hunter had noted in his journal: &#x201C;Found the room was filled with &#x2018;good company,&#x2019; the ladies greatly predominating,&#x201D; adding that Craik pointed out to him Edward Sterling and Forster. &#x201C;I also saw Lord Jeffrey, with whom I had a chat after the lecture. &#x2026; Carlyle lectures extemporaneously, as regards composition I mean, and is somewhat <hi rend="italic">costive</hi> and ungainly, but full of matter suggestive of reflection, and opening up some wide and grand views. I still, however, notice a great deficiency in the plastic power. His views are scattered, as it were, and do not cohere or combine into a harmonious whole. As we came out, we met at the door Hunt, whom I had not observed in the room. He told me that an engagement he had had for the day had gone off.&#x201D; Hunter also recorded an evening with the Hunts, the Carlyles, and Craik on Friday, <date when="1839-05-03">3 May</date>, postponed from <date when="1839-05-01">1 May</date> because of TC&#x2019;s lecture. Instead of a reading of Hunt&#x2019;s new tragedy, they sang: &#x201C;Carlyle enjoyed the singing with great gusto, and said he would give any money that he had been thrown into such a situation as would have led to his learning to sing. His wife said that, as it is, he never sings but when he is in absolute despair&#x201D; (W. C. Smith, &#x201C;Reminiscences of Carlyle and Leigh Hunt,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> 23 [<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>]: 101&#x2013;2).</note>&#x2014;having come in an Omnibus which took it in its head to run a race with another Omnibus after a rather novel fashion, that is to say, each trying which should be <hi rend="italic">hindmost</hi>. <hi rend="italic">We</hi> go to Lecture this year very commodiously in what is called a <hi rend="italic">Fly</hi> (a little chaise with one horse) furnished us from a Livery stable hard by at a very moderate rate&#x2014; Yesterday the Woman who keeps these stables<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Nodes, 21 New Manor St., Chelsea.</note> sent us a <hi rend="italic">flunky</hi> more than bargain, in consideration that I was &#x201C;such a very nice Lady&#x201D;&#x2014;showing therein a spirit above slavery and even above <hi rend="italic">Livery</hi>&#x2014; Indeed as a foolish old woman at Dumfries used to say &#x201C;every body is kind to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D; and I take their kindness and am grateful for it without inquiring too closely into their motives&#x2014; Perhaps I am a genius too as well as my Husband&#x2014;indeed I really begin to think so&#x2014; especially since yesterday that I <hi rend="italic">wrote down</hi> a parrot! which was driving us quite desperate with its screaching. Some new neighbours that came a month or two ago brought with them an accumulation of all the things to be guarded against in a London neighbourhood&#x2014;<foreign>viz</foreign> a pianoforte, a lap-dog and a Parrot&#x2014;the two first can be born with as <pb id="pg-11-95" n="11:95"/>they carry on the glory within doors but the Parrot since the fine weather has been holding forth in the Garden under our open windows&#x2014; Yesterday it was more than usually obstreperous&#x2014;so that Carlyle at last fairly sprang to his feet declaring he could &#x201C;neither think nor live&#x201D;&#x2014; Now it was absolutely necessary that he should do both&#x2014;so, forthwith, on the inspiration of conjugal sympathy I wrote a note to the Parrot&#x2019;s mistress (name unknown) and in five minutes after Pretty Polly was carried within and is now screaching from some subterrane<supplied>[an]</supplied> depth whence she is hardly audible&#x2014; Now if you will please to recollect, that at Comely Bank I also <hi rend="italic">wrote down</hi> an Old Maid&#x2019;s house-dog and an only son&#x2019;s pet-bantamcock<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;True instances both; the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of many hundred, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lasted till the very <hi rend="italic">end</hi>&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> you will admit I think that my writings have not been in vain.</p>
<p>My Mother is still in Liverpool, having been detained there by an operation which has to be performed on one of my Uncle&#x2019;s eyes&#x2014; but as he is doing very well I suppose she will now be thinking of Templand&#x2014; she was very happy here last time&#x2014;and very sensible to Carlyle&#x2019;s kind treatment of her&#x2014; He had been &#x201C;every thing&#x201D; she said &#x201C;that heart could desire&#x201D;&#x2014; When I wonder will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> be justified in saying as much of <hi rend="italic">me?</hi> We have blessed weather now which makes me feel as strong again&#x2014; I hope it will have the same effect on Isabella<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Brother Jamie&#x2019;s wife&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014;. We have been very comfortable in our household this long while&#x2014; My little fifeshire Maid grows always the longer the better&#x2014;and never seems to have a thought of leaving us any more than we have of parting with her&#x2014; My kindest love to all the &#x201C;great Nation&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see Gen. 12:2.</note> into which you are grown. <closer><salute>affectionately yours</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute> Here is a long Letter that Jane has written you according to bargain.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390413-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, <sic><date when="1839-04-12">12 April</date></sic><corr><date when="1839-04-13">13 April</date></corr></ref>.</note> I am pretty well; and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in the frightful state of shivering and tremor I experienced last year. My audience is very considerably the best I have at any time had; and this is the more gratifying as none of the Newspaper Editors this year seems to have taken any charge of me,&#x2014;so that private friendship, public puffing or the like has had nothing to do with it; and it is &#x201C;pure natur&#x201D; altogether.&#x2014; The best news of all, however, is that I shall have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> in two weeks!&#x2014; It seems the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> after all <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a report of me this week, in the &#x201C;Sunday Edition&#x201D; of the Paper, that is, the one generally read here; for <hi rend="italic">ours</hi> is published on the Saturday afternoon, the other not till next morning. I will try to get you this too (I have not seen it yet), and send it you today. Also a copy of it to Jack, if it seem worth anything. It is no use troubling your head or his with more; for they are little other than clatters at best, and do &#x201C;neither ill nor good.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I did not get my Scotchman&#x2019;s horse,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.

Tomorrow I have appointed an acquaince [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to ride with me, which <hi rend="italic">binds</hi> me to go: I will make my Stable-Keeper give me a right horse, indeed I think he will be eager to do it.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We have got the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> at last; and read the Report,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-05-08">8 May</date>; a long report on the first lecture by &#x201C;one of the profoundest thinkers and sincerest men now living.&#x201D; There was also a report of the second lecture on <date when="1839-05-10">10 May</date>.</note> which my Wife is determined to clip out and keep. It is a Report worthy of praise, thanks and wonder; looks infinitely better than the poor Lecture itself could pretend to do: and has been made by some art I for one am altogether a stranger to. The &#x201C;mistakes&#x201D; I think are for most part altogether in my favour; in short the whole matter is kind and good. If there appear any more, I will be sturdy-beggar enough to ask you farther either to send us notice of it the night before, that we may apply to our Newsman here in time; or, what would be still better, if it were possible, direct some Newsman to forward us a copy payable on delivery. I find if you do not apply for a Newspaper near the hour of its publication, you lose the faculty of ever getting it at all in this Babylon,&#x2014;by any plan hitherto discoverable by me.</p>
<p>Your anecdote of Cromwell&#x2019;s last moments is touching, and full of significance. I did hope to use it yesterday,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the third lecture on Puritanism and Cromwell, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390505-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, [<date when="1839-05-05">5 May</date>]</ref>.</note> but (by the inexorable clock-hand) was obliged to omit both it and innumerable other things. It were no task at all to speak if one had <hi rend="italic">time</hi> at command. But the time is a condition I have never yet got master of.</p>
<p>Peel, somebody tells me, is come in, and all the Conservatives at his back.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Melbourne had resigned, <date when="1839-05-07">7 May</date>; for details of Peel&#x2019;s attempt to form a Tory government, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May</date></ref>.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [Well and good]!</p>

<salute>Dearest Mother&#x2014;</salute>
<p>&#x2026; Your last Letter is particularly unsatisfactory, scattery &#x201C;to a degree!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;My mother&#x2019;s favourite phrase,&#x201D; <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410108-JWC-SS-01">JWC to <sic>SHS</sic><corr>SS</corr>, <date when="1841-01-08">8 Jan. 1841</date></ref> (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 1:127).</note> as indeed all your Letters from Liverpool have been; but now that you have &#x201C;a bit <foreign>haddin&#x2019;</foreign> [property] o&#x2019; your ain&#x201D; again, I really do pray you to be at leisure, for, &#x201C;depend upon it the slower thou <foreign>gangs</foreign> the sooner thou&#x2019;lt get to thy journey&#x2019;s end.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Annandale farmer&#x2019;s advice to a traveller whom he saw over-driving a very poor horse&#x201D; (A. Carlyle&#x2019;s note).</note> I should have liked to know your mode of travelling; and whether my Uncle was &#x201C;not so well&#x201D; in the eyes or in his general health; and a variety of other things which are left to &#x201C;my own <hi rend="italic">conjectur</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> This the fourth Letter you will please to remember (including the long one to my Uncle) which I have written in Lecture-time, a time of hurry and flurry enough to drive a nervous human being like myself into daily hysterics,&#x2014;if it were not that my will is stronger than my nerves. And this seems to me to deserve an ample and leisurely <hi rend="italic">return</hi>.</p>
<p>To-morrow is last Lecture-day, thank Heaven. Unless he can get <hi rend="italic">hardened</hi> in this trade, he certainly ought to discontinue it; for no gain or <foreign>eclat</foreign> that it can yield, is compensation enough for the martyrdom it is to himself, and thro&#x2019; him to me.&#x2014; To appearance he has got thro&#x2019; the thing this year much more smoothly and quite as brilliantly as last year; but in defect of the usual measure of agitation <hi rend="italic">beforehand</hi>, he has taken to the new and curious crotchet of being ready to hang himself <hi rend="italic">after</hi>, in the idea that he has made &#x201C;a horrible <foreign><hi rend="italic">pluister</hi></foreign> [mess] of it.&#x201D; No demonstrations of the highest satisfaction on the part of his audience can convince him to the contrary; and he remains, under applause that would turn the head of most Lecturers, haunted by the pale ghost of last day&#x2019;s Lecture &#x201C;shaking its gory locks at him&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 3.4.</note> till next day&#x2019;s arrive to take its place and torment him in its turn.&#x2014; &#x201C;Very absurd.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We are suffering sadly from cold; by and by it will be hot enough. And then what is to follow is not yet very clearly apparent. Sometimes Carlyle talks of going to make a lecturing campaign in America this very Autumn; sometimes of taking a house on the seashore; but we are likely, I think, to end in a campaign against Templand,&#x2014;which I should not wonder if in your opinion were the most judicious and natural-looking <pb id="pg-11-99" n="11:99"/>thing we could do.&#x2014; God bless you, my own dear Mother: but you must get yourself right paper, ink and pens, and write world-looking Letters.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Above a week ago the enclosed Letter arrived from Jack <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> it came faster than usual, having travelled direct from Marseilles on the south shore of France. As it contained no special novelty, I judged fittest to wait with it till my Lectures were done. A draft in it for &#xa3;30 I got turned into cash and have the same lying here; our Doctor is to tell me by and by what I am to do with that. I have sent him Newspapers with reports of me both to Rome and to Florence; I do not write yet till I hear from him, or at least get a Roman Newspaper. The probabilities are, I think, that he is in Rome at present; that they will make off into Germany somewhere for the summer. Our Newspapers had a paragraph last week that the Duke was or had been very ill of a &#x201C;yellow fever&#x201D;: this is doubtless the &#x201C;bilious fever&#x201D; which Jack told us of, and which is all well over now.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reported by <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>, <date when="1839-05-16">16 May</date>, and others. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-05-10">10 May</date>, and <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi>, <date when="1839-05-08">8</date> and <date when="1839-05-10">10 May</date>, had carried reports of TC&#x2019;s lectures.</note> We have heard thro&#x2019; the Sterlings and others pretty frequent incidental tidings about our Doctor, of late; and all happily are to the effect that he goes on prosperously, doing well in his vocation. John Sterling came home about two weeks ago; his Brother, the Major Sterling whom Jack&#x2019;s Letter speaks of, is in France now, and expected very soon.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John and Anthony Sterling had met in Rome, <date when="1839-04-02">2 April</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:131, where TC correctly refers to Anthony&#x2019;s rank as capt. John had returned to England because his youngest child, Charles, had d. at Hastings, <date when="1839-03-30">30 March</date>. Anthony and Charlotte Sterling had then gone to Naples. John Sterling wrote, <date when="1839-05-22">22 May</date>, that he had seen &#x201C;a good deal&#x201D; of TC, &#x201C;who strikes me as advanced in tranquillity and in habitual harmony with all God&#x2019;s universe. I heard one of his lectures, which was very good&#x201D; (Richard Chevenix Trench, <hi rend="italic">Letters and Memorials</hi> [London, <date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>] 1:237).</note></p>
<p>But the grand thing at present is the Lectures: how went the Lectures? The Lectures, dear Mother, terminated happily on Saturday last<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1839-05-18">18 May</date>.</note> at half past four O&#x2019;clock. You will get a report of them, I suppose, <pb id="pg-11-100" n="11:100"/>in next Examiner; that is of the last three of them.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May</date>; the fourth, of which the reviewer confessed to missing &#x201C;the greater part,&#x201D; was on &#x201C;English Restoration, Europe till <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>, Voltaire and Arkwright&#x201D;; the fifth, &#x201C;French Revolution, Faith in the Rights of Man, Girondism, France till <date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>, Mirabeau, and Roland&#x201D;; and the sixth, &#x201C;Sansculottism, France till <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>, Robespierre, Danton, Marat, Napoleon, Results and Prospects&#x201D; (repr. Shepherd, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 1:206&#x2013;14).</note> I sent you either two or three daily papers that I got hold of while the business was going; one I think was sent direct, the other two were sent by Liverpool that Mrs Welsh might read them too, by whom I hope they were duly forwarded to you. I doubted not they would interest you. I would have sent you more, but more did not come into my hand or within reach of me: it is a strange place this for papers; all the world is hawking all sorts of papers on the day of their publication, sticking them under your nose wherever you go; and then on the <hi rend="italic">next day</hi> if you happen to ask for one no mortal can instruct you where to get it; nay the chances are that you will not be able to get it by any means whatever (except by accident); the decks are swept clear every day, and all is despatched off &#x201C;into the country sir,&#x201D; or burnt, or otherwise buried under hatches, and no mortal looks as if he had ever heard tell of it in his life! There was a report of one lecture in <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi> too, but Jane clipt it out, and it was of so little significance that I did not think of making any search for a second copy.</p>
<p>I lectured with much less pain this year than on former occasions, and with very kind acceptance from people more distinguished than ever; yet still with a feeling that I was far from the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> lecturing point yet. The main evil of all evils, I believe, was my bodily condition, my want of right health, and composure of nerves. It was like Jim MacDonald<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> in old days running at the Dalton footrace (Alick remembers it), and outstripping all competitors hollow, till his <hi rend="italic">bowels gave way</hi>, and he was forced to retire from the scene, with an exclamation that &#x201C;these cursed <hi rend="italic">greens</hi> were no feeding to run upon!&#x201D; So with me too, I felt as if little more than the third part of myself were ever there, the other two-thirds were sunk down, under obstruction, headache, biliousness, and mere <hi rend="italic">bodily stupidity</hi>. Very hard; but what help? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are there, just with what health you have, and must make that do. My good people seemed perfectly content with me as I was; but I had generally for two days after every Lecture a sentiment of pain and remorse at the poor figure I had made, which to myself seemed very poor. Twice I got on horseback (besides the unsuccessful time), and <foreign><hi rend="italic">spanged</hi></foreign> [leaped] out into the country a dozen of miles the day before lecturing; this both times had a good effect. The last <pb id="pg-11-101" n="11:101"/>lecture but one I had <hi rend="italic">a pill in me</hi>, poor wretch,&#x2014;I thought it was the worst Lecture I had ever made, or among the worst; and was much vexed, and plagued Jane about it, till in self-defence <hi rend="italic">she took a headache</hi>, and I was forced to hold my peace. On Friday however I got again on a swift steed; cantered, and trotted, and galloped, in lonely roads, over green England, like &#x201C;the hind let loose,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 49:21.</note> and returned home much wearied and much benefited, with a feeling that I should not be so stupid on the morrow. On the morrow accordingly (that is, Saturday last) I made much the best lecture of all, and indeed the only good lecture, or rather I should say goodish lecture, I ever had the happiness to deliver. That was really almost pleasant. I got into an Annandale rage at it, I felt myself above it, and stormed and <foreign><hi rend="italic">gollied</hi></foreign> [barked], carrying the whole people triumphantly after me;&#x2014;thinking to myself after I had done, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">There&#x2019;s</hi> for you! If it were not for the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">cursed greens</hi>&#x2019; I could talk a little!&#x201D; And so it ended, handsomely, and I am well thro&#x2019; it once more.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The reviewer noted that it &#x201C;added little new to the one just noticed, but was perhaps the most interesting of the series, from the number of portraits painted&#x201D;; adding, &#x201C;nor can we now take leave of the series &#x2026; without wishing there was an autumn as well as a spring course, to set the heads of his hearers thinking, and their hearts swelling with the love of truth and their species.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; But surely if I ever lecture again, I will decidedly have myself a horse, if I should pay fifty pounds for one&#x2014; Indeed I have almost as good as come to the conclusion that if I live here at all, I simply must have myself a horse to ride; it is the only medicine that will keep me in any kind of tolerable health, the first condition of all good for every man. Thank Heaven, I am no longer entirely unable, either, to venture on such a thing.</p>
<p>The money accounts of these Lectures have not yet come in; but the attendance seemed to be decidedly more numerous than it had ever been: I should guess that, deducting all expenses which are very heavy, there would remain something like &#xa3;200 clear for me,&#x2014;which for 3 weeks is surely not bad wages! Let us be thankful. With my bookseller money, my American money and the rest, I suppose I am decidedly richer at this moment than I have been these dozen years. Indeed I know not that I ever had as much money in my possession before. These tidings, dear Mother, I have sent you without delay; knowing how anxious you would be for them. Out of the money already received I enclose &#xa3;5 to make into five sovereigns for the five women; if Manchester Jenny be with you there will be one for her too;&#x2014;and for my poor Mother, this time, there will be nothing at all, but we will mind <hi rend="italic">her</hi> some other time!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For his sisters-in-law Janet Clow Carlyle and Isabella Calvert Carlyle, and his sisters Mary Austin and Jean Aitken, and either Janet Hanning, or, if Janet was not visiting from Manchester, his mother.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-102" n="11:102"/>I cannot tell you at all today what I am to do for the summer, or how things are to turn. The weather as yet is wholesome and beautiful; I could not be better than here. The printing goes fast on,&#x2014;the Americans have written too that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> do want 500 new copies (of the F. R.) which is precisely the number I had guessed for them. Besides I do not know but I shall actually now begin and write something. In short, dear Mother, I can say no more at all today except send my blessing to one and all of you, and promise to let you hear again before long. Let Alick send me an old Newspaper with one stroke when this comes to hand. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of the old <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicles</hi> (if that still survive) with the report of the first lecture in it, would be very welcome to Jane. But any paper will do. I noticed James Aitken&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">accidental blot</hi> at the sale of Craigenputtoch woods:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About this time TC received a letter on legal questions in connection with &#x201C;the lands of Craigenputtock&#x201D; from JWC&#x2019;s uncle Robert Welsh (<date when="1839-05-14">14 May</date>).</note> the cunning dog!&#x2014; Jane is tolerably well, and will grow better now that <hi rend="italic">she has</hi> the lecturing done. She was down stairs when I came up: if she be not gone out, she will perhaps add a word. Blessings with you all!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours, dear Mother, now and ever.</salute></closer></p>

<p>The last lecture was indeed the most splendid he ever delivered&#x2014; and the People were all in a heart-fever over it&#x2014; On all sides of me people who did not know me, and might therefore be believed, were expressing their raptures audibly&#x2014;One man&#x2014; (a person of originally large fortune which he got thro in an uncommon way, namely in <hi rend="italic">acts of benevolence</hi>)<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> was saying &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a glorious fellow, I love the fellow&#x2019;s very faults&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;while another answered &#x201C;Ay faith is he&#x2014;a fine&#x201D; wild chaotic &#x201C;noble Chap&#x201D; and so on over the whole room&#x2014; In short we left the concern in a sort of whirlwind of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">glory</hi>&#x201D; not without &#x201C;bread&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371225-TC-JOST-01"><sic>9:379</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1837-12-25">25 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; One of the most dashing facts of the day being a Queen&#x2019;s carriage at the door&#x2014;which had come with some of her household&#x2014; Another thing I noticed of a counter-tendency to ones vanity was poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Edward Irving sitting opposite me in her weeds and looking as ugly as sin&#x2014; with sorrowful heart enough I dare say&#x2014;and when I thought of her lot and all the things that must be passing thro her heart to see her husbands old friend there carrying on the glory in his <pb id="pg-11-103" n="11:103"/>turn; while <hi rend="italic">hers!</hi>&#x2014;what was it all come to&#x2014;she seemed to me set there expressly to keep me in mind&#x2014;&#x201C;that I was but a woman like the skeleton which the Egyptians place at table in their feasts to be a memorial of their latter end<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied><note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; Herodotus, <hi rend="italic">History</hi> bk. 2, ch. 78.</note>&#x2014; My love to them all&#x2014;and surely I will write a long letter to Jane before long who is very foolish to imagine I ever had or could have any reason for silence towards her other than my natural dislike to letter-writing</p>

<p>I have many thanks to send for good kind Letter, the pains you took for me, and the affectionate invitation you send.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It will probably seem rather surprising that I of all persons should propose writing for you in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>. Neither do I propose it for a series of times, nor altogether definitely even for one first time. <pb id="pg-11-104" n="11:104"/>For one first time, however, there is in it such a look of possibility that I find it worth while to consult you on the matter.</p>
<p>I have, and have had for many years, a word to speak <hi rend="italic">on the condition of the lower classes</hi> in this country.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380100-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1838-01-00">late Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-03-00">early March 1838</date>]</ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381127-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-11-28">28 Nov. 1838</date></ref>.</note> My notions on this subject differ intensely from those of the speculating radicals, intensely from those of the Whigs: it seems to me the better class of the Conservatives were on the whole the persons to whom it were hopefullest and in many ways fittest to address myself. There are writers in your Review with whom I have a deep sympathy; a Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Mr Sewell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Sewell (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), divine and author. Educated at Oxford; fellow of Exeter College, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>; ordained <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>; Whyte prof. of moral philosophy, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>. He was an early member of the Tractarian Movement but left it in the early <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>s, alienated by its romanizing tendencies. TC possibly refers to Sewell&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Cathedral Establishments,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> 58 (<date when="1837-02-00">Feb. 1837</date>): 196&#x2013;254. Sewell later reviewed &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> 66 (<date when="1840-09-00">Sept. 1840</date>): 446&#x2013;503.</note> in particular whose name I inquired out some years ago, gets in general from me the heartiest, most entire assent all along <hi rend="italic">till we get to the conclusion</hi> he draws, when, strangely enough, I am obliged to answer, &#x201C;Not at all by any means,&#x201D;&#x2014;for most part! On the whole, I think I partly understand what the conditions of this proposed sermon of mine would be; and if you gave me scope I think I could tell my audience a strange thing or two without offence, nay with hope of persuading and interesting certain of them.</p>
<p>At all events, as I said, it is a kind of necessity for me to speak this word, some time or other, somewhere or other; and as I cannot afford to pay for printing pamphlets, or even to write for nothing, I find on looking round me that first of all I ought to ask <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to consider what is feasible about this, and let me know your decision.</p>
<p>I come almost daily into the Piccadilly region, and could give you a meeting anywhere in that quarter, at any house, at any time (about the middle hours of the day) you might please to appoint. At all events, pray consider this proposal not altogether as an intrusion, but at lowest as a proof of something which (I judge very certainly) if you knew it to the bottom would <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be offensive to you.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lockhart&#x2019;s reply not found.

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came yesterday, a day after I had despatched the frank to our Mother: I will answer you today, and send the sheet off at once without waiting for franks. I have very little time; so you will put up with the merely needful.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s draft of &#xa3;30, which I have now the cash for here, which he said he would &#x201C;tell me <hi rend="italic">afterwards how</hi> to dispose of,&#x201D; becomes a plain matter from what you write.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May</date></ref>.</note> The good Doctor! It was one of the charitablest outlays ever made, and a thing worthy of his kind heart to purpose. I shall surely remember him for it, what use soever may turn out to lie in it. Had I possessed such a horse last year and the year before; still better, could I have had the nag sent up to me by post prior to beginning these Lectures,&#x2014;it might have been of eminent service to me! There is no greater possession for one in the world than a kind Brother, than kind Brothers.</p>
<p>As to the <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> advice to be given you at present, I really have got no new light yet, and know not what to say. The very horse, which it seems you already possess, what has become of it, how is it to be supported in the interim? Is it turned loose upon Scotsbrig, and can it in any way work for its victuals there? I am altogether at sea as to my own plans; and see only that such a convenience waiting me will be an additional inducement and incitement towards Scotland, always till I come thither.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh it seems is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got to Templand, as we thought, having been suddenly taken rather unwell at Liverpool on the day she was to have gone. When she will go now has become uncertain again. It is true, that need not operate as any bar upon us, for we could take possession of the premises, with full good will from her, in her absence; yet it does introduce or seem to introduce a kind of additional confusion when all already was confused enough.&#x2014; I have two or three schemes on the anvil, none of which is consistent with my leaving London for a few weeks yet; and indeed while the weather is no hotter than it has yet been, London is as good as any place for me. In truth, I begin to feel as if I had gone <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> long enough now, and discern more or less that I must take to some graver occupation than any I have been concerned in, these two last years. It is a feeling of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> that urges me, happily no longer a feeling of such urgent <hi rend="italic">necessity;</hi>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-11-106" n="11:106"/>and the whole is a proof, I daresay, that with all my bitter biliousness I am really in a sounder state of body and mind than I was in. For the immediate moment I have a kind of Review Article or Pamphlet on my mind, which might occupy me well some weeks, and which I must if not write here, yet get arranged about here, and then set to writing in the country. I have applied accordingly two days ago to Lockhart Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, to ascertain if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> can throw any light on it; I have not yet received any answer. With this, and with a horse and green fields somewhere I could contrive (I calculate) to brush myself up during summer, and get into tolerable condition before autumn. And <hi rend="italic">then</hi>,&#x2014;I think some times I must do one of two things: either buckle to another Book, as I might do under better auspices outwardly than ever heretofore; or else steam myself over to America, in september or so, and set to Lecturing there &#x201C;like a roaring lion&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Pet. 5:8.</note> all over the Union, where it seems possible I should both <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> the art of extempore speaking in public, and also in few months realise a canny purse of money to come home with again! One or other of these two things I feel inclined towards at present; and really have it not any less confusedly before my mind that I here fling it down on paper for you. Some summer months in the country, you see, stand as a fixed preliminary to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> plans of procedure. As to <hi rend="italic">what part</hi> of the country, the schemes and offers are fourfold or fivefold; but Dumfriesshire seems the likeliest of all (tho&#x2019; there are drawbacks against that too), as the place where my Mother and kindred wait to receive me, a place like no other under the sun in that particular! As for Jane she professes her willingness to go with me whithersoever I list; but would not stir out of London (I think) if it were not I that took her. In short, dear Alick, you see it is altogether <supplied>[ly]</supplied>ing in the vague state, and nothing definite can well be predicted out of it yet.</p>
<p>&#x201C;But what am <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to do about the gig?&#x201D; that is your practical question; and I am greatly at a loss what to answer about it, and wish I had not to answer at all. I think however you might look, and ascertain what a good stout, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> altogether ugly, second-hand gig would cost, and if you found one anywhere <hi rend="italic">decidedly cheap</hi>, you might buy it; but if not decidedly cheap, then not to be in haste in buying it. Such a vehicle I suppose could get standing-room where it would take no hurt; and it might be rather useful to our Mother thro&#x2019; the whole year, to whose custody and possession I think it ought to be rigorously consigned. These things cost no tax now; our Mother is not able to move about as of old; and surely it would be a great comfort if by our <pb id="pg-11-107" n="11:107"/>means she could be provided with a convenience of that sort. For the rest, if you buy a gig, let it not be a bad one: it need not be shewy, indeed it should not be so; but decent and substantial and smooth-going, these are the qualities. I must leave it with you, dear Alick, in this vague state; for I feel that whatever I say will be like a <hi rend="italic">precept</hi>, and at the same time that I have no knowledge adequate to giving precepts. You must exercise your own genius, and do the wisest you can.&#x2014; By the bye, is the horse a smart rider? That will be more important than even running in gigs. For I have decided that not only in the country all summer, but here too when I come back, I ought to have continual riding, as the one condition of a supportable state of health, the basis of whatever else is to be done by me.</p>
<p>The frank will have told you all our news. The lecture accounts are not quite settled yet; but I understand the net-produce <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be somewhere just about &#xa3;200, as I anticipated.&#x2014; People have taken to ask me to &#x201C;8 o&#x2019;clock dinners&#x201D; now,&#x2014;two in these four days, which I could not well refuse, which (for one of them was last night) have made me &#x201C;a wreck&#x201D; today. It is very useless to me that kind of civility, or worse than useless; I mean therefore not to go into it, but always to be entirely <hi rend="italic">shy</hi> of it. Indeed the poor nervous-system, both before, during and after such a business, sufficiently admonishes me to be shy.&#x2014; I shall hear from Lockhart in a day or two; and even if I do not hear from him, I will arrange that matter of the &#x201C;article&#x201D; before long. Good be with you; and many thanks to you, my dear Brother, for all the pains you take with me. We shall surely meet this summer too!&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> Two Letters have arrived from you by way of Marseilles, the first some three weeks ago, the last on friday; I take my earliest morning for writing in reply. Your first Letter had a draft for thirty pounds, which I presented at Hoare&#x2019;s Bank,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >37 Fleet St.</note> and got the money for without difficulty: three new ten pound notes, lying now in my drawer, waiting your farther instructions. You have been doubtless in a sad bustle and distress; we had heard, thro&#x2019; the Newspapers, of the poor child&#x2019;s death,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis R. M. D. Scott (b. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), fourth son, d. at Naples, <date when="1839-05-07">7 May</date>, of measles.</note> some two days before your Letter came; a still earlier paragraph gave account of &#x201C;yellow fevers&#x201D; &#x26;c in your household; but we understood that to be nothing but what you had mentioned to us, in milder and truer terms, in your last bulletin. The poor child must have given a sore affliction to you all; yet your sorrow, which can but be professional and of general humanity, is nothing at all to that of the parents. Their &#x201C;thanks&#x201D; in these mournful circumstances must have been very affecting. You must put up with your share in this infliction, whatever it may be; you have been luckier with patients than most Doctors are; and Death is a power that defies all skill. But surely you have not wanted work, this voyage, whatever you have wanted! Nor do I think whatever uneasiness and toil it cost, that such is the worst arrangement for you. A man, in all circumstances, must desire to see himself doing something, assisting in something; a Physician, where no sickness exists, is like a taper burning in day-light.&#x2014; But on the whole, dear Jack, I wish you were fairly away out of all these Italian confusions; it seems to my imagination as if, were you once over the Alps, it would be all well with you,&#x2014;an imagination merely! One would at least know where to address you, how to get answer from you. I have punctually without loss of time obeyed all your directions as to Newspapers and notices, tho&#x2019; with a misgiving <pb id="pg-11-109" n="11:109"/>always that perhaps you might never profit thereby, but only some <foreign><hi rend="italic">oorie</hi></foreign> [dismal] yellow Postmaster beyond seas light his pipe with the &#x201C;two strokes&#x201D;; however, I sent them with what hope I could. A <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> directly on reading your last Letter, went to Naples; two <hi rend="italic">Examiners,</hi> with Lecture Reports, went to Rome, and a third will go to Florence, to conclude the matter, along with this; to Florence I already sent a <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> Newspaper, which had incidentally something of me at the very time I was bound to send at any rate: in short, if you can recollect what orders you gave me, you may calculate that I was faithful to execute them <hi rend="italic">all;</hi> that if disappointment arise, it is the Postmaster&#x2019;s blame not mine. And now with one other Letter from you, we hope the confusion will all be knit up again, and no farther vague shooting at the wind be needed for some time. The lost Roman Letter must be about a year old now; <hi rend="italic">worth</hi>=o.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380714-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-07-14">14 July 1838</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Here in Britain all goes well enough. My Mother sent me a considerable letter since you heard: her health is good; Isabella improves fast, and seems now to be going about again; Jamie, tho&#x2019; his crop was bad, has helped himself thro&#x2019; with livestock which turned out singularly well; Jenny of Manchester, I since hear, has just got over to Scotsbrig with her child to enjoy some summer weather there: in a word, there was nothing at all wrong among them. Alick wrote a Postscript to my Mother&#x2019;s sheet; from which it appeared pretty decidedly that he was prospering in that business of his; making, I think, something not far from &#xa3;100 a year, and standing, they all said, steadily to it. Harkness the Minister was gone to America or somewhither, and now there was prospect of a Preacher in the Meetinghouse; to which, our Mother, with great joy, had returned. Alick wrote a second time, briefly, only three or four days ago&#x2014; Ah, Jack, I see now what the thirty pounds meant! He said you had instructed him before you went last year, to purchase a horse and gig for me, to render my stay in the country profitabler; that he had actually bought a horse (he did not say for what, but it was six years old, like Harry, only bigger and of a &#x201C;dunnish&#x201D; colour); that he thought he could get a gig, and wished to know what, when, and how, he should do in it! My dear Brother, what can I say to you for all this? It seems to me an improvident kindness, too lavish, too&#x2014;but it is very kind. I shall think of it; I should but spoil it by speaking of it. If I have had my sufferings in this world, I ought to feel that I have had my consolations too.&#x2014; To Alick I wrote instantly according to request, but knew not well what to answer. I said I had as good as determined to have a horse to ride on, be or go where I <pb id="pg-11-110" n="11:110"/>might; but then my coming to Scotland, still more my continuance there this summer, was extremely undecided as yet; wherefore as to the gig&#x2014;? I thought on the whole if he found a suitable article <hi rend="italic">clearly cheap</hi> he might purchase it, and &#x201C;consign it rigorously to our Mother,&#x201D; for whom in her old days it might be useful, whom you would like well to think of furnishing in that way. If nothing at once suitable and cheap offered itself, however, he was to wait till he heard. It seemed likeliest of all that the whole household of us, Ellen too, would come up to Templand for a while in summer, but Mrs Welsh was still in Liverpool (and is; not in good case with cold &#x26;c, nor has her Brother been quite well); so that nothing could be fixed hitherto. This was what I answered to Alick, in a very vague manner: what he will spell out of it I do not know.&#x2014; In fact, the weather is still cold here; not till it grow hot need we fly to the fields; after that we can soon pack up and fly. Jane seems to think Templand the eligiblest of all, to which also her Mother was very pressing: in that case, gig and horse will be welcomest of all.</p>
<p>But I am in the last page, and absolutely must turn to London&#x2014; Sorrow on it! here is &#x201C;Mr <hi rend="italic">Creek,</hi> Sir,&#x201D; come to take me out to walk, and it is only noon, &#x26; blue northwind! I suppose I must go. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p><lb/>
<p>6&#xBD; <hi rend="italic">p.m. same day</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>).&#x2014; Craik and I went as far as the extremity of the Regent&#x2019;s Park;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About five mi. walk, N from Cheyne Row.</note> I have dined and had tea, and now set to work again.&#x2014; The Lectures as you infer are over; with tolerable <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE9;clat</hi></foreign>, with a clear gain of very nearly &#xa3;200, which latter is the only altogether comfortable part of the business. My audience was visibly more numerous than ever, and of more distinguished people; my sorrow in delivery was less, my <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi> after delivery was much greater. I gave one very bad lecture (as I thought), the last but one; it was on the French Rev<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> I was dispirited, in miserable health, my audience mainly Tory could not be expected to sympathize with me; in short, I felt, after it was over, &#x201C;like a man that had been robbing hen roosts.&#x201D; In which circumstances, I, the day before my finale,&#x2014;hired a swift horse, galloped out to Harrow and back again, went in <supplied>[a]</supplied> kind of rage to the room next day, and made, on Sansculottism itself, very considerably the nearest appro<supplied>[ach]</supplied> to a good Lecture they ever got of me; carried the whole business glowing after me, and ended half an hour beyond my time with universal decisive applause, sufficient for the occasion. One of my great wants, as I now see, was a swift horse from the very beginning! I had hopes of one, but they misgave; I have got just four rides in all; the first was a failure, my horse refusing to act <pb id="pg-11-111" n="11:111"/>(in my <hi rend="italic">whip</hi>less state; but I took a whip always afterwards), the other three were not failures, but swift gallops to Richmond, to Harrow (as I said), and finally last week to Hampstead, Highgate, Hornsey, in company with Cavaignac who enjoyed it much. They are too dear (some 12/ each) to be repeated now; but I do mean to have a horse when I come back hither next season; I cannot live in any health without one. Another thing I sometimes think of, and that is going out to America this autumn to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> the business of extempore speaking, for I find I have it still to learn! Seriously unless I can take to the writing of some Book, I think I ought. I am well rested now; I feel disposition again to work. We shall see what the summer says to it. Meantime guess what immediate project I am on: that of writing an Article <hi rend="italic">on the Working Classes</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly!</hi> It is verily so: I offered to do the thing for Mill about a year ago; he durst not; I felt a kind of call and monition of duty to do it, wrote to Lockhart accordingly, was altogether invitingly answered, had a long interview with the man yesterday, found him a person of sense, goodbreeding, even kindness, and great consentaneity of opinion with myself on this matter, am to get books from him tomorrow; and so shall forthwith set about telling Conservatives a thing or two about the claims condition, rights and mights of the working orders of men!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390520-TC-JGL-01">TC to JGL, <date when="1839-05-20">20 May</date></ref>.</note> Jane is very glad; partly from a kind of spite at the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bl&#xF6;dsinnigkeit</hi></foreign> [idiocy] of Mill and his wooden set. The Radicals, as they stand now, are dead and gone, I apprehend&#x2014;owing to their heartless stupidity on that very matter. As to poor Mill I cannot be angry with him; but I feel that the Quarterly will suit better for this Article; and indeed that the Mill-Robertson affair will hardly suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for any article at all: let it live, or as rathe<supplied>[r]</supplied> seems likely, die, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> me. Robertson is in Scotland, Mill is not to be home till <date when="1839-07-00">july</date>; I have less and less trade with them, or sympathy with them, in regard to that business of theirs.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill wanted to get rid of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> &#x201C;not only on account of the expense, but the time and exertion,&#x201D; but did not want to &#x201C;drop it without trying to preserve an organ for radicalism by offering it to any radical who would carry it on, on radical lines&#x201D; (to John Robertson, <date when="1839-05-31">31 May</date>; Mineka 13:399). He continued to publish it until vol. 33 (<date when="1840-03-00">March 1840</date>), after which Henry Cole and William E. Hickson took it over as the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review.</hi> Mill admitted to Macvey Napier that &#x201C;there is not room for a fourth political party in this country&#x2014;reckoning the Conservatives, the Whig-Radicals, &#x26; the Chartists as the other three&#x201D; (<date when="1840-04-22">22 April 1840</date>; Mineka 13:430).</note> But as to my <hi rend="italic">Working Classes,</hi> it is not to be out till Autumn that being the time for &#x201C;things requiring thought,&#x201D; as Lockhart says; I shall have much to read and inquire, but in fine I shall get the thing off my hands, and have my heart clear about it. Next time you hear, I shall probably be in the middle of it.</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Having a Letter from John, which perhaps you were not expecting as the last came so recently, I have got a frank to forward it to you at Dumfries: perhaps you may be able to get it forwarded to Annandale directly on the Wednesday; at all events you will find some opportunity soon, and there is, this time, no very breakneck hurry with it.</p>
<p>I have written so often and copiously of late that I suppose you all <pb id="pg-11-115" n="11:115"/>well acquainted with my news; nay indeed the very Newspapers have given you notice enough of me. The Lectures, thank Heaven, are over, in a very tolerable sort of way; and have left me bilious indeed, yet not nearly in so wrecked a state as the last two years. My nerves are <hi rend="italic">quiter</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>];&#x2014;ah, I was in a frightful ferment on those two last occasions; half out of my wits, with fret, ex<supplied>[c]</supplied>itation, toil and misery! I begin to have the feeling of a sane man now again.</p>
<p>James&#x2019;s cunning blot of ink over the Puttoch larch-cuttings did not escape me; I am very glad to think the poor woods <hi rend="italic">have</hi> actually got air now, and are put into a reasonable [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The woods at Craigenputtoch had been thinned.</note> I am very much obliged to James for his punctuality, for all the trouble he takes to serve me. I suppose this is his busiest season too; in which he has very little time to spare from his own affairs. He was from home when the last <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> came off, I think: the writing seemed not to be his but Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their cousin; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351021-TC-HI-01"><sic>8:235</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1835-10-21">21 Oct. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Mrs Welsh still remains at Liverpool; not very well in health, tho&#x2019; decidedly getting better: her passage was once taken in the Steamer, or about to be taken; when on the day of sailing she grew suddenly rather ill. We have a considerable notion here of removing bodily to Templand this summer for a month or two: warm weather has come back this morning; such weather as would very soon make London too hot for me as one individual! But I have partly undertaken to write a Review Article the next thing I do, on the <hi rend="italic">State of the Working People,</hi> and tho&#x2019; I could write it in the country, I must have books gathered and settlements made respecting it, before I quit town.&#x2014; This time of the year is precisely the heyday of London. Perhaps 100,000 additional people crowd into it, in <date when="1839-05-00">May</date> and <date when="1839-06-00">June</date>, from all parts of England and the world. The Religious people hold meetings incessantly; the fashionable people dine and dance; the &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short it is one enormous beehive of human creatures, all buzzing their loudest in the burning weather; and so they buz&#x2014;till about the end of <date when="1839-07-00">July</date> all of them are nearly dead with waste and weariness, and glad to fly into the country and hide themselves&#x2014;as dull as ditchwater! I do not admire their ways of proceeding at all.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s news of his having bought a Horse for us, of his being about to buy a Gig, was very surprising. I have written to Jack this very day to apprise him how it stands, to thank the good soul for his kindness in it. I think it likeliest that we shall go to Templand, and that before long: in which case no article whatever could be more essential for me than a horse to ride. With this, and a Gig to drive the Wife to and <pb id="pg-11-116" n="11:116"/>fro in, one would be well provided for in rusticating. The country hereabouts, so long as there falls <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> enough, is among the beautifullest I ever saw; an ocean of wavy greenness,&#x2014;quite blessed to get into out of the dust-whirlpool: the only thing one wants is the clear-gushing streams, with their music, which never fail us in the North;&#x2014; here there are nothing but drab-coloured ditches instead. It is a beautiful country: but to me no country is or can be equal to my own, for tarrying in. I hope to write before long, telling you that we are positively coming, and when. Jack, I expect, will be for some German expedition for me in his next Letter; and that too of course has its recommendations to me; but I do not think it can really take effect this year. Nay they seem to be in considerable trouble and sickness themselves, and one knows not what their own arrangements will be.</p>
<p>We go on with our printing as zealously as may be, the printer-men often flying off, as their wont is, into drink. Besides they tell me they have broken their steam-engine! In a word, it is very clear they will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have done, as they promised, at the end of <date when="1839-06-00">June</date>; we may give them till the end of <date when="1839-07-00">July</date>, I apprehend. I will not wait here a day for <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. The Americans write to me that they even now want 500 new copies, which is just the number I had by guess assigned them. We print 2,000 copies in all; 1500 of them for England: I make few or no changes. The Miscellanies are coming in two divisions; the first must have been at sea since the <date when="1839-04-00">end of April</date>, and ought to be near these shores now; the second (that is, volumes 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>) were to be a month later. Fraser advises not to begin the sale at all till the whole arrive; in which judgement I agree.</p>
<p>Jenny of Manchester will come up to see you, doubtless: she is well out of the huge spinning-mill in this bright weather, and should stay as long as she possibly can. I received an old Newspaper from Alick today, indicating that my last letter had come safely. Nothing has given me more satisfaction for a long time than to hear and perceive that Alick was prospering in his place yonder. Let him keep his shop, and his shop will keep him. Poor Dillick, he has had a good deal of beating about for many a year now: but, as the Proverb says, &#x201C;it is a long lane that has no turn.&#x201D;&#x2014; Jane is pretty well in general, and indeed fears nothing in warm weather: however, today she is a little out of order; and can only send you her love (she says) without writing anything. My Mother was well when she wrote,&#x2014;good news always. Isabella too seems to be fast getting round. I infer that there is no Farm yet for Austin and Mary: they must be patient; a time is coming.&#x2014; Are your two <foreign>Bairns</foreign> in good order?

<salute>My dear Alick,</salute>
<p>I do not find that I have a single word to say to you today: but the frank will carry another bit of paper, and that may as well go with a salutation to you as not.</p>
<p>The Letter I wrote the other day was, I daresay, one of the most confused; but it was only the better emblem of my own state on that account: you would be able to spell out of it some reasonable scheme for your own procedure if you went to Carlisle on saturday. I have written a Letter to Jack, which is still lying here; unfolding the condition of the matter. If you actually get a Gig, it will be interesting news to me; especially I want to know if the new Horse be a smart trotter? Nothing in all the Physician&#x2019;s pharmacopeia is worth naming beside that for me.</p>
<p>You will find by Jean&#x2019;s Letter that I have in view to write an Article on the Poor People. I have long felt a kind of obligation to do it. I offered last year to Mill, but he refused unless I would come to the conclusion that <hi rend="italic">their situation was gradually improving!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A question argued in the second ch. of <hi rend="italic">Chartism,</hi> &#x201C;Statistics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:124&#x2013;29.</note> I did not think him wise in that refusal, but I said nothing. This present Article I partly intend for Lockhart and the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi> the organ of the Tories. Lockhart I have seen and talked with about it; he is a man of sense and breeding, very anxious to have me write the thing if it can at all be made to suit; which I think it may really be; for it is a plain truth to me that I have found among the Tories, the best kind of Tories, far more fellow-feeling <supplied>[for the]</supplied> Poor, than among that rubbish of Radicalism, which in general has sympathy with nothing but its own self-conceit.&#x2014; The Article will cost me a good deal of reading and trouble; but I can take plenty of time for it; there will be no printing till some time in Autumn. It will be a matter well off my hand at any rate; for I have really had a kind of conscience about it for a good while, and felt as if I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to write it.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-118" n="11:118"/>My Mother has got little from me but Newspapers of late; I hope to write to her again before very long.&#x2014; We rejoice much in the account you give of your business, of your prospering in it. That is a very tolerable income, it seems to me; far beyond what one could have expected; and a kind of life, not indeed without its vexations, but perhaps freer from them than most.&#x2014; Good be with you my dear Brother.

<salute>Dear Mrs Rich,</salute>
<p>If you have that Letter still about you which Admiral Griffiths wrote me concerning the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>, it would be very useful at present.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the letter from Anselm John Griffiths pbd. in the article, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:217&#x2013;18.</note> I think I remember giving it you at one of Darwin&#x2019;s reunions a good while ago; and I do not remember getting it back. I am now drawing up a formal contradiction of that piece of rhodomontade; to be published in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, that it may be referred to in the new edition of the F.

<p>If you cannot lay your hand on the Letter, never mind; I shall manage without it.&#x2014; Mrs Wedgwood was to tell you about it; but, I daresay, forgot. How can <hi rend="italic">I</hi> complain? Wedgwood&#x2019;s Newspaper, which he left me to read, was carried off next morning by the maid into some orderly receptacle (under Pianos or elsewhere), and came flashing thro&#x2019; my memory for the first time the day before yesterday in Sloane Street;&#x2014;so that I can only send it off along with this! We are all fallible creatures.</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, dated Boston <date when="1839-04-20">20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> April</date>, has been here for some two weeks. Miss Sedgwick,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Maria Sedgwick (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>), introduced by Emerson, <date when="1839-04-20">20 April</date>, as &#x201C;the writer of affectionate New England tales&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 227&#x2013;28). The most recent of her domestic novels was <hi rend="italic">The Linwoods; or, &#x201C;Sixty Years Since&#x201D; in America</hi> (New York, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>). She did not arrive in Portsmouth until <date when="1839-06-04">4 June</date>, and was in London, <date when="1839-06-14">14 June</date> to <date when="1839-07-09">9 July</date>, before continuing her <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date> tour on the continent.</note> whom it taught us to expect in &#x201C;about a fortnight,&#x201D; has yet given no note of herself, but shall be right welcome whenever she appears. Miss Martineau&#x2019;s absence (she is in Switzerland this summer) will probably be a loss to the fair Pilgrim;&#x2014;which of course the rest of us ought to exert ourselves to make good.</p>
<p>Your Bookseller&#x2019;s Proposition as to the stereotype edition of the F. R. will already have become void for you by intelligence arrived before this at Concord. I gave up the stereotype speculation, the plan of printing at my own expence at all; the estimates indicated too much cost: it would have been a throwing of all the money I had yet got out of this Book, and more, anew into the melting-pot,&#x2014;with bookseller alchymists to manage the projection (at a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> charge of 42 per cent), I myself understanding nothing of it. The comfort is that by this new method with Fraser I cannot lose; the past is safe, and for the future also the poor man is like to do something. My satisfaction from your news, however, is, that 500 copies are actually wanted for the American market; precisely the number now, by guess, getting ready for that. I, along with this letter, despatch you a perfect sheet of the new edition, by way of specimen; the 500 New-England and 1500 Old-England copies are printed <hi rend="italic">so</hi>. There are to be, it is computed, 47 sheets; to make three volumes, which Fraser will sell here at 24/; some 7 shillings cheaper than the former. His estimate of cost has risen a little, by some change of paper and figure; I find these 500 copies, as they leave the Printers&#x2019; warehouse, unbound, 47 sheets each, will cost me 3/6 each, or within a penny or so of that. It is said there is some kind of drawback on our taxed paper, which will perhaps carry the commodity over to Boston or nearly so. Between 3 and 4 shillings, prime cost; that is the best guess we can make.</p>
<p>Now, my friend, the thing I want you to do is to present this specimen sheet to a Bookseller, make a bargain with him, and send me his <pb id="pg-11-120" n="11:120"/>name to put on the title-page.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1839-05-15">15 May</date>, crossing with this letter, told TC that C. C. Little &#x26; James Brown, Boston, would gladly take &#x201C;500 American Copies of the History&#x201D; and add their name as well as Fraser&#x2019;s to the title page (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 232).</note> Such a task is rather shameful on my part, I fear;&#x2014;but how can I help it? You yourself opened this American silver-vein for me; hitherto America has paid me in the proportion of 3, while England paid only 2. On the whole, however, if you cannot do any good, bargaining, pray give it up, and I will keep these 500 copies here, and, putting the English title-page on them, let them go into Fraser&#x2019;s general stock and sell as they can.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; As to the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, Fraser will not start selling till all the four volumes are here. He requests greatly that your Binder would take pains to bind the two last volumes <hi rend="italic">exactly like</hi> the first two. The first two ought to be near our shores by this time; the last two will follow as they can: it seems to be little matter whether they arrive in what is cal<supplied>[l]</supplied>ed &#x201C;the season,&#x201D; or not.</p>
<p>My Lectures are happily over ten days ago; with &#x201C;success&#x201D; enough, as it is called; the only <hi rend="italic">valuable</hi> part of which is some &#xa3;200, gained with great pain, but also with great brevity:&#x2014;economical respite for another solar year! The people were boundlessly tolerant; my agitation beforehand was less this year, my remorse afterwards proportionally greater. There was but one moderately good Lecture, the last,&#x2014;on Sansculottism, to an audience mostly Tory, and rustling with the beautifullest quality silks! Two things I find: first that I <hi rend="italic">ought to have had a horse;</hi> I had only three incidental rides or gallops, hired rides; my horse <hi rend="italic">Yankee</hi> is never yet purchased, but it shall be, for I cannot live, except in great pain, without a horse. It was sweet beyond measure to escape out of the dust-whirlpool here, and <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>, in solitude, thro&#x2019; the ocean of verdure and splendour, as far as Harrow and back again; and one&#x2019;s nerves were <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> next day, and words lying in one like water in a well. But the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> thing I found was, that extempore Speaking, especially in the way of Lecture, is an <hi rend="italic">art</hi> or craft, and requires an apprenticeship, which I have never served. Repeatedly it has come into my head that I should go to America, <supplied>[this]</supplied> very Fall, and belecture you from North to South till I learn it! Such a thing do<supplied>[es]</supplied> lie in the bottom-scenes, should hard come to hard; and looks pleasant enough.&#x2014; On the whole, I say sometimes, I must either begin a Book, or do it. Books are the lasting thing; Lectures are like corn ground into flour; there are loaves for today, but no wheat harvests for next year. Rudiments of a new Book (thank Heaven!) do sometimes disclose themselves in me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festinare lente</hi></foreign> [To hasten slowly]. It ought to be better than the F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; I mean better written. The greater part of that Book, <pb id="pg-11-121" n="11:121"/>as I read proofsheets of it in these weeks, does nothing but <hi rend="italic">disgust</hi> me. And yet it was, as nearly as was good, the utmost that lay in me. I should not like to be nearer killed with any other Book!&#x2014; Books too are a triviality. Life alone is great; with its infinite spaces, its everlasting times, with its Death, with its Heaven and its Hell. Ah me!</p>
<p>Wordsworth is here at present; a garrulous, rather watery, not wearisome old man. There is a freshness as of brooks and mountain breezes in him; one says of him: Thou are not great, but thou are genuine; well speed <hi rend="italic">thou</hi>. Sterling is home from Italy, recovered in health, indeed very well could he but <hi rend="italic">sit still</hi>. He is for Cifton [Clifton] near Bristol, for the next three months. I hear him speak of some sonnet or other he means to address to you: as for me he knows well that I call his verses timbertoned, without true melody either in thought, phrase or sound. The good John! Did you ever see such a vacant turnip-lantern as that Walsingham Goethe? Iconoclast Collins strikes his wooden shoe thro&#x2019; him, and passes on, saying almost nothing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Sterling&#x2019;s prose tale &#x201C;The Onyx Ring&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1838-12-26">26 Dec. 1838</date></ref>), Walsingham is a poet marked by &#x201C;self-conscious dignity,&#x201D; and Collins (based on TC) is an earnest and tactless recluse, expressing himself in phrases that are &#x201C;rude and sudden &#x2026; violent and picturesque.&#x201D; They come into confrontation in pt. 3, ch. 7.</note>&#x2014; My space is done!</p>
<p>I greet the little <hi rend="italic">maidkin</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s second child, Ellen, b. <date when="1839-02-24">24 Feb.</date></note> and bid her welcome to this unutterable world. Commend her, poor little thing, to her little Brother, to her Mother and Father;&#x2014;Nature, I suppose, has sent her strong letters of recommendations, without our help, to them all.&#x2014; Where I shall be, in six weeks, is not very certain; likeliest in Scotland, whither our whole household, servant and all, is pressingly invited, where they have provided horses and gigs. Letters sent hither will still find me, or lie waiting for me, safe: but perhaps the <hi rend="italic">speediest</hi> address will be &#x201C;care of Fraser 215. Regent Street.&#x201D; My Brother wants me to the Tyrol and Vienna; but I think I shall not go. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Friend. It is a great treasure to me that I have you in this world.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If I could throw any light on this question, which interests myself as well as you, I should have great pleasure in doing it. Mr Lamond<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Lamond, Blythswood Sq., Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331213-TC-AG-01"><sic>7:51</sic><corr>TC to AG, <date when="1833-12-13">13 Dec. 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360629-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:363&#x2013;64</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-06-29">29 June 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> has not called; I have not seen the Translations you speak of, nor the Letters of your Brother.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His brother was the mentally handicapped William Glen, whose letters have not been found. He had trans. &#x201C;the whole of the Greek anthology&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391002-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-10-02">2 Oct.</date></ref>). TC had helped find him a home with Peter Austin, at Carstammon nr. Craigenputtoch, in <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date> (see earlier vols.).</note> Probably they would not give me much insight, different from what I already have one way or another. The last accounts I got when in Scotland were not favourable; I had thoughts of going up to Carstammon in person, but it threatened to be a pain from which no good could issue: those wild Peat Bogs themselves are hateful to me; I have no great wish ever to behold them again. Peter Austin thought &#x201C;Mr Glen no better.&#x201D; My Wife, who had seen our poor Patient the year before, expressed herself as almost hopeless. For myself I can only say and repeat, &#x201C;while there is life there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> hope.&#x201D; I have never entirely despaired. Time has much in it for all living men; but it seems likely <hi rend="italic">much</hi> Time, even in the best event, may in this case be needed. You must continue hoping. God in His mercy <hi rend="italic">can</hi> one day verily awaken your dear Brother out of his sad darkness; and show him, to the melting of both your hearts, what a Brother he has had!</p>
<p>Occupation is of course the best of all known remedies; could it but be had. It seems to me very likely your Brother might actually be able to make good Translations: I think Translations from the Greek would have almost no chance to bring in <hi rend="italic">money;</hi> but Translations from the French, or modern languages, are constantly wanted by Booksellers, and do, I believe, yield actual payment to the doer of them. The difficulty is, getting them to do. Your Brother, I can fancy, might be able to perform the work perfectly well; but he would of course need some supervisor, some middleman between him and the Bookseller and Public: could Mr Candlish<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Robert Smith Candlish (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>), theologian; a contemporary of Glen&#x2019;s and Lamond&#x2019;s at Glasgow Univ., M.A. <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>; minister of St. George&#x2019;s, Edinburgh, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>; later minister of Free St. George&#x2019;s, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; moderator of the gen. assembly of the Free Church, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; and principal of New College, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>.</note> or anybody known to you undertake this friendly part? I, unfortunately have nothing to do with the <hi rend="italic">economics</hi> <pb id="pg-11-123" n="11:123"/>of Literature, and could not. Translation from the Greek, or from anything, independently of money, provided poor William took an interest in it, and liked to work at it, were undoubtedly a thing to be encouraged for his own sake, if for no other.</p>
<p>As to your removing him from Carstammon nearer to your own dwellingplace, that is a very natural desire on your part: nor do I see any difficulty in it, provided he too wishes it. If he did not wish it, I should think the step questionable; he would be fretted, disquieted, thrown out of his way; might not suit himself well to his new landlords. But <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>, you can probably, by diligent inquiry, find such a place as Carstammon, a quiet place with thrifty reasonable methodic people in it, in Lanarkshire as well as Nithsdale; and, on the whole, if his own <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> go with you, I see no great obstacle in the way. It will give me great satisfaction to learn that a comfortable arrangement has been made.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glen remained at Carstammon until his death, <date when="1852-06-04">4 June 1852</date>.</note></p>
<p>Being so far out of the current of Scottish things here, I did not understand, till you now informed me, that your old copartnery was not yet going on as before. I rejoice very sincerely that such a sudden interruption did you no mischief, nay perhaps may be found to have done you benefit. A Partner so easily frightened into flight could not have been a very safe yokefellow. It was a great blessing to you that you had the faculty of <hi rend="italic">helping yourself</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Glen&#x2019;s firm of Farie, Glen &#x26; Co., silk manufacturers and printers, had apparently failed. His ex-partner, Robert Farie, was now in Farie &#x26; Ramsay, wholesale shawl and muslin warehouse, a partnership dissolved by <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. Glen no longer had his own firm but was listed, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, as with James Dunlop &#x26; Sons, cotton spinners and power-loom cloth manufacturers, 86 Miller St., with whom he remained for some time. After <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> he became a commission merchant, still at 86 Miller St.</note> A man with that gift is not to be cast down permanently at all. &#x201C;Help thyself, Heaven will help thee,&#x201D; say the French,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; see La Fontaine, <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> (&#x201C;Le Chartier Embourb&#xE9;&#x201D;), bk. 6, fab. 18.</note> and it is a true saying. I will fancy you going on decidedly well, and in a much safer position than the last was.</p>
<p>My wife has had much ill health since you saw us: she is much better now, indeed very tolerably well; has been improving pretty steadily for these two last years. We both salute you, and your household, and Life-companion, with our kind wishes. Your welfare will never be indifferent to us.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Some days ago these two Letters from John arrived. They contain little that is new, nothing but what is satisfactory; I send them off this morning, a morning later than I had calculated, having been busy of late days.</p>
<p>I have been writing an article for Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine, but for my own behoof, about a business connected with this new edition of the F. Revolution now printing. You remember that story of the French Ship of War that refused to strike to the English, and went down shouting <foreign><hi rend="italic">vive la R&#xE9;publique</hi></foreign>, and firing its guns? The story turns out to be an <hi rend="italic">entire falsehood:</hi> I had some considerable correspondence about it in winter, and have made it out satisfactorily to be as false as anything need be. I am accordingly to contradict it in this new edition, and have put the documents concerning it into a shape for publishing beforehand in some Periodical: this was the Article for Fraser; I finished it and sent it off last night.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The article was dated <date when="1839-06-10">10 June</date> in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi>. See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381210-TC-MRI-01">TC to <sic>MR</sic><corr>MRI</corr>, <date when="1838-12-10">10 Dec. 1838</date></ref>.</note> That is one thing done. My other Article on the <hi rend="italic">Condition of the Poor</hi> will be a work of considerable time and trouble; I have not got it begun yet; I have not even got any of the Books or Pamphlets for it: but I persist in meaning to do it; there seems a kind of <hi rend="italic">call</hi> on me that way. I will put it in train now without farther delay.</p>
<p>The Printers go on very irregularly,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With the new edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>.</note> and not so fast by far as they ought. They are printing the second and third volumes both together, they have done with the first. Their &#x201C;steam-engines&#x201D; break down, &#x26;c &#x26;c. But it is a pretty enough Book, and they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have done before long.</p>
<p>Emerson writes to me again from America, about the &#x201C;Miscellanies,&#x201D; about their 500 copies of the F. R. Book. I find I shall not make so much as I <hi rend="italic">wished</hi> by that last adventure; but I must go on with it; the result will still in the end be profit, perhaps some &#xa3;70 or &#xa3;80. I sent off, thro&#x2019; Liverpool, a completed <hi rend="italic">sheet</hi> of the new edition, to this kind friend; that he might shew it to his Booksellers, and make the best bargain for me he could.&#x2014; But the grand thing that seems to animate Emerson is the speculation that I shall go to America this <foreign>back-end</foreign> [late autumn], and lecture! His house, he says,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1839-05-15">15 May</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 232&#x2013;34).</note> is all brightened up <pb id="pg-11-125" n="11:125"/>into brilliancy at news of it: they will <hi rend="italic">nurse</hi> my wife and me, they will &#x26;c &#x26;c: in fact nothing can be kinder than these good people all are. If I knew <hi rend="italic">how much cash</hi> I could earn by American lecturing. I should see the whole business. But no one can tell me that. It is easy to go over, in these Steamers or other ships, and easy to get back again;&#x2014; but unless one earned money, to do one benefit for after years, it were of no use. One would need to set off, he says, in <date when="1839-09-00">September</date>; and lecture in <date when="1839-10-00">October</date>, <date when="1839-11-00">November</date>, <date when="1839-12-00">December</date>; ending at Washington the Capital. You think it a fearful thing, dear Mother; but it is one of the simplest things Nor is it more <hi rend="italic">dangerous</hi> than the average of what one does daily. A stock of spare cash, to keep the hawks out of my eyes a little, would be a decided convenience. We shall see, we shall see. It is all very vague yet; I perceive only that if I do not go, I must <hi rend="italic">fall upon a Book</hi>, and decidedly find myself some new <hi rend="italic">work</hi> for this season.</p>
<p>Jack, you will observe, on the other hand, wishes me to come and meet him in Germany; and has even sent me &#xa3;30 of cash, to bear my charges, if I will but come! Poor fellow, it is very kind. Jane says rather, I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to go, and stir myself up; she will go to Scotland without me, or stay here, where she likes to be much better than I. Perhaps I ought to go? Except a sight of Jack, I have simply no wish to wander at all without solid business; I am far past the years for freaks of that kind, which indeed I never at any years indulged much in.&#x2014; Mrs Welsh <hi rend="italic">is</hi> got to Templand now, tho&#x2019; she has not written to us yet. She seems to have been in much worse health at Liverpool than we knew at the time, and was actually in serious alarm for herself. She is clear that we should come to Templand.&#x2014; For the rest, the <hi rend="italic">weather is generally cool</hi> here yet, and not unattended with rain: one week of right hot dusty weather will set me running <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of this place, in some direction or other, fast enough!&#x2014; &#x2014; In short, my dear Mother, I have resolved only on one thing: that I will shortly <hi rend="italic">have a horse to ride on</hi>, live where I may. It is unsuitable to go on longer without one, in such obstruction of health as I suffer, with such supply of means and hopes as kind Providence has furnished me with. If I could b<supplied>[e]</supplied> in health in London, there is no place in the world where I am so well. I will try it <hi rend="italic">with a horse;</hi> I ought decidedly to do that. What is the horse Alick bought now doing? Did he <hi rend="italic">get</hi> a gig? There came a Newspaper from him yesterday, addressed to Jane (tell him her address is &#x201C;Mrs Carlyle&#x201D; simply): but no letter. I see today since I began writing, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hand, in pencil, on the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> that has arrived: whence I am to infer that you are at Dumfries, and therefore not out of your usual order? I am right thankful for it. But what a convenience it will be when our <pb id="pg-11-126" n="11:126"/>Universal Penny Post comes into action!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bill, passed <date when="1839-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, came into effect <date when="1840-01-10">10 Jan. 1840</date>.</note> It seems there is no doubt but it will be in action next year. Every writer then will <hi rend="italic">frank</hi> for himself; and I will forgive nobody for not writing to me that has <hi rend="italic">half a word</hi> to say.</p>
<p>But I must end, dear Mother. You will hear soon what result we arrive at as to our summer movements.&#x2014; Jane gets on better and better as the Summer advances; she affectionately salutes you all. If you are at Dumfries, we shall, without word spoken, be naturally remembered there. I will address this Letter thither, in the persuasion that you are. James got the Puttock sticks sold, I suppose?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to remember me again as the season comes round. I have never forgiven myself for the failure of last year.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380927-TC-TSS-01">TC to TSS, <date when="1838-09-27">27 Sept. 1838</date></ref>.</note> Both my Wife and I are resolute for Keswick on this occasion; so promising a <foreign><hi rend="italic">partie quarr&#xE9;e</hi></foreign> [<foreign><hi rend="italic">carr&#xE9;:</hi></foreign> a foursome] as might establish itself there is worth some effort. If we go Northward at all (which seems much the likeliest course), it shall decidedly be set about. Whether in going; while remaining; or in returning? We will warn you duly; and avoid the barren week.</p>
<p>My Brother wants me to come to him at Ischel<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ischl, a health resort in Upper Austria, twenty-eight mi.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Two days ago there arrived this Letter from the Doctor; giving an account of his movements Northwards out of Naples towards Germany.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> He is still well himself; and his household is on the way seemingly to improvement; they appear to have had a great deal of sickness since they went abroad in quest of health. I mean to write to Jack today if I can manage to get as much time; but in the meanwhile I take <pb id="pg-11-128" n="11:128"/>opportunity by the <hi rend="italic">forelock</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; see also <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:167</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and make sure of writing a word to you with the first hour of my morning&#x2014;especially as there is a frank likely to be convenient in the course of the day.</p>
<p>We are all well, and doing well in our way, in spite of the hot weath<supplied>[er]</supplied>; nay partly because of it; for hot weather agrees with Jane. I have noticed my name in several late Newspapers written in my Mother&#x2019;s hand; from which I infer that she too is tolerably well. Yesterday came one such Newspaper; I first noticed your hand, and then in the interior an announcement from Alick that he &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">had</hi> procured a gig&#x201D;! Tell him that it <hi rend="italic">will in all probability be put in action soon;</hi> that it seems to be as good as fixed that we are to be in Scotland before many days. Our weather has never yet been above a day together disagreeably hot; always (as last night for example) there comes some thunder-plump of rain, and cools us again. But independently of this, Miss Fergus of Kirkcaldy<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth.</note> has come and taken up her quarters with us at present; so that we have not been able to begin making arrangements and packings. I have books to gather about me for the &#x201C;Article&#x201D; I spoke of; I find them wide-scattered, difficult to get hold of, Jane says <hi rend="italic">she</hi> can be ready at any time in about a week after I warn her. She wrote yesterday to her Mother at Templand, to say that we were all coming; the maid and all. It seems unlikely that we shall be here a fortnight hence: this is all that can be settled at present. But you will hear more precisely <hi rend="italic">when</hi> we go. Miss Fergus is to leave us on friday, she calculates; I shall do my best about the Books, and there is nothing that need detain us long.</p>
<p>The Cumberland Friends of last year are again very urgent this season to have us visit them; they and several others in that quarter. We do not know whether it will not perhaps suit us best to take them as we come along,&#x2014;for there is a row of them all the way from near Kendal to Penrith or up towards Wigton.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Speddings were at Greta Bank and Mirehouse, nr. Keswick; the Marshalls were at Hallsteads (John), Patterdale Hall, nr. Ullswater (William James), all in Cumberland, and Monk Coniston, Lancashire (James Garth)</note> Or perhaps we had better come to Scotland at once, and go back <hi rend="italic">on a jaunt</hi> to see these people? It will depend on several things. You shall hear so soon as we have got to any decision,&#x2014;probably by a Letter from Liverpool.</p>
<p>It is needless going into news, in these circumstances; yet there is one fact I must specify, for it will give you pleasure to hear it. A certain Mr Marshall, who has a place about Greystock in Cumberland <pb id="pg-11-129" n="11:129"/>and lives in great style here thro&#x2019; winter, a fine old man, modest like a boy, and yet a most intelligent man, who has made an immense fortune (I believe) by the linen-manufacture at Leeds,&#x2014;this excellent modest old Mr Marshall<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Marshall; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380612-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1838-06-12">12 June 1838</date></ref>. His summer residence was at Hallsteads, on the west bank of Ullswater. He is said not to have wintered there until <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>. He was a flax-spinner rather than a linen manufacturer.</note> is one of my constant Lecture-auditors, and very fond of me. He had heard that I wanted a horse, that I needed one for my health&#x2019;s sake. Well, the day before yesterday, one of his sons came down here to say that &#x201C;his father had a horse he had no use for, and would be very glad if I would take it: they could turn it out to grass for me in this neighbourhood till I returned to London; in short, it would be all convenient if I would accept!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To be named Citoyenne by TC.</note> There was a fair offer I think! Such an offer does one good to hear tell of, whether one accept it or not. But really I think I shall conditionally accept. This is a good man; and I believe has &#xa3;80,000 a year: it is, as Jane says, like my &#x201C;buying a <hi rend="italic">laying hen</hi>, and giving it to some deserving person;&#x2014;accept it dear!&#x201D; The young Mr Marshall is to present himself here, with a servant and the horse, this day at two o&#x2019;clock; we are to have a ride together; and very probably I may answer that if they persist in such beneficent purpose till I return hitherward, I shall be very thankful to take possession of the gift then.&#x2014; It is another of the sons, who has a country place some 20 miles from this, in whose fields the beast is to <hi rend="italic">graze</hi> till my time come: he is member for Carlisle, and, as I compute, will probably be the franker of this Letter.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William James Marshall (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), the eldest son, M.P. for Petersfield, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">30</date>, Beverley, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">32</date>, Carlisle, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>, and East Cumberland, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">68</date>; m., <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, Georgiana Hibbert; he was not involved in the family business. The country place was Edge Grove, nr. Watford. Young Mr. Marshall was probably the youngest son, Arthur (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>).</note></p>
<p>Our printing goes on pretty well; half-done and more: I can get <hi rend="italic">franks</hi> for the remaining proofsheets. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> half of the American &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; have been in the &#x201C;Port of London&#x201D; for a week past (had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> got so far as Fraser&#x2019;s yesterday); I hope to bring my Mother a Copy in my pocket. The second half will probably follow in some six weeks. I have had repeated Letters from Emerson lately; all going right there; &#x201C;celebrated Americans&#x201D; coming hither &#x26;c &#x26;c. Yesterday Jane and I went to call for a &#x201C;celebrated Miss Sedgewick&#x201D; from that country who had brought a letter to us: a very good woman I believe; she was out when we called.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Maria Sedgwick.

Catherine Sedgwick reported that TC &#x201C;expressed humorous surprise that a man from over the sea should talk English, and be as familiar as the natives with the English constitution and laws. &#x2026; He said Webster&#x2019;s eyes were like furnaces, that only wanted blowing on to light them up. &#x2026; Our countryman has made a sensation here. &#x2026; They have given him the sobriquet of the &#x2018;Great Western,&#x2019; and they seem particularly struck with his appearance&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters from Abroad to Kindred at Home</hi> [London, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>] 86).

<p>I write no more at all today, dear Mother. You see what a pen I have, tho&#x2019; I mended it! We send our salutations and affectionate regards to all and every one, beginning with Jenny the stranger. Thank Alick for his care.

<p>You are very kind to ask us to your house and hospitality; but it cannot be effected at present. My Wife and I go to Scotland in a few days, and purpose staying there till the heats be over.

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Your Letter arrives this morning; many thanks to you for it. Mrs Strachey, whose Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> perhaps accompanied yours in some frank hitherward, writes in raptures about you; rapture of admiration, but also of anxiety&#x2014;as to your health breaking down. My dear fellow, you must positively learn the great art of <hi rend="italic">sitting down;</hi> of keeping yourself alive for the sake of us all. <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Asseyez-vous, mes enfans!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Monseigneur, il n&#x2019;y a pas de quoi!</hi></foreign>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381115-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1838-11-15">15 Nov. 1838</date></ref>.</note> The good lady does not see how you can subsist with such perpetual vivacity of movement (so charming to her too); nor do I;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I know the feline <hi rend="italic">toughness</hi> of the subject withal; and persist in asserting continually that he will one day <hi rend="italic">discover</hi> a sufficient &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">de quoi</hi></foreign>&#x201D; (much to his astonishment), and become one of the finest fellows extant in these parts. Seriously, I like very ill to hear of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">blister</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably mentioned in Mrs. Strachey&#x2019;s letter since not in Sterling&#x2019;s, <date when="1839-06-15">15 June</date>.

<p>The American &#x201C;Miscellanies,&#x201D; part first, have arrived &#x201C;in the River&#x201D;; part second to follow in perhaps six weeks. You do the writer honour in hesitating to strike into him. When did a reviewer pause for &#x201C;not understanding&#x201D;? By the nature of him, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> understands what thing you will, and the end of his log-line is the bottom of all manner of waters. You will never get on in that way.&#x2014; But as to this Miscellany man I do confess him questionable.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC himself. Sterling had written about his projected review of the English edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> and the 1st English edn. of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) that he had been &#x201C;spending most of my time&#x201D; in studying them, and that &#x201C;I have nearly come to the conclusion that the writer is too queer a subject to be articulately discoursed on by any man who has a choice of topics.&#x201D; He was amazed at TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;valour&#x2014;vulgarly impudence&#x2014;which enabled you to offer such productions to the British public with an apparent pretension to be understood by them. I fancy that I have a glimmering of your meaning but am not so sure so the writing about it must remain as yet uncertain.&#x201D; The review, a pioneering evaluation, was to appear in the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 33 (<date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>): 1&#x2013;68. In the <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:191, TC speaks of the &#x201C;deep silent joy&#x201D; it gave him.</note> None of the intelligiblest of men, not he; yet <pb id="pg-11-132" n="11:132"/>perhaps with a kind of meaning in him too (poor devil), which he is struggling to express and get out of him as he can! Better let him rest on his own basis for a while? Safer I do believe. And yet Sterling was never known as a <hi rend="italic">prudent</hi> man, timid, or even cautious. My bet is that the very hazard will pique him into the adventure; and there will be nothing but limbs flying before long. Nobody can say.</p>
<p>We have a whole cargo of American celebrities here in these days. Miss Sedgwick, the &#x201C;divine Miss Sedgwick,&#x201D; whom I have not yet got eye on: she is herself a host. Yesterday Milnes gave us breakfast in honour of Webster, the Washington Senator. Sir Stratford Canning, Hallam, Sir R. Inglis &#x26;c;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Stratford Canning (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">1880</date>), 1st Viscount Stratford de Redeliffe, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; distinguished diplomat and authority on the Eastern question; at this time he was without a post and M.P. for King&#x2019;s Lynn, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>. He then became ambassador to Constantinople, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>.</note> and Webster actually there &#x201C;in the old country&#x201D;! I will warrant him one of the stiffest logic-buffers and Parliamentary athletes anywhere to be met with in our world at present. A grim, tall broad-bottomed, yellow-skinned man, with brows like precipitous cliffs, and huge black dull wearied unweariable-looking eyes under them; amorphous projecting nose; and the angriest shut mouth I have anywhere seen;&#x2014;a droop on the sides of the upper lip is quite mastiff-like, magnificent to look upon, it is so quiet withal. I guess I should like ill to be that man&#x2019;s nigger!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Webster, as a northern landowner, did not own slaves. He abhorred slavery, though he also later saw it as an internal matter for the southern states which should not be allowed to destroy the Union.</note> However, he is a right clever man in his way; and has a husky sort of fun in him too;&#x2014;drawls, in a handfast didactic manner, about &#x201C;our republican institutions&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c, and so plays <hi rend="italic">his</hi> part.</p>
<p>Thirlwall, they whisper, is going to be wedded, or rather to wed. I passed a long evening at Spedding&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding&#x2019;s rooms in Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn Fields.</note> where he was a main figure lately. Very pleasant; free and easy; with windows flung up, and tobacco <foreign>ad libitum</foreign> [as desired]: a most sarcastic, sceptical, but strong-headed, stronghearted man, whom I have a real liking for.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Connop Thirlwall (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), historian; an outstanding scholar at Cambridge, he first trained for the law, but gave it up in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> and returned to Trinity College, where he had been elected fellow in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>, and took orders. He was well acquainted with current German theology, and had trans. Niebuhr&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Rome</hi>, vol. 1, with J. C. Hare (<ref target="volume-05/lt-18291222-TC-G-01"><sic>5:49</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1829-12-22">22 Dec. 1829</date></corr></ref>). He was compelled to resign his fellowship, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>; appointed to a living in Yorkshire, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>; pbd. his <hi rend="italic">History of Greece</hi>, 8 vols. (London, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>); appointed bishop of St. David&#x2019;s, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>. TC was to admire him; this was apparently their first meeting. He d. unmarried. In his reply, <date when="1839-06-30">30 June</date>, Sterling wrote of Thirlwall: &#x201C;I admit that he looks like a horse lantern but there is plate glass inside the horse &#x26; sharp flame in the centre&#x201D; (MS: Yale). Most of this letter is printed in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:187&#x2013;89.</note> Milnes <pb id="pg-11-133" n="11:133"/>gave us dilettante Catholicism, and endured Thirlwall&#x2019;s tobacco.&#x2014; I regret to say the business, which seemed so innocent, consisting only of talk, tobacco, and a cup of black tea, proved again noxious to the nervous-system, destructive of sleep and creature-comfort for two days ensuing.&#x2014; Enough of all this.</p>
<p>What I had to say is that probably we are off for Scotland some time within the next fortnight. Future movements undecided; but you shall hear of them. Our address will be always known at Knightsbridge. We are bound for Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s &#x201C;Templand, Thornhill, Dumfries N.B.,&#x201D; which is to be our head-quarters: but whether we loiter a few days in Cumberland and Westmoreland on the way thither, is not yet made out. My Mother&#x2019;s is distant a day&#x2019;s drive. We depend on seeing the heats over there. I mean to read about the &#x201C;Working classes,&#x201D; if there be any book discoverable <supplied>[or]</supplied> pamphlet on that subject worth reading,&#x2014;which is not the case <supplied>[hith]</supplied>erto. My Brother is on his way to Ischl (not far from Salzburg), had got as far as Florence, is probably in the Tyrol heights today. Lastly it seems <hi rend="italic">decided</hi> that I am to have a horse; and in that case the likelihood becomes very considerable that I shall actually ride it out to Clifton some time or other, and then all round Clifton with the landlord of the place there,&#x2014;a man whom <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would like if you knew <hi rend="italic">him!</hi></p>
<p>Your brave Brother is here, looking better than ever. We partly expect him this evening. No word of Mill. My Wife salutes you, and your Wife and household. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sterling; we all love you.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute> Since I wrote last, your Letter sent by some private conveyance has arrived, and was forthwith despatched to Annandale; and now, three days ago, the Florence despatch comes safe to hand, with the welcome intelligence that all is still right with you; that our rather confused correspondence both of Letters and Journals is all successful, and has handsomely winded itself up into some possibility of becoming regular now. Let us thank the Post-office with all its drawbacks: if you get that old Roman Letter (which otherwise is not of any moment) we shall have it to say that in these dozen years or so, while so much writing towards all quarters went on between us, not one Letter was ever lost. I am right glad to learn that you have got out of the hot South, with your young patients doing well; and are on your way towards the free German mountains where we hope they and all of you will do better and better. You spoke of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Poste Restante</hi> at Innspr&#xfc;ck [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>],&#x201D; if I had eight or nine days before the 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> to work on: I had only some seven days at the utmost, and durst not risk a Letter on that. I took an old Newspaper, and directed it very legibly thitherward; venturing two-pence upon it to give you a chance, tho&#x2019; almost without hope. I aim at Salzburg today: perhaps this may find you in passing thro, at all events it will get to Ischl I hope without delay or risk.</p>
<p>The Annandale people and all you are interested in seem to continue well, tho&#x2019; they have not written, since you last heard, anything beyond the address of a Newspaper, or some scratch of that kind. My Mother&#x2019;s hand is generally on the last <hi rend="italic">Couriers;</hi> and there was an announcement from Alick three days ago, readable thus: &#x201C;Have got a <pb id="pg-11-135" n="11:135"/>gig&#x201D;! I wrote to my Mother yesterday enclosing your Florence Letter. Jenny still seems to be with them, Mother and she give tokens of having been at Dumfries &#x26;c. All in short is in the usual state there.&#x2014; We are still in London, as you see, tho&#x2019; the weather has now grown heartily hot in these last days. But it is clear and breezy withal, as beautiful hot weather as I ever saw; and now we do begin to make earnest preparations for departure. Indeed we should very probably have been off before now, had it not been for Elizabeth Fergus and&#x2014;Count Pepoli! Elizabeth the oldest of the Ferguses, a most staid considerate elderly woman, came down into Devonshire with a weakly sister in <date when="1839-03-00">March</date> last, and back homewards some three weeks ago as far as Park-street here. At Park-street, however, she sent for Jane, indicated that Pepoli had <hi rend="italic">asked her in marriage;</hi> with which offer she, as Jane had already guessed long ago, could by no means be disinclined to comply. What affected <hi rend="italic">us</hi> more, Elizabeth volunteered farther to come and live with us two weeks, till the matter were decided; sending on her sister and maid by the Steamer; leaving her Brother&#x2019;s wrath and objection to ferment into some clear utterance or other <hi rend="italic">in the distance</hi>. We heartily disliked having any even semblance of concern with such a business; but poor Elizabeth had no resource, she could not stay in lodgings a lone woman, and of her <foreign><hi rend="italic">hospites</hi></foreign> [friends] here (some of whom &#x201C;stay six months at a time in Kirkcaldy&#x201D;) no one invited her. So here she is, and waits yet a day or two; one of the quietest of women; whom, in her autumn age, here so isolated, hopelessly hoping, I am truly concerned for. Her Brother would speak no <hi rend="italic">refusal</hi>, whereupon the thing is actually to proceed, a married sister from Aberdeenshire comes hither one of these days, to take her into lodgings and wait till it be done. Pepoli has had a &#x201C;cottage&#x201D; in Brompton ever <hi rend="italic">since March</hi> last, and has Bologna pictures now hung up in it for sale; is brightened up into gold ornaments, gay clothes, and looks very happy. We have seen little of him for a year past; he knowing very well that Jane saw into his game. I have sedulously abstained and do abstain from speaking at all of the matter. In spite of oneself one cannot look at Pepoli with admiration in this business, or indeed without pity, and a certain mixture of contempt perhaps not merited. He was reduced to utter distress I believe, and is a poor dangling man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Count Carlo Pepoli (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>), at present prof. of Italian at Univ. of London, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350800-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>8:194</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1835-08-13">13 Aug. 1835</date></corr></ref>. The Carlyles evidently thought that he wanted to marry Elizabeth Fergus (who was about seven years older than he) simply for her money. Yet the marriage lasted until her death, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>, and seems to have turned out happily enough. The &#x201C;weakly sister&#x201D; was probably Jessie, the married sister presumably Jane Royd (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380906-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC [<date when="1838-09-06">6 Sept. 1838</date>]</ref>). JWC had already mentioned the marriage to her mother in April (<ref target="volume-11/lt-18390407-JWC-GW-01">JWC to GW, <date when="1839-04-07">7 April</date></ref>).</note> Enough of him, and of <pb id="pg-11-136" n="11:136"/>this,&#x2014;mentionable only as detaining us a few days longer here.&#x2014; And now, dear Jack, before explaining to you <hi rend="italic">whither</hi> we mean to go, let me specify how imprudent it was, if you wanted me at Ischl, to provide a horse and gig for me in Annandale! My good Brother&#x2014;; but there is a word in one of my Mother&#x2019;s poor Letters in her rough tremulous hand, &#x201C;Come while thy <hi rend="italic">Mother is still there</hi>,&#x201D; which sticks very close to me, which I even <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> not disregard. So we are for Annandale; for Nithsdale rather, the whole of us, servant and all, and shall run between the two places as we see expedient. Observe however I do not even yet give up Ischl, or a meeting with you <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi>, were the fervour of the heats once over. Except seeing my Mother I really have at bottom little or no call to Dumfriesshire; and do not calculate with any certainty that we shall get permanently well on there; to get into fresh air, and finish my &#x201C;article&#x201D; comfortably, is as much as I bargain for. At bottom I must be far healthier than in these last two years, tho&#x2019; my bodily annoyances are not at all lessened, for I feel anew a disposition not to sleep but move. In no year has it seemed so little <hi rend="italic">incredible</hi> that I should actually stir myself and give you meeting. My program as before is, having done this article, either to fasten on some <hi rend="italic">course</hi> of writing, or make for America and lecture. In the latter case, I shall certainly have a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> call to run over and see you. Nay to have seen Germany itself even for weeks might be useful in the &#x201C;new country.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >U.S.A.</note> My dear Jack, when I look at that &#xa3;30,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Alick to buy the horse and gig for TC.</note> it makes me <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae, wae</hi></foreign> and silent. But, by God&#x2019;s blessing it shall be all right too. Let us hold on steadily, ever trusting that our paths <hi rend="italic">will</hi> converge and at least intersect before long; and not entirely divided even when so many miles are between us. I have little appetite for American lecturing, except as it might be useful to stir me up, to let my mind ripen several things,&#x2014; and likewise to yield me a modicum of useful cash. As for Book-writing there is at this moment no very <hi rend="italic">pressing</hi> call, I do think; my <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi> be pretty well uttered now, to my infinite relief, and I gladly see them making their way with unexpected undeserved rapidity in my generation; there is nothing in me now <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> to get itself uttered. Let us thank God (O yes, after all our wretchedness!) and wait not unquietly. O Me! the Moray-street dances overhead,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230104-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:256&#x2013;57</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1823-01-04">4 Jan. 1823</date></corr></ref>; TC lodged at 3 Moray St. from the end of <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> to <date when="1824-06-00">June 1824</date>.</note> and all the base misery known and unknown that one has had were probably the exact thing one needed to have. Courage, my boy!</p>
<p>As to my &#x201C;Article&#x201D; I must confess to having made hitherto very insignificant <pb id="pg-11-137" n="11:137"/>progress. I find myself totally in want of statistics in regard to it, and do not succeed easily in getting at them. I have jotted down very scatteredly some thoughts &#x26;c; I am communicating with Chadwick<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edwin Chadwick; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330924-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:449&#x2013;50</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1833-09-24">24 Sept. 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370423-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:187&#x2013;88</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-04-23">23 April 1837</date></corr></ref>. He had just pbd. his police report proposing a centrally controlled and professional force. He was attacked over the issue of control by those, including Buller, who believed that control should remain local, with the ratepayers, and by the Chartists and working-class organizations who saw accurately that Chadwick&#x2019;s proposed police would be the enforcers of Chadwick&#x2019;s hated New Poor Law and of anti-trade unionism. Whatever answer, if any, TC received from Chadwick, he was not satisfied, since in <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> he specifically ridicules Chadwick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Means of Insurance</hi> as an example of &#x201C;statistic proofs &#x2026; drawn out with all solemnity,&#x201D; and concludes his chapter on &#x201C;Statistics&#x201D; with, &#x201C;Can the labouring man in this England of ours, who is willing to labour, find work, and subsistence by his work? &#x2026; the Legislature, satisfied to legislate in the dark, has not yet sought any evidence on it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:125, 128&#x2013;29).</note> (hitherto without answer from <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, he is in Lancashire) and with others; not hitherto to almost any purpose. However I shall and must get on. At bottom withal I find that it must not be statistics by any means, tho&#x2019; I ought to know these too; but it must be utterance of <hi rend="italic">principles</hi>, grounded on facts which all may see: an utterance of things difficult to utter articulately; yet many, indeed all reflective people, are longing to have them uttered. I mean to persist. Lockhart allows me perfect fair-play, the Quarterly so far as I can reasonably desire or expect is to be open to me: if my word prove entirely unsuitable, I am not to be bound to offer it there. Wish it well <hi rend="italic">written:</hi> that is the difficulty.&#x2014; But, on the whole, I shall do no good in the way of work till I get out of London. My time is cut in pieces, with visits, dinners and rubbish,&#x2014;refused, most of them; some always unrefusable. I have written nothing, except some 8 or 9 pages for Fraser about the sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi> in Howe&#x2019;s victory of <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>: you remember it, the whole crew flying desperate, shrieking <foreign><hi rend="italic">vive la R&#xE9;publique</hi></foreign> &#x26;c? I have had some considerable investigation about it, and find it at last utter <hi rend="italic">falsehood</hi>, and publish accordingly with my name at it. You shall see the thing,&#x2014;it is curious enough to read: I will get it sent along with the &#x201C;Miscellanies.&#x201D; The &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; part first are now &#x201C;in the River,&#x201D; not yet got into Fraser&#x2019;s hands; I will take care to leave them at Montague House for you, where I mean to call and inquire this evening. Emerson sends me the account of the F. R.; some 60 or 70 dollars <hi rend="italic">still</hi> owing to me, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> they pay: &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; nearly all sold now, yet with inferior immediate prospects of <hi rend="italic">profit</hi> to me, owing to &#x201C;bargain&#x201D; &#x26;c, but tolerably sure to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in the end all that was expected. I have sent Emerson a perfect sheet of our new edition: the American profit out of that will not be worth much either, I think; but it will be something, <pb id="pg-11-138" n="11:138"/>the utmost possible,&#x2014;perhaps &#xa3; 80 or &#xa3;90. All which is well. Emerson is strong for my coming out, as is natural. He has sent a notable literary Miss Sedgwick hither, whom we have not seen yet. American Webster is here too; I breakfasted with him at Milnes&#x2019;s, with Hallam, Sir R. Inglis, Sir Stratford Canning &#x26;c: you remember his picture? A terrible beetle-browed, mastiff-mouthed, yellow-skinned, broad-bottomed, grim-taciturn individual; with a pair of dull-cruel looking black eyes, and as much Parliamentary intellect and silent-rage in him, I think, as I have ever seen in any man. Some fun too; and readiness to speak in drawling didactic handfast style about &#x201C;our republican institutions.&#x201D; I care little for him.&#x2014; Anthony Sterling is here and Wife;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte (d. <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), da. of Maj. Gen. Joseph Baird, m. <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>.</note> well, and well-affected towards you, tho&#x2019; disposed for <foreign><hi rend="italic">badinage</hi></foreign> overmuch. John is at Clifton settled, where he wishes me much to go and see him; he would &#x201C;ride with me&#x201D; &#x26;c. What seems stranger, it really is not certain but I may go, leaving Jane here to her &#x201C;week of packing.&#x201D; For you must know, dear Jack, a certain Mr Marshall, a Yorkshire Millionaire and very good old man has in these days made me the offer of a very pretty black horse, nay the farther offer that one of his sons will keep it for me till I return hither,&#x2014;really one of the handsomest offers ever made to me! I galloped yesterday all round the Dulwich region (unvisited since <hi rend="italic">we</hi> visited it) on this brisk swift black along with another of the Marshall sons, a most bashful, but thinking honest-hearted man;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur.</note> and directly on finishing this sheet I am to go Marshalldom, and give final answer about that offer,&#x2014;accepting it, I do calculate! I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> then have a horse (in some 2 hours) most likely; to gallop whither I will. The world has many kind people: such offers do one <hi rend="italic">good</hi> in the right sense, or ought to do it. I can then gallop to Clifton, or anywhither! Anthony half talks of galloping with me; Mrs Strachey too writes in the most enthusiastic dialect: I do think it might do me good; but nothing is yet nearly <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>,&#x2014;except that the black horse (mare it is) will most probably be in &#x201C;Nodes&#x2019; Stables Manor street&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Nodes, 21 New Manor St., Chelsea.</note> before ma<supplied>[n]</supplied>y hours here.&#x2014; My dear Brother, why do I <hi rend="italic">fill</hi> all your sheet with these things of my own almost exclusively? Because you are the kindest of brothers, and take interest in everything of mine&#x2014; Our paper is done Write the moment you get this; to &#x201C;Templand&#x201D;: and consider that the summer is still partly before us.

<p>My pen is none of the best; but I will try here a little.&#x2014; I read with <pb id="pg-11-139" n="11:139"/>perfect understanding and sympathy what you say about Herzogthism [Dukedom] and your situation there.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John&#x2019;s letter, about his employment in the Buccleuch household.</note> Money alone, or but little else than money!

It is a frightful thing settling in London; yet it is always here when you like. America doubtless is savage too. Have you no notion of marrying, and making a great adventure of practice and domesticity both at once! If you continue a bachelor, you will soon have money enough,&#x2014;and need to study nothing, except how, by reading &#x26;c, you could expect to keep your own mind calm.

<salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>Two Letters from you were brought hither by Miss Sedgwick last week.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written on <date when="1839-03-19">19 March</date> (arrived <date when="1839-04-17">17 April</date>), <date when="1839-04-20">20 April</date> (arrived mid-<date when="1839-05-00">May</date>), <date when="1839-04-25">25 April</date> (delivered by Catherine Sedgwick), <date when="1839-04-26">26 April</date> (a note introducing Chandler Robbins), and <date when="1839-04-28">28 April</date>, presumably the second letter brought by Miss Sedgwick.</note> The series of post letters is a little embroiled in my head; but I have a conviction that all hitherto due have arrived; that up to the date of my last despatch (a <hi rend="italic">Proofsheet</hi> and a Letter) which ought to be getting into your hands in these very days, our correspondence is clear. That Letter and Proofsheet, two separate pieces, were sent to Liverpool some three weeks ago, to be despatched by the first conveyance thence; as I say, they are probably in Boston about this time. The Proofsheet was one of the Forty-seven such, which the new F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is to consist of: with this, as with a correct sample, you were to act upon some Boston Bookseller, and make a bargain for me,&#x2014;or at worst report that none was to be made. A bad bargain will content me now, my hopes are not at all high.</p>
<p>For the present, I am to announce on the part of Bookseller Fraser that the First Portion of our celebrated &#x201C;Miscellanies&#x201D; have been hovering about on these coasts for several weeks, have lain safe &#x201C;in the River&#x201D; for some two weeks, and ought at last to be safe in Fraser&#x2019;s shop today or else tomorrow. I will ask there, and verify, before this Letter go. The reason of these &#x201C;two weeks in the river&#x201D; is that the packages were addressed &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">John</hi> Fraser, London,&#x201D; and the people had tried all the Frasers in London before they attempted the right individual, <hi rend="italic">James</hi>, of 215. Regent Street. Of course, the like mistake in the second case will be avoided. A Letter, put ashore at Falmouth, and properly addressed, but without any <hi rend="italic">signature</hi>, had first of all announced that the thing was at the Door; and so with this &#x201C;John Fraser&#x201D; it has been knocking ever since, finding difficult admission. In the present instance such delay has done no ill, for Fraser will not sell till the Second Portion come; and with this the mistake will be avoided. What has shocked poor James much more is a circumstance which your Boston Booksellers have no power to avoid: the &#x201C;enormousness&#x201D; of the charges in our Port here! He sends me the account of them last Saturday, with eyes&#x2014;such as drew Priam&#x2019;s curtains:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 <hi rend="italic">Henry IV</hi> 1.1.</note> &#xa3;31 and odd silver, whereof &#xa3;28 as duty on Books at &#xa3;5 per cwt. is charged by the <pb id="pg-11-141" n="11:141"/>rapacious Customhouse alone! What help, O James? I answer: we cannot bombard the British Customhouse, and sack it, and explode it; we must yield, and pay it the money; thankful for what is still left.&#x2014; On the whole, one has to learn by trying. This notable finance-expedient, of printing in the one country what is to be sold in the other, did not take Vandalic customhouses into view, which nevertheless do seem to exist. We must persist in it for the present reciprocal pair of times, having started in it for these: but on future occasions always, we can ask the past; and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> whether it be not better to let each side of the water stand on its own basis. As for your &#x201C;accounts,&#x201D; my Friend, I find them clear as day, verifiable to the uttermost farthing. You are a good man to conquer your horror of arithmetic; and, like hydrophobic Peter of Russia making himself a sailor, become an Accountant for my sake.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson&#x2019;s &#x201C;accounts&#x201D; were in his letter of <date when="1839-04-25">25 April</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 228&#x2013;30). Peter the Great (<date when="1672-00-00">1672</date>&#x2013;<date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>), emperor of Russia, enthusiastic sailor and boat builder, founder of the Russian navy.</note> But now will you forgive me if I never do verify this same account, or look at it more in this world except as a memento of affection, its arithmetical ciphers so many hierograms, really <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> to me! A reflexion I cannot but make is that at bottom this money was all yours; not a penny of it belonged to me by any law except that of helpful Friendship. I feel as if I could not examine it without a kind of crime. For the rest, you may rejoice to think that, thanks to you and the Books, and to Heaven over all, I am for the present no longer poor; but have a reasonable prospect of existing, which, as I calculate, is literally the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> that money can do for a man. Not for these twelve years, never since I had a house to maintain with money, have I had as much money in my possession as even now. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Allah kerim</hi></foreign> [God is generous]! We will hope all that is good on that side. And herewith enough of <hi rend="italic">it</hi>.</p>
<p>You tell me you are but &#x201C;a reporter&#x201D;: I like you for thinking so.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I do not belong to the poets, but only to a department of literature, the reporters; suburban men&#x201D; (<date when="1839-04-25">25 April</date>, Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 230).</note> And <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will never know that it is <hi rend="italic">not true</hi>, till you have tried. Meanwhile, far be it from me to urge you to a trial before your time come. Ah, it will come and soon enough; much better perhaps if it never came! A man has &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">such</hi> a baptism to be baptised withal,&#x201D; no easy baptism; and is &#x201C;straitened till it be accomplished.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luke 12:50.</note> As for me I honour peace before all things; the silence of a great soul is to me greater than anything it will ever say, it ever can say. Be tranquil, my friend; utter no word till you cannot help it;&#x2014;and think yourself a &#x201C;reporter,&#x201D; till you find (not with any great joy) that you are not altogether that!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-142" n="11:142"/>We have not yet seen Miss Sedgwick: your Letters with her card were sent hither by post; we went up next day, but she was out; no meeting could be arranged earlier than tomorrow evening when we look for her here.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Sedgwick noted that she came to &#x201C;six o&#x2019;clock family tea&#x201D; and that TC&#x2019;s head &#x201C;would throw a phrenologist into ecstacies [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. It looks like the &#x2018;forge of thought&#x2019; it is; and his eyes have a preternatural briliancy. He reminded me of what Lockhart said to me, speaking of the size of Webster&#x2019;s head, that he &#x2018;had brains enough to fill half-a-dozen hats.&#x2019; Carlyle has as strong a Scotch accent as Mr. Combe. His manner is simple, natural, and kindly. His conversation has the picturesqueness of his writings, and flows as naturally, and as free from Germanism, as his own mountain streams are free from any infusion of German soil.&#x201D; She repeated TC&#x2019;s account of the first meeting with Emerson at Craigenputtoch: &#x201C;a stranger &#x2026; &#x2018;he seemed to them an angel.&#x2019; They spoke of him as if they had never lost their first impression of his celestial nature&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters from Abroad</hi> [London, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>] 1:85&#x2013;86).</note> Her reception, I have no doubt, will be abundantly flattering in this England. American Notabilities are daily becoming notabler a<supplied>[mong]</supplied> us; the ties of the two Parishes, Mother and Daughter, getting closer and closer knit. Indissoluble ties:&#x2014;I reckon that this huge smoky Wen<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cobbett&#x2019;s term for London.</note> may, for some centuries yet, be the best Mycale for our Saxon <hi rend="italic">Panionnium</hi>,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A gathering of all the Ionians held at the temple on the mountain of Mycale.</note> a yearly meeting-place of &#x201C;All the Saxons,&#x201D; from beyond the Atlantic, from the Antipodes or wherever the restless wanderers dwell and toil. After centuries, if Boston, if New York have become the most convenient &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">All-Saxondom</hi>,&#x201D; we will right cheerfully go thither to hold such festival, and leave the Wen.&#x2014; Not many days ago I saw at breakfast the notablest of all your Notabilities, Daniel Webster. He is a magnificent specimen; you might say to all the world, This is your Yankee Englishman, such limbs <hi rend="italic">we</hi> make in Yankeeland! As a Logic-fencer, Advocate, or Parliamentary Hercules, one would incline to back him at first right against all the extant world. The tanned complexion, that amorphous crag-like face; the dull black eyes under their precipice of brows, like dull anthracite furnaces, needing only to be <hi rend="italic">blown</hi>; the mastiff-mouth, accurately closed:&#x2014; I have not traced as much of silent <hi rend="italic">Berserkir-rage</hi>, that I remember of, in any other man. &#x201C;I guess I should not like to be <hi rend="italic">your</hi> nigger!&#x201D;&#x2014; Webster is not loquacious, but he is pertinent, conclusive; a dignified, perfectly bred man, tho&#x2019; not English in breeding: a man worthy of the best reception from us; and meeting such, I understand. He did not speak much with me that morning, but seemed not at all to dislike me: I meditate whether it is fit or not fit that I should seek out his residence, and leave <hi rend="italic">my</hi> card too, before I go? Probably not; for the man is political, seemingly altogether; has been at the Queen&#x2019;s levee &#x26;c &#x26;c: it is <pb id="pg-11-143" n="11:143"/>simply as a mastiff-mouthed <hi rend="italic">man</hi> that he is interesting to me, and not otherwise at all.</p>
<p>In about seven days hence we go to Scotland till the <date when="1839-07-00">July</date> heats be over. That is our resolution after all. Our address there, probably till the <date when="1839-08-00">end of August</date>, is &#x201C;Templand, Thornhill, Dumfries N.B.&#x201D;&#x2014;the residence of my Mother-in-law, within a day&#x2019;s drive of my Mother&#x2019;s. Any Letter of yours sent by the old constant address (Cheyne Row, Chelsea) will still find me there; but the other, for that time, will be a day or two shorter. We all go, servant and all. I am bent on writing <hi rend="italic">something</hi>; but have no faith that I shall be able. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> try. There is a thing of mine in Fraser for <hi rend="italic"><date when="1839-07-00">July</date></hi>, of no account, about the &#x201C;sinking of the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>,&#x201D; as you will see. The F. R<hi rend="italic">n</hi> printing is not to stop; two thirds of it are done, at this present rate it ought to finish, and the whole be ready, within three weeks hence. A Letter will be here from you about that time, I think: I will print no titlepage for the 500 till it do come. &#x201C;Published by <hi rend="italic">Fraser and</hi> Little&#x201D; would, I suppose, be unobjectionable,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; Fraser is the most nervous of creatures: but why put <hi rend="italic">him</hi> in it at all; since these 500 copies are wholly Little&#x2019;s and yours?&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my Friend. Our blessings are with you and your house. My wife grows better with the hot weather; I always worse.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p>I say not a word about America or Lecturing, at present; because I mean to consider it intently in Scotland, and there to decide. My Brother is to be at Ischl (not far from Salzburg) during summer: he was anxious to have me there, and I to have gone; but&#x2014;but&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s shop</hi>. Books not yet come, but known to be safe, and expected <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. Nay the dextrous Fraser has argued away &#xa3;15 of the duty, he says! All is right therefore. N.B. he says, you are to send the 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> Portion <hi rend="italic">in sheets</hi>, the weight will be less. This if it be still time.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter did not reach Emerson until <date when="1839-08-08">8 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;too old to do its errand even had it come twenty days sooner so far as printer &#x26; bookbinder are concerned&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 244).</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Basta</hi></foreign> [enough]</salute></closer>.</p>

<p>We are packing up for departure; I cannot say as to Friday morning, but will decidedly try, and hope.</p>
<p>This morning I was about writing to you at any rate. In these days, till Friday afternoon, I have a horse; and go galloping along thro&#x2019; all manner of lanes, and green, shady or windy, desert places, much to my benefit. I had set my heart on riding with you one day! Tomorrow it must be, if at all. Could you appear here saddlefast, without farther warning, between one and two o&#x2019;clock; or <hi rend="italic">with</hi> warning, at whatever other hour and place you liked to name?

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We are decidedly packing up now, with intent to set out Northward in the beginning of next week! I write you this, if even nothing else; because I know it will give you great pleasure, and put an end to uncomfortable guessings. The weather has never yet been at all disagreeably hot; copious showers have always cooled us down: excellent weather for all kinds of growth here. However, we do now go: Jane is packing and sorting (with a bad headache today, poor dame, tho&#x2019; otherwise generally very well); all is to be secured, fast bolted and nailed, the valuables sent to the Sterlings&#x2019;s even,&#x2014;for she is an accurate woman!</p>
<p>We go first to Liverpool, most likely by the railway, and in the night, if the weather threaten heat. We shall have to stay, and speak a little with the Liverpool friends; but after that, we propose making direct for Annandale: so Jamie can fetch the Gig Alick talked of, and prepare to meet us at the Annan shore if all go right. Our maid, I suppose may travel on towards Templand; but Jane and I ought to make up towards Scotsbrig, and hover with you a little before following her <pb id="pg-11-145" n="11:145"/>thither. You need not trouble yourselves much; I think, if the bed where Jack slept last year were made ready, that would be all the preparation needed. We are bad sleepers; and have no other difficulty.&#x2014; But you will hear more minutely when we get to Liverpool: some time next week, it is likeliest. I will <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> here till the night before we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to set out; that will be a sign for you, dear Mother, if you attend to it. Then, in some two days more, if we prosper, some Newspaper from Liverpool may indicate that we are there; or a Letter direct will do it more decisively. But do not weary for the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> till it do come;&#x2014;or think that anything has gone wrong because it does not! If anything more than a day or two of delay before setting out be found necessary, I will send you some other Newspaper as a token that it is <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> merely, that all is right otherwise; and then the Examiner <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come by and by.</p>
<p>I got my horse, two days after writing to you about it; I have it lodged in a Stable-keeper&#x2019;s near this, and have ridden it every day since except one. A beautiful black quadruped, in perfect condition, training and equipment: truly I might have felt myself <hi rend="italic">set up</hi>,&#x2014;and yet I felt nothing of the sort, nothing but confusion and anxiety; with a great joy too at getting out into the green solitudes hereabouts, which are beautiful to escape into, out of the city whirlpool. The riding seemed to do me <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> for two or three days; brought out headaches, rheumatisms &#x26;c; however, I persevered with confidence, and do find myself now much better, more like a sound man than I have been for a long while. The son of Mr Marshall,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Marshall.</note> who has a farm some twenty miles off, is to ride the horse away thither, on friday or saturday next, and keep it there till my return; so that I have but some two days more of the business now, and by the time you read this you must fancy me <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with my riding till I mount at Scotsbrig again. It has given me great pleasure in itself, this kind act of the worthy Mr Marshall&#x2019;s in making me such a present.</p>
<p>Our Printing and other affairs go on without material change of aspect. The American Books, first part, are got to Fraser&#x2019;s I should think, today; Fraser was very clever and punctual in getting them thro&#x2019; the Custom house, and saved me some &#xa3;14 of hard cash there by his own industry. My &#x201C;Article&#x201D; is still greatly in the background, but I must fasten on it heartily when once in Scotland.</p>
<p>And so, <foreign>Bairns</foreign>, we are very glad at the near prospect of seeing you all once more! Let us all be thankful for that, and reckon it among the blessings vouchsafed us amid all our trials. Best affection to one and <pb id="pg-11-146" n="11:146"/>all. <closer><salute>Farewell, dear Mother,&#x2014;we hope not for long this time!&#x2014; Your ever affectionate</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>That Note for James Aitken<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The next letter.</note> is about ready-cash to be received by him for me at Dumfries. If he have it safe on Wednesday, it will be as soon as needed. Perhaps you will seal up the whole concern, this letter of your own too, and send it to him?</p>
<p>Jenny we hope is still with you, and well. Mary shall give us tea at Annan as we pass. Our address while in Liverpool, if it should chance that we could do anything for any of you will be: &#x201C;Care of John Welsh Esq, 3 Maryland Street.&#x201D;</p>
<p>It has been thunder and rain; and promises to be a bright afternoon for a horseman: the ground here can never get enough of wet; it is all sandy, like a filter or sieve, and is flying about as dust in few hours after its muddiest state. With rain enough it is the greenest country I ever saw.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Enough now!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>We are just about coming to you; hope to find you all well, and see for ourselves that you are so, in not many days! I need not write any news, or speculations, therefore; since we have the prospect of <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> so soon.</p>
<p>My cause of writing today is that you may go to the Commercial Bank, and take charge of certain money for me. Some day this week I purpose to transmit Three Hundred and Sixty Pounds deliverable to you at the Commercial Bank. The order will be there on Wednesday first, as I compute: &#xa3;360 <hi rend="italic">from</hi> me payable to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>. Will you appear, therefore, to demand that sum; and then deposit in my name, and get me a Bank Receipt for the same? This is the whole transaction. You may call me &#x201C;Carlyle of Craigenputtoch,&#x201D; the name they know me by of old. Fold up the Paper with your old punctuality, and let it lie till we come.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-147" n="11:147"/>We are all coming; as you will hear, as you will have heard. We shall see you as we go up to Templand first; and we hope, often afterwards. Be good <foreign>bairns</foreign> till then.</p>

<dateline>Friday morning [<date when="1839-06-28">28 June 1839</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Cousin</salute>
<p>It has been intimated to you doubtless with more or less clearness that we are girding up our loins for a grand and general move Templandward&#x2014;where it is to be hoped that after infinite fatigues endured and difficulties overcome, we shall arrive without loss of life or of baggage&#x2014;and get such benefit from fresh air and silence as may answer the expectations of all parties concerned.</p>
<p>For several days back there has been a distinct appearance of getting underway&#x2014;all the loose property about getting itself thrust into boxes &#x26;c to be sent into sure keeping; our house being to be left in care of Providence, with a recommendation backed by the promise of &#x201C;a trifle&#x201D; to the Policeman&#x2014; My Maid, who is both a coward and an universal accquaintance-maker&#x2014;totally unfit to be left in a house by herself&#x2014;is to go with us and prosecute her valuable activity at Templand&#x2014; By the beginning of the ensuing week we shall be in the completest state of deprivation and disorganization&#x2014;and may be confidently expected to &#x201C;take the road&#x201D; as they say in a mandate&#x2014;necessity being the Mother of decision as well as of invention&#x2014; Carlyle cannot yet &#x201C;tie himself to a day&#x201D; No man indeed has such a dislike to being &#x2018;tied&#x2019;&#x2014;but he thinks Tuesday or Wednesday will probably answer him&#x2014; He also thinks that &#x201C;a nights sleep is not a thing to be given up without <hi rend="italic">an effort at least</hi> to save it.&#x201D; and accordingly votes for travelling by day rather than by night. I am taking it for granted that natural instinct has already informed you of our purpose to go by Liverpool&#x2014; Your willingness to receive us I do not at all doubt but I am not without qualms as to your ability to put us all into bed&#x2014; It cannot be done in fact (so far as I know of your resources) without Alick&#x2019;s reducing himself into <hi rend="italic">impalpability</hi> at nightfall, as I have known him do before; but never well understood how he managed it.</p>
<p>Now if this miracle be in the slightest degree hard for him to perform&#x2014;write to me by return of post and we can go to the Chorely&#x2019;s [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] who are close by you, and have overflowed us with invitation as <pb id="pg-11-148" n="11:148"/>if in having us, they imagined they would be &#x201C;entertaining Angels <hi rend="italic">awares</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heb. 13:2.

If I hear nothing from you&#x2014;I shall understand that you expect us&#x2014; If we are to be with you on Tuesday night I will send off a newspaper on Monday&#x2014;if on Wednesday I will send a newspaper on Tuesday&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope to find you all well and glad to see us&#x2014;much kindness that heretofore always awaited us in that house we shall painfully miss<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen&#x2019;s mother, Mary Welsh, had d. just after TC&#x2019;s visit the previous autumn.</note>&#x2014;and the thought of this saddens my prospect of being there again&#x2014;but one must be thankful for what is left&#x2014;</p>
<p>I need write no further news&#x2014;as any interesting thing I should tell you now would be lessening the budget which I shall have to make myself agreeable with when I come&#x2014; Kindest love to my dear Uncle who must prepare to be emphatically kissed&#x2014;and to all the minor productions</p>
<p>God help you thro&#x2019; the deciphery of this penmanship which is appalling even to my own eye&#x2014; But my desk is packed my pen-knife is packed&#x2014;and my fingers ache with packing&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Scarcely was the last Book-Parcel gone when to my amazement these three other Books of yours turned up on my shelves here. I send them now; believing that they do make finis for the present. Guizot&#x2019;s seems to me the best History I have yet seen of that period: he never completed it, I suppose; and will not, having become a kind of hack.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois P.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>After making a great bustle to get out of London <hi rend="italic">in time</hi>, we arrived here by the Railway, safe and well, on Tuesday evening; calculating that we should find a steamer for Annan, or at worst for Dumfries, probably on Wednesday or Thursday. Yesterday morning we ascertained, on inquiry, as Macdiarmid&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> on its coming in like wise indicated, that the Steamers for this week <hi rend="italic">had</hi> all sailed, that there was no way of getting across the Frith till Monday! After some vain murmuring, we found that <hi rend="italic">it could not be helped;</hi> that we must simply reconcile ourselves to stay here, and make the best of it, till the time did come. I sent our Mother a Liverpool Newspaper yesterday; which I suppose will this day have signified to her that we are here. So far good. I now write you a hasty word, one word is enough, to say that, if all go right, we may be expected at the Annan Jetty by Hudson&#x2019;s Steamship, seemingly at a pretty early hour, on Tuesday morning next. Both Sewell and Hudson seem to sail from this at the same hour that night; but we will aim for Hudson; he if I remember is reckoned the best:&#x2014;however, even failing him (which is altogether unlikely) we are not entirely desperate for you till Sewell too have arrived without us. The hour of sailing from Liverpool is 7 o&#x2019;clock (Monday night): I suppose that indicates 7 in the morning of Tuesday? But you will know that better than I. By Hudson, at whatever his hour is, we may <pb id="pg-11-150" n="11:150"/>be looked for.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Hudson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Royal Victoria</hi> (Carlisle &#x26; Annan Steam Navigation Co.) and Joseph Sewell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Newcastle</hi> (Carlisle &#x26; Liverpool Steam Navigation Co.); each sailed from Annan to Liverpool and back three times a fortnight, in twelve hours or less.</note> The &#x201C;Gig,&#x201D; I dare say, under some trustworthy person&#x2019;s guidance (do not you, my dear Brother, leave your work inconveniently on that account), will be in waiting at the shore; and Mary will have breakfast for us: we shall be happy to have a cup of her tea once again. None but Jane and I will be there; the Servant Ellen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell from Kirkcaldy.</note> is sent to Kirkcaldy, in place of coming with us; things suddenly assumed a new face on that side, and we judged it better that she should go home than come with us. She is to join us at our return. Jane and I, then, with a quantity of luggage that may go mostly direct off to Dumfries: that will be the cargo. We must go up to Scotsbrig directly; and see how our dear Mother is, how you all are. Next day I have appointed to take Jane forward to Templand,&#x2014;not knowing how they may be situated for accommodation at Scotsbrig; Jane, besides, being very impatient <hi rend="italic">to get to sleep</hi> beside her Mother. I calculate on returning by myself, if not with her, down to Middlebie, in a day or two. This is our arrangement for the present.&#x2014; I expect there will be a big frank with Proofsheets<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the 2d British edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>.</note> in it for me at Ecclefechan on Monday morning: will you look after it, and take it out if it be there.</p>
<p>My story, dear Alick, has spun itself out far beyond the due length; &#x201C;I have not <hi rend="italic">time</hi> to make it shorter,&#x201D;&#x2014;as I once said. You will contrive to gather from it what I mean. No other word need be added on the subject; for words would but darken counsel.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Job 38:2.</note></p>
<p>This is not a place for resting in, as you have often heard; but it is quieter at present than it used to be. I got a fine bathe in the sea yesterday; today I am to have a ride. The weather is <hi rend="italic">cool</hi> enough, indeed today almost cold; however, it was very beautiful yesterday, and my <foreign><hi rend="italic">swatter</hi></foreign> [splash] in the Solway brine (tho&#x2019; on the wrong <hi rend="italic">coast</hi>) did me considerable good. I hope in spite of the late hour and difficulty of sleeping here, we shall not come to you in an <hi rend="italic">enfeebled</hi> state, but fully fresher than when we started.&#x2014; The Master of the House is but in poor health here,&#x2014;he has lost both his Wife and his Partner<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Welsh and James Leishman.</note> in trade since we were here last, and is in great fret just now shifting his wareho<supplied>[use t]</supplied>o a new quarter of the town &#x26;c: I never saw him in worse spirits<supplied>[;]</supplied> gets little sleep he says; and indeed is not well. An honest true hearted man as I have ever known. The Goodwife is <pb id="pg-11-151" n="11:151"/>greatly missed. Nothing here or elsewhere on this Earth will continue, but all is in perpetual restless movement; and Change, and Mortality, and Eternity, waits for us all! These things, old as the world, have still a kind of novelty for us, a kind of surprise for us,&#x2014;so unfathomable, fearful and wonderful, is their significance.</p>
<p>I will add no more words today. God grant us all a happy meeting such as we hope for now, before many hours. We shall get all one another&#x2019;s news by a better method than writing, ere long. Our united love and blessings to you all.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have some thought of collecting and reprinting the two Portions of <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x2019;s Wilhelm Meister;</hi> they have both been long out of Print. The latter Portion, <hi rend="italic">Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi>, as you may remember, was first published, as the fourth volume of our <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi>, many years ago, in concert with you and your Brother.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1827-01-00">Jan. 1827</date>, by William and Charles Tait, of Edinburgh and London, respectively.</note> I do not suppose you would now wish at all to be concerned farther with such a business as this present one; but before taking any step whatever in it, I beg to ask formally whether my supposition is correct; and in case of its being correct, to request your kind permission to look out for another publisher.</p>
<p>We have quitted London and its torrid pavements some ten days ago; and are got hither into the green country, meaning to be mainly here for some weeks to come. I should like well to see Edinburgh, and old friends there; but know not whether it will do, this time.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your friendly Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> awaited my return hither from a short excursion into Annandale.</p>
<p>I had not forgotten the nature of our bargain, but remembered, or at any rate done my utmost to remember it. The minute of the business, which lies or ought to be lying in some paper-heap at Chelsea, is not accessible at this moment; but my uniform recollection has been that the ultimate copyright of that <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> was expressly reserved to <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> that, besides the First Edition which of course was exclusively yours, a certain joint interest remained for the high contracting parties in any second Edition that might be printed (I think it was that you were to have the <hi rend="italic">refusal</hi> of it, or in some way the preference to all other Publishers in respect of it); but that after said second Edition, or your said refusal, the work was and continued mine,&#x2014;much good might it do me! This, I say, has been my rather misty but constant and undoubting recollection of that important state-paper: if you will look in your copy of it, provided such exist, and set me right about it, I promise to be altogether open to the truth whatever it may be. By offering you the reprinting of this <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> (the only portion of the <hi rend="italic">G. Romance</hi> which promised to be worth reprinting) coupled with another <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> which might better the adventure,&#x2014;I fancied I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> complied with the terms of our agreement as far as might be; and that you, refusing to print yourself, would answer that I was at liberty to print. Such was my understanding; right or wrong I cannot at this moment determine;&#x2014;neither indeed is it of much moment.</p>
<p>For, alas, as to any terms offered by my Publisher, I grieve to be able to answer so decisively at once that the privilege solicited is not reckoned certainly to be worth any money at all; and that no offer of money either now or within a computable date has any chance to be made. My Publisher is Fraser: he merely judges the thing worth the risk of paper and print, offers me no coin of sure money, only doubtful &#x201C;halving of the <hi rend="italic">profits</hi>,&#x201D; and my own chance of ever being paid for correcting of the press seems very far from certain. Not to say that <hi rend="italic">Meisters Apprenticeship</hi> being already mine (for Messrs Oliver &#x26; Boyd have frankly washed their hands of it), the <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> are a very secondary <pb id="pg-11-153" n="11:153"/>item in this enterprise;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> had been pbd. in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>.

<p>In short, my dear Sir, the circumstances are such that if you and your Brother find that you can say to me, &#x201C;Do with this <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> as you like, we will not hinder you,&#x201D; I shall take it as a handsome thing and a proof of your old good-nature towards me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser, not the Taits, pbd. the new edn. of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels</hi> later this year.</note> If on the other hand you find that you must refuse such permission, I will not raise the question whether it be still competent for me to proceed in defect of that; I will simply leave the Book standing unprinted there, and proceed without it,&#x2014;or even not proceed at all, for that too is a course I shall little regret to take.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We were very agreeably surprised over in Annandale by the announcement, which Jane forwarded without delay,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent by John to Templand, where only JWC was staying at the time; see below.</note> that you were on <pb id="pg-11-154" n="11:154"/>the road home to us again; unexpectedly, and rapidly arriving. It made the black wet day at Scotsbrig bright for us all. Our Mother in particular was &#x201C;right glad that he&#x2019;s to be back again, poor fellow.&#x201D; As the chance of a Letter being in time for you at Rotterdam seemed very imperfect, I contented myself with despatching a <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courie</hi>, which I considered would answer all essential purposes. Did you receive it? At all events you have arrived! Half an hour ago my Mother and I (for she too is here) went out smoking, after breakfast, to the old seat at the end of the shrubbery towards Thornhill, to look over the <date when="0000-07-00">July</date> earth a little, when old Mary Mills<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Templand servant who had also been at Craigenputtoch; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310806-JWC-TC-01"><sic>5:313</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-06">6 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> hove in sight, and produced from her lap among other things a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper with three strokes, which I instantly interpreted as a true token. Heaven be praised for it. I write directly; hardly knowing what I mean to say; but understanding well that you will expect some sound from me, and very glad to write, in these circumstances, whatsoever may come uppermost.</p>
<p>You would find no house at Chelsea this time; a mischance which one one [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] cannot but regret, perhaps more than enough. We have been in this North country some three weeks now or more; we had to wait almost a week in Liverpool, no steamboat being ready to sail; we arrived at Annan (Jane dreadfully sick) where Jamie, Alick and &#x201C;the Gig&#x201D; waited us, in a heavy shower of rain; we staid two days at Scotsbrig, then all night, detained by rain, at Jean&#x2019;s in Dumfries; then at last to Templand for breakfast on the morrow. All our kindred in these two Dales are tolerably well; our good Mother seems to me better than we left her, really wonderfully strong and fresh for her years. After a day or two I returned back into Annandale by myself, leaving Jane here; I expected Proofsheets, the concluding sheets of the Revolution, which have not all arrived <hi rend="italic">yet;</hi> I staid nearly a week; was at Annan once, where I bathed, called for B. Nelson, did not see him; I was at Burnswark, at Ecclefechan, was greatly imprisoned by rain; on Monday last my Mother and I got into the gig, to Dumfries, where I left <hi rend="italic">her</hi> with Jean, one of whose children was suffering much, and making her anxious (it is the youngest, it is better now); then on Thursday, a beautiful sun-and-shadow day, I returned for her by appointment, and brought her up hither where I compute she will stay till Monday. This is our travel&#x2019;s history<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 1.3.</note> hitherto. I am tolerably well,&#x2014; except when some cursed lamb-soup or wash of that kind deranges me; I enjoy unspeakably the silent green fields with their peaceable cattle, and no crackling Cockneys visible or audible,&#x2014;ah me, how <pb id="pg-11-155" n="11:155"/>blessed is the <foreign><hi rend="italic">soughing</hi></foreign> [sighing] of the woods, the ancient everlasting song of brooks and streams, compared with any human speech one can in general hope to fall in with! I find it as yet a sufficient felicity simply to be let alone.&#x2014; Jane does not enjoy herself nearly so much; the reverse of me, she prefers London to all places; indeed she is not well here, and has no soul I think out of her own household whom she cares a farthing for. We get a beautiful drive in the Gig when the weather permits; we came the other evening along Drumlanrig Bridge, an ancient most austere-looking erection, not above seven feet wide I think, with a great red flood just then tumbling far beneath it,&#x2014;and Jane apprehensive, so fast were we going, that she should be canted over into the same; an imagination which haunts me ever since. The whole scene is beautiful, princely, Castle, woods, streams, hills; and all was doubly interesting to us for a shadow of Jack which it seemed to have in it, tho&#x2019; Heaven knows he, at bottom, has little to do there.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The castle is a seat of the Duke of Buccleuch on the right bank of the Nith, and at least eighteen mi. NW of Templand. The part of the estate the Carlyles drove through was presumably not quite so far.</note> On the whole this Gig and Horse is a great comfort to us, our chief secular comfort; and I often feel that it is really a successful kindness, thanks to our Brother for it. We hope he himself will come and take the reins before long. The thing was cheap; not much above &#xa3;20 in all; and yet it is an effectual thing: a solid yet smooth-going decent rustic gig; this they got for &#xa3;10; it was John Scott of Yorkshire the Surgeon&#x2019;s gig while he lived, then some other person&#x2019;s, from whom Alick bought it; I have now put our Mother&#x2019;s name on the back of it, at which she in secret seems by no means offended, and so it runs paying no tax to her Majesty, stands safe in Scotsbrig barn when not running. Many of the substantial farmers are getting these <hi rend="italic">named</hi> Gigs; Gigmen proper do not put the name, but pay the tax instead, as they have a good right to do. The Nag, which we call &#x201C;Donald,&#x201D; or rather &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Doundle</hi>&#x201D; if you understand that, is one of the best gig-horses extant; quiet, peptic, strong, swift and expert; yet he cost only some &#xa3;12; his knees were broken in some drunken race at Langholm Fair, so that, tho&#x2019; without intrinsic damage therefrom, he is unfit for the market. He can plough, cart, ride, all very tolerably well; I was on his back this morning early, along the hilltops on the Drumlanrig side again: he will be well enough worth his meat to Jamie, with the gig over and above. In short, my dear Brother, your gift, as I said, has been successful; and I enjoy it as a brotherly kindness with many satisfactory thoughts of various kinds. It is better than a stroke over the crown, that!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-156" n="11:156"/>For the rest, my idleness since leaving London has been as nearly as possible <hi rend="italic">entire</hi>. I do not remember that I ever in my whole life was emptier of all strenuousness, or effort of any sort, of all meditation or purpose, nay of all emotion. My time indeed is totally clipt in pieces hitherto; I cannot get myself fastened at all. I have been reading a very little in Poor-Law Reports, in Wieland&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Horace</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is referring to edns. by Christopher Martin Wieland of either the letters or satires: <hi rend="italic">Horazens Briefe</hi>, 2 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>) or <hi rend="italic">Horazens Satyren</hi>, 2 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>).</note> in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, which latter Fraser proposes reprinting, both <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi>, if the original Edinburgh Publishers do not object: Tait rather hangs back a little, Oliver and Boyd have frankly given way, as indeed they were bound to do.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390711-TC-WT-01">TC to WT, <date when="1839-07-11">11 July</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390723-TC-WT-01"><date when="1839-07-23">23 July</date></ref>.</note> This is all my <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, up to this date! Conscience, however, does now begin to stir me very prettily in a dyspeptic morning before breakfast; I positively must and will <hi rend="italic">try</hi> that Article of mine, tho&#x2019; it is dark, dubious, questionable and even inane beyond any similar thing of mine I can remember.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi></note> But what am I good for if not writing? I can see no reason otherwise why I am alive or take the pains to keep myself alive. In short we must and will set about trying! The stupider one is the more pressingly essential is it to try,&#x2014;and to succeed. That Article on the Working people has been delayed two years too long for me; it is a feeling &#x201C;sinking into languor of resignation&#x201D; with me; two years ago it might have ended in &#x201C;satisfaction of fulfilment.&#x201D; Enough of it here. Surely there is need of a word on the subject now if ever! Ecclefechan itself has its <hi rend="italic">Chartists</hi>; they were rattling a very slack old drum, and shouting round the rumble of it, passing &#x201C;resolutions&#x201D; I suppose, last night I was in Alick&#x2019;s,&#x2014;very curious to me to hear. By the way, before I forget, let me say that Rob Hanning and Jenny have quitted Lancashire, being driven out by the poverty of innumerable unemployed spinners; and, after some considerable hithering and thithering, have come over to Annan or Northfield, where they occupy Jamie Jeffrey&#x2019;s old abode<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably James Jeffrey, the &#x201C;Annan Mason&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:248</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> which you remember; purposing to wait there till a new season at least. Rob, busy as a bee, is already trading in corn &#x26;c, and floats to and fro from the Mersey waters to the Annan, like an aquatic creature. They are well enough all, Jenny much better than in Manchester; they will shift along, I believe, as heretofore more easily than most</p>
<p>But now, dear Jack, after all this tittletattle, make haste to tell me where you are, what you are doing, are going to do. Our movements <pb id="pg-11-157" n="11:157"/>will depend a good deal on yours. We hear from the Creightons<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Major Crichton (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18370304-JWC-JWE-01"><sic>9:161</sic><corr>JWC to JWE, <date when="1837-03-04">4 March 1837</date></corr></ref>) was the Duke&#x2019;s factor in Dumfriesshire.</note> that your Duke is expected here this summer; hardly your Duchess: my plausiblest conjecture for the present is that she, the children and you may hover some time about Richmond perhaps; in that case, we may make the greater speed back to Chelsea to be near you,&#x2014;more commodiously now than at Ischl <supplied>[We]</supplied> have some little visiting to perform in Cumberland and Westmoreland, and nothing more <supplied>[which]</supplied> is not wholly at our own discretion, were the hot weather over. You will of course write directly. I grieve to think of you in London lodgings;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably 8 Leicester Pl.</note> I at one time thought of billeting you on Darwin (43. Marlbro&#x2019; Street), a most hospitable man; but probably you are freer at your own hired hearth. Go and see D. at all events; you will be a great treasure to him in his present state of destitution. Spedding is discoverable at the Colonial Office. Mill returned just when we were departing; I did not see him. We heard from Mrs Sterling this morning; do not neglect to go thither. Fraser would give you the American Book, the half of it that is come? His concluding <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> are expected every morning. W. Fraser I fear is in Marshalsea Prison; for an &#x201C;assault&#x201D;; &#x201C;always unfortunate.&#x201D; Craik is at a place called Vine Cottage, Old Brompton; at all events, Publisher Knight knows of him: he sends us a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> now and then, with slight return; a good man, but prone to come and see you <hi rend="italic">too often</hi>. Mrs Austin is at Richmond; Lady Byron lives there too, a pale melancholy woman. I must write a word to Cavaignac, who has been writing to me, still asserting the heroism of the <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi>. Jane is writing, tho&#x2019; with headache, in her own bedroom: I am in the drawing-room here, with Alick&#x2019;s<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cousin Alick Welsh.</note> old desk brushed up; and can hear my Mother and Mrs Welsh down in the Garden, amid the waving of leafy trees, in the fresh grey weather. I will make my Mother write a word somewhere before this goes off. For the present I ought decidedly to call halt. <closer><salute>Ever yours, dear Brother.&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I wrote a long rigmarole of a Letter in reply to your mute Newspaper-token; today we have your frank, and the new tidings, better than before, that you expect soon to be free altogether and home with us. We are right glad of it; we hope soon to set eye on <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and the fulfilment of it.&#x2014; All remains here in <foreign><hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi></foreign> today, except the weather, which is brighter and more like permanent fairness; as beautiful as one could wish. [Interruption here,&#x2014;till now, <hi rend="italic">Monday Morning</hi> 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s square brackets.</note></p>
<p>I write a few words before breakfast; the house mostly still yet, except myself. The morning again is of the beautifullest; our Mother is to go off for Dumfries today, I am to take her so far in the <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi>, where I had her yesterday evening (sunday as it was) thro&#x2019; the Drumlanrig woods in the blessed sunshine. We shall have a fine drive, I expect. She is to go to Bonerick to see her sister Nickie, whose husband died since you were here;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bonerick is six mi. W of Dumfries in Kirkpatrick Irongray parish. Nickie has been glossed Nicholas in pencil (by A. Carlyle?). Her husband has not been identified.</note> to Bonerick probably tomorrow, then to Dumfries on Wednesday; after which she will proceed to Annan in the Coach, and stay there with Mary and Jenny till she think of Scotsbrig again, perhaps &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> or so.&#x201D; Isabella is still weakly, and threatened with &#x201C;nervousness&#x201D;; but she seems greatly stouter than when you were here, and is able to shift about, somewhat. Jamie has had a sorrowful time I understand, but he holds out in hearty spirits. Alick seems to flourish, might do well enough, they all say, were it not that his miserable tendency<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To drink, presumably.</note> still now and then overcame him, and threw a doubt over all. He is kept busy, but does not seem very cheerful.</p>
<p>As for me I return hither tonight; I would have taken my Mother right forwards into Annandale, but she does not want that. I mean to come and make a resolute struggle here for a week or two to see whether I cannot get some work done. It is absolutely indispensable. I will set to it tomorrow morning with dogged misery and obstinacy; we shall see. My future movements will depend on yours. I will wait here till I hear farther what they are to be. It is not yet known at Ecclefechan that you have arrived; but our Mother will spread the glad news. <pb id="pg-11-159" n="11:159"/>It is likely that you will be here soon: is it not? When any news of moment arrive from you, I will despatch a message thither. If I could but get my Article forward, or even fairly under way, I should meet you with a clearer heart!</p>
<p>Fraser sent a huge packet yesterday, containing after long expectancy on my part&#x2014;one sheet! If you could stir the Printers up there, and make them <hi rend="italic">get done</hi> with that tagrag it would be something. F. and I have a speculation about reprinting W. Meister, both the Portions (as I told you?)&#x2014;Tait does not answer positively as yet, for his share.</p>
<p>In F&#x2019;s packet yesterday came an Emerson Letter:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1839-07-04">4 July</date> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 241&#x2013;43).</note> all right in America; first portion of the Miscellanies done all to 40, a new Edition likely to start soon,&#x2014;for which reason pray do not neglect <hi rend="italic">to bring your copy with you:</hi> there are some errors I want to correct. If you had even room for a copy or two more, I could give them to our friends <hi rend="italic">now;</hi> but that is immaterial.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are very good to think of us still. I sent you a <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Newspaper the other day, as a mute token of my existence and remembrance; yet with doubts whether you would be able to interpret it so. I am here for the last two weeks; one of the most unoccupied, loneliest, far from one of the joyfullest of men. From time to time I feel it absolutely necessary to get into entire solitude; to beg all the world, with passion if they will not grant it otherwise, to be so kind as to leave me altogether alone. One needs to unravel and bring into some articulation <pb id="pg-11-160" n="11:160"/>the villainous chaos that gathers round heart and head in that loud-roaring Babel; to repent of one&#x2019;s many sins, to be right miserable, humiliated, and do penance for them&#x2014;with hope of absolution, of new activity and better obedience! These last two years I have spent in inaction; not in rest; but like a man lying shot on a Waterloo-field, waiting whether he was to get strength again, or to lie and be buried there. Let us hope. All walking, they say, is a succession of <hi rend="italic">falls</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:30.</note> I go wandering with closed lips over the green summer here; in this <hi rend="italic">uns</hi>peakable Universe, winds and waters alone speaking of it to me. One could sit down and burst into streams of tears; but it would serve no purpose.</p>
<p>What you say of your Brother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Spedding (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>), the second son, who had gone into banking, was mortally ill at Leamington Spa; m., <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, Jane Headlam (d. <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>), eldest sister of Frances, Thomas&#x2019;s new wife.</note> gives me a great shock. I knew not at all that it was so. Yesterday, no farther gone, I wrote a light line to James at the Colonial Office, fancying he was there as usual; little in accordance with Leamington where it will find him. Ah me! And &#x201C;life,&#x201D; as you say, &#x201C;must go on.&#x201D; Life is as awful as Death; as awful and far more toilsome. They that die early depart but an hour before us; in an hour we shall rejoin them&#x2014;and the Great God will dispose of us all even as He wills, not as we will, and there shall at least be <hi rend="italic">rest together</hi> forevermore. What a wretched stroller&#x2019;s farce were life throughout, did not the great black curtain of Death hang ever in the background; great as Eternity, inscrutable as God!&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is among our clearest purposes not to return home this year without visiting you. Nothing but some incapability signified on your part is likely to prevent us. Meanwhile as to time, manner, circumstances, all is yet as vague as ever. I can guess only that it will probably be towards the end of this month before we stir anywhither. My Medical Brother is home again unexpectedly from Italy, and expected here in a few days; I am also trying <hi rend="italic">to work</hi>&#x2014;God knows with what success. You shall hear from me again in due time. Send me an old Newspaper in the interim; a Letter if anything special take place, good or evil.</p>
<p>What you say of Chartism is the very truth: revenge begotten of ignorance and hunger! We have enough of it here too; the material of it exists I believe in the hearts of all our working population,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Throughout July there had been riots in Birmingham and Newcastle; wholesale trials of previous rioters at Liverpool, Lancaster, Devizes, Welshpool (for the Llandidloes riot), Chester, Warwick; more arrests for illegal possession of arms and attending unlawful meetings; and the national convention, moving from Birmingham back to London, talked itself into disarray over first calling and then postponing the &#x201C;sacred month,&#x201D; or general strike. For TC&#x2019;s description of a Chartist meeting at Ecclefechan, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390727-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-07-27">27 July</date></ref>.</note>, and <pb id="pg-11-161" n="11:161"/>would right gladly body itself in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> promising shape; but Chartism begins to seem <hi rend="italic">un</hi>promising. What to do with it? Yes, there is the question. Europe has been struggling to give some answer, very audibly since the year <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>! The gallows and the bayonet will do what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can; these altogether failing, we may hope a quite other sort of exorcism will be tried. Alas it is like a dumb overloaded Behemoth, torn with internal misery and rage; but dumb, able only to roar and stamp: let the doctors <hi rend="italic">say</hi> what ails it, let both doct<supplied>[ors]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Obscured by seal.</note> and drivers and all men tremble if they cannot say,&#x2014;for the creature itself is by nature dumb, you need not ask <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to speak. Unless gentry, clergy and all manner of washed articulate-speaking men will learn that their position towards the unwashed is contrary to the Law of God, and change it soon, the Law of Man, one has reason to discern, will change it before long, and that in no soft manner. I pray Heaven they might learn; but fancy that many stripes will be needed first. However, it is in the hands of the right School-master; one who, whatever his <hi rend="italic">wages</hi> may rise to, does verily get his lessons <hi rend="italic">taught</hi>. Experience of actual Fact either teacher Fools, or else abolishes them. For the rest, that England will not become what Ireland is, that England has taken to protesting, even inarticulately, at a point far short of that, is perhaps a thing one ought to be glad of. The fever-fit of Chartism will pass, and other fever-fits; but the thing it means will not pass, till whatsoever of truth and justice lies in the heart of it has been fulfilled; it cannot pass till <hi rend="italic">then</hi>,&#x2014;a long date, I fear.</p>
<p>I know not why I have scribbled so much; I intended only a word, and have sent many. My Wife joins me in kind salutations to you and yours. Unless things go <hi rend="italic">too</hi> perversely we shall all meet soon.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever faithfully yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Miss Wilson</salute>
<p>A letter from me at this date, on a sheet of card paper, and only twopence to pay for it may well fill you with a certain degree of astonishment</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-162" n="11:162"/>The truth is I have received notice of a frank to London and of the arrival of three visitors within the same five minutes and this is a sort of compromise between the <hi rend="italic">desired</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">possible</hi></p>
<p>To write without a frank, in the demoralized conditin [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] which has been my general condition since I came hither, has seemed to me heretofore too strong a measure to venture on&#x2014;only to be thought of under the increasing pressure of desire to know what you are doing, and if you ever think of poor me&#x2014; My Husband I am sure you think of; for besides his superior merit you have his books and his <hi rend="italic">d&#x2019;Orsayfied</hi> likeness<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >D&#x2019;Orsay&#x2019;s sketch of TC (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May</date></ref>) was pbd. as a lithograph by J.

<p>In great pressure of Proofsheets and other rubbish I do write &#x201C;compliments&#x201D;; sorry that I have no time or means to write more. I am not well, today, or any day of late. The weather is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> dusty; no, moisture enough!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter of this morning; which tells us all you can tell: we hope in a day or two there will be definite news of your home-coming, and a day set when I am to come and meet you! The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> of this week has never yet come up from Dumfries, I will send it still if it come. The <hi rend="italic">next</hi> one, which will contain all the sailing days for <date when="1839-08-00">August</date>, I will make a point of sending. Your <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> came duly; I do not get the <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi>r now since we left London; you can send the next N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> too if you chance to have it,&#x2014;not otherwise. The frank to Scotsbrig never arrived;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That is, John&#x2019;s franked letter to Scotsbrig had not been sent on.</note> nor do I know by any hint what is going on there since Monday gone a week, when our Mother and I left it. I suppose they must have guessed that the frank was from you, and opened it to see what news.</p>
<p>I took down my Mother on Monday last, as I told you: it was a bright beautiful day; our <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of that sort. The weather is very moist, very blustery ever since. Today or yesterday, our Mother ought to be at Annan, on her way homewards. She was well, and eager for your return, and mine.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to be busy here ever since Tuesday morning; but cannot say I get on well in any sense. I awake every morning at some unreasonable hour, 7,5 or even 3; and no breakfast is going till half past 9. I will try it a day or two longer; if with no better issue, I will over to Scotsbrig, taking my <hi rend="italic">desk</hi> with me; there at least one can have breakfast a little earlier! It is as of old the chosen region of <hi rend="italic">clatter</hi> this; Jane wrote to me she was &#x201C;nearly dead of clatter.&#x201D; I am always moderately well in solitude, utterly alone; and oftenest contrive to be that way. You will still have time, I think, for another frank to me <hi rend="italic">here:</hi> if I should even be off, the frank can follow me without difficulty.</p>
<p>I daily splash down something on paper about that &#x201C;working-class&#x201D; business; but I am not yet got at all into the heart of it, I have not found the <hi rend="italic">back-bone</hi> of it at all; and can hardly yet venture to say that I have in any sort got into <hi rend="italic">motion</hi> decisively. I must and will persist. There seems no use in <hi rend="italic">living</hi> to me, if it be not writing, or preparing to write. My faculties these two years have lain dormant; I feel impatient to get repossession of them.&#x2014; Write the instant you get any fixed issue. Say whether I may answer under cover to the Duke; Pr<supplied>[oofsh]</supplied>eet <pb id="pg-11-164" n="11:164"/>fr<supplied>[anks?]</supplied> are done for the present.

Tell Craik, we get his <hi rend="italic">Newspapers</hi>, and are always glad of them; oftenest even read them.&#x2014; Jane is not at all very well; but I think will not go to Annandale with me even if I go so soon.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You are at this moment, as I now guess, not a little disappointed as the Postman passes you without a Letter from me. You will get a Letter tomorrow morning, and that also will disappoint you. It would have been all right had you either written last time in a more unmistakeable manner, or not written at all. However, I think I do decipher you now, and the business will still be found in train far better than you once hoped. For after getting home last night, and putting dry clothes on me, and reading and again reading your brief Note in Fraser&#x2019;s frank, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had at last got quietly under my eye, it became more and more clear to me that you had all along calculated on <hi rend="italic">staying</hi> in London till you heard from me, be that when it might: this seemed decidedly the likelihood, and now I could figure your vexation on receiving by Friday&#x2019;s post only the <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> of a letter from me, the important kernel being still, by my bewilderment and over-caution, retained hard and fast <hi rend="italic">here!</hi> I therefore got one of Jamie&#x2019;s men to saddle, and forthwith, by the same post, transmitted the Letter of Credit (&#xa3;1220&#x201D;14&#x201D;10, I think) to W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From John&#x2019;s bank account in Dumfries to William Hamilton, merchant, whom they had used before to transmit money; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310712-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:301&#x2013;2</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-07-12">12 July 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> with request to impart it to you instantly; a thing which I am this day still better satisfied at having done. I calculated that either Hamilton would send to you, or more probably that you would run directly over to Hamilton; and so in either case your vexation vanish with an &#x201C;all&#x2019;s well that ends well.&#x201D; So be it.</p>
<p>The worst is that you cannot now come by tomorrow&#x2019;s steamer, which indeed you could hardly have done even without this last Thornhill <foreign><hi rend="italic">nodus</hi></foreign> [difficulty], tho&#x2019; perhaps you would have attempted it. You will now have to aim either for &#x201C;<date when="1839-08-19">Monday 19 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date> 4 p. m.&#x201D; by <pb id="pg-11-166" n="11:166"/>Sewell, or &#x201C;<date when="1839-08-21">Wednesday 21 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi></date> 8 a. m<supplied>[.]</supplied>&#x201D; by Hudson;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390704-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1839-07-04">4 July</date></ref>.</note> either ship is good enough. I rather conjecture you will make for the former; leaving London on Sunday (or even Sunday night&#x2014;no, that is <hi rend="italic">too insomnial</hi>, avoid that!)&#x2014;getting some 20 hours rest in Liverpool (it is enough <hi rend="italic">there</hi>), then home to breakfast with us on Tuesday? If it is <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, and the Cash affair too is right, and all is right, then send me a Newspaper with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> distinct stroke on it, and I will be in waiting for you at Annan-foot on Tuesday morning. I compute that you will get this note into your hands on Saturday some time, for I have requested Fraser to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> it straight: if however it be past 7&#xBE; o&#x2019;clock at Charing Cross, and no more mails open for six and thirty hours, then do not mind, we shall not indeed get your sign at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> on Monday morning; but do you carry it on in your pocket to Liverpool, put it into the office there, and we shall still get it some time of the day on Monday, time enough, for I will have Alick on the watch for it. Is this clear? If you have time to write, it will of course be better. If you aim for Wednesday, a letter will be expected. I think they will get into Annan that same night: the Gig will be ready. But I vote for Monday, and hope it will be so; the rather as our own time here is drawing to a close, and the sooner you come we shall the better get our discussions completed. I am not nearly sated of the country yet, indeed I should wish to live in the country the year round; but Jane is completely uncomfortable at Templand, cannot long be put up <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> so I find we must quickly address ourselves to getting these Cumberland visits transacted,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Thomas Spedding and the Marshall family.</note> and have her conveyed back to Chelsea again. I, however, will not probably set off <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> at that time; but return out of Cumberland for a ten days? She wants to be at home a while before me to rectify the house. Perhaps I can include you in my future movements? We shall see that.&#x2014; Jane and her Mother were to go off to Ayr this morning,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit William Gibson; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1839-08-18">18 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> to continue there <hi rend="italic">one</hi> week; then hitherward: she will be expecting to be brought down not many days after you arrive; I had an invitation for you too to Templand; you can see about that. My writing has gone all to <hi rend="italic">smearing;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Messiness, as in &#x201C;smearing&#x201D; the sheep with tar and grease against parasites. TC refers to his work on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.</note> I shall do no good till I get to my own desk at Chelsea: I do mean to write that thing, if faculty be left me.</p>
<p>We were all well pleased that you had not made a new alliance with Claredom; well pleased we should all be if you had to go no more to Italy at all. But your plans must shape themselves according <pb id="pg-11-167" n="11:167"/>to necessity; a man must go where he finds there is work for him. I dare say you are full of uncertainties at present, of complicated possibilities and impossibilities. If there was anything that you yourself decidedly <hi rend="italic">wished</hi>, you could then bend all sail towards that, one&#x2019;s chief happiness any where lies in a determinate endeavour such as that. You must have patience, candour of self-judgement; you must learn, if you have not yet learned it, to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">rest in a place</hi>&#x201D; till you get some judgement formed. After all, your own wishes are now your chief indication; you have an income, on which in your single simple state you can live independently of all. Yet of course I would not recommend that. One has other faculties that call for work beside the digestive faculty! In short, dear Brother, you must be your own doctor in this case; you must by patience and effort dive down into what is the real centre of all these confused-looking whirlpools that whirl (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> without their <hi rend="italic">law</hi>) on the surface of one&#x2019;s conduct; you must ascertain the centre, and fix your determination <hi rend="italic">there</hi>. God give you clearness to know, courage to do, and no worse success than you have hitherto had! If your lot brought you near me, it would of course be a blessing to me, to us both I dare say, for tho&#x2019; we chaffer and argue a good deal,&#x2014; a good deal too much, yet surely there is good brotherly agreement between us. A Brother is a great possession in this world; one of the greatest. Yet it would be unwise to make great sacrifices of essentials for the advantage of being <hi rend="italic">close</hi> together. Ah me, I am no man whom it is desirable to be too close to! An unhappy mortal, at least with nerves that preappoint me to continual pain,&#x2014;to loneliness, let me have what crowds of society I like; to work, as the one sole use of living. But we will speculate no longer; above all we will not <hi rend="italic">complain</hi>. Are not the good Heavens good to us? We have a prospect of meeting on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>Had it not been for your pressing injunction, and the shortness of your stay at Ayr, with such uncertainty of posts, I would not have <pb id="pg-11-172" n="11:172"/>written today; being, to speak figuratively, under the influence of <hi rend="italic">fiends,</hi> fiends <hi rend="italic">chemical and vegetable,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laxatives.</note> to which I am given up for a season! You must put up with such as I can give you.</p>
<p>Wednesday proved one of the ugliest days, and my road over the hills was rough, as I computed, with some ten thousand loose stones; however, <hi rend="italic">Doandle</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donald the horse.</note> held toughly out; I was at Ecclefechan about three o&#x2019;clock, and had not passed a hurtful or very uncomfortable day. After an hour or two&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">study</hi> of the Letter I perceived that in all probability Jack did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> mean to quit London till he had heard from me: so, that same evening, I despatched the cash too, but under cover to W. Hamilton; calculating that Jack would post over thither full of rage as soon as he read his own <hi rend="italic">case</hi> of a Letter, and so would unexpectedly by the same post find the <hi rend="italic">kernel</hi> too lying ready for him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390815-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref>, for the arrangements with John&#x2019;s money.</note> As it actually proved. Letters however, as indeed you saw in one instance, came popping along hitherward every second day,&#x2014;to tell us that we must pay 13 pence halfpenny<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To receive John&#x2019;s letters.</note> and sit perfectly still. I calculated that Tuesday (this day) would end it: but greatly to our surprise, Alick&#x2019;s Tom, on Sunday morning early, came over with the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> letter, and tidings that the Doctor was actually there by Coach from Preston! I met him and Alick on the Potter Knowe;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The hill behind Middlebie; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370818-TC-JWC-01"><sic>9:293</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1837-08-18">18 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> they jumped into the Gig, and this mighty enterprise of getting our Doctor home again was happily completed. The money had been &#x201C;all right,&#x201D; was settled at 5&#xBD; per cent., and <hi rend="italic">except</hi> the postages and coursing no harm whatever had been done.</p>
<p>Jack looks a little greyer, not otherwise altered, or if so for the better rather. He expresses great satisfaction over his Duke, satisfaction over Lady Clare<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had been in touch with Lady Clare in London, and had apparently refused a new appointment with her.</note> and many others: he listened rather with interest, you would have said, to your quizzical message about Miss Jessie,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC must have teasingly mentioned Jessie Fergus as a possible wife now that Elizabeth was to marry Pepoli.</note> and inquired, rather rapidly you would have said, &#x201C;Where is she now?&#x201D; My idea is that he will not get married, within a near date; but that he is not without notions tending that way. His plans, if plans he have, he has not spoken of yet. He had seen Darwin, Wedgwood, Wrightson, Mill; but brought no tidings of importance from any of them. He had also dined with Fraser, now <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of Prison I think; and <pb id="pg-11-173" n="11:173"/>seen him while in.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wrightson (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:152</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></corr></ref>) was a friend of Erasmus Darwin and the Wedgwoods. Mill had returned from Italy by <date when="1839-07-01">1 July</date>. For William Fraser&#x2019;s imprisonment, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May</date></ref>.</note> Darwin looked &#x201C;dull&#x201D;; Mill looked &#x201C;much improved,&#x201D;&#x2014;told him Sterling had an &#x201C;Article&#x201D; on me coming out by and by.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <date when="1839-10-00">Oct.</date> issue of the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>. For Mill&#x2019;s letters to Sterling on the article, see Mineka 13:401&#x2013;2, 405.</note> He &#x201C;would have liked rather well to go to you at Ayr; but&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Today my Mother and he are gone to Annan; and I (under the influence of fiends) sit scribbling here to my Spirit-of-Soot.</p>
<p>Nonentity, or as near an approach to that as the human faculties are capable of, has been my history ever since I returned. I feel it pleasant, even useful for a time; with solitude and freedom there is something in it that seems very wholesome for me. I have written no more; will not try it again till I get to Chelsea. In Fraser&#x2019;s frank I sent a Note for Creek;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. L. Craik.</note> bade Fraser too [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] send him a copy of the new F. R. Jack has brought a copy of it with him; it looks very well; is to be bound in red coloured cloth, with gilt letters.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Dyer, the 1,500 for Britain were bound in black cloth and the 500 for North America were bound in green</note> He has also an American <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> concern, tho&#x2019; as yet only the two volumes that we know.</p>
<p>I have also been in communication with Stewart of Gillenbie about the sale of Puttoch; Nelson had spoken to him the day I saw you. He expresses great zeal to serve me; evidently &#x201C;desires my acquaintance.&#x201D; I had appointed to visit him on Monday last if he <hi rend="italic">said nothing;</hi> but he had a messenger here, some 7 miles off, who roused me before 7 in the morning, to say that he was called from home, that Wednesday or <hi rend="italic">any</hi> subsequent day would do, and that I would surely &#x201C;stay to dinner.&#x201D; I had the <hi rend="italic">chemical fiend</hi> in me that morning (not yet exorcised), it was before 7 of the clock, and I suddenly roused; alas, I said Wednesday would probably still do, but it runs in my head that I treated the dinner, impolitely, almost like an <hi rend="italic">offence,</hi> as the notion of it was at that moment; and there it still hangs. We shall see tomorrow. He is really very civil this Stewart and a clever sensible man. His aid in this same sale could not fail to be valuable. He can say too whether one should do it now or wait. My lowest computation of the probable price gives a decisively superior amount of interest to the present rent, and no trouble whatever with it thenceforth; my opinion is that it ought without fail to be sold when the time is of average quality for selling.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craigenputtoch was not sold. For Stewart, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390815-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; God help me! Here, visible from this window, slowly sailing down <pb id="pg-11-174" n="11:174"/>Purdhamston <foreign>brae</foreign>, is W. Grahame, evidently bent hither to see Jack! Yes indeed; there is his knock; and I am doomed&#x2014; &#x2014; &#x2014; <hi rend="italic">4&#xBD; p.m.</hi> That fatal man has sat these two hours and more; still sits: one cannot assassinate him, he is so goodnatured withal; I have got him set to the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies,</hi> and retire hither to finish. Isabella is to make tea; I am free at least till then. &#x201C;Died by the visitation of Clatter!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Stewart has another thing in hand for my behoof: the letting of a small Farm for poor Austin and Mary. I believe nothing will come of it; &#x201C;The Marquis&#x201D; has already &#x201C;given his promise to another,&#x201D; I dare say. They must make a shift elsewhere, poor crea<supplied>[tures.]</supplied> Austin was here today for some hay he had bought; Jamie and he are off to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at the Farm in question, but a new letter arrives from Stewart, since they went, expressing apprehension of that kind.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably John Douglas (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), 7th Marquess of Queensberry, of Kinmount House, Cummertrees, Dumfriesshire, a major landowner. TC had also referred to Charles Douglas, 6th Marquess, as &#x201C;Marquis&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18370921-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:313</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-09-21">21 Sept. 1837</date></corr></ref>). Apparently Stewart was successful as the Austins had moved into the Gill, a small farm on Queensberry&#x2019;s estate in Cummertrees, by <date when="1839-10-00">Oct.</date></note> We shall know tomorrow.</p>
<p>So passes existence with us here. As for my poor Duckie, were it not for such close neighbourhood of the Town-clock, things would look not so ill with her. I am very glad to hear of that plunge in the sea: I feel always as if there were health in it for everyone, it does myself so much good. Also we do not let ourselves be <foreign><hi rend="italic">nooled</hi></foreign> [beaten]! No, there is no occasion for that, I think. The British subject stands up for himself; endures no <hi rend="italic">defeat;</hi> hopes soon to attain the blessedness even of <hi rend="italic">no battle</hi>. When you tire of Ayr, as I said, take a place in the Dumfries Coach, and warn me the day before. Or if you find it supportable, still more if you enjoy yourself at all, end it peaceably, by the natural termination. We must make for Cumberland before long; there will be little good farther got of it in this quarter, I doubt. I have not yet written to the Marshalls, nor will I till you come. Return of post, I fancy, will do it, at any time. I sent a Newspaper to Spedding of Keswick. Did you write to Mrs Chorley; to Miss Wilson or anybody? It is not of much moment. Creek had sent a Newspaper to Templand; it came hither; nothing else, except your <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Chronicle</hi>.</note> from Ayr. There is a delightful immunity from Letters here. Cavaignac&#x2019;s I retain for you, tho&#x2019; there is nothing in it except wind-melody. He speaks of Pepoli, what we know, that his marriage <hi rend="italic">has not taken place</hi>. Pepoli, Jack says, cut him (as he thought) or half-cut him. <foreign><hi rend="italic">va ben</hi></foreign> [all right].</p>
<p>O Goody what a useless wretch I am! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Armseliger Faust, ich kenne <pb id="pg-11-175" n="11:175"/>Dich nicht mehr</hi></foreign> [Wretched Faust! I don&#x2019;t recognize you any more].<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Faust says this of himself; <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> 1:2720.</note> We must try to take up a new sort of stitch soon. I do not think I am yet ready or very near ready with any Book, but I am and must be ready to resume the possession of my faculties, and shake this sick sleep out of my eyes. The Article, or some Article, must be written. Ye must just excuse us this day. Poor Goody! But it will and shall all be better yet, and as good as need be. Courage, my <foreign>Bairn</foreign>!&#x2014; Jack has a bottle of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eau de Cologne</hi></foreign> for your Mother (this a secret, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like?); for you or me, nothing that I see. What has this little girl &#x26;c? Remember me as is fit to the good Hostess; good, but with the best intentions always unfortunate! Really one could weep to think of poor human nature; but it is a thing not to be remedied by weeping. Enough of it here.&#x2014; A Letter seems to get hither from Ayr in 24 hours (yours came on Monday); from Templand it takes 48;&#x2014;remember this in your writing and messaging. I shall look to get some letter or sign from you very soon; a letter will be more distinct. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Goody, dear enough if thou knew all.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Printing Account for the 500 American Books shall be paid so soon as I get in contact with Banks and means of transmission. It proves, as most accounts do, considerably larger than was expected; but I compute that you have done what you could to keep it down to the right point; so we will pay it, and say nothing. I wish with my whole heart the Books were fairly at sea, and the other <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> Books fairly <hi rend="italic">off</hi> sea;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Emerson wrote to TC, <date when="1839-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, the additional 260 copies of vols. 3 and 4 of the <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> printed by James Munroe of Boston had been sent, by the <hi rend="italic">Ontario,</hi> on <date when="1839-08-01">1 Aug.</date>, with a title-page already printed for James Fraser. They arrived <date when="1839-09-00">early Sept.</date> The 500 copies <hi rend="italic">of The French Revolution,</hi> for America, were sent <date when="1839-09-00">early Sept.</date> Fraser was to be paid &#xa3;95 for them.</note> that so we might have done with that kind of transit-trade. I beg of you to use all despatch in getting the former embarked:&#x2014;or perhaps you have already done it? I shall be right <pb id="pg-11-176" n="11:176"/>thankful to hear that they are past the Buoy of the Nore,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marking a sandbank in the Thames estuary, forty-seven mi. from London.</note> let their voyage end where it can. Nothing, or very little, can now be made of that part of the adventure; we must look to the English 1500, which I am glad to hear you praise the appearance of. The binding in cloth is a change that I cannot but approve of very much.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fraser&#x2019;s 2d edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>. The 1st edn. was in boards.</note></p>
<p>I am glad you have given the <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> to Robson;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Printer, of Levey, Robson, &#x26; Franklin, 46 St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane, who had printed vol. 3 of the 1st edn. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>.</note> my imagination has all along represented him as a paragon in comparison with the others. We shall see.</p>
<p>As to the questions, I answer that the &#x201C;Notice on Goethe&#x201D; is to be printed where it now stands, namely at the beginning of the <hi rend="italic">Travels;</hi> the &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface&#x201D; also where it stands, that is, at the beginning of the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Notice on Goethe,&#x201D; called &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface to the Fourth Volume of &#x2018;German Romance&#x2019;&#x201D; (&#x201C;Goethe,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:12&#x2013;33), and the &#x201C;Translator&#x2019;s Preface to First Edition of &#x2018;Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:3&#x2013;11) were duly printed in 3:iii-xxxi and 1:ix-xix, of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels.

A New Edition, Revised</hi> (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>).</note> Some other slig<supplied>[ht]</supplied> announcement of perhaps three or four sentences in length ought possibly to precede this latter, and have reference to both.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;To the Reader,&#x201D; signed &#x201C;T.

In his <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> pref. he wrote that he had made &#x201C;many little changes&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> but could not change it into a &#x201C;right translation.&#x201D; In the <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> which had been a trans. of Goethe&#x2019;s incomplete <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date> edn., he had changed &#x201C;little or nothing.&#x201D; Despite Goethe&#x2019;s own additions to the final (<date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>) German version (to which TC refers here), which gave &#x201C;a great expansion both of size and scope,&#x201D; TC decided that for the &#x201C;mere English reader&#x201D; there were &#x201C;already novelties enough&#x201D; and that &#x201C;it seemed inadvisable to meddle with it farther at present&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:1&#x2013;2). Presumably, in fact, Fraser offered no extra money for any new trans. of Goethe&#x2019;s <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date> edns.</note></p>
<p>Have you got the <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> by you? There are two other things in it well worth reprinting, and only two: <hi rend="italic">Richter</hi> occupying volume 3<hi rend="italic">d; Tieck</hi> occupying the <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of volume <hi rend="italic">2nd</hi>. Are these things capable of being in any way gathered into this Enterprise, or incapable? At the time when Tait hesitated, I used to think we might print the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> by itself, as one item, the first item, of &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Translations from the German&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> were of course still better), the rest to follow as they could: <hi rend="italic">Goethe, Richter, <pb id="pg-11-177" n="11:177"/>Tieck,</hi>&#x2014; I should not care to shew myself in company with any other of them, and these are here somewhat in the proportion of their relative worth in my estimation, Goethe 3 or 4 times as large as Richter, 6 or 7 times as large as Tieck!&#x2014; On the whole it was merely a vague glance or two I gave at such a scheme, nor do I care anything about it even now.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390723-TC-WT-01">TC to WT, <date when="1839-07-23">23 July</date></ref>; none of the other writers from <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> was included.</note> It is only that Richter and Tieck <hi rend="italic">ought not,</hi> in fairness, to sink; and the others <hi rend="italic">ought,</hi> whenever they like. Perhaps you had better not mind it much, but hold by the Goethe, as at present.</p>
<p>It seems likely we shall be at Chelsea soon again. We have visits in Cumberland, Westmoreland; then home in a week or two. My address is <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> franks will follow anywhither. No haste about my Brother&#x2019;s Letter; he is here safe beside me: send it by any frank.&#x2014; Now, speed with your shipments!</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>A cheerful and right welcome Letter of yours, dated <date when="1839-07-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July</date>, reached me here, duly forwarded, some three weeks ago; I delayed answering till there could some definite statement, as to bales of literature shipped or landed, or other matter of business forwarded a stage, be made. I am here, with my Wife, rusticating again, these two months; amid diluvian rains, chartism, Teetotalism, deficient harvest, and general complaint and confusion; which not being able to mend, all that I can do is to heed them as little as possible. &#x201C;What care I for the house? I am only a lodger.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seneca, <hi rend="italic">Ad Lucilium Epistulae Morales</hi> 120.16.</note> On the whole, I have sat under the wing of Saint Swithin; uncheery, sluggish, murky, as the wettest of his Days;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rain on St. Swithin&#x2019;s day (<date when="0000-07-15">15 July</date>) was supposed to mean rain for the next forty days.</note>&#x2014;hoping always nevertheless that blue sky, figurative and real, does exist, and will demonstrate itself by and by. I have been the stupidest and laziest of men. I could not write even to you, till some palpable call told me I must.</p>
<p>Yesternight however there arrives a despatch from Fraser, apprising <pb id="pg-11-178" n="11:178"/>me that the American <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, second cargo, are announced from Portsmouth, and &#x201C;will probably be in the River tomorrow&#x201D;; where accordingly they in all likelihood now are, a fair landing and good welcome to them! Fraser &#x201C;knows not whether they are bound or not&#x201D;; but will soon know. The first cargo, of which I have a specimen here, contented him extremely; only there was one fatality, the cloth of the binding was multiplex, party-coloured, some sets done in green, others in red, blue, perhaps skyblue! Now if the second cargo were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> multiplex, party-coloured, nay multiplex <hi rend="italic">in exact concordance with the first</hi>, as seemed almost impossible&#x2014;?&#x2014; Alas, in that case, one could not well predict the issue!&#x2014; Seriously, it is a most handsome Book you have made; and I have nothing to return but thanks and again thanks. By the bye if you do print a small second edition of the First Portion, I might have had a small set of <foreign><hi rend="italic">errata</hi></foreign> ready: but <hi rend="italic">where are they?</hi> The Book only came into my hand <hi rend="italic">here</hi> a few days ago; and I have been whipt from post to pillar without will of my own, without energy to form a will! The only glaring error I recollect at this moment is one somewhere in the second article on <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul:</hi> &#x201C;Osion&#x201D; (I think, or some such thing) instead of &#x201C;Orson&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2:223, corrected in the 2d edn. (2:353) to &#x201C;Orson&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 27:142).</note> it is not an original American error, but copied from the English; if the Printer get his eye upon it, let him rectify; if not, not, I <hi rend="italic">deserve</hi> to have it stand against me there. Fraser&#x2019;s joy, should the Books prove either unbound, or multiplex in the right way, will be great and unalloyed; he calculates on selling all the copies very soon. He has begun reprinting Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> too, the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> under one; and hopes to remunerate himself for that by and by: whether there will then remain any small <foreign>peculium</foreign> for me is but uncertain; meanwhile I correct the press nothing doubting. One of these I call my best Translation, the other my worst; I have read that latter, the <hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi>, again in these weeks; not without surprise, disappointment, nay aversion here and there, yet on the whole with ever new esteem. I find I can pardon <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things in a man except purblindness, falseness of vision,&#x2014; for indeed does not that presuppose every other kind of falseness?</p>
<p>But let me hasten to say that the <hi rend="italic">F. Revolution</hi>, 500 strong, for the New England market, is also, as Fraser advises, &#x201C;to go to sea in three days.&#x201D; It is bound in red cloth, gilt; a pretty book, James says; which he will sell for 25 shillings here;&#x2014;nay the London brotherhood have &#x201C;subscribed&#x201D; for 180 at once, which he considers great work. I directed him to consign to Little and Brown in Boston,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The 500 copies did not arrive until <date when="1839-11-29">29 Nov.</date>, as Fraser sent them by a ship bound for New York. Emerson wrote, <date when="1839-12-12">12 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;They came &#x2026; not in the pretty red &#x2026; but in a sober green;&#x2014;not so handsome &#x26; saleable a <hi rend="italic">back</hi>, our booksellers said, as their own; but in every other respect a good book&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 253). They were to sell for $3.75.</note> the <hi rend="italic">property</hi> of the <pb id="pg-11-179" n="11:179"/>thing <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, with such phraseology and formalities as they use in those cases. I paid him for it yesterday (to save discount) &#xa3;95; that is the whole cost to me, 20 or 30 pounds more than was once calculated on. Do the best with it you can, my friend; and never mind the result. If the thing fail, as is likely enough, we will simply quit that transport trade, and say experience must be <hi rend="italic">paid for</hi>. The Title-page was &#x201C;Boston: Charles C. Little and James Brown&#x201D;; then, in a second line and smaller type, &#x201C;London: James Fraser&#x201D;; to which arrangement James made not the slightest objection, or indeed rather seemed to like it.&#x2014; So much for trade matters: is it not <hi rend="italic">enough?</hi> I declare I blush sometimes, and wonder where the good Emerson gets all his patience. We shall be thro&#x2019; the affair one day, and find something better to speak about than dollars and pounds. And yet, as you well say, why not even of dollars? Ah, there are leaden-worded <supplied>[bills]</supplied> of exchange I have seen which have had an almost sacred character to me! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Pauca verba</hi></foreign> [Few words].</p>
<p>Doubt not your new utterances are eagerly waited for here; above all things the &#x201C;Book&#x201D; is what I want to see.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written, <date when="1839-07-04">4 July</date>: &#x201C;I am getting on with some studies of mine prosperously for me, have got three essays nearly done, and who knows but in the autumn I shall have a book?&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 243); in fact, his <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> was not pbd. until <date when="1841-00-00">early 1841</date>.</note> You might have told me what it was about. We shall see by and by. A man that has discerned somewhat, and knows it for himself, let him speak it out, and thank Heaven. I pray that they do not confuse you by praises; their blame will do no harm at all. Praise is sweet to all men; and yet alas, alas, if the light of one&#x2019;s own heart go out, bedimmed with poor vapours and sickly false glitterings and flashings, what profit is it! Happier in darkness, in all manner of mere outward darkness, misfortune and neglect, &#x201C;so that <hi rend="italic">thou canst endure</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 18:23.</note>&#x2014;which however one cannot to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> lengths. God speed you, my Brother! I hope all good things of you; and wonder whether like Phoebus Apollo you are destined to be a youth forever.&#x2014; Sterling will be right glad to hear your praises; not unmerited, for he is a man among millions that John of mine, tho&#x2019; his perpetual-mobility wears me out at times. Did he ever write to you? His latest speculation was that he should and would; but I fancy it is among the clouds again.

<p><salute>Alas, my dear Sir,</salute> precisely on the day when I was about writing to you, to fix, in spite of all obstacles, the time of our meeting, arrives the fatal Letter!

I never knew your dear Brother,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Spedding.</note> of you also I have seen with my eyes but little; yet it seems to me at this moment as if I had known you both long, and loved you well.</p>
<p>We have forthwith renounced the notion of Cumberland altogether for this year. We had no strict call except to you; and from you we are now too mournfully absolved by this event. Cumberland is wrapt in sorrow and shade to one&#x2019;s thoughts; visiting there, or anywhere, is not our business any more at present. We purpose getting to Carlisle on Monday; then by the Preston Railway home as soon as possible,&#x2014;on <pb id="pg-11-181" n="11:181"/>the following forenoon as we calculate. If you could write me a word thither, or failing you if James were to write, I feel as if it would be kind; tho indeed at bottom, what is there to say? Alas, all is already said. God comfort you, my friend.</p>
<p>I shall have a Book to send you: is Carlisle the place to direct it towards?</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>On this friday morning, having now mastered or shoved aside the most pressing of the affairs that were waiting for me here, I sit down to write according to engagement. Alick will bring the Letter over for you, I hope, on Sunday morning, and find you well to welcome him and it.</p>
<p>We got along in the gentlest manner, without adventure of any kind, to Carlisle, where we arrived about three o&#x2019;clock. The luggage lay safe at the Bush Inn, which however was not the place our evening Coach was to start from; the morning coach starts from the Bush, but the evening from another Inn called the &#x201C;Coffee house.&#x201D; However, we abode by our Bush; the &#x201C;head-inn,&#x201D; a very orderly desirable house, tho&#x2019; a dear one;&#x2014;our bill in it, for horse, boy and selves, was ten shillings for these two hours, but our treatment also was good and satisfactory. The boy arrived about an hour after us; we had passed him some five miles from the city, not recognizing him at once. He looked very <foreign><hi rend="italic">blate</hi></foreign> [bashful] and bewildered, would not say <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he could like to dine on, but expressed no unwillingness to dine on something; which accordingly he seemed to have done at last; for he looked sated, glass-eyed, and as it were clogged with victual at the time we set off, and I could rather have liked to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him arrive safely at Scotsbrig, tho&#x2019; there seemed small likelihood of danger, and I straitly charged <hi rend="italic">Boots</hi> and all persons concerned to get him under way forthwith. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Doandle</hi>&#x201D; had been fed and scrubbed: the boy&#x2019;s duty consisted in paying sixpence to the ostler, and not flinging himself out till he got to your door. The sight of the luggage brought to my mind that I had never repaid Jamie what he paid for carrying it from Templand thither; I gave the boy cash for that, 3/, which I judged withal might be useful to have in his <pb id="pg-11-182" n="11:182"/>pocket by the road. He stood by the Coffee house-door, with the old great coat hung over his arm, looking listlessly at our departing coach; that was the last of him. On the top of Shap Fell,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >High crossing point of the road, and later the railway, from Carlisle to Preston between the mountains of the Lake District and the Pennine Chain.</note> about nine o&#x2019;clock, I judged you might be all questioning him; glad to learn from him that all had gone well,&#x2014;as I hope it did go on his side no worse than on ours.</p>
<p>Till five o&#x2019;clock we had plenty of time, and not more than that, for getting all things arranged: one inside seat was open at Carlisle when we arrived; they have two, an inside and an outside, which they can let there beforehand; the outside was already taken, so that till the vehicle actually came, there was for me no certainty but only a hope. However, at five, it had all gone as right as possible; Jane sat within, our whole luggage on the top, and I in front of it between two simple persons, of the harmless miscellaneous class, the place on the coach-box occupied by a tourist dandy in white hat and scotch plaid and Taglioni coat,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A kind of greatcoat, named after the family of ballet dancers, fashionable in <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.</note> also a very harmless person; whom indeed I had taken for the driver at first! We had the finest evening, the finest night; I had six <hi rend="italic">cheroots</hi> in my pocket and a ready tinder-box; I sent many a silent thought towards you, and wished my dear Mother could have known how well we were. Your cloak was of essential benefit; I wrapt my own well round my legs and feet, keeping yours round my shoulders, and suffered next to nothing at all from cold. It was two o&#x2019;clock when we got to Preston; the mail train to start about three. They crammed a cup of hot coffee and a buttered muffin into us, then us into an omnibus, and after some jolting confusion and delay into a railway vehicle which at three shot off with us into the Night. A small rain had begun by this time; the first spit of it I felt in my face as we drove up to our inn-door at Preston. The whirl thro&#x2019; the confused darkness on those steam wings was one of the strangest things I have experienced. Hissing and dashing on, one knew not whither, we saw the gleam of towns in the distance, unknown towns; we went over the tops of towns (one town or village I saw clearly with its chimney heads vainly stretching up towards us); <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the stars, not <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the clouds but among them; out of one vehicle then into another, snorting, roaring we flew;&#x2014;the likest things to a Faust&#x2019;s flight on the Devil&#x2019;s mantle;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> 1:2065&#x2013;70.</note> or as if some huge steam nightbird had flung you on its back, and were <pb id="pg-11-183" n="11:183"/>sweeping thro&#x2019; unknown space with you, most probably towards London! By degrees I fell asleep; woke as little as possible till I heard the sound, &#x201C;Wolverhampton was our last stage,&#x201D; and knew that <hi rend="italic">Brumagem</hi> [Birmingham] was now nigh. Jane had slept some too; we had ample room in our machine, and could lie stretched across it. At Birmingham there was a change of vehicle, and luggage to be shifted amid the rain; however, all was again right; an excellent breakfast, with deliberation to eat it, set us up surprisingly; and so with the usual series of phenomena we were safe landed at Euston Square, soon after one o&#x2019;clock; and in another hour, by a most ugly hackney-coachman, here at our own door.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The journey was on <date when="1839-09-10">10</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-09-11">11 Sept.</date> The North Union Railway from Preston had opened <date when="1838-10-31">31 Oct. 1838</date>, and the Birmingham to London line had opened <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept. 1838</date>.</note> Helen had fires on; she had arrived only twelve hours or so before us, having come by Hull for cheapness: it was on the whole a piece of luck that we did not get away on Monday. All was as right here as it could be in a house so dismantled, not a paper-clipping out of its place, but the place of no thing discoverable at once. I borrowed a pen from the Marshalls, and despatched the <hi rend="italic">Corn Law Circular;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The next-door neighbors; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date>]</ref>. The <hi rend="italic">Anti-Corn Law Circular</hi>, the League&#x2019;s fortnightly journal, begun <date when="1839-04-16">16 April</date>, was to indicate safe arrival. Henry Cole had asked Cobden, <date when="1839-06-22">22 June</date>: &#x201C;Will you send your circular to Thomas Carlyle, Cheyne Street, Chelsea? He was quoted in last week&#x2019;s Circular, and is making studies into the condition of the working class&#x201D; (Henry Cole, <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years of Public Work</hi> [London, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 2:145&#x2013;46).</note> I discovered pipes, and smoked;&#x2014;by the bye, you may assure my good Alick that dried, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the right tobacco after all, that same, which he took so much trouble with, and I shall thank him for it all winter! Finally, we had two chickens boiled (tell this to my Mother), and <supplied>[ate a?]</supplied> wholesome dinner; the third chicken roasted was our dinner yesterday. We slept long a<supplied>[nd]</supplied> deep. It was a great surprise: the first moment, to find one did not awaken at Scotsbrig! Wretched feelings of all sorts were holding carnival within me; the best I could do was to keep the door <hi rend="italic">carefully shut on them:</hi> I sat dead silent all yesterday, working at <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi>, and now they are gone back to their caves again. Jane has already rehabilitated the house; could she but get her <hi rend="italic">spoons</hi> from Darwin, who perhaps is not in town! We spoke at Fraser&#x2019;s door as we passed in our hackney; the <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> sheets were soon forwarded, and all goes right there: the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> arrived, and <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> as to binding; the F. R. packed into boxes, and waiting for a Boston ship, or destined now to take a New York one without waiting.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By using a New York ship, their arrival at Boston was delayed until <date when="1839-11-29">29 Nov.</date></note> Fraser was not there. They handed me a packet from America, a Translation of Eckermann&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-11-184" n="11:184"/><hi rend="italic">Conversations with Goethe</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >S.

Emerson had sent it to TC &#x201C;for the sake of its preface mainly. She is a most accomplished lady, and her culture belongs rather to Europe than to America&#x201D; (<date when="1839-07-04">4 July</date>, Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 243). Margaret Fuller described TC in her pref. as &#x201C;the only competent critic&#x201D; of Goethe.</note> which I will by and by send to my Mother; for you there seemed to be nothing lying. The Sterlings, Mrs Sterling and Mrs Major Sterling,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Major Sterling was Charlotte, Anthony&#x2019;s wife, though he was still a capt.</note> called yesterday on chance; the old Stimabile at Brighton, the young one making ready for Canada; Jane was up there in the evening, having been out when they called here. John is well at Cifton [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].

Hunt and Craik also found us yesterday; interrupted my &#x201C;dead silence&#x201D; for a while. I lent Hunt the Eckermann; Craik was as kind and wearisome as ever. No news have I heard of the smallest moment,&#x2014;unless it be that our Chelsea omnibuses now take you to the City for <hi rend="italic">sixpence</hi>, if you account that of moment! I walked to Hyde Park after nightfall yesterday; I am going up to town today. In short, we have had the most prosperous journey that was possible; all is right here, and I, with work daily, shall grow right too. The <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> will occupy me continually for ten days or so; we shall then see. Silence!</p>
<p>About midway between Birm<hi rend="italic">m</hi> and London our rainy morning cleared up into a grey, damp, rainless day, which yesterday also was; I doubt it continued raining all the while in Lancashire and northward, over poor Jamie among others. Today is bright brisk sunshine, wind at N. W. I hope Jamie has this too. Tell him I admire his healthy equanimity, his honest solidity of mind; and will thank him for many things, in thought, more than I ever did in word. To all of you, ye kind good souls, what can I send but thanks, heartfelt thanks. Well fare it with you all; at a distance, since it cannot be near! I was an ungainly <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> man while loitering there; but you have forgiven me, you have pitied me: I shall in reality be much better now. And so enough for today, dear Jack. Take my Mother to Dumfries, the first bright glimpse of weather you have; the drive will do her good. Settle with Austin about his money. Write to me when anything definite occurs; in a few days <pb id="pg-11-185" n="11:185"/>whether there be anything definite or not. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. Good be with you all ever!</salute></closer></p>

I will off into town with him; that is the shortest&#x2014;for once.&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, again.&#x2014; Jane is gone out, or she would send you all her remembrances in words.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter dated <date when="1839-07-01">1st July</date> was put into my hands precisely three-and-twenty <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> ago! It must have been delivered at this door just about the moment of our departure; a moment sooner, we should have got hold of it at once; a moment later, it would have fallen into the course prescribed for subsequent Letters, and been forwarded to us in a day or two. As it was, the unfortunate House-Agent, at that instant on the premises, laid hold of it, and nothing doubting kept it safe and silent by him till, yesterday morning, he had ascertained our return! The solemnity with which this unfortunate functionary presented the one small note, with the air of a man who had done <hi rend="italic">his</hi> duty and made sure of thanks, was a thing to look at. With all one&#x2019;s vexation, one could not but explode into laughter.</p>
<p>We are now here at anchor; awaiting what gyration of yours will be kind enough to lead you hither. Any day or week, the sooner the better, we shall be glad to see your face again.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is yet hidden from me; I have been far remote from Books. The dim prophecy, which I interpret to mean that I shall soon see <hi rend="italic">it</hi> withal, ought to fulfill itself with the least possible delay.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Cromwell and the Republicans</hi> had been pbd. in <date when="1839-08-00">late Aug.</date></note></p>

<salute>Dear Jack,</salute>
<p>On Saturday towards four O&#x2019;clock our Postman met me accidentally in Brompton, and handed me the inclosed Letter, a little before the time. I stopt into Sterling&#x2019;s, and answered, in time still for that evening&#x2019;s post, that I would forward the letter by the first opportunity, that &#x201C;Scotsbrig Ecclefechan N. B&#x201D; was some 300 miles off, that &#x201C;should any of her Ladyships wishes be frustrated by this circumstances, Dr Carlyle&#x2019;s sorrow&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;a proper <foreign><hi rend="italic">nichtssagendes</hi></foreign> [saying-nothing] <hi rend="italic">Billet;</hi> to which no answer having come, I suppose that all is right, that her Ladyship is gone or going as predicted, and that the Note is of no pressing moment.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s note to Lady Clare not found. John replied, <date when="1839-09-25">25 Sept.</date>, that her note was to say that she &#x201C;would be very glad to see me before setting out for Italy.&#x201D;</note> Sterling today can perhaps get me a frank for it, however; I will send it forthwith.</p>
<p>I am literally altogether busy today, have not time for a word. All goes on well enough: my travelling hurricane is nearly calmed again, and I feel rather decidedly better than while with you. Weather still rainy, showers and sunshine, hardly one day entirely dry.

<p>Anthony Sterling sails on Saturday next from Liverpool for Canada: his Wife continues here in Knightsbridge, till he return, it is hoped in spring. I have not seen Mill or anybody. Fraser is out of town; his Clerks cannot get the American F. R. off without delays.

<p>Yesterday I heard a young thick lipped energetic-looking mechanic lecturing to a considerable crowd on teetotalism; what a miserable beast he himself had once been, how much better he was now, happy he and his &#x201C;old woman,&#x201D; and ever growing happier &#x26;c &#x26;c. The people listened attentively, in considerable numbers, in perfect silence: it was a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sermo</hi></foreign> [personal utterance] meaning a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>, not a babblement meaning no-thing. I with my whole heart wished him speed.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The British and Foreign Temperance Society, founded <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, advocated abstinence from spirits. The more extreme teetotalism, total abstinence from all liquor, had begun in Preston, <date when="1833-00-00">ca. 1833</date>. Disagreement between the advocates of both kinds of temperance caused problems in the movement and led to ridicule (e.g., <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1839-06-12">12 June</date>, <date when="1839-07-24">24 July</date>). TC obviously saw a successful example of public preaching by the converted to a receptive audience.</note></p>

<p>After the<date when="1840-01-01">first of January</date>, when the penny-post bill comes into action, I shall surely send &#x201C;Sibilline leaves&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wise and prophetic utterances.</note> all over the world, and you <pb id="pg-11-188" n="11:188"/>shall get your share of them. But in the meanwhile (our members being all serving their country in the moors a-shooting of innocent grouse) it is a questionable kindness to take fourteen pence out of your purse for any good I can do you by writing. For the consolation of my own conscience, however, I must articulate my thanks for your irish-collar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >White embroidery on a white ground.</note>&#x2014;must give some explanation of our crow&#x2019;s-flight southward&#x2014;must assure you that my cousinly feelings towards you have by no means been steeped out of me by my wet sojourn in Scotland, but have been preserved quite snug in a warm corner of my heart to bloom luxuriantly, I trust to the end of time&#x2014;that is to say&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> time. There was in the Liverpool letters, which came while I was at Templand, indications of a beautiful delusion in the cousinly mind on the subject of my <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;improvement&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; in what, if not in the virtue of patience, I was at a loss to conceive. For my looking-glass assured me that I was growing thinner and yellower every day&#x2014;and headaches, rheumatism, <foreign>ennui</foreign> and desperation were my portion every day and all. How could it be otherwise&#x2014;it rained without ceasing, my occupation was gone,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 3.3.</note> and there was no human speech to be got out of Mundells Macveahs<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Robert Mundell of Closeburn and his wife; the Macveahs are not identified.</note> and the like&#x2014;but only inhuman clatter. I cannot conceive how my mother manages to exist in that place, yet she appears to find it quite satisfactory, nay to think it a sort of fairyland where everybody <hi rend="italic">must</hi> thrive, unless thro&#x2019; own perversity, and wilful resistance to its &#x201C;improving&#x201D; influences.</p>
<p>When the time came for returning Southward all heart for other visiting was entirely cut out of me. I longed for my own No. 5 Cheyne Row with the passion of a lover; where I might at least declare myself unwell, if I felt so, without offence to mortal, and where my hands should find something to do more or less profitable. Nevertheless we were all in readiness to start for the lake country, as in duty bound, having promised Mr. Spedding to that effect for the last two years&#x2014;but just then, a death occurred in his family which put our visit to him aside for the present&#x2014;and the other two visits, my husband and I taking sweet counsel together opined might be <hi rend="italic">shirked</hi> without much harm done&#x2014;so we made our excuses like a couple of liver-hearted travellers, as it must be admitted we are, and tempted by my Brother-in-law John&#x2019;s experience who had just come down by the Preston Railroad we renounced Liverpool also, and putting ourselves into a coach at Carlyle Carlisle (is that it?), found ourselves in London twenty <pb id="pg-11-189" n="11:189"/>hours after. At twelve on Tuesday we started from Scotsbrig in our gig&#x2014;at half after one on Wednesday we were in London. This was losing no time. Our little maid had arrived according to orders the night before, and opened the door to us with a half glad &#x201C;half Magdeline&#x201D; aspect. There was nothing a-missing&#x2014;but a pair of scissors had been put in. Darwin, who had my sheets and silver spoons in keeping, was out of town, which caused a serious destitution at first. But we have got all back now except the sugar tongs and my work box, and are restored to tolerable order. Helen goes on well hitherto, and I only pray that she may not bethink her some fine day that her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">resolution deserves a dram</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell was later dismissed for drinking.</note> Miss Fergus had become &#x201C;La contessa Pepoli&#x201D; two days before our arrival, and is now domesticated with her angelic Conte within a quarter of an hour&#x2019;s walk of me. They both look well content; if the romance of the thing could but hold out! She will be an acquisition to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and I hope her bold step (not to say rash) may be justified by a better future than onlookers predict for her. Old Sterling, who had been to see her, said to me to-day &#x201C;Heavenly Father! what a wreck she is! She is fifty by Jove!&#x201D; But love has no arithmetic. Cavaignac says <foreign>&#x201C;Voil&#xE0; un homme condamn&#xE9; &#xE0; rendre sa femme heureuse! J&#x2019;esp&#xE8;re qu&#x2019;il se donnera cette justification!&#x201D;</foreign><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;There is a man condemned to make his wife happy! I hope he will allow himself that justification.&#x201D;</note> I hope so too. Mr. Darwin says <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Ah!&#x201D;</hi>&#x2014;and perhaps that is the best that can be said of the matter. London is very dead at this season&#x2014;but one gets the more good of the people that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> in it. It is also contrary to custom very rainy. What are you all doing in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> City? How is my uncle? Is the worsted work all done? Surely you will write and instruct me of your doings and sufferings. &#x2026; Carlyle joins me in kind love to you all. Is my uncle going to Templand? My mother never ceases to expect him.</p>

<p>The book of Swedenborg which you have translated anew, I read carefully in the old version received from you long ago. The impression <pb id="pg-11-190" n="11:190"/>it left was, and is, very strange. In his feeling about the <hi rend="italic">moral essence</hi> of things, properly the core of his own being, I almost altogether and even emphatically agreed with him. It was clear, too, that he was a man of robust, nay, you would have said, cold, hard, practical-looking understanding: how such a man should have shaped for himself, into quiet historical concretions, standing there palpable, visible, solid and composed as the mountain rocks or more so, spiritual objects which eye hath not seen nor ear heard; this is what I cannot at all put together. I have looked into all the lives of Swedenborg that my Biographical Dictionaries would yield me; but with little help there.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilkinson replied, <date when="1839-10-19">19 Oct.</date>, sending TC &#x201C;on loan, what biographical notices of Swedenborg I could procure. I also gave him a few particulars about the Philosophical Works and the &#x2018;Diary of Memorabilia,&#x2019; which is in manuscript, and I told him my motives for having troubled him so much with the Books, namely, that I wished him to have before him materials for forming and expressing to the world an opinion on the subject&#x201D; (in a letter to Emma Marsh, <date when="1839-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi> 205). TC comments in his Journal, <date when="1839-10-23">23 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Swedenborg&#x2019;s writings; strange correspondence from Swedenborgians here, especially from one Wilkinson,&#x2014;a curious shy, proud deephearted simple kind of man seemingly. Wishes me to write on Swedenborg. Begin actually to form some outline of a notion of Swedenborg. Eighteenth century: mechanicals <hi rend="italic">and</hi> spirituals; the spirit of a man struggling out from beneath loads of metallurgy, practics, cause-and-effect &#x26;c. Swedenborg, Voltaire.&#x201D; Wilkinson was to write <hi rend="italic">A Sketch of Swedenborg and the Swedenborgians</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi>, repr. as a booklet (London, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>), and he reported later that &#x201C;when my sketch of him (Swedenborg) came out he (Carlyle) read it, and gratified my wife by telling her that it was a &#x2018;star-bespangled book&#x2019;&#x201D; (F. H. Evans, <hi rend="italic">James John Garth Wilkinson</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1936-00-00">1936</date>] 92). Presumably he is referring to the booklet rather than his <hi rend="italic">Emanuel Swedenborg: a Biography</hi> (London, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note> I ought to admit that this is one of the most wondrous men; whom <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot altogether undertake to interpret for myself!

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Your good Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1839-08-15">15 Aug.</date></note> after some detours, found me at my Mother&#x2019;s in Annandale; most languid, vacant, not to say altogether torpid and closed up in melancholy remembrances, sad aspects, sad prospects, and continual deluges of wet weather. Solitude is indispensable to my existence now and then; it is very miserable, yet a kind of blessed misery, with a wholesomeness in it, the beginning of a time more wholesome than the past was. Your Welsh excursion, and child&#x2019;s-idyl with your Brother, came like a sunny place into that dim Hades of mine. You take those matters more wisely than I.</p>
<p>The reason of my not writing answer was mainly a grand scheme I had of soon speaking an answer. It was among our projects that my Wife, who in her sail from Liverpool to Annan nearly gave up the ghost and altogether declared she would never go to sea again, should proceed homeward by Carlisle and the Preston Railway herself: leaving me to come at a week&#x2019;s distance, round by Dublin, Bristol, Clifton, and so see Sterling, and find the dilapidated Chelsea establishment somewhat set up again first. But the poor dame gave in, when it came to the point; would like <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much better if &#x26;c: whereupon we got together into the huge Steam Mystery, and it snorted off with us (under cloud of night) like an enormous diabolic fire-dragon as it is, and in the most unintelligible yet unerring way, set us down at Chelsea next morning, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any sight of Sterling. I have waited since then a fortnight or more now, till the Suspicious <hi rend="italic">Sterling Article</hi> should appear, that I might see whether I was to excommunicate the man, or what I was to do with him. Mill, the day before yesterday, gave me unexpectedly a copy, which I have read, which I have even sent off into Scotland; and now I write&#x2014;the excommunication that is needed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 33 (<date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>): 1&#x2013;68. TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1839-10-09">9 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Magnanimous wonderful eulogistic &#x2018;Article&#x2019; on me by Sterling in L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26; W. Review; agitated me somewhat in my weak nervous state, for two days,&#x2014;confess it; all now got into the old rut again!&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Mill says this is the best thing you ever wrote;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill added an editorial disclaimer at the end of Sterling&#x2019;s article: &#x201C;this attempt by one of our most valued contributors &#x2026; at a calm and comprehensive estimate of a man &#x2026; whose genius and worth have shed some rays of their brightness on our own pages &#x2026; <supplied>[the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>&#x2019;s]</supplied> conductors are in no respect identified with the opinions delivered in the present criticism, either when the writer concurs with, or when he differs from those of Mr Carlyle&#x201D; (33:68).</note> and truly so should <pb id="pg-11-192" n="11:192"/>I, if you had not shut my mouth. It is a thing all glowing and boiling, like a furnace of molten metal. A brave thing, nay a rash and headlong; full of generosity, passionate insight, lightning, extravagance and Sterlingism: such an &#x201C;article&#x201D; as we have not read for some time past! It will be talked of, it will be admired, condemned, and create astonishment and give offence far and near. My friend, what a notion you have got of <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> I discern certain natural features, the general outline of shape, but it is as one would in the Air-giant of the Harz, huge as Ophiuchus;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ophiuchus, &#x201C;the serpent-bearer,&#x201D; a constellation; see <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:708&#x2013;10, and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 190. The &#x201C;Air-Giant&#x201D; is the Brocken-Spectre, a huge human image projected onto a cloud seen by climbers of Brocken, the highest peak of the Harz mountains, Germany.</note> painted there, as one finds, by sunrise and early vapour, that is, by Sterling&#x2019;s heart impinging on you between himself and the Westminster Review! I do not thank you; for I know not whether such things are good, nay whether they are not bad and a poison to one: but I will say there has no man in these Islands been so reviewed in my time; it is the most magnanimous eulogy I ever knew one man utter of another man whom he knew face to face, and saw go grumbling about there, in coat and breeches, as a poor concrete reality&#x2014;very offensive now and then. And so we will let it lie there, incredible to all men, incrediblest of all to me; yet sweet in the highest degree, for very obvious reasons, notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I admire the ingenuity which which this Reviewer contrives withal to introduce the quarrels he has against me. Not a crow we have ever had to pluck together but he plucks it here, and scatters the limbs of it triumphantly to the winds. I swear honestly I like him all the better. &#x201C;Consciousness,&#x201D; &#x201C;Silence&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c I tell you, my dear fellow, you are right; and yet I myself am perfectly right too, and know not well yet how I could find terms to express myself in, less liable to contradiction. It is the fault, as Shandy said, of &#x201C;the auxiliary verbs.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tristram&#x2019;s father, <hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi> 5:ch. 42.</note> Goethe&#x2019;s saying comes often in my mind: &#x201C;We begin to err, the first <hi rend="italic">word</hi> we utter.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign>&#x201C;Sobald man spricht, beginnt man schon zu irren,&#x201D;</foreign> Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Werke, Gedichte, Epigrammatisch Spruch Widerspruch</hi>.</note> For Nature is solid, with six sides; Language is superficial, nay linear. I believe you have me, however, in regard to Mother Cagliostro and the gold ounces; I had read that passage wrong, and yet as I remember, not without some misgiving as to the truth.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC refers to a passage in &#x201C;Count Cagliostro,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>) 4:69&#x2013;74, trans. from Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Itali&#xE4;nische Reise</hi>, in which he described meeting Cagliostro&#x2019;s family in Palermo. His sister had told Goethe that her brother had cheated her out of &#x201C;fourteen gold Ounces.&#x201D; TC commented that &#x201C;we can believe at least, that the fourteen gold Ounces were paid, by a sure hand.&#x201D; Sterling quoted this and pointed out Goethe&#x2019;s following paragraphs which he said made it clear that Goethe had not later reimbursed the sister. He saw TC&#x2019;s misunderstanding as an example of Goethe&#x2019;s words &#x201C;that man in the present, and still more in his recollection, shapes and models the outward world according to his own peculiarities&#x201D; (&#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works&#x201D; 27&#x2013;28). In the next edn. (<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, 4:425) TC changed his comment to &#x201C;shall we not hope at least, that the fourteen gold Ounces were paid. &#x2026; Alas, no, it would seem; owing to accidents, not even that!&#x201D; However, according to A. Carlyle (<hi rend="italic">CMSB</hi> 225), TC crossed out that last sentence in JWC&#x2019;s copy of the 3d edn.

Wrong indeed! Where are you <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, if one come to that?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>, TC says that Sterling continued to disagree with him on certain points and &#x201C;especially&#x201D; on &#x201C;that doctrine of the &#x2018;greatness and fruitfulness of Silence&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:192). TC had written in <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> in relation to the <date when="1830-09-00">Sept.</date> Massacres that &#x201C;articulate speech, not shrieking is the faculty of man: when speech is not yet possible, let there be &#x2026; at least silence. Silence &#x2026; is the thing we recommend and practise&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 4:47). Sterling was particularly critical of TC&#x2019;s relating this doctrine to the Massacres. He quoted the passage immediately following, from &#x201C;instead of shrieking more&#x201D; to &#x201C;let us cease shrieking, and begin considering&#x201D; and described it as &#x201C;ill-timed and poorly imagined sophistry and scorn&#x201D; (&#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works&#x201D; 60&#x2013;63).</note> God help you, my man, with such a huge Brocken-Spectre &#x201C;Chimera&#x201D; and lot of &#x201C;cub chimeras&#x201D; sucking at her!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling has writen of &#x201C;a subordinate mistake, a cub-chimera accompanying the dam thereof&#x201D; (40). Chimera, a fabulous monster, and so a wild fancy; such a favorite word of TC&#x2019;s that it had become something of a joke between himself and Sterling.</note> I would not be in your shoes for something.</p>
<p>Mill, whom I had not seen till that day at the India House, was looking but indifferently; he professed not to be sensibly better at all by his last-year&#x2019;s journeying. Mrs Taylor, he farther volunteered to tell me, is living not at the old abode in the Regent&#x2019;s Park, but in Wilton Place, a street where as I conjecture there are mainly wont to be <hi rend="italic">Lodgings</hi>. Can it be possible? Or if so, what does it betoken?<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently John Taylor was having repairs made to their home at 17 Kent Pl., and was also staying at Wilton Pl. (M. St. John Packe, <hi rend="italic">Life of John Stuart Mill</hi> [London, <date when="1954-00-00">1954</date>] 240&#x2013;41).</note> I am truly sorry for Mill: he has been a most luckless man since I came hither, seeming to himself all the way to be a lucky one rather. He seems to fear that the Review will have to cease; a thing I regret but do not wonder at. Did ever man choose such a flathoofed jackass, under the name of lapdog and dog-of-knowledge, as Robertson to help him forward in such an enterprise? He has no skill in &#x201C;concrete realities,&#x201D; or less than I ever saw in a man so skilful about abstractions.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390526-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-05-26">26 May</date></ref>. Mill pbd. one more issue in <date when="1840-03-00">March 1840</date>. TC continued to believe that the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> was to close. Harriet Martineau wrote to Frances Wedgwood (<date when="1840-01-17">17 Jan. 1840</date>) that &#x201C;Robertson complains bitterly that Carlyle will go on declaring (against warning) that the London and West<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is to cease,&#x2014;whereas no such thing is yet settled. It so happens that Carlyle told me so, as a matter of fact, but I have not let R. know this. If it is as R. says, it is too bad of Carlyle; and indeed, amidst all the beauty and glory that is in him, I fear we cannot but see a great increase of self-will and conceit of late. Yet I struggle against this&#x201D; (Wedgwood Papers, Univ. of Keele; pbd: E. S. Arbuckle, ed., <hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s Letters</hi> &#x2026; 27).</note> Nature <pb id="pg-11-194" n="11:194"/>and Fact, as you remark, first tell a man the truth about his philosophy. Sow real wheat on the honest earth, you reap real wheat; sow chaff never so <hi rend="italic">like</hi> wheat, the earth receives it, but says nothing about it next year.</p>
<p>As for me I have been busy daily, revising <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> which they are reprinting (<hi rend="italic">Apprenticeship</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi> together) as rapidly as they can. I dissent greatly from much that I find; yet everywhere there is truth, real truth even in what you hate, and it is good for you to see it; there is real talent, to me the infallible symptoms of all other sorts of reality, sorts of worth, for no real thing is not worthy&#x2014;you know! Fraser has got to hand the American Miscellanies, and sold 100 of them; regrets immensely that he has got so few still to sell. I sent your Mother a copy, not you one; I intend for you a better <hi rend="italic">English</hi> copy, such as seems possible and probable by and by. What I am to do for the winter is all uncertain. This <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> business will keep me busy for three weeks yet. I am far from ready to write on anything. My Brother, in Scotland at present, is coming soon; <foreign><hi rend="italic">unbestimmt</hi></foreign> [uncertain] he too. We see your people as often and gladly as ever; that is to say, therefore <hi rend="italic">more</hi> gladly, so precious is <hi rend="italic">continuance</hi>, in a world like ours. Your father had bad news from you yesterday: nothing serious we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> hope. Take care of yourself, do not wear yourself to pieces. You are too vehement; mind that always. My wife is charmed, as the female character may well be, with your review. She salutes you a hundred times; you, and your better half and household, good be always with you all!</p>

<ps><p>I have heard twice from Emerson, mainly about books and shipments, the good Emerson. He is getting forward with something of his own to be published soon. In one of his Letters he says: &#x201C;I have only time to say that I love Sterling&#x2019;s poetry, that I admire his prose with reservations here and there. What he knows he writes manfully and well.

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>If that place were freely offered to me, with the duty, we will say, of teaching some reasonable useful thing which a man in the year <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date> could name Moral Philosophy, with expressed or implied liberty to do it as he conscienciously, having regard to all the circumstances of the thing, best could; in that case, I should require four-and-twenty hours, I think, to deliberate earnestly with myself whether I ought to accept it or not. Perhaps I might accept it; perhaps too I might repent accepting it: it would not be very easy for me to decide. But the contingency of the whole matter, the necessity of making application, solicitation &#x26;c &#x26;c form an altogether conclusive weight in the negative scale; and I decide at once that I will not become a <hi rend="italic">candidate</hi> in that sense.</p>
<p>Pray answer Professor Nichol that this as near as I can describe it is my position towards the thing; and give him many thanks for me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Pringle Nichol (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), astronomer; rector of Montrose Academy, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>; prof. of astronomy, Glasgow Univ., <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360126-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:287</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-01-26">26 Jan. 1836</date></corr></ref>). He had written to Mill &#x201C;about finding some fit person to fill it,&#x201D; not just about TC. Mill also asked Sterling (&#x201C;Alas that you are not in a condition to take it yourself&#x201D;) whether he knew of anyone suitable and gave the extra information that it only took six months of the year (Mineka 13:409). Harriet Martineau wrote to Frances Wedgwood on <date when="1839-10-27">27 Oct.</date> that the idea of TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;being Moral Philosophy Professor&#x201D; was &#x201C;a funny idea &#x2026; &#x2014;a business which requires logic so especially.

<p>Sterling&#x2019;s is a splendid Article; in spite of its enormous extravagance some will like it; many are sure to talk of it and on the whole to be instructed by it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your pleasant and welcome Letter came, along with one of Stewart&#x2019;s, not many nights ago. Stewart reported progress about Puttoch; he had had an &#x201C;Inquirer,&#x201D; he did not know whom; thought the thing might sell for about &#xa3;6,500 or so;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stewart of Gillenbie was acting as agent. He had written, <date when="1839-09-24">24 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Craigenputtoch really looks respectable&#x2014;I think it will sell&#x2014;I do not change from my first random estimate much&#x2014;this was &#xa3;6500&#x2014;&#x26; really we must try for it&#x2014;but you must consider if the guineas&#x2014;if &#xa3;6300 were offered what ought to be done&#x2014; Whether it should be taken or a public sale risked.&#x201D; An advertisement for Craigenputtoch (dated <date when="1839-09-10">10 Sept.</date>) without particulars appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1839-09-25">25 Sept.</date>, saying that &#x201C;whenever an adequate offer is made, a Sale will readily be concluded.&#x201D; It was also advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>. No sale was effected.</note> requested instructions from me; above all things, requested to have the title deeds forwarded to Adamson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380214-TC-JA-01">TC to JA, <date when="1838-02-14">14 Feb. 1838</date></ref>.</note> of Dumfries. I answered by return of post, that it was all right, that we would wait till <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had to his own satisfaction ascertained the impossibility or due unlikelihood of getting &#xa3;6,500 (as there was no haste, as his estimate was deliberate), and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> we would cheerfully take 6000 guineas, which he seemed to have some notion might be a fair price too if we could get it at once. On the whole I endeavoured, as before, to lay it altogether under <hi rend="italic">his</hi> management; conceiving that it was safer so than in any other way I could appoint for it. I also wrote by the same post to Robert Welsh;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Welsh, JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle, Edinburgh solicitor, had written a long letter to TC (see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390520-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1839-05-20">20 May</date></ref>) outlining the problems of Craigenputtoch, and this seems to have set the Carlyles thinking about a sale.</note> having mentioned to Stewart that I would; the title-deeds, or something to the same effect if they be not written out yet, will as I hope get into Adamson&#x2019;s hands straightway, or perhaps are already there. Finally I sent a copy of the F. Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to Stewart, by Edinburgh and Lockerby.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1839-12-13">13 Dec.</date>, Stewart said: &#x201C;My wife &#x2026; thanks you heartily for your book, which she takes care to keep continually in sight that she may introduce your name as &#x2018;our friend.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> I sent another to Grahame of Burnswark,&#x2014;poor Grahame: it was to be forwarded by Coach to Ecclefechan, where I hope in these days it has arrived. Stewart said, rather in the lamenting way, you had never looked near him more. Ben and you might take a bright day, and drive thither. He is a good little fellow, Stewart, I think; and decidedly clever in his way. Your sketches of Puttoch, of Glen &#x26;c were very interesting. What a change <hi rend="italic">there too</hi>; nothing but changes; one&#x2019;s life is change! Glen I doubt will never get <pb id="pg-11-197" n="11:197"/>better; however, all things ought to be tried with him. Your notions about him seem to agree with his Brother&#x2019;s on that side.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written, <date when="1839-09-25">25 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;While at Dumfries with my mother I went up to Carstammon &#x26; Craigenputtoch. Jas. Stewart had been there about a week before &#x2026; with a Mr. Watkins of Torthorwald.&#x201D; Stewart had had the woods measured. John had seen William Glen at Carstammon, who &#x201C;talked quite sensibly &#x2026; for the first half hour &#x2026; but during our walk he raved in the wildest fashion about spirits that had power over him for a time. &#x2026; He has translated the whole of the Greek anthology, wishes for more work in this way. &#x2026; At Carstammon all that is wild and insane about him finds no check. &#x2026; If I were his brother I should run the risk of trying what the purpose of society &#x26; such employment as he is capable of might <supplied>[do]</supplied> for him&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390607-TC-AG-01">TC to AG, <date when="1839-06-07">7 June</date></ref>.</note> What a cub is Menzies!

She is a methodic person, and does not like entanglements. Alick does not like such either; but he has &#x201C;an offputting way&#x201D;! I think it would answer well if they made an arrangement, that is if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> made a determination, to settle regularly at some appointed day twice a year: to start next Whitsunday, as Martinmas for this year is so close at hand? <hi rend="italic">You</hi> should also settle with Alick, I think, and put the matter down in some clear shape in black-on-white. Or have you already done that?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had taken &#x201C;a whole day at Ecclefechan&#x201D; to settle his mother&#x2019;s &#x201C;account with Alick&#x201D; (for his use of her houses at Ecclefechan), put in order Alick&#x2019;s account for house repairs, and his for the horse and gig, etc.</note> Keeping a tangled account is like wearing a tattered coat; unpleasant for the moment, and has an ill effect for the future: better <hi rend="italic">mend</hi> your coat, and go about with a reputable feeling. I rejoice to hear that the shop prospers. It is one of my most earnest prayers that poor Alick&#x2019;s heart too could get into a state of clearness, of manful patience, quiet endeavour; <hi rend="italic">this</hi> I should reckon prosperity, be the money result what it might. Ah me, poor fellow, he has had a tough fight, many, many a vexation; and feels as if he had not conquered, as if he were himself conquered after all! But it is not so; no, I will never cease hoping that so brave a man will take the attitude of a brave man; that when affliction press upon him he will learn to shut his lips, and think what is wrong in <hi rend="italic">himself,</hi> what is curable in himself;&#x2014;in a word, that he will renounce <hi rend="italic">that</hi> &#x201C;refuge of lies&#x201D; altogether, and fly far from it as from the clearest revelation of the Infernal Pit manifested to men in these days of ours!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-198" n="11:198"/>My own history since I wrote to you has not been momentous.

Mill, whom I called for when in the City seeking my Dumfries money, did not look any better, felt little or no better (he said), but was able to go on without much impediment. His review, he hinted, was to cease probably, before long: not paying, no prospect &#x26;c. The Bullers have left their fine town-house; taken some residence about Leatherhead: a bad symptom for Radicalism, as Mrs Buller reads it! Anthony Sterling sailed by the last Steamer from Liverpool: the old Stimabile comes whirling down here, takes Jane often, Jane and me sometimes, out to dine; one day to Greenwich and the Park there: pretty enough. Jane bids me salute you all with her best affection, and say that she is wonderfully stout ever since her return, and wishes every one of you had made <hi rend="italic">as much</hi> improvement.

The weather has been decidedly drier for above a week now; I trust Annandale and Scotsbrig share in it.

I had four miles to walk af<supplied>[ter]</supplied> the railway at Watford; part of it thro&#x2019; an oak wood with hazel bushes where the people were busy nutting. It, and the ride home generally were very interesting to me. My horse is in good order; I was obliged to go and get her, partly out of <foreign><hi rend="italic">mense</hi></foreign> [propriety], partly that I really did want riding again.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jack has got a frank, and is writing you, I suppose, or has written you, a long letter: he is now gone out; but leaves me this bit of paper to say a word for myself upon: the frank shall not go without my doing it. As you would get a copious despatch from me addressed to the Doctor, just the morning after he had left you, there cannot be any news today; for of course you would open that sheet, and read it,&#x2014;and I fear think it very dear at the money; however, a word is a word even tho&#x2019; it contain nothing.</p>
<p>Jack knocked at our door in a raw morning rather before six o&#x2019; clock; I alone was up, half-dressed or less, sitting smoking my pipe, a little <hi rend="italic">too</hi> early for any other beneficial purpose! I opened the shutters; recognised my brave Doctor with great pleasure. Helen was soon on foot, got us breakfast by the kitchen fire; and all was right. The Doctor seemed not to have suffered by his journey at all; he went to bed and slept, slept again next night, and on the morrow was as fresh as if there had been no travelling.</p>
<p>He brought us news of all of you; sad news of the harvest weather. We have now got dry east and north winds; I do hope they extend to Scotland and poor Jamie, whose post is not an enviable one at present. Austin too must lose considerably we fear by his crop of this year; but it cannot be helped; there was no other way of getting into a farm. What is to become of the poor people this winter, those who are scarce of work with provisions so scarce, one cannot well see.</p>
<p>You, dear Mother, suffered much from toothache and cold, Jack tells me; but he asserts you were in your average state when he left Scotsbrig. One message he delivered that affected me greatly; not to <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping], but almost on the way towards that: &#x201C;I was not to be deterred from coming back to Scotsbrig by the confused treatment I had found.&#x201D; Ah me! There is little danger of that! I have nothing to say about treatment, except that I know not how to thank you, one and all, for your unwearied kindness to me. God is good, who still leaves Scotsbrig and my Mother&#x2019;s hearth accessible to me from time to time. While we are all spared on the face of this earth, we shall never be quite separated. We will toil along, each in his place, and always cry good-speed to one another now and then.&#x2014; I was also very glad to <pb id="pg-11-202" n="11:202"/>learn that you and Alick <hi rend="italic">had</hi> come upon a definite agreement about the houses: it will be far better for all parties, and you in the first place.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, Preface and all, is now fairly tied up, and off to the Printer; so that I have nothing more to do with that now, except correct a few sheets. I am studying determinately whether I shall actually write that Article I spoke of, and how and for whom I am to write it. Work is indispensable for me: work I shall and will have. Meanwhile I go daily out to ride; sometimes into the Park, sometimes over the River into the country, or somewhere else into the country, which is all very beautiful and pleasant for riding here. Sometimes I fall in with some friend, also riding; and then it is quite cheerful to go trotting together, thro&#x2019; green lanes, from one open common with its whin-bushes and high trees to another. My horse is in the best order; it does seem to do me good: I will try it out for a while, and see what comes of it, dear tho&#x2019; it be.&#x2014; Jane longs greatly for her <hi rend="italic">side-saddle</hi>, often lamenting that I did not bring it in spite of all. I tell her it will soon be here with the butter and oatmeal, all of which are wanted. She is very well ever since our return; and has a better outlook towards winter than she has had for some years back.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1839-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, TC wrote in his Journal: &#x201C;Lectured in the <date when="1839-06-00">beginning of June</date>; very indifferently, so sick and miserable was I; took a <hi rend="italic">gallop</hi> out to Harrow (like a Faust&#x2019;s flight thro&#x2019; an ocean of green) the day before my last lecture; shook the dust out of me somewhat, and did that lecture almost well. Went to Scotland about the first of july. Rain and obstruction; idleness, solitude, obstruction and rain. My mother very affecting to me. Jack there at last (<hi rend="italic">here</hi> now some days): all of them kind to me as brothers &#x26; sisters could ever be. American Miscellanies come; and selling well enough, it seems. French Revol<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> edition out; 1500 and 500 for America. Good Mr Marshall (of Halsteads &#x26;c in Cumberland) had given me a horse in the end of june; I could not but accept it. His son Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> (M.P. for Carlisle) has had it keeping for me ever since; I went for it on Wednesday last; to Edge Grove, near Aldenham, near Watford; have it here; have ridden it every day since, with no great benefit as yet. Will persist for a while. My Wife happily in much better health. Me too the sluggish-looking ignoble solitude has perhaps benefited. No longer such a <hi rend="italic">horror</hi> at work, at writing of any kind. I yesterday completely finished the revisal of <hi rend="italic">W. Meister</hi>, sent it off tag and rag by the &#x2018;devil&#x2019; this morning. Wait now <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I shall do. The Article on the <hi rend="italic">Poor</hi>? Or the commencement of some <hi rend="italic">Book!</hi> It is very difficult to decide; painful till I have decided. &#x2026; The desirablest of all blessings would be <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> for me.&#x2014; O that I were at work! What shall I work at, and how?&#x2014;&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Did you get the Books yet from Dumfries? Perhaps they may just be coming for you tomorrow, which is Wednesday. You will get some reading in them; you will read John Sterling&#x2019;s Article with interest. I have now been, I think, <hi rend="italic">sufficiently</hi> praised: I remain the same unfortunate <hi rend="italic">in</hi>sufficient &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">cameral</hi></foreign> [sprawling, awkward person]&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360727-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:24</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1836-07-27">27 July 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> I was before, nothing, alas, changed in <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good be with you, my dear <pb id="pg-11-203" n="11:203"/>Mother.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Every fortnight, I suppose by your means, there comes to me an <hi rend="italic">Anti-Corn Law Circular;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390913-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref></note> written in a valiant, resolute, if perhaps rather noisy and tumultuous way. I endeavour to forward my copy to some one likely to profit by it. I wish the cause, as you know, all speed.</p>
<p>On the accompanying piece of paper<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s draft report on the hardship of agricultural laborers in Annandale, which he had presumably written at the same time as working on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>. &#x201C;Finest peasantry in the World,&#x201D; a phrase used here, is the title of ch. 4, <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>, which also speaks of &#x201C;Scotch farm-labourers who, &#x2018;in districts the half of whose husbandry is that of cows, taste no milk, can procure no milk&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:141). The MS is on two sides of a single sheet, 13&#x201D; by 8&#x201D;, folded, and headed, in another hand, &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Picture of Husbandry in Annandale,&#x201D; followed by a note, probably by A. Carlyle, saying that it was &#x201C;A Memorandum sent to Mr. Henry Cole about the time of the Repeal of the Corn Laws&#x2014;(<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>).&#x201D; Cole had refused to become sec. of the Anti-Corn Law League in <date when="1839-02-00">Feb.</date>, but he helped with the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Corn Law Circular</hi>, which had been inspired by his <hi rend="italic">Post Circular</hi>. &#x201C;In the lower district of Annandale, Dumfriesshire, the husbandry, which is understood to be in an advanced scientific state, depends in about equal proportions on crops and on cattle. It is what they call a breeding district and a growing district. The farm-labour in the large farms, which have become numerous within the last twenty years, is commonly performed by men named <hi rend="italic">hinds</hi>, oftenest married men, whose wages consist partly of money, partly of allowances in kind. The misery of these men in their squalid cottages, where hope never comes, where hunger itself too often dwells, would not be credited readily on description. One fact, capable of being stated and authenticated, will be significant of innumerable others.<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Till within the last ten or twelve years these hinds used to have each of them a cow, as part of their allowances. Some twelve years ago it was resolved among the large farmers that their cows should be taken from them: a certain degree of trouble, of annoyance arising from the interference of the hind&#x2019;s wife in the farmer&#x2019;s cowhouse, was hereby got rid of. These men have now no cow. How did they submit to this? The district lies opposite Ireland; by steam-boats the finest peasantry in the world, ready to live on potatoes, without clothes, and to roost or pig in any sod-cabin, are imported, sometimes at the rate of four-pence a head: the Scotch hinds have one of two resources; to go to Canada, or take what terms soever are offered them. The unmarried sort, of any enterprise, prefer Canada, endeavour to save ten pounds, and leave their native soil to the finest peasantry; the married sort, without money, without means, have nothing for it but remaining, cow or no cow. They have no cow; and what is more, tho&#x2019; indeed but an extension of the same thing, they have in many cases no possibility of procuring milk. Their masters find it suitabler to fatten pigs with the milk, than sell it at the rates going there to their farm-labourers: the labourers&#x2019; wives would have access to the farmer&#x2019;s kitchen in that case, the farmer&#x2019;s dairy-maid might peculate in the milk-halfpence &#x26;c &#x26;c.; it is briefer, clearer, on the whole suitabler to give it to the pigs, and make bacon of it. If a farmer will not sell milk to his own labourers; much less to those of others. Except by accident of some more liberal farmer, at whose option it stands, the farm-labourers have no milk. They eat their oatmeal porridge with treacle-and-water, their potatoes with salt followed by water;&#x2014;they do. God knows how. They cannot, by money or love, or any industry of theirs, except robbery and theft which they do not yet practice, procure for themselves, for their wives or young ones any milk. Half the industry of that country is the production of cattle and milk; these men, sons of the soil, labourers exclusively in such industry, have to go without milk as in a country which produced none. Such a fact may seem incredible; but it is unhappily indubitable. It is significant of many things;&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">very</hi> many things: one would say [last sentence crossed through].<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;Not to shoot into the vague, we specify the Duke of Buccleuch &#x26; Queensberry&#x2019;s estates in that quarter of Scotland; the estates of the Radical M.P. for that quarter. Large farms tilled by hinds who neither can nor do procure for themselves any milk, are easy to be met with on both those estates. It is a fact possible everywhere, practiseable everywhere. The Radical M.P. is not reckoned a bad landlord; the Duke of Buccleuch is by universal consent admitted to be the best in the south of Scotland&#x201D; (MS: Huntington Library).</note> there is a fact jotted down, <pb id="pg-11-204" n="11:204"/>which my conscience for many years has been urging me to publish abroad, since no one else would. It is true every fibre of it, and less than the truth; a thing known to me by eyesight, and knowable to every one.</p>
<p>If keeping back my name and all allusion to me in the most rigorous manner, your Corn Law people like to publish this note, they are welcome. But my name is not to be alluded to at all; that is a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi></foreign>.&#x2014; If the thing on these terms be unsuitable, pray keep it, or keep a copy of it, till you see me.</p>
<p>I rejoice greatly to hear that you are in the New Post office business, with Mr Hill.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cole&#x2019;s principal work under Rowland Hill was superintending the production of the three forms of prepayment, the adhesive stamp, envelopes with an engraved postage design, and an embossed stamp on paper. For details, see Henry Cole, <hi rend="italic">Fifty Years of Public Work</hi> (London, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>) 1:58&#x2013;68.</note> That is right. Universal <hi rend="italic">Prepayment</hi> I hope will be insisted on. Look at the Railways; their waiters, servants of every kind are the most perfect in England, and it is not &#x201C;collecting of money&#x201D; that makes them so. It is, being well paid;&#x2014;first of all, being <hi rend="small-caps">Well Chosen</hi> and <hi rend="small-caps">Well Superintended</hi>. The old plan of having a wooden log or hand-mill in the centre of an establishment, must, in the case of this New Post office (as of much else before long) be altogether done away with, and a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> put in the centre.</p>
<p>Come and see me when you pass this way.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It never was a habit of mine, and has for a long time been becoming less and less so, to set down what insight I might arrive at in the shape of aphorisms or logical points of faith. I should like very ill to have a <hi rend="italic">Credo</hi> to write. I should say it is already written there, as well as I could do it, in those various volumes of mine! It seems to me but a barren thing that of hammering one&#x2019;s Thirty-nine Articles into never such decisiveness of form: better to be a good Christian, and leave your Thirty-nine Articles very much to shift for themselves,&#x2014;especially in times like ours. At all events, that is not a service one can least do for himself; kind friends may do it, for their own behoof, if they see good.</p>
<p>In reading my friend Sterling&#x2019;s thirteen aphorisms, accordingly, I felt that they were his not mine, that several of them were quite new to me, most of them more or less questionable on some side; that if another man were drawing out aphorisms for me, he might do it very differently, and be as near the mark for his share too.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works&#x201D; Sterling had written out thirteen aphorisms as &#x201C;a hint and foretaste of what is written in his [TC&#x2019;s] works&#x201D; though he disclaimed that they were either &#x201C;absolutely&#x201D; or &#x201C;completely true&#x201D; as &#x201C;adequate statements of Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s views&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> 33 [<date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>]: 4&#x2013;5).</note></p>
<p>This is all I can say of Sterling&#x2019;s Aphorisms, or of his magnificent, magnanimous, enormously exaggerated &#x201C;Article&#x201D; generally; of which indeed, having read it only once (and in the jolting of an omnibus mainly, lumbering along from Cheapside hither!), I retain but an indistinct remembrance.</p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>On sunday I learned from you that another Number of the Review was to be published: but it strikes me that perhaps you wish to print <pb id="pg-11-206" n="11:206"/>only gratuitous Articles on that occasion; that an Article of mine will be of little or no more use to you than any other which would cover the paper reasonably.</p>
<p>I have, for a good many weeks at intervals, been writing down in a very loose manner, a variety of things about the Poor, about Radicalism, the Priesthood, the Aristocracy: it is an attempt to utter in suitable language, and apply to the present aspect of things, the fundamental notions which you know me to entertain; an attempt which prospers very ill with me, hating as I do to appear in the character of objurgator, to wrangle or seem to wrangle with any one,&#x2014;and not, were it even by retiring into vacuum, to have it all my own way!</p>
<p>A great many sheets lie covered; mostly with things worthless; here and there, with a thing that might be preserved and printed. I find, in these days, that I must bring it under some rubric, and finish it; or else tie a string about it, and shove it indefinitely into the background, perhaps, without any string, into the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>. Lockhart, long ago, was desirous I should put it into some reasonable shape of a pleading and protestation to the upper clases on behalf of the under. That is not perhaps impossible, tho&#x2019; surely it is not very feasible. On the other hand, Benthamee Radicalism at this time seems to me like a wind-bladder <hi rend="italic">rent</hi>, lying flaccid now probably enough forever. What am I to do? One is hard bested, squeezing oneself into any of the marketable shapes!</p>
<p>Pray tell me what is the interest of your Review (if it have any interest), and your own <hi rend="italic">wish</hi>, in regard to such a thing. Probably your answer will illuminate me more or less.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1839-10-23">23 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Am waiting now to see what is to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with the &#x2018;Article&#x2019; I have been, not so much writing as floundering round, and trying to write. Never <hi rend="italic">had</hi> a more headless business in hand. For the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review?</hi> Have written to Mill for light. M&#x2019;s Review about ending. The matter of that same &#x2018;Article&#x2019; has never yet been steadily and clearly in my <hi rend="italic">eye</hi>. I write it, comparatively speaking, half asleep. We shall see, soon.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I wish you would get stronger; tho&#x2019; I know dyspepsia, sick nerves, and perpetual uneasiness or pain to be nowise dangerous to <hi rend="italic">life</hi>, I do not like to see you so thin. Probably this coil of annoying labour you are now to throw off your shoulders will prove a great and wholesome alleviation. I still continue to have faith in horse-exercise, especially were summer once here.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Along with this Note of Jack&#x2019;s I will send you a small line, were it only to say in words what the &#x201C;two strokes&#x201D; say weekly in the symbolic manner, that all is well.</p>
<p>Jack, I suppose, has given account of his own proceedings;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter, <date when="1839-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, John said: &#x201C;My winter plans are not yet fully made up, but I think it very unlikely that any opportunity of going to Italy will occur. I am in truth not very anxious for one, as I am heartly tired of wandering.&#x201D;</note> he has left his Note sealed; I did not read it. He has plunged about here, in the old style, ever since he came; flying hither and thither, not very unhappy as yet, but unable to settle to anything. I am rather sorry for him, rather angry sometimes; but I do not advise him much, for it does more ill for most part; besides I always calculate that he will finally fall upon some feasible scheme, and stick by it. This Mr Cunningham,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spelled &#x201C;Conyngham&#x201D; in John&#x2019;s letter. William Coningham (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), at Trinity, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>; cornet with 1st Dragoons, resigned <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>; M.P. for Brighton, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>. He later pbd. <hi rend="italic">Twelve Letters, by John Sterling</hi> (London, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Lord Palmerston and Prince Albert</hi> (London, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>).</note> with whom he is off to Brighton two hours ago, is a young, very tall, very lean, dyspeptical, gentlehearted, rich and melancholic man; the son of a man we liked well, and lamented for the Death of;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Robert Coningham, Hester Sterling&#x2019;s brother; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360727-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:26</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1836-07-27">27 July 1836</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-SS-01"><sic>8:206</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref> (where TC also spells his name Cunningham).</note>&#x2014;it seems not unlikely Jack may be of service to him; he is at present in a pitiable state with his stomach-disorders, and the dispiritment they have brought on. Jack talks of staying only a week; but it is of course very uncertain how long he will stay. To him the chief charm of the business is that he escapes from the necessity of determining what he means to make of himself. If Cunningham do any good with him, I should not wonder that they made an engagement (for C. is rich enough), and continued all winter together, perhaps wandering about from place to place. Brighton is only some sixty miles from us, which they travel in five hours; a pleasant place, full of fashionable people at this season, by the shore of the sea.&#x2014; I was <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to see poor Jack take the road again this morning. But how could we help it, how could <hi rend="italic">he</hi> help it? A man that has a restlessness within him <hi rend="italic">must</hi> travel, no less than he that has a necessity pushing him from without. We will hope and believe that it is all for good still.</p>
<p>As for myself the chief fact is that I have gone riding every day <pb id="pg-11-208" n="11:208"/>since I wrote last. Every day; except one that Jack consented to take the good of, when I went walking:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, 23 O<hi rend="italic">ct</hi>.: &#x201C;(N.b. Today is my <hi rend="italic">third</hi> week of the Mare &#x2018;Citoyenne&#x2019;; today I complete my third week: must have <hi rend="italic">begun</hi>, on <date when="1839-10-02">Wednesday 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> October, 1839</date>. Pay the <hi rend="italic">hostler</hi> weekly; the Nodes not).&#x201D; John told his mother that he found the horse &#x201C;quiet, steady &#x26; at the same time willing to go with any speed.&#x201D;</note> Jane, tho&#x2019; she has <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the offer of a saddle here, has never once made use of it; she needs some mounted man to go with her, and they are scarce at this season; besides she has had a kind of cold, caught in the Sterling&#x2019;s carriage one day with thin clothes, so that she did not like at any rate to venture. I have had it all to myself; and a curious thing it is, two hours or more of swift riding in this neighbourhood! It does me decided good as to health, keeps my head much clearer too; it is the blessedest thing possible to escape altogether out of this whirlpool into the green silent lanes over the river, as I can do in few minutes&#x2019; galloping, and then go perfectly left to myself there! It is like dew on mown grass to me. Or if I like the other way, I can turn North Eastward, and be in Hyde Park and a series of Parks, roads: streets and drives, among the busy press of equipages, brisk motion and display. The only thing is, I grudge dreadfully the price! But yet again, if it do keep me in better health, I shall even <hi rend="italic">make more money</hi> of myself, and ought to go on with it.</p>
<p>Generally every forenoon till 2 o&#x2019;clock I sit writing; the ostler brings my horse to the door at that hour. Formerly I used to go into the Town then, and probably call on people, or meet people; not so now, I see nobody, even the people that call here I miss, for all calling is transacted, at least all formal calling, in these two hours which for me are riding hours. I cannot say but that this too is a relief and pleasure to me! Plenty of people come about me still; once or twice in the week somebody steps-in in the evenings and that is abundantly enough for me. I like fully better to spend the evening in reading than with the average of company. In the day excursion, the great towering trees, the green silent fields, the repose of brown October far and wide, with my swift little black mare,&#x2014;is much preferable to any human society I could get. When I have written a tolerable morning&#x2019;s task, I feel extremely peaceable and content; when I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, it is not so well, but I must just hope to do better next day. What reason have I to thank a kind Providence that has led me so mercifully thus far! It is a changed time with me from what it was but a few years back; from what it had been all my life. My sore sufferings, poverty, sickness, obstruction, dispiritment were sent me in kindness, angrily as I rebelled against them, they were all kind and good. My poor painful existence <pb id="pg-11-209" n="11:209"/>was not altogether in vain.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Every thing goes very tolerably well with me here; I have a prospect of being able to live now with less misery from terror of want,&#x2014;that is the chief good I find in the thing they call &#x201C;fame,&#x201D; the rest is worth little to me, little or even nothing. I should thank Heaven too that that was delayed till I had got grey hairs on my head, and could judge what the meaning of several things was.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:171, for TC&#x2019;s Journal entry, <date when="1839-10-23">23 Oct.</date>, exploring the same preoccupations.</note></p>
<p><salute>My dear Mother,</salute> I am writing all about myself; and yet Heaven knows I am anxious anough to hear about you, and every one of you! Is your health tolerable at this delicate season? I see you often in that little end-room; I see you, and it all, vividly at this moment! May the good Guardian watch ever over you&#x2014; I long to have a Letter. Somebody must write one. The penny-post by and by is coming; then we shall have unlimited supply of Letters. How has Jamie&#x2019;s harvest gone? I must know that. We have had good weather, sometimes even droughty weather; hardly any rain till yesterday and today (a very <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> day), these three weeks. I hope it far excelled his expectations, which I know were not high. Isabella&#x2019;s brother came one night lately, left that letter; he looked very healthy, effectual, and content.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Calvert&#x2019;s letter to Isabella was enclosed in the frank. John had also called at his office.</note> We are to see him again by and by: but he lives, I think, almost six miles off this.&#x2014; How is Alick getting on? Give him my unalterable regards. He might write to me,&#x2014;if he liked; but he is very lazy. I will write to him by and by. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> sheet was not premeditated; it is accidental, and has grown far longer than I expected.&#x2014; I should like to hear that James Aitken had got the books and pamphlets safely, and sent them safely to you. Suppose Alick addressed me an old Newspaper (<hi rend="italic">no</hi> writing on it, as the last had!) with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> stroke to signify the affermative [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of this.&#x2014; My love to Mary, to Jean, and their households; and to one and all of you.&#x2014; And so good b&#x2019;ye dear Mother for this day. I must still try to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">write</hi>&#x201D; a little before 2 o&#x2019;clock. What is to become of it we shall see by and by. Perhaps an &#x201C;article,&#x201D; perhaps none: at all events it is <hi rend="italic">written</hi>.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am ever your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you excuse me for having so long delayed to answer by the smallest note of hand the kind gift of your &#x201C;Rhymed Plea.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Rhymed Plea for Tolerance</hi>, 2d edn. (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>).</note> It had come to me in a time of hurry; I have been in Scotland since, and much occupied: I could not till now have answered, except by a vague and altogether empty acknowledgement that the Book had been delivered me.</p>
<p>Pray accept my thanks; and, if that can do anything for you, my sincere agreement in the spirit that animates you, my clear recognition of an honest purpose, of a valuable talent in you. It is saying much, if you knew my habits, that I have read great part of your Book tho&#x2019; in rhyme; that I mean to read it all, and with attention. Rhyme, of late years, is a thing I have felt myself obliged more and more to avoid. Speech of any kind ought to be the authentic impression of the thought that had been in the heart of a man. Rhymed speech, Poetry, ought to be the <hi rend="italic">musical</hi> expression of what had been so <hi rend="italic">vividly</hi> there as to grow musical, to become <hi rend="italic">song</hi>, and oblige the man to sing it! Such is my creed; what my practice, in these years in this region, may have been, you yourself understand! One cannot do with speech that is the impression of Nothing; with rhymed speech that has the additional incumbrance of dislocating the grammar of the thing; hiding the no-meaning in a perplexed wrapping of jingle. As true song of thought is the delight of man&#x2019;s soul; so false song is the horror of a man; the thing that makes a Hogarth&#x2019;s &#x201C;enraged musician&#x201D; of him!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Engraving (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>) of a musician enraged by noises outside his window; see John Nichols and George Steevens, <hi rend="italic">The Genuine Works of William Hogarth</hi> (London, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>) 2:153.</note> I have more than once read all the Notes of so-called &#x201C;Poems&#x201D;; keeping the Poems themselves at a safe distance from me.&#x2014; I fear you think me very perverse; but the thing I say will explain what compliment I meant you by the mere fact of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi>. My haste at this moment is great; and I have written too much and too little for any but a candid man&#x2019;s interpretation.</p>

<salute>Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>Take a word from me today, of the briefest kind, to tell you that after due announcement &#x26;c of which you see evidence inclosed, the <hi rend="italic">Box of Brandy</hi> arrived here, safe (to all appearance), the day before yesterday. I say &#x201C;to all appearance,&#x201D; and indeed have no doubt that it is &#x201C;in reality&#x201D;: but the Box is convenient for <hi rend="italic">keeping</hi> the liquor in, and we have set it by unopened. I am much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken; and glad for both our sakes that it has succeeded.</p>
<p>&#x201C;18 bottles&#x201D; must mean I think three gallons, the prime cost of which, if I mistake not, is some &#xa3;4&#x201D;10. I here inclose you a five-pound Note. If you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not have any profit, pray send over a bottle of the same Brandy to my Mother; and divide any residue of cash there may be, equally between Rob Scott and old Jamie Morison.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Scott, blacksmith, Ecclefechan; Morison not further identified unless the same man as &#x201C;Old Tipler Morrison&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-09/lt-18371107-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:341</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1837-11-07">7 Nov. 1837</date></corr></ref>).</note> That will make all square.&#x2014; And pray write to me directly (or re-address that <hi rend="italic">Courrier</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to me, if you cannot get written) to announce that the Cash has come safe.&#x2014; Of Course, make yourself right out of the &#xa3;5 first, if I have calculated wrong!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>In such a beautiful confusion is this head of mine that I cannot recollect the least in the world whether or no I wrote to you that the Parcel had been sent to the address you gave me,&#x2014;by the Delivery Company carriage, paid. In case of its not turning up within reasonable time you should be told this twice rather than <hi rend="italic">not at all</hi>, that you may enquire after it. It was sent some ten days or fortnight ago.</p>
<p>For the rest I have been thirteen days confined to the house with a cold, which is not quite gone yet. But I am tired of nursing it entirely; and must go out for a little while today, to get the cobwebs blown out of my brains;&#x2014;it is dreadfully dull being confined to <hi rend="italic">this</hi> house&#x2014;especially now that John is not here to come in once a day and ask after me.</p>
<p>My maid is very kind, luckily, when I am laid up. She has no suggestiveness or voluntary help in her; but she does my bidding quietly and accurately, and when I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad; she bends over me in my bed, as if I were a little sick child, and <hi rend="italic">rubs her cheek on mine!</hi> Once I found it wet with tears. One might think one&#x2019;s maid&#x2019;s tears could do little for a tearing headache; but they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> comfort a little. What is more to the purpose however she makes <hi rend="italic">mutton</hi> broth that is the chief consolation of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s life; he prefers <hi rend="italic">it</hi> even to the <hi rend="italic">cock-broth</hi> of old <hi rend="italic">Putta</hi>.</p>
<p>Did M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. tell you that one of the last outgoings I made I got my pocket picked,&#x2014;the first time since I came to London;&#x2014;my purse, containing a sovereign and some silver&#x2014; I felt very like a fool on making the discovery when I was going to pay my omnibus.</p>

<p><supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied>joice to hear the accomplishment of. Her milk-supply too ought to be settled; I wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had spoken about it. Isabella seemed to me always a most reasonable woman, far above any petty thing; and who would herself <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to have petty causes of annoyance put out of the way. On the whole, however, our Mother and she must be allowed to have done better than two of a thousand could have done in that relation.</p>
<p>You forgot to mention whether M&#x2019;Kie&#x2019;s books arrived. In a letter of Alick&#x2019;s to Jack which came the same day with yours, he did speak of one of the things I sent by M&#x2019;Kie, the &#x201C;article&#x201D; on myself; but there were two Books in another parcel, which should have come along with that.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391002-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-10-02">2 Oct.</date></ref></note> From my having asked thrice or four times, and got no <hi rend="italic">denial</hi> of its having arrived, I incline to infer that all is right. By next month I send another parcel to my Mother; not thro&#x2019; M&#x2019;Kie, but over by Edinburgh and the Coach, direct to Ecclefechan: in that, there will be, if I can find it, a Cobbett&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">English Grammar</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Formerly sent by TC to Alick (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210324-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:347</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-03-24">24 March 1821</date></corr></ref>), often repr.</note> for James, an excellent book for learning with. I warmly approve of his purpose to instruct himself in that and in all things within his reach. I already notice the <hi rend="italic">Copperplate</hi> address on the Newspaper: he writes as well as anybody need do; no small credit to him! Could he not get himself connected with one of your Libraries, and set forth in a large course of reading? <pb id="pg-11-214" n="11:214"/>There is nothing more manful than a man of hard work and much business, who nevertheless contrives to instruct himself, and become a thinking enlightened man,&#x2014;as there is nothing to hinder his doing, if he will resolve upon it.</p>
<p>But now I have another piece of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> for him. On looking into the pipebox some days ago, I was shocked to discover, tho&#x2019; it looked still a fourth part full, that the filling was mere hay, and I had now come upon the last <foreign><hi rend="italic">stratum</hi></foreign> of pipes,&#x2014;perhaps some thirty pipes now left and no more nearer than Glasgow! Instantly let the goodman address himself to that invaluable carrier; mission him with a broken pipe (of the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> species,&#x2014;and O <foreign>bairns</foreign> be careful of that!), and let him get five gross at Glasgow as before.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371019-TC-JA-01"><sic>9:333&#x2013;34</sic><corr>TC to JA, <date when="1837-10-19">19 Oct. 1837</date></corr></ref>. Dumfries had three Glasgow carriers&#x2014;Robb, Fergusson, and Wells.</note> It was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> right before. I have forgot the potter&#x2019;s address; but I doubt not, it will all be right again. Probably a seventh part of the pipes were broken when they got here: the carrier can see if that is the natural proportion? A full half broken, they were still a gain to me. So send them, get them sent,&#x2014;for my blessing!</p>
<p>We are to have postages for four-pence in a few days now;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Uniform level for general inland postage of a half-ounce, introduced on <date when="1839-12-05">5 Dec.</date> in preparation for uniform penny postage in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>. London district postage was reduced to one penny (1d).</note> one will then have some heart to write. I intend a Letter for my Mother, probably next week; however you may try your best to let her know about this too. I must omit all other inquiries, rem<supplied>[em]</supplied>brances and details till then. The Austins will be <hi rend="italic">at</hi> Gill now? The Hannings gone to K. bridge?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many kind thanks for your kind gift of the S<hi rend="italic">chlegel</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horne had written an intro. for August W. von Schlegel, trans. John Black, <hi rend="italic">A Course of Lectures on Dramatic Art and Literature</hi>, 2d edn. (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> I read the Introduction last night; and can truly say I sympathize completely with the doctrine you advocate there. It is your way, from your different point of sight, of stating an emphatic truth, and beginning of endless truths, little recognised and dolefully wanted in these times of ours. I bid you good speed in prosecuting that. Had not I, for my share, many years ago, got rid of the cursed malady which you call by the name &#x201C;analysis,&#x201D; I think I literally should not have been alive now. Logic is glass-spectacles; may be very useful if there be an <hi rend="italic">eye</hi> behind it. God help them that stick it on a bare eye-less death&#x2019;s-head, and pretend to see with that!</p>
<p>I conjecture you do not yourself read German. You seem to me one of those that ought before all things to read it. There is, in a manner, no instruction at all to be had for the like of you, for pursuits like yours, in any other Literature but the German. Schlegel, tho&#x2019; so new to us English, is a very small matter in his own country. What he did, so far as he has done it, was to grind good wheat into marketable meal: the sowers and growers were quite another sort of men, with another sort of cunning in them than his! Lessing I believe was the first in any country that began to put Shakspeare on his true basis; a very original enterprise sixty years ago. The best criticism extant I should incline to call Goethe&#x2019;s of <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, written several years before Schlegel was heard of.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trans. by TC; in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:251&#x2013;53.</note> He, at bottom, is a very poor creature, tho&#x2019; of a rich country; wears a flaxen wig, paints himself, tho&#x2019; upwards of seventy, and <hi rend="italic">aspires</hi> indeed in a very hopeless manner after many things.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC recalls John Carlyle&#x2019;s description of Schlegel in <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date> (<ref target="volume-04/lt-18271119-TC-JJ-01"><sic>4:279</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1827-11-19">19 Nov. 1827</date></corr></ref>).</note></p>
<p>Pray think me a zealous preacher, not an impertinent advice-giver, when I counsel you to set about decisive study of German for yourself.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horne replied, <date when="1839-11-30">30 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I assure you I feel very sensibly the kind interest you have taken, now and heretofore, in me and my onward working. To all that you say about German literature I deeply respond; not much indeed, from actual knowledge, but from intuitive sympathy, o how much! I am almost glad you say that no other literature will bring help to where I am flying and floundering&#x201D; (MS of rough draft: Yale). He also writes at length about TC&#x2019;s influence on him.</note> The language, even if you do not know it, is attainable by any ordinary faculty in three months.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-216" n="11:216"/>If you ever pass in this direction and have half an hour to spare for the purpose, pray come and tell me what you are doing now.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>We hear bad accounts of you last week; how you have had <hi rend="italic">Bronchitis</hi>, are meditating the possibility of Italy again &#x26;c. I called next day at your Father&#x2019;s, for farther news; but none had then come. I will continue to hope that it is but a false alarm; a necessary alarm, to keep you from excess of confidence, excess of work and movement, to which I know you at all times too prone. Keep snug within doors mostly, till the dry weather return; working with extreme moderation, reading light stuff, oftener than writing either light or weighty; then in the brisk dry months, on that western coast, get yourself a horse, and go galloping about: that is my prescription! I cannot afford you in Italy any more; you have work to do in England, I hope,&#x2014;and will do it, if you can only remember that golden maxim, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [Hasten slowly]. The Annandale Farmer exclaimed to a man he saw riding a certain Rosinante of measurable vigour: &#x201C;Take time, my lad, ride at leisure! Thou may&#x2019;st depend on&#x2019;t, the slower thou ride&#x2019;st, the sooner thou&#x2019;lt get to thy journey&#x2019;s end!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Richie&#x2019;s saying; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>8:271</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> A precept I have applied a thousand times to myself; and have too often forgotten, never without penalty.</p>
<p>We see your lucubrations in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood;</hi> always with pleasure. I rejoice in the omen of their accepting your <hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit</hi>. Let us hope they will find their interest to lie in going on with it. Would not a few Notes here and there be of use to the uninitiated? I find the Translation good in itself, exquisite as compared with the generality of our Translations: a page or two of it I was at the pains to hold in close contact with the original proved to be grammatically exact almost to the last fibre; good flowing English too: but the <hi rend="italic">Goethe tune</hi>, the last perfection of Translation, was not fully in it; that will come by degrees. I translated Goethe some two years before I could <pb id="pg-11-217" n="11:217"/>discover that he had a tune; what indeed all mortals have. There is nothing of it, or next to nothing, in my <hi rend="italic">Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship;</hi> in the other <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> I did get hold of it, not to lose it any more. For the rest, I will heartily congratulate you on being laid hold of by that man; he will not let you quit of him again till you have made out his wondrous secret, and learned from him what none else can teach you. A translator is properly a perfect <hi rend="italic">reader;</hi> one never reads honestly till one tries translation: Goethe deserves much reading in a sense no other man of these ages can pretend to do.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Theophilus</hi> was a beautiful portrait; such as the original deserved. Good Mr Dunn!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. James Dunn. <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi>, <date when="1839-10-00">Oct.</date>, <date when="1839-11-00">Nov.</date>, had pbd. 2 pts. of Sterling&#x2019;s trans. of <hi rend="italic">Dichtung und Wahrheit;</hi> see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391002-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-10-02">2 Oct.</date></ref> Sterling&#x2019;s portrait of James Dunn, disguised as &#x201C;Theophilus,&#x201D; was on pp. 675&#x2013;76 of his &#x201C;Sayings and Essayings,&#x201D; also in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s</hi> 46 (<date when="1839-11-00">Nov. 1839</date>): 669&#x2013;76.</note> One will hardly ever see a face like his again in this world. But indeed the man&#x2019;s Life was a kind of Picture; not a solid angular Reality, with its contradictions, with its self-assertion, as other men&#x2019;s lives are and ought mostly to be.</p>
<p>Compare <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, for example, with <hi rend="italic">Sinner Saved!</hi> Many thanks you [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for these two books; which I read with many thoughts. A most notable Antinomian savage this &#x201C;S. S.&#x201D; Poor brother mortal, deep sunk in poverty, coal-dust and every degradation and defacement; struggling withal to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a man, not the simulacrum of a man! I know few things that have more of a savage greatness in them than that last victorious vision of his on the pear-tree, and his running into the tool-house, covering his head with his blue apron, to pray, weeping as if tears of blood, God be merciful to me a sinner! We could not do without such men. Yet the man is a savage too, a gross base greedy-hearted plebian coalheaver to the end of him. Never was a struggling sunbeam imprisoned in a stranger element, and bidden struggle there. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Requiescat</hi></foreign> [Let him rest], the monster! By the bye, having a sudden opportunity, I sent off these two little books to my Mother, tho&#x2019; I know them to have been only lent me; if you need them before they return of their own will, let me know, and we will fly to Aldersgate the cheap fountain-head.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably religious tracts, not further identified. There were several book-sellers in Aldersgate.</note></p>
<p>Emerson&#x2019;s Letter was straightway despatched (&#x201C;Concord, Massachusetts, U.S.&#x201D;): there is not time yet, I apprehend, for an answer?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Sterling&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1839-09-30">30 Sept.</date> and Emerson&#x2019;s reply, <date when="1840-05-29">29 May 1840</date>, see E.

New York, <date when="1971-00-00">1971</date>) 25&#x2013;31. Sterling had praised &#x201C;our friend Carlyle, whose shaggy-browed and deep-eyed thoughts have often a likeness to yours which is very impressive, neither evidently being the double of the other. &#x2026; His suggestions work more deeply into the minds of men in this country than those of any living man: work, not mining to draw forth riches, but tunnelling to carry inwards the light and air of the region from which he starts&#x201D; (26&#x2013;27).</note> I <pb id="pg-11-218" n="11:218"/>have heard nothing of him; indeed it was mine to write; and I have been too busy for writing to any one. Only last week I finished an astonishing piece of work, a long review article, thick pamphlet or little volume, entitled &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.&#x201D; Lockhart has it, for it was partly promised to him, at least the refusal of it was; and that, I conjecture, will be all he enjoy of it. Such an Article, equally astonishing to Girondin Radicals, Donothing Aristocrat Conservatives, and Unbelieving Dilettante Whigs, can hope for no harbour in any review. Lockhart refusing it, I mean to print it at my own expence; so in any case you will see it, and have the pleasure of crying shame over it. The thing has lain in my head and heart these ten, some of it these twenty years: one is right glad to be delivered of such a thing on any terms. The <hi rend="italic">Meisters</hi> are coming out, two in one, in a few days.&#x2014; By the bye, you understand the &#x201C;Article&#x201D; to be entirely a secret <hi rend="italic">even to yourself?</hi></p>
<p>I have seen almost nobody; I could <hi rend="italic">call</hi> for literally nobody.

Green, frondent, fertile, entirely subdued to man; whatsoever all this in its utmost perfection can offer, without running water, rock or mountain, is there. The hectic dying beauty of some of these sun-glimpses I have come upon in my solitude are things to be enjoyed&#x2014;in profound <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, you Knave! I am also greatly delighted with the country people, working on the roads &#x26;c, down to the very children; and rejoice to call such people my kindred. Unhappily the day after tomorrow I part with my horse; the mud having grown too intense for me. It was a present from a certain worthy wealthy Mr Marshall of Leeds last summer, this horse: his son now pretends to &#x201C;borrow&#x201D; it from me, half-guessing, I believe that I would fain be rid of it till spring again. Kindness is frequent in this world, if we reckon upwards from <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> (as were fair) not downwards from infinity; and always very precious, the more so the rarer.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have compared your Friend&#x2019;s Translation<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> with the Original, so far as my haste would admit. Grammatically he seems to have understood his Author, which as English Translations go is something; and even poetically here and there, there is some feature of him given. For the rest he is not very close; and, curious enough, in that half of the Poem where the fetters of the rhyme are flung off altogether, he is the least so. His Translation is not by any means without worth; he might with good hope prosecute that department if his mind decidedly called him to it.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This being the first day of the <hi rend="italic">cheap post</hi>, I determine on writing you a scrap of a letter. There will soon be an actual penny-postage, they say; but even this fourpenny-postage is a great thing. Were the penny system once come, I will expect to hear from you every week; I will write to you every week: we shall have such writing as was never seen before!</p>
<p>I know not whether Jean sent you out a Letter of mine from Dumfries. I told her there that I had got done with my &#x201C;Article&#x201D;; that all was going on very tolerably here. The &#x201C;Article&#x201D; is indeed all written, nay I have added some things to it since; everybody approves of it too; but how to publish it? has been the question. The Tory <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> people kept it for a week; and then, seemingly not without reluctance, sent it back, saying, &#x201C;We dare not.&#x201D; Mill saw it next, and contrary to my expectation expressed himself eager to have it, and publish it in his <hi rend="italic">final</hi> Number, as a kind of final shout; that he might sink like a <hi rend="italic">Vengeur</hi> battle-ship, with a broadside at the water&#x2019;s-edge!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See &#x201C;On the Sinking of the Vengeur,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:208&#x2013;25.</note> But Jane and Jack, and my own feelings too, advise that the thing is too good for that purpose. I have had nothing to do with their hide-bound <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, that I should sink along with it. I offered them this very thing two years ago, the blockheads; and they durst not let me write it then.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380100-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, [<date when="1838-01-00">late Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-03-00">early March 1838</date>]</ref>.</note> If they had taken more of my counsel, they need <pb id="pg-11-222" n="11:222"/>not perhaps have been in a <hi rend="italic">sinking</hi> state at present. But they went their own way; and now their &#x201C;Review&#x201D; is to cease with the Next Number, as a thing that will not pay; and their whole beggarly Unbelieving Radicalism may cease too, if it like, and let us see whether there be not a Believing Radicalism possible!&#x2014; In short, I think of publishing this piece, which I have called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>,&#x201D; which is all about the Poor and their rights and wrongs, as a little separate Book, with Fraser, on my own independent footing. Fraser will print it; &#x201C;halving&#x201D; the profits. It may be out, probably, by the end of this month. I shall perhaps get less money by it from Fraser, but its effect on the public will have a chance to be much more immediate. This year, for the first time, I am not at all <hi rend="italic">poor;</hi> and can shift, whether I gain &#x201C;sixty pounds,&#x201D; or do not gain them. Let us be thankful, then; and publish, as we best can, what it has been given us to write as we best could!</p>
<p>There went a parcel by Fraser to Edinburgh last week; addressed to you at Scotsbrig, to be &#x201C;forwarded by coach.&#x201D; Have you got it yet? I thought <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a more direct method than M&#x2019;Kie&#x2019;s by Dumfries, and not likely to cost above a few pence more. The parcel contained your knit spencer, some worthless books and nicknacks. I remembered at the last hour a piece of razor-strap <hi rend="italic">paste</hi> for Jamie, and ran up with it to Fraser&#x2019;s; but was too late! It will come by another parcel in the beginning of next month; for I shall have another to send, containing <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, and this <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> if it be ready. <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> is out, and a very reasonable-looking book doing &#x201C;as well as could be expected.&#x201D; The whole cargo of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> too is sold, and we are about beginning to print another, which will be three months of half-work half-amusement for me. Fraser must pay me down the cash at New-years-day. On this side, as you see therefore, all goes tolerably well.</p>
<p>Jack, I believe, announced to Alick that the sea-borne Packages arrived safe from Newcastle, a while ago. We broke into the butter, and are consuming it daily &#x201C;with apparent relish&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varying expressions with &#x201C;relish&#x201D; are coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:331</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380915-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-15">15 Sept. 1838</date></ref>.</note> the meal I threaten to break up daily, tho&#x2019; there remains a fraction of the old stock, &#x201C;blessed,&#x201D; Jane says, &#x201C;like the widow&#x2019;s cruse.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Kings 17:12.</note> The ham also gives way rapidly before the teeth of the destroyer; it is of excellent taste; but far too <hi rend="italic">lean</hi> for eating otherwise than as common meat. Fat enough, it is a kind of medicine to poor dyspeptic creatures at breakfast. I am also smoking Alick&#x2019;s tobacco: I will have the axe ground (it is very useful even <hi rend="italic">un</hi>ground), the hook shall mow grass against spring-time; the awl and gimlets did not want welcome! Thanks and again thanks to <pb id="pg-11-223" n="11:223"/>you all, you ever-kind friends, unwearied in caring for us! Near or distant, it is all one; your <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] with these London people never terminates.</p>
<p>Jack has been rushing about in the old style; twice down at Brighton, at the Isle of Wight &#x26;c &#x26;c. He is not so unhappy as one might fancy. He has all along, I think, had a kind of expectation that the Buccleuchs would go abroad again; and now this week, when the Duke is returned, it is to be decided; one of these very days it will be decided; you of course will hear directly how. My own conjecture is that they <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go, and take Jack with them, for half a year or so: there is clearly nothing else that he can do so eligible. They speak of Lisbon rather than Italy this time; Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, is a bright place as to climate, a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> place too for them, Jack I suppose will like that not worse but better. &#x201C;They are idle of work that go <foreign>clatching</foreign> [splashing] up and down the country on <foreign>cuddy</foreign>-asses,&#x201D; I think!</p>
<p>Jane caught cold about a fortnight ago, for the second time this winter; and has been rather feckless ever since. She has the cold thrown off now, but continues in a feeble way, not being yet able to venture out in the cold fogs we have. I hope this rap on the knuckles at the opening of winter may be a warning to her, that she is not to take liberties! She sits and sews, as peaceably as she can.</p>
<p>About a week ago I sent my horse off to its old quarters; very glad that I could get so handsomely rid of it. The Mr Marshall junior<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William.</note> had actually I think some work for it; engaged, at any rate, to turn it out into a strawyard when his work ceased. I accordingly rode it out to him last wednesday (gone a week), some twenty miles off; returning next day by the railway; a pleasant enough ride,&#x2014;in spite of sleet-showers: I shall not meddle with it again, till the roads <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> a little; we will say in <date when="1840-03-00">March</date> or <date when="1840-04-00">April</date>. The mud of the great thoroughfares here, in wet weather, surpasses all conception: Champed into the consistency of thin weaver&#x2019;s-dressing, floating there like an ever-vexed sea; hundreds of men vainly endeavouring with <foreign><hi rend="italic">clats</hi></foreign> [scrapers] and spades to keep it down. You cannot ride <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> in that, and the weather is too cold for riding slow. On the whole, I am glad to have my five-and twenty shillings a-week taken off my hands for a while! The horse did me perceptible benefit; real good, I think: I will resume it in due season; I must work the harder to pay for it.&#x2014; By the bye, did either Jamie or Alick ever in this world hear of horses being <hi rend="italic">clipt</hi> in the winter time? All riding or smart carriage horses here, I found to my astonishment, are treated in that way; to prevent their sweating! I saw an <pb id="pg-11-224" n="11:224"/>artist at work on a horse, with scissors and comb; making a very neat job: he had one whole side, and a hip of the other done;&#x2014;his charge, he said, was from two guineas to thirty shillings, or even one guinea, according to <hi rend="italic">neatness</hi>. I did not employ him.</p>
<p>Alas the <hi rend="italic">sheet</hi> is on the point of ending; and I have clattered all along, and got nothing at all asked about as yet! What is my small namesake down stairs doing, whom Alick reported to be unwell? I hope it proved nothing of moment. How are all the rest of you; how are you, dear Mother? Put on that knit-spencer; Jane declares it to be a great help: it goes on uppermost of all, except the gown and keeps all the rest snug. Take care of cold; I have no more pressing advice to give, to you, to Isabella, and all the womankind of you. What does Jamie&#x2019;s crop say when he has it on the <hi rend="italic">floor?</hi> Are the Austins <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> to the Gill? What of Kirtlebrig?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For The Gill and Kirtlebridge, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391123-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1839-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref></note> I hope to hear from Alick soon, or to write to him soon. <closer><salute>God be ever with you all!&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mill,</salute>
<p>After a good deal of consulting and considering this way and that, I have found that on the whole it would be best to give Fraser the Paper, and let him send it out as a pamphlet, for the <hi rend="italic">Tories</hi> to read.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had returned the MS a few days before, saying: &#x201C;It is a glorious piece of work&#x2014;&#x26; will be a blessed gospel to many, if they read it &#x26; lay it to heart.&#x201D; After some suggestions for changes he went on: &#x201C;I should be very averse to disturb any other arrangement you may have made, or may wish to make; but it would delight me much to let this be the last dying speech of a Radical Review. I do not think a radical review <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to die without saying all this&#x2014;&#x26; no one else could say it half as well. Any number of copies of it might be printed in pamphlet form from the same types&#x201D; (MS: NLS 618.98A; pbd: Mineka 13:414).</note> <hi rend="italic">He</hi> &#x201C;could not undertake to publish any reprint from the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>&#x201D;: I calculated that the Tories would not see me for a long time, if at all, on any other scheme. So there we are,&#x2014;wisely, or unwisely. I shall at any rate be the sooner rid of the thing; in a week or two: a great blessing of itself.</p>
<p>Mazzini<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giuseppe Mazzini (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), Italian patriot and revolutionary. He had founded the association of Young Italy in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date> to promote a united republic, went into exile, and came to London in <date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>. He tried to live by writing, met Mill, and is said to have met TC as early as <date when="1837-11-00">Nov. 1837</date> (M. C. W. Wicks, <hi rend="italic">The Italian Exiles in London, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date></hi> [Manchester, <date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>] 190), apparently through John Taylor (see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 75). Mazzini&#x2019;s article on <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Chronicle</hi> 5 (<date when="1840-01-00">Jan. 1840</date>): 71&#x2013;84. During <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> they met more frequently, and it was the Carlyles who were to persuade him to take lodgings nearby, in the King&#x2019;s Rd., Chelsea. The friendship grew, particularly between JWC and Mazzini, in spite of TC&#x2019;s aversion to his revolutionary politics. TC was to write in his Journal, <date when="1849-05-17">17 May 1849</date> (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:454), when Mazzini was besieged in Rome: &#x201C;Mazzini came much about us here for many years, patronised by my wife; to me very wearisome, with his incoherent Jacobitisms, George-Sandisms, in spite of all my love and regard for him; a beautiful little man, full of sensibilities, of melodies, of clear intelligence, and noble virtues. &#x2026; True as steel, the word the thought of him pure and limpid as water. &#x2026;&#x201D; TC also writes in the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences:</hi> &#x201C;We soon tired of one another Mazzini and I; and he fell mainly to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> share,&#x201D; and in the Journal on their parting in <date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>, &#x201C;Mazzini is the most <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> living man I now know&#x201D; (75).</note> and Usiglio<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Angelo Usiglio, who had been in exile with Mazzini, and who accompanied him and stayed with him when he first came to London.</note> called here yesterday; but I unluckily was out.

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>What a time since we have written to one another! Was it you that defalcated? Alas, I fear it was myself; I have had a feeling these nine or ten weeks that you were expecting to hear from me; that I absolutely could not write. Your kind gift of Fuller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Eckermann</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390913-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1839-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref> Emerson&#x2019;s last letter had been of <date when="1839-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390904-TC-RWE-01">TC&#x2019;s of <date when="1839-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref> In Emerson&#x2019;s next letter, <date when="1839-12-12">12 Dec.</date>, he wrote: &#x201C;For a good while I dared believe you were coming hither, &#x26; why should I write?&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 254).</note> was handed in to our Hackney Coach, in Regent Street, as we wended homewards from the railway and Scotland, on perhaps the <date when="1839-09-08">8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of September</date> last;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact, <date when="1839-09-11">11 Sept.</date></note> a welcome memorial of distant friends and doings: nay perhaps there was a Letter two weeks prior to that:&#x2014;I am a great sinner! But the truth is, I could not write; and now I can, and do it.</p>
<p>Our sojourn in Scotland was stagnant, sad; but tranquil, <hi rend="italic">well let alone</hi>,&#x2014;an indispensable blessing to a poor creature fretted to fiddlestrings, as I grow to be in this Babylon, take it as I will. We had eight weeks of desolate rain; with about eight days bright as diamonds intercalated in that black monotony of bad weather. The old Hills are the same; the old streams go gushing along as in past years, in past ages; but he that looks on them is no longer the same: and the old Friends, where are they? I walk silent thro&#x2019; my old haunts in that country; sunk usually in inexpressible reflexions; in an immeasurable chaos of musings and mopings that cannot be reflected or articulated. The only work I had on hand was one that would not prosper with me: an Article for the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> on the state of the working Classes here. The thoughts were familiar to me, old, many years old; but the utterance of them, in what spoken dialect to utter them! The <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> was not an eligible vehicle, and yet the eligiblest; of Whigs, abandoned to Dilettantism and withered sceptical conventionality, there was no hope at all; the <hi rend="italic">London-and-Westminister</hi> Radicals, wedded to their Benthamee Formulas, and tremulous at their own shadows, expressly rejected my proposal many months ago: Tories alone remained; Tories I often think have more stuff in them in spite of their blindness than any other class we have;&#x2014;Walter Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">sympathy</hi> with his fellow creatures, what is it compared with Sydney Smith&#x2019;s, with a Poor Law Commissioner&#x2019;s! Well: this thing would not prosper with me in Scotland at all; nor here at all, where nevertheless <pb id="pg-11-227" n="11:227"/>I had to persist writing; writing and burning, and cursing my destiny, and then again writing. Finally the thing came out, as an Essay on <hi rend="italic">Chartism;</hi> was shown to Lockhart, according to agreement; was praised by him, but was also found unsuitable by him; suitable to <hi rend="italic">explode</hi> a whole fleet of Quarterlies into skyrockets in these times! And now Fraser publishes it himself, with some additions, as a little volume; and it will go forth in a week or two on its own footing; and England will see what she has to say to it, whether something or nothing; and one man, as usual, is right glad that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has nothing more to do with it. This is the reason why I could not write. I mean to send you the Proofsheets of this thing, to do with as you see cause; there will be but some five or six, I think. It is probable my New England brothers may approve some portions of it; may be curious to see it reprinted: you ought to say Yes or No in regard to that. I think I will send all the sheets together; or at farthest, at two times.</p>
<p>Fraser, when we returned hither, had already received his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies;</hi> had about despatched his 500 <hi rend="italic">French Revolutions</hi>, &#x2018;insured&#x2019; and so forth, consigned I suppose to your protection and the proper Bookseller&#x2019;s; probably they have got over from New York into your neighbourhood before now. Much good may they do you! The <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, with their variegated binding, proved to be in perfect order; and are now all sold; with much regret from poor James that we had not a thousand more of them! This thousand he now sets about providing, by his own industry, poor man; I am revising the American copy in these days; the Printer is to proceed forthwith. I admire the good Stearns Wheeler as I proceed; I write to him my thanks by this post, and send him by Kennet a copy of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> for symbol of acknowledgement.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The vols., sent in recognition of Stearns Wheeler&#x2019;s proofreading of the <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, were inscribed &#x201C;Mr. Stearns Wheeler / T.C. London, <date when="1839-12-00">Dec. 1839</date>,&#x201D; as noted by J. O. Eidson, <hi rend="italic">Charles Stearns Wheeler</hi> (Athens, Ga., <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>) 106, where he records that they were still owned by the family.</note> Another copy goes off for you, to the care of Little and Company. Fraser has got it out two weeks ago; a respectable enough book, now that the version is corrected somewhat. Tell me whether you dislike it less; what you do think of it? By the bye, have you not learned to read German now? I rather think you have. It is three months well spent, if ever months were, for a thinking Englishman of this age.&#x2014; I hope Kennet will use more despatch than he sometimes does. Thank Heaven for these Boston Steamers they project! May the Nereids and Poseidon favour them! They will bring us a thousand miles nearer, at one step; by and by we shall be of one parish after all.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-228" n="11:228"/>During Autumn I speculated often about a <foreign>Hegira</foreign> into New England this very year: but alas! my horror of <hi rend="italic">Lecturing</hi> continues great; and what else is there for me to do there? These several years I have had no wish so pressing as to hold my peace. I begin again to feel some use in articulate speech; perhaps I shall one day have something that I <hi rend="italic">want</hi> to utter even in your side of the water. We shall see. Patience, and shuffle the cards.&#x2014; I saw no more of Webster; did not even learn well where he was; till lately I noticed in the Newspapers that he had gone hom<supplied>[e a]</supplied>gain. A certain Mr Brown (I think) brought me a letter from you, not long since; I forw<supplied>[arded]</supplied> him to Cambridge and Scotland: a modest inoffensive man. He said he had never personally met with Emerson.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A &#x201C;travelling Neighbour&#x201D; of Emerson&#x2019;s (<ref target="volume-12/lt-18400117-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1840-01-17">17 Jan. 1840</date></ref>), otherwise unidentified. Emerson met him for the first time in Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1840-08-00">Aug. 1840</date>.</note> My Wife recalled to him the story of the Scotch Traveller on the top of Vesuvius: &#x201C;Never saw so beautiful a scene in the world!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Nor I,&#x201D; replied a stranger standing there, &#x201C;except once; on the top of Dunmiot in the Ochil Hills in Scotland.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Good Heavens! That is a part of my Estate, and I was never there! I will go thither.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dunmyat, a hill of 1,375 ft., three and a half mi. NE of Stirling, with splendid views. The traveller who owned the estate was probably Lord Abercromby (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) of Airthrie Castle.</note> Yes, do!&#x2014; We have seen no other Transoceanic that I remember. We expect your <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> soon! We know the subject of your winter Lectures too;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ten lectures on &#x201C;The Present Age.&#x201D;</note> at least Miss Martineau thinks she does, and makes us think so. Heaven speed the work. Heaven send my good Emerson a good utterance, in all right ways, of the nobleness that dwells in him. He knows what silence means; let him know speech also, in its season: the two are like canvas and pigment, like darkness and light-image painted thereon; the one is essential to the other, not possible without the other.</p>
<p>Poor Miss Martineau is in Newcastle-on-Tyne this winter; sick, painfully not dangerously; with a surgical brother-in-law. Her meagre didacticalities afflict me no more; but also her blithe friendly presence cheers me no more.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When she collapsed in Venice in <date when="1839-06-00">June</date>, her illness was diagnosed as either prolapse of the uterus or a polypus tumor. She was taken directly to Newcastle to stay with her sister Elizabeth (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>) and her brother-in-law Thomas Greenhow (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>), surgeon. She remained with them until <date when="1840-03-16">16 March 1840</date>, when she moved to a rented house nearby in Tynemouth. She told Fanny Wedgwood, <date when="1839-12-12">12 Dec.</date>, that TC had sent her &#x201C;a most kind and beautiful letter&#x201D; (Wedgwood Papers, Univ. of Keele; pbd: E. S. Arbuckle, ed., <hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s Letters</hi> &#x2026; 24).</note> We wish she were back. This silence, I calculate, forced silence will do her much good. If I were a legislator, I would <pb id="pg-11-229" n="11:229"/>order every man, once a week or so, to lock his lips together, and utter no vocable at all for four-and-twenty hours: it would do him an immense benefit, poor fellow. Such racket, and cackle of mere hearsay and sincere-cant grows at last entirely deafening, enough to drive one mad;&#x2014;like the voice of mere infinite rookeries answering your voice! Silence, Silence!&#x2014; Sterling sent you a Letter from Clifton, which I set under way here, having added the address. He is not well again, the good Sterling; talks of Madeira this season again: but I hope otherwise. You of course read his sublime &#x201C;article&#x201D;? I tell him it was&#x2014;a thing <hi rend="italic">un</hi>tellable!</p>
<p>Mr Southey has fallen, it seems, into a mournful condition: oblivion, mute hebetation, loss of all faculty. He suffered greatly, nursing his former wife in her insanity, for years till her relief by death; suffered, worked, and made no moan; the brunt of the task over, he sank into collapse in the hands of a new wife he had just wedded.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Southey m.

My Wife seems better than of late winters. I actually had a Horse, nay actually have it, tho&#x2019; it is gone to the country till the mud abate again!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There are two Books of yours here; which I beg you to understand are not meant to be kept as <hi rend="italic">black-mail</hi>, but to be returned with thanks. I retain them only till the <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> concern be printed; till I can send you a copy of that along with them.</p>
<p>However, the reason of my writing is not these Books, which are probably of no value at all to you: but a reflexion I made yesterday on the irritable nature of Authors;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign>&#x201C;Genus irritabile vatum,&#x201D;</foreign> as in Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi> 2.2.102.</note> on the doubts you may by possibility have about my being irritated!&#x2014; God knows, I am much gratified, by your praise of me especially, which I believe to have much more sincerity in it than praise usually has. For the rest, I consider that your decision about that wild piece as an Article for the Quarterly was altogether what it should have been, what on the whole I expected it to be. Fraser is printing the thing now as a separate Pamphlet. Your negative was necessary to decide me as to that step. The Westminster people were willing to have taken the thing, after you; but I was not willing to appear with it there.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you accept a hasty word of thanks for your two beautiful lithographs, and the altogether friendly message that accompanied them.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had written artlessly and effusively on <date when="1839-12-13">13 Dec.</date> to thank TC for the way he interpreted &#x201C;german thoughts to our english Brethren&#x201D; and much more, &#x201C;thinking in the same time, it cannot be quite indifferent to you to know, how many there are &#x2026; for whom you have not laboured in vain. I know already three such, myself &#x26; two ladies.&#x201D; With his letter he sent &#x201C;two lithographic prints,&#x201D; by a young German artist (unidentified). One of the women was probably his sister, Rosetta; the other possibly his future wife, who d. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.</note> The Packet came to hand, safe and in due order, last night.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-11-232" n="11:232"/>I find you are an enthusiastic man, as indeed most of my best friends have a tendency to be; and that you praise me very enthusiastically. Under penalty, a most severe penalty, of seeing myself changed into an enchanted &#x201C;Bottom the Weaver&#x201D; (with ears <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, and hairy to the scratch!), I must not believe literally a word of what you or my two fair Nottingham Titanias<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Midsummer&#x2019;s Night&#x2019;s Dream</hi> 3.1 and 4.1.</note> so enthusiastically say; except indeed that you do really love me; and this I will, most literally and with all thankfulness, believe. Is not this, too, good news; the best of news? This, and the like of this, as our Goethe&#x2019;s Theresa says, &#x201C;first makes the waste empty world into a peopled garden for one!&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:24.</note>&#x2014; Of Nottingham, Snottingham [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and the old and new wonders in that point of space, I, having made acquaintance in school-years with Robin Hood and the rest of them, have long had a sufficiently romantic idea; but now it seems on the sudden as if I had got three household-establishments there,&#x2014;nay three <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> establishments, which are not to be hired like houses!

<p>The lithographs are beautiful; the finest work I have ever seen of that sort; more like steel-engravings than lithographs. The Artist has ideas in his head, and surely one of the daintiest hands that ever Artist had. Would he were near you!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In these days I am busy scheming out a new edition of a book of mine called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>,&#x201D;&#x2014;four volumes of Review Essays &#x26;c, which probably you have not seen in the combined state. Some friends collected and published them in America; sent me over a portion of their stock with a new Titlepage, by way of British edition, which is now happily all sold. Fraser is to get out a new revised edition therefore, on the &#x201C;Half-profits system&#x201D;; and I am now planning how it is to be done.</p>
<p>Almost half of the whole <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi>, I find, is composed of Essays on <hi rend="italic">German Literature</hi>. Now among a variety of plans for arranging the work, there is one in regard to which the question arises, Whether certain of those <hi rend="italic">Notices</hi> in <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> (&#x201C;Hoffmann,&#x201D; &#x201C;Tieck&#x201D; &#x26;c) might not with advantage be introduced among the rest?&#x2014; and then secondly, or rather primarily, the question, Whether you would allow me to reprint them there? It is not very likely, after all, that I should at present make use of such a permission: but it would lay the matter more <hi rend="italic">evenly</hi> before me, allow me to judge more unbiassedly of it, if I had such a permission. I therefore write to ask you, Whether you will not again be so good?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s earlier request to repr. vol. 4 of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels</hi>, see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390711-TC-WT-01">TC to WT, <date when="1839-07-11">11</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390723-TC-WT-01"><date when="1839-07-23">23 July</date></ref>. Tait pencilled, between these two paragraphs, &#x201C;I consented.&#x201D; TC repr. his intros. to Tieck and Hoffman from vol. 2 of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> in Appendix 1, <hi rend="italic">Critical and Miscellaneous Essays</hi> (London, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>) 3:333&#x2013;64. The remaining critical intros. were repr. in the edn. of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>.</note></p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> is out; I know not how it sells. There are none of the other Translations I should care to see republished, except perhaps <hi rend="italic">Tieck</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jean Paul;</hi> the rest are ephemeral rubbish in comparison; these themselves are not altogether of the immortal sort.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC commented in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> on <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> that &#x201C;these translations were good, and I could not do better yet&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi> 61).</note></p>
<p>I have been writing an Essay on the Condition of the Working Classes; which I will recommend to your tolerance when you see it. The thing is called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>&#x201D;; it is coming out&#x2014;as fast as the Christmas <hi rend="italic">gin</hi> of the Bookbinders will allow it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini&#x2019;s review, &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Chartism,&#x201D; appeared in <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> 7 (<date when="1840-02-00">Feb., 1840</date>): 115&#x2013;20.</note></p>
<p>Mrs Johnstone&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Tales of the Irish Peasantry</hi> bring her honourably <pb id="pg-11-234" n="11:234"/>to our mind.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Isobel Johnstone, ed. of <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (<ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:163</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May 1834</date></corr></ref>); <hi rend="italic">True Tales of the Irish Peasantry, as related by themselves; selected from the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners</hi>, 2d edn. (Edinburgh, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>).</note> Pray offer the good brave-hearted lady my hearty remembrances, good-wishes and applauses.&#x2014; Radicalism, I grieve to say, has but few such practical adherents! Radicalism, when one looks at it here, is&#x2014;a thing one had rather not give a name to!</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is to reach you on Newyearsday, if all go well, and Postie do his duty. There will be but a word of it; the expression of a prayer for &#x201C;Good to be with you,&#x201D; which expressed or unexpressed dwells always in me, at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> wishing season, and at all seasons. The happy fourpenny postage allows me to write, were it never so briefly. In some ten days more we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to have the actual penny-post! We shall then be able to write, did our sheet contain only, &#x201C;How do you do, dear Mother?&#x201D;&#x2014; I inclose, on the present occasion, a small Newyear&#x2019;s present. I beg you <pb id="pg-11-235" n="11:235"/>to get with it whatever <hi rend="italic">luxury</hi> you may have the smallest notion of: a keg of beer, a new gown,&#x2014;whatever thing you like or can. I am not near you to choose the article myself; I can <hi rend="italic">send</hi> nothing, except a scrap of Bank-paper to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> things sent with.&#x2014; You may, lastly, take an old Newspaper and make <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> direct it hither with two strokes (if all is tolerably right) when this arrives. It will be satisfactory to have some such token, and it costs nothing; Isabella will do it.</p>
<p>Today likewise there goes off, round by Edinburgh like the last, a packet of books. A copy of the new <hi rend="italic">Meister</hi> is in it for you; two copies of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> was pbd., in an edn. of 1,000 copies, <date when="1839-12-00">late in Dec.</date></note> one expressly for you, the other for &#x201C;general circulation&#x201D; among the brethren. Alick, I suppose, will read it,&#x2014;nay Jamie most probably will read it too! It can then be sent on to Dumfries, where they appear to be very anxious to see it. It came out only two days ago; the Bookbinders had all taken to drinking about <hi rend="italic">Christmas time</hi>, and could not be got to bind a sufficient stock of copies sooner. I have of course heard no opinion whatever about it yet; except from our own household here, who unanimously vote rather in favour of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC and John A. Carlyle.</note> To tell the truth, I do not care very much <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the world say or forbear to say or do in regard to the thing: it was a thing I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to write; and, behold now, I have written it, got it written and out of me, and have for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> part no farther concern with it at all.&#x2014; You will receive it, I should think, in about a week after this sheet arrives. But you will know by the last time. The Booksellers&#x2019; Magazine Parcels always leave London on the first of the month; they go by steam to Edinburgh, and then it depends a little on the activity of the people there.</p>
<p>We had a long good Letter from Jean<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> last week: all is well enough with them at Dumfries: she complains that she has got no right tidings of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> individually for some time; a Note of Alick&#x2019;s did not explicitly instruct her on that head. She asks <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to tell her how you are! I mean to send some line or other thither this week; but, alas, to myself it is only a <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> that you are well at present! Pray, get some kind of Note despatched <hi rend="italic">from Scotsbrig</hi> with proper news to her. She gives a most woeful narrative about the poor little <foreign>lassie</foreign> we saw with her in harvest-time last; of her poverty, of her Mother&#x2019;s insanity, and all manner of misery. Jane has written to her Mother to see if she can do nothing for the poor little creature.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> The wretchedness of many of God&#x2019;s creatures in this earth at present afflicts one&#x2019;s very heart.</p>
<p>Jane had a cold for three weeks, and kept the house; she is now <pb id="pg-11-236" n="11:236"/>round again, and ventures out as usual. We have had more rain lately than I ever saw in this region; the flat-lying roads swim in water; <foreign>lea</foreign> fields [fields of old grass] are lakes, where the level favours that. At present we have firm black frost; but it will not last, with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">dubs</hi></foreign> [puddles] so full.&#x2014; I am in my usual order as to health; a little better, I think, perhaps owing to my diligence with the <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> in weeks past. I work daily revising the Essays for the Press; I am in the last volume now, and shall then have very little <foreign>fash</foreign> [bother] farther,&#x2014;nothing but correcting the Proofsheets where they <hi rend="italic">vary</hi> from what I am now settling. It is strange work with me, studying these Essays over again: ten years of my life lie strangely written there; it is I, and it is not I, that wrote all that! They are as I could make them,&#x2014;among the peat-bogs and other confusions. It rather seems the people like them in spite of all their crabbedness. I had a most enthusiastic Letter the other day from Nottingham on the subject.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Joseph Neuberg.</note> I get enow of enthusiastic Letters and the like: but really as Corrie says &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">What&#x2019;s</hi> ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Jack is as usual, on the other side of the door from me,&#x2014;or rather I think I heard him sally out into the world a few minutes ago. He has bought you a Fox&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Book of Martyrs</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The popular title of the <hi rend="italic">Actes and Monuments</hi> (<date when="1563-00-00">1563</date>) of John Foxe (<date when="1516-00-00">1516</date>&#x2013;<date when="1587-00-00">87</date>), of which there were many popular edns.</note> which I calculate will go in the Parcel to-day; you will get right good reading out of it, I guess, and <hi rend="italic">plenty</hi> of it.&#x2014; As to Jack&#x2019;s ulterior plans I know nothing; and rather think he himself does not know much. He reads Medical books &#x26;c; and does not seem uncomfortable; is ready to <hi rend="italic">argue</hi> on any subject under the sun, to all lengths; sputters up into anger when I am too cross upon him, but in one moment becomes a sucking-lamb again: the old fellow in all points!

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your little German Annual for <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>, not uninteresting otherwise, does seem rather questionable in the part you suspect. It treats there of Father Origen&#x2019;s feat, in <hi rend="italic">Language</hi> as good as Gibbons;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Origen (<date when="0185-00-00">185</date>?&#x2013;<date when="0254-00-00">254</date>?), Christian theologian. Edward Gibbon (<date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1794-00-00">94</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</hi>, 6 vols. (London, <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>). The German Annual is unidentified.</note> but warns its lady-readers (as it well enough may) to &#x201C;look only thro&#x2019; their fans&#x201D; at such a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi>.&#x2014; I fear you must not send it.</p>
<p>How often has your kind soliloquy an exact counterpart within my own person!&#x2014; I am good for nothing at all, during these late weeks; sunk in confusion of dyspepsia, dispiritment, and the impossiblity to make any way in my confused work. Tonight or tomorrow night, you shall have share of my dulness since I have nothing better to impart&#x2014;</p>
<p>God bless you!</p>
