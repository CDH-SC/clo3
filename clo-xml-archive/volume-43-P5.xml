        <p>Volume 43 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> sees the end of the epistolary relationship of Jane Welsh Carlyle and Thomas Carlyle that has been traced through all the preceding volumes. This volume covers the last winter and spring of their life together, from <date when="1865-10">October 1865</date> to JWC&#x02019;s death in <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date>. It continues through the aftermath of her death with TC&#x02019;s shock at her loss, covering May through <date when="1866-06">June 1866</date>, when TC was preoccupied with writing his reminiscences of JWC. There are 114 of TC&#x02019;s letters, 65 of JWC&#x02019;s, and one written for her by Margaret Welsh. There are also two letters written by Margaret Welsh and three by John A. Carlyle on TC&#x02019;s behalf. This volume is the last to have JWC&#x02019;s letters placed chronologically with TC&#x02019;s letters.</p>
        <p>The Carlyles were together most of this last winter and spring, the drama in their lives coming, as always, from their friendship circles and also the rectorial election of TC by the students at the University of Edinburgh. This consisted of two parts, the proposal, acceptance, and election of TC in <date when="1865-11">November 1865</date>, and then the trip to Edinburgh and the giving of the rectorial address to the gathered crowd of students, staff, the University Court, and other invited members of the audience (see <sic>158</sic>
          <corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1866-04-03">3 April 1866</date>
          </corr>), in late <date when="1866-03">March</date> and early <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date>. There was a lot of correspondence in <date when="1865-11">November 1865</date> between TC and various Edinburgh University connected individuals, David Laing who reluctantly agreed to be TC&#x02019;s assessor (TC&#x02019;s representative on the University Court), all the many congratulatory letters from old friends and acquaintances, and TC&#x02019;s brother, John A. Carlyle, who elected himself advisor to TC while TC used him as the keeper of all the letters generated. TC wrote that he was &#x0201C;perfectly worn out with the shovelfuls of empty Letters &#x02026; flying ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me all week; one in ten of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (very unwillingly) I have been compelled to write ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in return&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18651117-TC-DL-01">

</ref>). After the election, there was a flurry of correspondence about when TC would give his inaugural address, eventually settled for early <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date>, making traveling easier than a winter event would have allowed for. While JWC toyed with the idea of accompanying TC, she gave short shrift, in a letter to one of her aunts, to the idea that they might move back to Edinburgh to live:</p>
        <q>It made me laugh, Dear, that Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> notion that because M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had been made Rector of the University, an office purely honorary; we should immediately proceed to tear ourselves up by the roots, and transplant <pb id="pg-43-xii" n="43:xii" />ourselves <hi rend="italic">there</hi>! After <hi rend="italic">thirty years of London</hi>, and with such society as we have in London to bundle ourselves off to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to live out the poor remnant of our lives, in a new and perfectly uncongenial sphere; with no consolations that I know of but your three selves&#x02014;and dear old Betty&#x02014;! &#x02026; And for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> people!&#x02014; Those that I knew are mostly dead and gone&#x02014;and the new ones would astonish me much if they afforded any shadow of compensation for the people I should leave here! No! my Dear we shall certainly not go &#x0201C;to live in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>,&#x0201D; I only wish M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C hadn&#x02019;t to go to deliver a speech in it; for it will tear him to tatters.

</ref>)</q>
        <p>Once the decision was taken about when the inaugural was to be held, TC moved into an unusually calm state of mind:</p>
        <q>This Rectorial Office is beginning to promise being a highly pacific one; and has already shifted itself to a corner of the mind where I seldom remember it, and never almost with anything of anxiety or displeasure. When the time for <hi rend="italic">speeching</hi> approaches, I shall have to bethink me a little, &#x26; be bothered &#x26; tumbled ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for a week or so; but that done, I hope, essentially all will be done. (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18651221-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1865-12-21">21 Dec. 1865</date>
</ref>)</q>
        <p>TC was correct in that his winter continued pleasantly with no particular agitation until shortly before his departure, late <date when="1866-03">March 1866</date>, for Lord Houghton&#x02019;s house, Fryston, Yorkshire, on his way to Edinburgh and the address itself. William Brookfield, an old friend of both Carlyles, wrote to Lady Ashburton describing a <date when="1866-02">February</date> visit: &#x0201C;I have seen the Carlyles pretty recently. She invalided a good deal&#x02014;but still not set aside from human life&#x02014; no less agreeable than ever; He&#x02014;now that Frederick is finished, is more amenable to social intercourse than I have known him for long&#x0201D; (WB to Lady A, <date when="1866-02-21">21 Feb. 1866</date>; MS: NLS Acc. 11388.62). During TC&#x02019;s journey north, he was expressing himself in his more customarily agitated way at the prospect of travel, people, and public speaking, changing his mind about his plans, and arguing with other guests at Fryston. But John Tyndall successfully shepherded him through the visit at Fryston and all the subsequent drama of the events surrounding the inaugural. JWC, undoubtedly preferring to stay in London in an active social whirl, finally acknowledged in letters that her health did not allow her to accompany him; she wrote a dramatic account to TC of the imagined giving of his lecture:</p>
        <q>What I have been suffering, vicariously, of late days, is not to be told! If you had been to be <hi rend="italic">hanged</hi>, I don&#x02019;t see that I could have taken it more to heart! This morning, after about two hours of off-and-on sleep, I awoke&#x02014;long before daylight&#x02014;to sleep no more! While drinking a glass <pb id="pg-43-xiii" n="43:xiii" />of wine and eating a biscuit at five in the morning; it came into my mind what is <hi rend="italic">He</hi> doing, I wonder, at this moment? and then instead of picturing you sitting smoking, up the stranger chimney, or anything else that was likely to <hi rend="italic">be</hi>; I found myself always dropping off into details of a regular <hi rend="italic">execution</hi>! now they will be telling him it is time! now they will be pinioning his arms! and saying last words! Oh mercy! was I dreaming or waking? was I mad or sane?&#x02014;Upon my word I hardly know <hi rend="italic">now</hi>! &#x02026; My &#x0201C;Imagination&#x0201D; has gone the length of representing you getting up to speak before an awful crowd of people; and what with fuss and &#x0201C;bad air&#x0201D; and confusion dropping down dead!&#x02014;Why on Earth did you ever get into this galley!

        <p>She used this trope of TC being hanged in other letters; it undoubtedly entertained her, but it also expressed an anxiety about her own health as well as about TC&#x02019;s capacity to survive his own challenging situation. The irony for later readers is, of course, that it was she herself who was to drop dead, not TC.</p>
        <p>TC extemporized his rectorial address, <date when="1866-04-02">2 April</date>, to a large, attentive audience, and Tyndall immediately sent a telegram announcing that it had been &#x0201C;a perfect triumph&#x0201D;; JWC took the telegram to John Forster&#x02019;s birthday party, <date when="1866-04-02">2 April</date>, where she celebrated with Charles Dickens, Forster, and others. This event was only one during an intense period of socializing that JWC took part in while TC was away in Scotland; its intensity later appeared almost to contain a presentiment of her sudden death, but it was simply part of the social pace that JWC adopted over this winter and spring. TC&#x02019;s letters between <date when="1865-10">October 1865</date> and <date when="1866-03">March 1866</date> may be preoccupied with the rectorial events, his own health, and wellbeing, but JWC&#x02019;s give detailed descriptions of socializing, of a new young friend, of her triumphs over neighbor hens (just like the old days), and of driving out in her carriage. She talked about a particular health problem in letters to Betty Blakiston and to Lady Ashburton,<date when="1865-12"> Dec. 1865</date>; it occurred when she was agitated or alarmed: &#x0201C;I was sure to take a pain like a knife-stab at the bottom of my back; that would take my breath away and leave me gasping&#x02014;like an idiot&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18651210-JWC-BB-01">

</ref>). She apparently discussed it with Geraldine Jewsbury during this last winter, as Jewsbury recalled it in her second letter to Betty Braid after JWC&#x02019;s death:</p>
        <q>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle always when she was alarmed or agitated had a great sudden pain in her <hi rend="italic">Back</hi> wh took her breath for the moment she used to say her mother had it &#x26; that some day it would <hi rend="italic">kill</hi> her&#x02014;well on Saturday she had put her little dog out of the carriage to run by the side a little A carriage drove over it poor thing &#x26; she sprang out of the carriage to take it up&#x02014; took it in her arms &#x26; got in again&#x02014; then in a little while the driver of the carriage was surprised not to have orders to go home <pb id="pg-43-xiv" n="43:xiv" />as it was her time&#x02014; then they found she was <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>&#x02014; now she lies in her Coffin upstairs looking as tho&#x02019; she were asleep.

        <p>Her sense of herself this winter may have been that of a woman back from the brink of death after her illness of <date when="1864">1864</date>; she also wrote to contrast her ill-health during the summer of <date when="1865">1865</date> (particularly neuralgia in her arm) with her current comparative good health:</p>
        <q>When Georgina saw me, I was wild with pain in my arm and hand, and I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not write, with the right hand&#x02014;could not cut my food, nor sup my soup nor do any one earthly thing with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>. After my return from Scotland in August, the pain went away all in a moment, and has never come back!! And tho&#x02019; the <hi rend="italic">stiffness</hi> remained behind, that also has gradually lessened&#x02014;till I have recovered such power in my hand that, the other day, I made myself a&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Bonnet</hi>!! &#x02026; And I can play on the piano!&#x02014;and it would be difficult to say what female thing I could <hi rend="italic">not</hi> do&#x02014;if I tried!&#x02014;(<ref target="volume-43/lt-18651128-JWC-MC-01">

        <p>Another of her tropes this winter was to describe herself as a &#x0201C;Living Miracle,&#x0201D; using it both to express her sense of astonishment that she was still alive and to justify not traveling to Edinburgh with TC. She wrote an expressive letter of justification to Henry Inglis, an old Edinburgh friend:</p>
        <q>The nearer we get to the end of <date when="1866-03">March</date>, the more I shudder at a journey of eight hundred miles (there and back) and <hi rend="italic">a Speech</hi> for object!

        <p>TC&#x02019;s insistence that JWC have a carriage at her disposal for a daily drive out meant that she was mobile during this winter in pursuit of friends and social events. Her latest (and last) prot&#38;eacute;g&#xE9;e was Maria Price, the daughter of a tailor, hence &#x0201C;Sartorina,&#x0201D; who wrote a letter of admiration to TC and was astonished about six months later to receive a visit from JWC in her home above her father&#x02019;s shop, <date when="1865-10">October 1865</date>. Price described her adoption into JWC&#x02019;s circle in her &#x0201C;Recollections of Thomas Carlyle&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, <date when="1896-01">Jan. 1896</date>), where she gave as many recollections of JWC as of TC in the detailed narrative of their contact between <date when="1865-10">October 1865</date> and Spring <date when="1866">1866</date>. Price&#x02019;s first contact with the Carlyles was described briefly by JWC:</p>

Some months ago M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C got a letter from a girl, giving her opinion of himself and his Books&#x02014;with considerable enthusiasm of&#x02014;what shall I say?&#x02014;admiration?&#x02014;I did not feel <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> whether it was <hi rend="italic">admiration</hi> or <hi rend="italic">love</hi>; but anyhow she expressed herself with an elegance, and eloquence, and real understanding of the subject, that excited my interest in her, and deserved, I thought some answer. So, as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C can never be moved to answer unknown adorers, especially unknown female adorers; one day that I had nothing to do, good or bad, I drove to Camberwell to find the &#x0201C;Maria Price&#x0201D; of the Letter. Heavens and Earth! The address she had given was a Tailor&#x02019;s shop! Not a rich Tailor&#x02019;s &#x02026; but a Tailor represented by one waistcoat and one pair of trowsers, in one small window! For one moment my heart failed me, and I was near driving away <hi rend="italic">re infecta</hi>. Then I said to myself; is not she the <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, not the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> worth seeing, for having had no &#x0201C;advantages&#x0201D; in making herself what she is? So I asked if Miss Maria Price was within, and was shown up the smallest stair ever seen, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> belonging to a hen roost[.] How there came to me a little creature, looking eleven years old, but in reality six and twenty; how she blushed and flashed into sudden beauty, (like one of Balzac&#x02019;s colourless Heroines) at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x02019;s name; How sweetly she looked and spoke, with what modesty and good breeding; how I invited her to Cheyne Row, and how she came, and how Ruskin took her home in his carriage! and how she is turning out the most comfortable proteg&#xE9;e that I ever <hi rend="italic">fell into</hi>. &#x02026; I will tell you &#x02026; when you come.

        <p>JWC included Maria in social gatherings at Cheyne Row and called on her often during her daily carriage rides. Maria Price&#x02019;s recollections provide a record by a bright young woman from outside the Carlyles&#x02019; usual social and intellectual milieu that confirms the impression given by JWC&#x02019;s letters as to how busy socially this last winter and spring were. After JWC died, Saturday <date when="1866-04-21">21 April</date> the news was &#x0201C;gently broken&#x0201D; to Maria the next day by James Aitken, TC&#x02019;s nephew, who had recently met her at a tea party (he also notified the Dilberoglues [see Appendix 258]). The speed and kindness of this shows the extent to which she had taken on an important role in these last months in the Carlyle household. Maria Price continued to see TC before and after her marriage and retained her admiration for him and his works. But it was JWC that she called the &#x0201C;sun of my little world&#x0201D; (Price, &#x0201C;Recollections&#x0201D; 35).</p>
        <p>TC&#x02019;s and JWC&#x02019;s activities in her last three weeks can be quickly summarized. For his rectorial address, TC stayed in as private a space as he could find in Edinburgh, the back bedroom of Thomas Erskine&#x02019;s house. TC was f&#202;ted in Edinburgh, about which he wrote to JWC, <date when="1866-04-04">4 April</date>: &#x0201C;am like a man <pb id="pg-43-xvi" n="43:xvi" />killed with kindness;&#x02014;ah me, all the world coming tumbling on &#x02018;Do me this, see me that; above all, dine, dine!&#x02019;&#x02014;Two days of it still remain to me; <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, Friday or at latest Saturday, I am <hi rend="italic">off to Scotsbrig</hi>; there to cool down, and be silent, dumb as stones.&#x0201D; At Scotsbrig he proofread the account of his rectorial address for its official publication (an unauthorized pamphlet was also soon to circulate). A sprained ankle slowed him down. JWC stayed with Margaret Oliphant at Windsor, <date when="1866-04-06">6</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-04-08">8 April</date>. Oliphant wrote later about this visit, reminding us of the forensic skill in storytelling and gossip that JWC possessed: &#x0201C;[She was] looking very feeble and picturesque, and as amusing as ever, and naturally has been taking away everybody&#x02019;s character, or perhaps I ought to say throwing light upon the domestic relations of the distinguished people of the period&#x0201D; (Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography and Letters</hi> 209); for a supreme example of gossip relayed by JWC, see the &#x0201C;London Scandal&#x0201D; relayed to Mary Russell (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18660126-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1866-01-26">26 Jan. 1866</date>]</ref>). On her return to Chelsea, she visited Lady William Russell, <date when="1866-04-08">8 April</date>, and had Maria Price, Count von Reichenbach, and James Aitken to a tea party in Cheyne Row, <date when="1866-04-09">9 April</date>. She sent TC a copy of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> with its cartoon of TC and John Bright, &#x0201C;Wisdom and Wind-bag.&#x0201D; TC wrote JWC the last letter she was to read from him, <date when="1866-04-19">19 April</date>, announcing he would go to Dumfries to stay with Jean Aitken, before leaving for London, Monday <date when="1866-04-23">23 April</date>. JWC drove to Richmond with Sarah Dilberoglue, Thursday <date when="1866-04-19">19 April</date> to see Margaret Welsh (on whose head a heavy wooden shutter had fallen); she called on Maria Price during her Friday <date when="1866-04-20">20 April</date> drive to show her the <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> cartoon. TC&#x02019;s letter of <date when="1866-04-20">20 April</date> to JWC arrived after her death. In her last letter to TC, Saturday <date when="1866-04-21">21 April</date> JWC wrote about her planned party for that evening, which was to include Margaret Oliphant, Geraldine Jewsbury, the Froudes, Professor Tulloch, Jane Tulloch, the Tullochs&#x02019; two daughters, Charlotte Williams Wynn, and the Spottiswoodes; she also planned a tea-party for James Aitken to meet the Dilberoglues on Sunday <date when="1866-04-22">22 April</date> (see Appendix 258). She went for lunch with the Forsters and was then driven around her usual route, jumping out at Victoria Gate to retrieve her little dog Tiny (inherited from Clara Chapman) whose paw had been run over by a passing carriage; she died in the carriage sometime during several turns around Hyde Park, and her body was taken to St. George&#x02019;s Hospital, near Hyde Park Corner. There is no possibility of knowing exactly from what JWC died as Forster organized (in the belief that it was essential for TC&#x02019;s well-being) the avoidance of a postmortem, customary after a sudden death. Jewsbury&#x02019;s reporting (see above) that JWC connected the pain in her back with something her mother suffered from and that &#x0201C;some day it would <hi rend="italic">kill</hi> her&#x0201D; seems to confirm it was probably a stroke, Grace Welsh having died in <date when="1842">1842</date> of a stroke (<hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 14:27&#x02013;28). John A. Carlyle wrote that it was from &#x0201C;disease of the brain or spine,&#x0201D; but Sarah Dilberoglue reported that &#x0201C;we all believe it was an apoplexy&#x0201D; (Appendix 255 and 258). JWC had last consulted <pb id="pg-43-xvii" n="43:xvii" />Dr. Richard Quain early <date when="1865-06">June 1865</date> and he was able to provide the certificate (noting the cause of death as &#x0201C;paralysis&#x0201D;) that prevented a postmortem. Her body was taken home to Cheyne Row to await TC&#x02019;s arrival, Monday <date when="1866-04-23">23 April</date>; she was then transported north to Haddington, Wednesday <date when="1866-04-25">25 April</date> with TC, Forster, and John A. Carlyle in attendance, to be buried beside her father in St. Mary&#x02019;s Church choir, Thursday <date when="1866-04-26">26 April</date>.</p>
        <p>JWC&#x02019;s death was most crushing for TC. But the shock of her sudden death was also palpable in the Carlyles&#x02019; social circles. Their friends wrote regretfully to each other as well as to TC, and we have included many of these comments in the footnotes or in the Appendix; the latter includes TC&#x02019;s journal entry about JWC&#x02019;s death, Geraldine Jewsbury&#x02019;s letter to TC, <date when="1866-05-26">26 May</date>, describing the events as John Silvester, the coachman, reported them to her, JWC&#x02019;s obituary in the <hi rend="italic">Haddingtonshire Times</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Times&#x02019;s</hi> description of the funeral, and various letters between friends about the death and TC&#x02019;s subsequent condition. TC himself, once he had returned to Cheyne Row after JWC&#x02019;s funeral in Haddington, retreated into silence, writing few letters and receiving hardly any visitors. John A. Carlyle stayed in Cheyne Row with TC: &#x0201C;The Dr seems well &#x26; comfortable; is prompt as possible to do any service to me; but there is not now much in his power&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18660514-TC-JCA-01">

</ref>). Maggie Welsh, JWC&#x02019;s cousin, also looked after TC from late <date when="1866-04">April</date> through early August, supervising the household and, initially, sorting JWC&#x02019;s possessions for disposal. TC wrote to Jean Aitken, mid-May: &#x0201C;Maggie Welsh &#x26; he [John A. Carlyle] keep the House from being so ghastly to me, as in its emptiness it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> otherwise be. Maggie is an active orderly polite creature, with a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> truth of sympathy in my sorrow,&#x02014;and will go at any moment, or stay longer, as I like. Everything is <hi rend="italic">catalogued</hi>, and arranged (I believe), in the House; but I have not yet had the heart to take it any way in hand&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18660514-TC-JCA-02">

</ref>). This was the background to TC&#x02019;s own reminiscences of JWC that he began in the notebook of &#x0201C;stories told by herself,&#x0201D; as Geraldine Jewsbury described them (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 65), sent to TC, <date when="1866-05-20">20 May</date> (MS: NLS 532). TC was stimulated into writing by his disagreement with them. He apparently did not discuss this self-imposed task with John A. Carlyle, as the latter, in a letter to their brother Alick, <date when="1866-07-04">4 July</date>, commented on TC&#x02019;s preoccupation: &#x0201C;He has written as few letters as possible since <date when="1866-04">April</date>, leaving most of them that were absolutely necessary to Miss Welsh and me; but every forenoon he occupies himself some hours with writing that he says nothing of, and reads diligently in the evenings&#x0201D; (Marrs 755). It is in this same letter to Alick that John expressed his somewhat limited appreciation of JWC, indicating that JWC&#x02019;s dislike of him was returned: &#x0201C;The loss of her of course was a very heavy calamity to him (though none of the rest of us except Mary ever got on well with her); for they were much attached to each other, and she always kept every thing in order most dexterously and faithfully for him, and with all her vehemenius <pb id="pg-43-xviii" n="43:xviii" />[vehemence] of temper was really a most true-hearted and excellent woman&#x0201D; (Marrs 754).</p>
        <p>TC interspersed his reminiscences of JWC with dated comments on his feelings and noting visitors to Cheyne Row; these have led commentators to interpret these reminiscences as being centered more on himself than her, foregrounding his own grief rather than her life. But reading them now in the context of TC&#x02019;s circumstances immediately after JWC&#x02019;s death, these interjections read more like a record of a life being lived as he wrote his memorial to JWC&#x02019;s life, giving them the feel of a man struggling with grief and loss of purpose, rather than any attempt at self-centered self-justification. As he wrote so few letters in the months of <date when="1866-05">May</date> and <date when="1866-06">June</date>, the first two months of his writing of the reminiscences, we have inserted these dated entries into the notes to give as full a record as possible of how he was feeling day by day and who was visiting him. The final month of his writing JWC&#x02019;s reminiscences, ending <date when="1866-07-31">31 July 1866</date>, will introduce volume 44. During these weeks after JWC&#x02019;s death, Maggie continued to organize the sorting and disposal of JWC&#x02019;s belongings, but she probably also gathered JWC&#x02019;s letters to TC. TC mentioned, <date when="1866-07-05">5 July</date>: &#x0201C;Her <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> must be got sorted up and (approximately) dated and put in order,&#x0201D; as though they had already been brought together. By <date when="1866-07-08">8 July</date>, he noted that the &#x0201C;collection of all her Letters now discoverable (by Maggie Welsh and me)&#x0201D; was nearly complete (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 158, 160). TC wrote in acknowledgment of Maggie&#x02019;s help just before she left in <date when="1866-08">August</date>; he also described to Lady Ashburton his own tasks of the preceding months:</p>
        <q>Miss Welsh &#x02026; is really a well-bred, correct, attentive &#x26; honourable creature &#x02026; always cheerful, punctual &#x26; helpful. Has done me a great deal of good in searching thro&#x02019; the affairs of the Past. I have been at that, day after day, all summer; at all hours, in a sacred, sad &#x26; quasi-religious kind of company with Her who has left me forever: this has been the far best solace I have had; and with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, I have preferred to be left alone when permitted.

</ref>; vol. 44)</q>
        <p>At least part of the work that remained for TC became the collecting and editing of JWC&#x02019;s letters for publication after his death, and this was the task he was to undertake over the next years. He wrote later about JWC&#x02019;s last letter to him as he ended the self-imposed task:</p>
        <q>The last words her hand ever wrote. Why should I tear my heart by reading them so often? They reached me at Dumfries, Sunday, <date when="1866-04-22">April 22</date>, fifteen hours after the fatal telegram had come. &#x02026; I am at Addiscombe &#x02026; day and house altogether silent, Thursday <date when="1869-08-05">August 5, 1869</date>. while I <pb id="pg-43-xix" n="43:xix" />finish this unspeakable revisal (reperusal and study of all her letters left to me). Task of about eleven months, and sad and strange as a pilgrimage through Hades.&#x02014;T.C. (TC&#x02019;s note to <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660421-JWC-TC-01">

        <p>The roots of all the controversies that raged after TC&#x02019;s death, <date when="1881-02">February 1881</date>, over Froude&#x02019;s publication of TC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (<date when="1881">1881</date>), JWC&#x02019;s letters (<date when="1883">1883</date>), and his life of TC (<date when="1882">1882</date>, <date when="1884">1884</date>), lie within these weeks of work by TC after JWC&#x02019;s death. But what also came from this work was the recognition of JWC&#x02019;s talents as a writer. In her own life she was noted for wit, sarcasm, and comic narratives; but the collecting, then publishing of her letters, placing them in the public domain, led to recognition of her position as one of the supreme nineteenth-century letter writers and provided the basis for the twentieth- and twenty-first-century publication of her complete letters as part of the Duke-Edinburgh edition of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi>. In his introduction to its first volume, Richard Sanders, originator of this edition, acknowledged both JWC&#x02019;s talents and TC&#x02019;s recognition of them: &#x0201C;Carlyle may be heavy-handed at times in his books and at times even in his letters, but he sensed and fully appreciated the qualities in Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x02019;s letters which were not only most compatible with her own unique genius but which indicate that she had much in common with the other great letter writers of literature&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 1:xviii). This volume completing the main publication of her letters now allows for the widest consideration of these talents.</p>
        <p>JWC&#x02019;s attitudes were resolutely un- or antisentimental, while TC, after her death, fell at times into an unrealistic and somewhat sentimentalized picture of her. As an antidote to any temptation to sentimentalize JWC, it seems appropriate to include reference to the Eyre controversy. This became one of TC&#x02019;s preoccupations after <date when="1866-08">August 1866</date> (see vol. 44) when his involvement in the Eyre Defence Committee undermined his public reputation both at the time and later. But the events began in <date when="1865-10">October 1865</date> with the riots in Jamaica, Governor Eyre&#x02019;s declaration of martial law, and executions. TC commented then: &#x0201C;What a shriekery is rising ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the &#x02018;Jamaica Massacre,&#x02019;&#x02014;from a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> throats, I can remark, but of choicest folly&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18651202-TC-LL-01">

</ref>. But JWC reminds us in one of her late letters to TC that she could be as intemperate in her holding of unpleasant opinions as TC, when provoked by liberal expressions of support for the opposing view: &#x0201C;He [Abraham Hayward] told me <hi rend="italic">women</hi> might patronize Eyre&#x02014;that women were naturally cruel, and rather <hi rend="italic">liked</hi> to look <hi rend="italic">on while horrors</hi> were perpetrated. But no <sCap>man</sCap> living could stand up for Eyre <hi rend="italic">now</hi>! &#x02018;I hope M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle does, I said, I haven&#x02019;t had an opportunity of asking him, but I should be surprised and grieved if I found <sCap>him</sCap> sentimentalizing over a pack of black brutes&#x02019;!&#x0201D; But, ensuring that TC <pb id="pg-43-xx" n="43:xx" />would hear a joke against himself, she included Hayward&#x02019;s riposte that TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;great aim and philosophy of Life&#x0201D; was &#x0201C;&#x02018;<hi rend="italic">the smallest happiness of the fewest number</hi>&#x02019;!&#x0201D; (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18660410-JWC-TC-01">

TC replied to this with a comment that epitomizes his own extremism in this area: &#x0201C;Nay (<hi rend="italic">privately very</hi>!) if Eyre had shot the whole Nigger populat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, &#x26; flung them into the sea, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it probably have been much harm even to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, not to speak of <hi rend="italic">us</hi>?

        <p>JWC returned in this last volume of her letters to writing expansively detailed letters, to TC, to particular friends such as Mary Russell, Lady Ashburton, and the young Lady Amberley (previously Kate Stanley). Mostly she was concerned with telling her stories, but on occasion she did comment on her own letter writing, particularly when it provided an elegant excuse for tardiness:</p>
        <q>My actual Birth occurred when postage was at a shilling and there-abouts, and it was a natural consequence that people should make their letters long and deliberate, to be worth the money they would cost. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, one&#x02019;s letter costs a penny and the penny paid by oneself; and the nicest conscience neednt trouble itself how few lines, and how offhand the lines, that go to a letter on the present terms of postage. Your modern Lady-letter may be written at any moment under any distractions! but as I have said, I was born too far back to adopt this free and easy little-note style&#x02014;having been early used to <hi rend="italic">filling</hi> big square sheets when I wrote at all. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>, I put off and put off always for &#x0201C;some reasonably good leisure&#x0201D; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> being a condition rarely vouchsafed me, with one devilry and another; it happens&#x02014;&#x02014;as it has happened in your case, that I often give myself the airs of a Brute, without being brutal the least in the world!

        <p>This provides a commentary on the cultural change of the increasingly efficient provision of postal services and its effect on the writing of long letters, while providing an amusing excuse to Mary Craik by illustrating the way JWC&#x02019;s long letters emerge from her upbringing and times. It is these long letters upon which most of our knowledge of her writing skills rests. In the twentieth- and twenty-first-century, as when they were first published, the range and accomplishment of her epistolary achievements have led to an assumption that she was somehow a &#x0201C;missing novelist,&#x0201D; rather than a supreme letter writer. The root for this assumption may rest with a mischievous comment in one of her letters this winter; after much description (in several <pb id="pg-43-xxi" n="43:xxi" />letters) of her new triumph over the threat to their quiet from neighbor noise, she concluded:</p>
        <q>It would be too long to go into details, enough to say, my negociations with &#x0201C;Next door&#x0201D; ended in an agreement that the Cock should be shut up in a cellar inside the owner&#x02019;s own house&#x02014;from three in the afternoon till ten in the morning! and in return I give the small boy of the house a lesson every morning in his <hi rend="italic">Reading made Easy</hi>!! . &#x02026; It is a house full of <hi rend="italic">Misteries No 6</hi>! I have thoughts of writing a novel about it. (<ref target="volume-43/lt-18651225-JWC-MR-01">

        <p>She clearly repeated this novel-writing trope to Charles Dickens; Forster described their last meeting, <date when="1866-04-03">3 April 1866</date>:</p>
        <q>Among other things she gave Dickens the subject for a novel, from what she had herself observed at the outside of a house in her street &#x02026; and the subtle serious humour of it all, the truth in trifling bits of character, and the gradual progress into a half-romantic interest, had enchanted the skilled novelist. She was well into the second volume of her small romance before she left, being as far as her observation then had taken her; but in a few days exciting incidents were expected, the denouement could not be far off, and Dickens was to have it when they met again. (Forster, <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> [<date when="1874">1874</date>] 3:277)</q>
        <p>Thus was laid out the possibility of constructing JWC as a novelist. But this is to distract from her real talents as an exceptional letter writer with a talent for comedy. Her comic timing was often best aimed at TC, so it seems appropriate to end this introduction to her final volume of letters with one of her last jokes at TC&#x02019;s expense. TC was still in Edinburgh, and Tyndall had called on JWC to tell her about the installation; <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660410-JWC-TC-01">

          </hi>. TC writes to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1865-10-04">4</date>) of his and JWC&#x02019;s anxiety about her coach accident in the Alps, late Sept. JWC and Geraldine Jewsbury visit Queen Emma of the Sandwich Islands; she has read some of TC&#x02019;s works. TC acknowledges arrival of a barrel of provisions from Scotsbrig (<date when="1865-10-10">10</date>). JWC visits Maria Price in Camberwell, and invites her to Cheyne Row where she takes tea with the Carlyles and John Ruskin. JWC cautiously welcomes Jessie Hiddleston from Thornhill as a servant, and Sarah Warren is an efficient housekeeper, but the two servants do not get on well. TC is becoming hypersensitive to railway whistles. JWC is at a loss to find a doctor to replace Dr. Herbert Barnes who d. late <date when="1865-09">Sept.</date> She writes affectionately to Betty Braid in Edinburgh and refers to her cousin Jackie Welsh&#x02019;s estate (<date when="1865-10-27">27</date>).

JWC sees Lord and Lady Russell at Henry Taylor&#x02019;s &#x0201C;the other day&#x0201D; and is visited by Caroline Davenport Bromley &#x0201C;till eleven at night&#x0201D; (<date when="1865-11-07">7</date>); Col. Stanley takes TC for a tour of the London slums (<date when="1865-11-07">7</date>), and JWC goes to see Chang the giant (for the second time) with Miss Bromley (<date when="1865-11-08">8</date>). TC, &#x0201C;idle as possible&#x0201D; is reading widely including Richter and Plutarch. Froude tells him of Gladstone&#x02019;s completion of his term as rector of Edinburgh Univ. (<date when="1865-11-06">6</date>); TC tells John A. Carlyle he has agreed, reluctantly, to accept the rectorship (<date when="1865-11-07">7</date>); John Stuart Blackie writes telling TC his majority is 347 (<date when="1865-11-11">11</date>), and TC replies (<date when="1865-11-13">13</date>) asking for help and advice. TC formally accepts the office (<date when="1865-11-14">14</date>) and asks David Laing (<date when="1865-11-16">16</date> [<date when="1865-11-15">15</date>]) to be his assessor on the University Court. Many letters arrive congratulating him, including one from his early friend Thomas Murray (<date when="1865-11-17">17</date>). Laing accepts ([<date when="1865-11">20</date>]), and the formal address is discussed; eventually TC decides on giving it in <date when="1866-04">April 1866</date> (<date when="1865-11-24">24</date>). He declines an immediate invitation to Fryston from Lord Houghton, but hopes he can visit on his way to Edinburgh in <date when="1866-04-23">April (23)</date>. TC and JWC attend a dinner at the Pollocks (<date when="1865-11-24">24</date>). JWC has to devise methods for deadening outdoor sounds while still admitting fresh air to 5 Cheyne Row, along with suppression of poultry noises from new neighbors next door (<date when="1865-11-28">28</date>). While her horse, Bellona, is in the stables after an accident to her hoof, JWC nervously rides an omnibus with TC, the first time since her accident ([<date when="1865-11-29">29</date>]). TC accepts the formal Senatus invitation from Edinburgh Univ. but holds out for an <date when="1866-04">April</date> inauguration (<date when="1865-11-29">29</date>). TC acknowledges gift of A. H.

          </hi>. TC thanks Lady Lothian for the gift of a wild turkey, sent from their estate at Blickling Hall, Norfolk (<date when="1865-12-02">2</date>). He mentions for the first time the insurrection in Jamaica in <date when="1865-10">Oct.</date> and Governor Eyre&#x02019;s response (<date when="1865-12-02">2</date>). Tennyson visits Chelsea (<date when="1865-12-03">3</date>). TC and JWC spend an evening at the Forsters&#x02019; to celebrate TC&#x02019;s 70th birthday (<date when="1865-12-04">4</date>) with Robert Browning. Maria Price, invited (<date when="1865-12-03">3</date>) to visit JWC (<date when="1865-12-06">6</date>), also sees TC on his return from seeing Chang the giant with Tyndall and another friend. The Carlyles dine at the Froudes&#x02019;, along with the Milmans and the Brookfields (<date when="1865-12-08">8</date>). JWC sleeps poorly: &#x0201C;Thick skinned people haven&#x02019;t a conception of what we thin-skinned individuals have to endure!&#x0201D; ([<date when="1865-12-10">10</date>]). She writes affectionately to Lady Ashburton, regretting that she is to stay abroad for the winter ([ca. <date when="1865-12-12">12</date>]). JWC acknowledges receipt of a hamper (including eggs and whisky) from the Russells at Holmhill, Thornhill ([<date when="1865-12-16">16</date>]). TC mentions interest in buying a house in Jean Aitken&#x02019;s neighborhood &#x0201C;even at this late date&#x0201D; (<date when="1865-12-16">16</date>). Ruskin calls at Cheyne Row (<date when="1865-12-16">16</date>); TC praises Ruskin&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Ethics of the Dust</hi> as &#x0201C;a most shining performance&#x0201D; (<date when="1865-12-20">20</date>). Seasonal gifts from Jean Aitken arrive (<date when="1865-12-24">24</date>), including a cape and whisky, and TC writes James Carlyle Jr. to praise the changes he has made at Craigenputtoch (<date when="1865-12-25">25</date>). The Carlyles go to Christmas day dinner with the Forsters (<date when="1865-12-25">25</date>). JWC writes affectionately to Charlotte Southam (<date when="1865-12-26">26</date>) and to Betty Braid, telling Betty she has a cold and about her cousin Robert Welsh dying (in Liverpool) of tuberculosis, like his sisters before him (<date when="1865-12-28">28</date>). JWC sends money for old servants and acquaintances for Mary Russell to disburse ([<date when="1865-12-30">30</date>]).</p>

TC writes to his brother John that he is improving in both health and mobility; the maids now sleep in the old attic study, from which the books have been moved to his working room downstairs. He sees Anthony Sterling. JWC, though suffering from a cold, manages still to make visits (<date when="1866-01-01">1</date>). A week later TC is complaining of lack of sleep, &#x0201C;nerves shivery&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;spots &#x02026; a kind of red eruption&#x0201D; on his side (<date when="1866-01-09">9</date>). JWC writes Geraldine Jewsbury (&#x0201C;my dear young Woman!&#x0201D;) telling her she misses her ([<date when="1866-01-12">12</date>]); she also misses Lady Ashburton and Miss Bromley, both away from London (<date when="1866-01-16">16</date>). Weather is bad; TC tells John A. Carlyle he is feeling &#x0201C;weak, languid, ineffectual&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-01-22">22</date> [<date when="1866-01-24">24</date>]). To her aunt Grace Welsh, JWC dismisses as ridiculous the idea that she and TC would move to Edinburgh on his being made rector (<date when="1866-01-23">23</date>).</p>

          <hi rend="italic">

          </hi>. TC thanks David Laing for his preparatory work in Edinburgh for the rectorial address (<date when="1866-02-14">14</date>). He resumes his old dream of a quiet Scottish retreat if his relatives could find him one, asking Jean Aitken to &#x0201C;take a little peep&#x0201D; at an old cottage, for himself or brother John (<date when="1866-02-21">21</date>).</p>

She has decided not to accompany TC to Edinburgh (<date when="1866-03-02">2</date>); she tells Henry Inglis (<date when="1866-03-03">3</date>) that TC is putting off all the arrangements as long as he can. <pb id="pg-43-xxxv" n="43:xxxv" />He accepts Lord Houghton&#x02019;s invitation to visit Fryston on his way to Scotland (<date when="1866-03-10">10</date>). He writes to John Stuart Mill (<date when="1866-03-13">13</date>) in friendly terms. JWC writes David Aitken (<date when="1866-03-15">15</date>) to decline an invitation for them both to stay with the Aitkens, while TC writes Laing (<date when="1866-03-15">15</date>) to fix <date when="1866-04-02">2 April</date> as the date of his address. Tiny, Clara Chapman&#x02019;s dog, joins the Carlyle household; Jane tells Lady Airlie ([<date when="1866-03-16">16</date>]): &#x0201C;my little dog is turning out all that could be wished.&#x0201D; JWC invites herself to visit Margaret Oliphant during TC&#x02019;s absence ([<date when="1866-03-17">17</date>]). She sends her Edinburgh aunts tickets for TC&#x02019;s address ([<date when="1866-03-26">26</date>]), while TC addresses handwritten tickets of admission to various friends. TC is to stay with Thomas Erskine in Edinburgh, and JWC writes (<date when="1866-03-28">28</date>) to Erskine to arrange for TC to see Betty Braid. TC leaves for Fryston (<date when="1866-03-28">28</date>), and Maggie Welsh arrives to stay in Chelsea for a few days; James Aitken is also staying, while looking for lodgings. TC, after a fractious start, seems to enjoy his time in Fryston with Lord Houghton and John Tyndall.</p>

TC in Edinburgh is feeling less nervous about the address (<date when="1866-04-01">1</date>), while JWC in London feels &#x0201C;if you had been to be <hi rend="italic">hanged</hi>, I don&#x02019;t see that I could have taken it more to heart!&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-04-02">2</date>). Tyndall wires that the address is &#x0201C;a perfect triumph&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-04-02">2</date>); JWC, Dickens, and others celebrate at John Forster&#x02019;s birthday party (<date when="1866-04-02">2</date>); TC has to endure various dinners, including the Senatus dinner (<date when="1866-04-03">3</date>), Erskine&#x02019;s (<date when="1866-04-04">4</date>), and Masson&#x02019;s (<date when="1866-04-05">5</date>). Maggie returns to Liverpool ([<date when="1866-04-03">3</date>]). JWC writes to TC: &#x0201C;I wish you had been coming straight back&#x02014;for it would be so quiet for you here <hi rend="italic">just now</hi>&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-04-04">4</date>), while TC writes: &#x0201C;two days of it still remain to me &#x02026; at latest Saturday, I am <hi rend="italic">off to Scotsbrig</hi>; there to cool down, and be silent, dumb as stones&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-04-04">4</date>). He reaches Scotsbrig (<date when="1866-04-07">7</date>) and begins to proofread (<date when="1866-04-08">8</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-04-15">15</date>) the account of his rectorial address for publication. He sprains his ankle (<date when="1866-04-09">9</date>), which slows him down. JWC stays with Margaret Oliphant at Windsor (<date when="1866-04-06">6</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-04-08">8</date>). On her return, she visits Lady William Russell (<date when="1866-04-08">8</date>); she has Maria Price, Count Reichenbach, and James Aitken to a tea party in Cheyne Row (<date when="1866-04-09">9</date>). She sends TC a copy of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> ([<date when="1866-04-11">11</date>]) with a cartoon of him and John Bright, &#x0201C;Wisdom and Wind-bag.&#x0201D; TC can walk again with care (<date when="1866-04-15">15</date>), and enjoys Scotsbrig&#x02019;s calm and good food. JWC writes affectionately to Lady Ashburton (<date when="1866-04-15">15</date>), and reports on her busy social life. TC&#x02019;s sister Jean Aitken arrives in Scotsbrig (<date when="1866-04-16">16</date>), and Mary Austin returns to The Gill. TC writes to thank Thomas Erskine for his hospitality (<date when="1866-04-17">17</date>), and sends both JWC and John A. Carlyle copies of the published rectorial address; as soon as his ankle allows, he is for &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi> &#x26; home!&#x0201D; (<date when="1866-04-17">17</date>). JWC calls on Tyndall (<date when="1866-04-16">16</date>) to hear his account of the rectorial address. TC writes JWC (<date when="1866-04-19">19</date>) the last letter she was to read from him; he announces he will go to Dumfries (<date when="1866-04-20">20</date>) to stay with Jean Aitken, before leaving for London. JWC drives to Richmond with Sarah Dilberoglue to see Margaret Welsh (<date when="1866-04-19">19</date>), a day earlier than planned, as she has had &#x0201C;an ugly accident&#x0201D; (a shutter fell on her head). During her drive (<date when="1866-04-20">20</date>), <pb id="pg-43-xxxvi" n="43:xxxvi" />JWC calls on Maria Price to show her the <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> cartoon of TC. JWC also saw both Jewsbury and Erasmus Darwin during Friday (<date when="1866-04-20">20</date>), probably in the evening; Darwin found her &#x0201C;extra well.&#x0201D; TC&#x02019;s last letter to JWC (<date when="1866-04-20">20</date>) arrives after her death. In her last letter to TC (<date when="1866-04-21">21</date>), JWC writes about her planned party for that evening, comprising Margaret Oliphant, Geraldine Jewsbury, James and Henrietta Froude, John and Jane Tulloch and their daughters Sarah and Isabella, William and Eliza Spottiswoode, and Charlotte Williams Wynn. She goes for lunch with the Forsters and is then driven around Hyde Park, jumping out at Victoria Gate to retrieve the dog, Tiny, who had been hurt by a passing carriage; she dies in the carriage, and her body is taken to the nearby St. George&#x02019;s Hospital (<date when="1866-04-21">21</date>). TC writes Forster (<date when="1866-04-22">22</date>) from Dumfries that he and his brother John will arrive in London the following day and asks him to make arrangements for JWC&#x02019;s funeral, <date when="1866-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x0201C;Do this for me, dear F,&#x02014;and for her.&#x0201D; He also writes to William Dods, asking him to make the necessary arrangements in Haddington. Maggie Welsh comes to London to help TC. TC, John A. Carlyle, Forster, and Edward Twisleton travel to Haddington where JWC is buried next to her father within the walls of the unroofed choir of St. Mary&#x02019;s Church (<date when="1866-04-26">26</date>). TC travels home overnight (<date when="1866-04-26">26</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-04-27">27</date>); Emilie Venturi calls on him shortly after.</p>

TC replies personally to messages of condolence from Lady Augusta Stanley on Queen Victoria&#x02019;s behalf (<date when="1866-05-01">1</date>), Erskine (<date when="1866-05-01">1</date>), Betty Braid (<date when="1866-05-02">2</date>), Ruskin (<date when="1866-05-10">10</date>), and Lady Ashburton (<date when="1866-05-20">20</date>), while between them John A. Carlyle and Maggie Welsh write to others. Henry Taylor, Arthur and Laura Russell call, and Forster comes to take TC for a walk (<date when="1866-05-13">13</date>). Froude and Emilie Venturi call (<date when="1866-05-15">15</date>). TC writes to Geraldine Jewsbury commenting on her notebook of JWC&#x02019;s anecdotes (<date when="1866-05-22">22</date>).

She replied, <date when="1865-10-07">7 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">I shd</hi> have got dear Emilia Bunsen to have written to you from Aosta but I didn&#x02019;t want to make you both needlessly anxious &#x26; rather hoped you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hear nothing of the accident till I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell you I was all right. We went to look at the place by daylight where the accident happened&#x02014; only wondered that we hadn&#x02019;t been killed on the spot. It was on the slope of a steep hill into a deep ditch &#x26; against a wall that the carriage upset.&#x0201D; Aosta, Italian city, apparently about 8 mi. (13 km.) from the scene of the accident.</note>&#x02014;such one figures them, ignorant otherwise of the exact localities and circumstances. It is a miserable adventure; &#x26; has raised among us, as you may image, no end of speculat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> and alarming considerat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>,&#x02014;especially of anxieties to know how how<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Word repeated.</note> you are going on after it. I in vain suggest to my poor Wife that it might have been far worse; she dwells upon the fact that it is itself <hi rend="italic">far too bad</hi>, thinks &#x0201C;all the <hi rend="italic">neuralgia</hi> will settle on that hurt shoulder,&#x0201D; and dares not wholly believe the favourable acc<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> there since are;&#x02014;in short, dear Wounded One, you perceive we are in great perplexity ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you; and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than now afford to be left in the dark as well! And it is principally in the hope of getting some authentic word, if not from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own hand (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, alas, is probably impossible), at least from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own honest self,&#x02014;who are earnestly petitioned hereby to tell us the exact <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>, no better and no worse than it actually is,&#x02014;that I now write. My own greatest anxiety is, to know whether that shoulder is completely <hi rend="italic">well set</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you will now be able to judge of); whether y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Italian Surgeon altogether knew his bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>? I persuade myself there w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be much complexity in the Operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>: but great trouble, pain &#x26; damage are often enough incurred by a mistake in that preliminary point.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton replied: &#x0201C;altho the Italian doctor assured that the arm was set &#x26; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> soon be quite well&#x02014;his words proved false as I have had to have it set again &#x26; it is now tightly tied up &#x26; it will be some days before I know whether this performance has been any better than the other. If, as I hope, it turns out well done, the first use of my right arm shall be to write to you. I need scarcely say how much I value y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind words &#x26; quite feel with you how thankful I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be that it is only the shoulder &#x26; still more that my dearest little child was not with me.

          <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
          <p>Your last Note was peculiarly welcome to me, and did me good in more than one way. It is longer than y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letters usually are, lets one into some of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> feelings, thus awakening ones kindly sympathies, and interesting one in a wholesome human manner. Such a thing was very welcome to me at the moment!</p>
          <p>For above a week past, I have been in deadly quarrel with the <hi rend="italic">railway whistles</hi> hereabouts; sometimes had no right sleep at all,&#x02014;only a 4, 3 or 2 hours of broken d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>; in such sad, shivering and ghastly humour as that always brings with it thro&#x02019; the day too;&#x02014;and, in fact, till <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night when I had an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> real &#x26; healthy sleep, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be said, with all my industries, to have seen my way to speedy <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> in the bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>. It is a most unfortunate &#x0201C;quarrel,&#x0201D; and a most unexpected. The railways are exactly what they were when I left them in May; but at that time I heed them no more than the wind; nor for a month after my return did I notice them with the least criticism; and yet, on slight cause, since 10 days ago it has come to this! One cannot <hi rend="italic">escape</hi> from railways; all over habitable England &#x26; Scotland that Scream extends its fitful dissonances, making night hideous if you have disordered nerves: it has given me many reflex<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, perhaps monitions and lessons that may be useful, <pb id="pg-43-9" n="43:9" />during this last week of battle. Enough of it at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>. I have hung up an ingenious <hi rend="italic">curtain</hi> (and have more in reserve if necessary); I believe I shall have to introduce a <hi rend="italic">ventilator</hi> going <hi rend="italic">top</hi>way, ample &#x26; effectual like that at Dumfries;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650525-TC-JWC-01">

I came to this resolution the more easily, as none of her rooms (except the upstairs ones which you know &#x26; which would not do at all for the winter) are other than strange to me, &#x26; I don&#x02019;t know how I should be able to train myself to them. The old ones in Hanover Street had become tolerable to me only by long usage, &#x26; my stay in them was frequently dreary enough. If I find Dumfries wearisome in the winter I can leave it whenever I may think fit; &#x26; meanwhile I have books about me &#x26; make plenty of work for myself.&#x0201D; Miss Orrock was probably Agnes, the older sister; John had lodged with Agnes and Elizabeth Orrock in Edinburgh for many years.

With M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren she seems to <hi rend="italic">fight</hi> less than at first; but still they are by no means cordial. I kept them under silent but watchful observations for a while, to find out where the fault lay; and so far as I could discover, Jessey&#x02019;s passionateness, and <hi rend="small-caps">suspiciousness</hi>, and quarrelsomeness<pb id="pg-43-15" n="43:15" />

                              was chiefly in fault. The Proverb says; &#x0201C;where two quarrel the right is with him who <hi rend="italic">says least</hi>.&#x0201D; By this rule; the right is with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren, who has never spoken of Jessey at all beyond <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, asking me, &#x0201C;if the friends from whom I had got Jessey had not told me what a dreadful temper she had. I said, several people had spoken of her temper being sharp. &#x0201C;Oh well! that&#x02019;s all right, she said, but I thought it strange, if taking her among your own people none of them should have told you <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x0201D;&#x02014;and then she spoke of something else. Whereas Jessey is never weary of complaining of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren, and saying things of her which I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">untrue</hi>. &#x0201C;Im a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> servant! I have had plenty of experience! I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> my work&#x02014;better than M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren can tell me! and I&#x02019;ll <hi rend="italic">not</hi> let <hi rend="italic">her</hi> take any authority over <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! <hi rend="italic">One</hi> Mistress is plenty! And if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren pretended to be <hi rend="small-caps">my</hi> Mistress I wouldn&#x02019;t stay!&#x0201D;&#x02014; That is the style!&#x02014; To <hi rend="italic">me</hi> she puts a certain restraint on her tempers, feels, I believe, that <hi rend="italic">it is better</hi>. But it worrys me a good deal, to think it is not because I am kind to her and because she <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> me in return, that she behaves with tolerable respectfulness to me; but merely because she knows and feels that I should <hi rend="italic">tolerate</hi> no incivility! I thought her so <hi rend="italic">loveable</hi> looking! and could have, for her looks sake and other sakes have liked her dearly! but there is that about her that perpetually warns me, (as you did) &#x0201C;not to make too much of Jessey.&#x0201D; Please <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing of this&#x02014;and dont leave my letter <hi rend="italic">about</hi>.

These points once settled, you will be on a firm basis. I am of course anxious enough for a right decis<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to you; but, alas, can give you little or no assistance. One thing I write to day ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to repeat <hi rend="italic">to y</hi>r<hi rend="italic">self</hi>, as it may be of some small weight in the matter: namely, that Craigenp<hi rend="italic">k</hi> shall be at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> refusal, if you like; and certainly no tenant shall be preferred to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> at a given rent wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I can reckon fair!

 I think he suggested) sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be got to name a probable rent for the place, and that then we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> advertise. You will believe I do not want more than a just rent from anybody whatever; least of all from you or yours! And, I find, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perhaps satisfy me best, if in this, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> transact<hi rend="italic">n</hi> I can expect to have ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> poor Puttock, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> happen to leave it comfortably in the hands of one of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Boys.

For one moment my heart failed me, and I was near driving <pb id="pg-43-28" n="43:28" />away <hi rend="italic">re infecta</hi> [with the business unfinished]. Then I said to myself; is not she the <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, not the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> worth seeing, for having had no &#x0201C;advantages&#x0201D; in making herself what she is? So I asked if Miss Maria Price was within, and was shown up the smallest stair ever seen, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> belonging to a hen roost How there came to me a little creature, looking eleven years old, but in reality six and twenty; how she blushed and flashed into sudden beauty, (like one of Balzac&#x02019;s<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss">Honor&#xE9; de Balzac (<date when="1799">1799</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), French novelist and playwright.</note> colourless Heroines) at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x02019;s name; How sweetly she looked and spoke, with what modesty and good breeding;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss">Maria Price later wrote: &#x0201C;one never-to-be-forgotten day in <date when="1865-10">October 1865</date> (just about six months after my letter), I was told a lady had called to see me, and on entering the room I saw a lady indeed, but a perfect stranger, who told me that she was Mrs Carlyle. Overwhelmed by this announcement I sank into the nearest chair; but the beautiful eyes and kind smile soon reassured me, so that I was quite at my ease&#x0201D; (Price, &#x0201C;Recollections&#x0201D; 31).</note> how I invited her to Cheyne Row, and how she came, and how Ruskin took her home in his carriage!<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss">Price wrote about the visit: &#x0201C;Knowing nothing of Chelsea, in my ignorance of the locality I took a train to Victoria, then walked to Cheyne Row. &#x02026; I saw Mrs Carlyle on a sofa at the farther end, who started up with both hands outstretched in welcome. &#x02026; Not long after this Mr Ruskin was announced, and we were all three soon engaged in animated conversation. &#x02026; At last Mr Carlyle came in, erect and tall.&#x0201D; Price sat between TC and JWC at tea, and John Ruskin sat opposite: &#x0201C;Of the conversation I took no notes, but I remember that we talked of many things&#x02014;of John Sterling, of Edward Irving, of Mrs Oliphant&#x02019;s Life of the latter, and Mrs Carlyle&#x02019;s own early days.&#x0201D; TC gave Price (signing each vol. for her) a 2-vol. copy of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>; Ruskin gave her a lift home in his carriage; they had a discussion (&#x0201C;I had almost said a dispute&#x0201D;) &#x0201C;as to the relative beauty of sunlight or moonlight &#x02026; but Mr Ruskin&#x02019;s amused sense of the unsuitability of &#x02018;Wilhelm Meister&#x02019; to a girl was still uppermost&#x0201D; (Price, &#x0201C;Recollections&#x0201D; 32&#x02013;33). In about a fortnight, JWC called on Price in her carriage (with one of the Reichenbach das.) and took her for a drive: &#x0201C;She was full of interest and curiosity as to how Mr Ruskin and I had got on together, teasing me not a little about my having to write a critique on &#x02018;Meister&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Price, &#x0201C;Recollections&#x0201D; 33).</note> and how she is turning out the most comfortable prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;e that I ever <hi rend="italic">fell into</hi>&#x02014;! About all that and much more, I will tell you if you like, when you come&#x02014; In writing it would be too tedious!</p>

But I assured him my Genius wanted nothing of anybody not even a subscription to a Book of Poems! When I asked her had she ever thought of writing a book herself she answered, like the wise little woman she is. &#x0201C;Oh Dear! <hi rend="small-caps">no</hi>!

Excuse me if I suggest that you can select no more satisfactory man than your brother the Doctor.&#x0201D; TC noted beneath this on MS: &#x0201C;my Brother won&#x02019;t go;&#x02014;and is even <hi rend="italic">forbidden</hi> on the face of him by his being <hi rend="italic">my Brother</hi>!&#x0201D; The assessor was chosen by the rector to be his representative on the University Court. John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1865-11-12">12 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;I hardly know what to say about that Rectorship, but on the whole it afflicts me to think that you are pestered with it at all. The duties of it you might perform well enough if it were worth your while to try; but Edinburgh has now become a narrow &#x26; illiterate arena for any one; &#x26; all your habits stand opposed to public speaking &#x26; minute discussions, especially before such men as have to do with Edinburgh University.

You ought to thank God that you live in an age when there is much to speak about; specially in the Educational world. Here, as in the church, we are living too much upon dead traditions. We do not look nature directly in the face. We move in a groove of books. I have a strong faith in you, that you will speak out the word that the time requires. Only in God&#x02019;s name, do not be too violent, or you will ruin all. The stupid world requires a qualification&#x02014;half a dozen sometimes; they do not understand your method of swinging about with a club.&#x0201D; John A. Carlyle agreed, <date when="1865-11-14">14 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;No hurry about Installation. Some speech will be indispensable at the outset, some address to the Students who have chosen you &#x26; to them mainly; &#x26; you will have no difficulty in giving them sound &#x26; good advice. Any extraneous eloquence like Gladstone&#x02019;s would be out of place &#x26; disorderly&#x02014;calculated to do no good at all.&#x0201D;</note> if that be at all feasible?

 that, by vote of the matriculated Students of Edinburgh University, I am appointed Rector: and in reply I will now beg you to make known to those Gentlemen and others concerned that I am very sensible of the great honour done me, that I cheerfully accept the Office, and will to the best of my ability endeavour to discharge the same.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Peter Kelland wrote to Alexander Gibson, chairman of the committee for TC&#x02019;s election, quoting this letter: &#x0201C;20 Clarendon Crescent [printed] &#x2F; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle desires it to be made known to the Electors and others concerned that he is very sensible of the great honour done him, that he cheerfully accepts the office of Rector, and will, to the best of his ability endeavour to discharge the same&#x0201D; (MS: EUL draft; pbd: <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi>, <date when="1865-11-17">17 Nov.</date>).</note>

          <p>The choosing of an Assessor occupies me at this moment;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC had already written to John A. Carlyle discussing the choice of an assessor as John replied, <date when="1865-11-14">14 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;The main thing is to get an Assessor of good quality. I agree with you in thinking it would not do at all to appoint me even if I were much better qualified than I am for the office: such appointment w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> look too like a job at the very outset.&#x0201D; He then discussed various candidates, continuing: &#x0201C;David Laing is all that you say. He has no talent for public speaking, but can write rapidly enough &#x26; sensibly, &#x26; is well liked by many in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, &#x26; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very zealous for improvements of all kinds &#x26; entirely faithful &#x26; loyal. Perhaps you should try him &#x02026; first. I know of no other as well qualified &#x02026; Laing might perhaps suit you best.&#x0201D;</note>
 and I expect, in a few days, to offer you one who will not be unwelcome, nor prove unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p>In regard to the subsequent necessary steps, you will perhaps have the goodness to give me some intimations from time to time. I remain, meanwhile,&#x02014;with the sincerest thanks to my too friendly Electors,&#x02014;</p>

          <salute>Dear Lady Lothian,</salute>
          <p>I was much pleased yesterday morning, on sight of the Cromwell Letters (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> arrived quite safe, tho&#x02019; they had needed to be &#x0201C;sealed in the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Post-Office&#x0201D;); and still better pleased on sight of the more <hi rend="italic">modern Letter</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> testified that you still remembered me with the old kindness.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Lothian wrote, <date when="1865-11-12">12 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;These letters have been ready for you for a long time, but I unfortunately forgot altogether about sending them. They have been copied under the superintendance of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> David Laing, &#x26; may therefore be relied upon for correctness. Lord Lothian has been rejoicing at the decision of his compatriots about the Rectorship &#x26; trusts it may give him an opportunity of seeing you again. We trust that when you do come to Edinburgh you will not risk quarrelling with us, by shunning a visit here&#x02014; The little visit you did pay has been something pleasant to think about. I trust M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is feeling stronger. May I ask to be brought to her recollection.&#x0201D;</note> I had heard of you all, a few days ago, from Mrs Gladstone, whose Husband I had gone to have a few words with on this extraordinary Rector business.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Catherine Gladstone; TC called Sat. <date when="1865-11-11">11 Nov.</date>; Gladstone noted only: &#x0201C;Saw Mr. Carlyle&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Gladstone Diaries</hi>, ed.

 The Lady staid with us not above 3 minutes; but was eloquent upon Lord Lothian&#x02019;s &#x0201C;beauty,&#x0201D; among other qualities; and had nothing at least that was <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> news to tell me of you.</p>
          <p>I cannot well make out hitherto what this Rectorate of mine will amount to,&#x02014;not quite to nothing, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem; but then to what kind of <hi rend="italic">something</hi>? For one thing, I do fear there will be journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> before long, and a certain necessity of opening one&#x02019;s lips more or less, in public; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> in itself, to say nothing of the 800 miles of railway, is abundantly horrible to me!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440625-JWC-TC-01">

          <salute>Dear Laing,</salute>
          <p>You know they have elected me Rector of the University; and that, as the preliminary of all else, I want an Assessor. Contrary to first notions I find that there are real duties, apart from the honorary, connected with this appoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi>; &#x26; that for these, as for all others whatsoever, real qualities will be required,&#x02014;three in particular: perfect integrity, sound judgement, and compatibility on fair terms; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> three, indeed, are everywhere available in this world!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>The first man I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of was you; and after considerable reflexion and comparison, you still appear to me clearly the eligible. If there is any honour in the thing, you are he who have deserved it; you will be welcome to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and your fidelity, in peaceable form but solid as the rocks, to all interests of the University, is a thing we can depend upon.&#x02014; Say only, on considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, &#x0201C;I will,&#x0201D; and the matter is settled.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Laing replied, <date when="1865-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;My Dear Lord Rector &#x2F; I was no less surprised this morning than honoured, to receive your very flattering letter. On referring to the University Calendar, I see that you have the benefit of only one Assessor, and that the duties are such as might well make one hesitate to undertake them, even if an aversion to public notoriety did not exist. It occurred to me moreover, that not being qualified to have my name enrolled as one of the Council, there might be more serious objection to your proposal which might throw me &#x02018;out of Court.&#x02019; &#x2F; As this might apply to others as well as myself, I went down to the College to enquire. It seems however that any one may be appointed excepting the Principal or a Professor in one of our Universities. &#x2F; Now seriously speaking, I would much rather that you should nominate some one else. But if you are inclined to give me the preference, remember&#x02014;I will not engage (much as I may wish it for the sake of harmony) to concur in all the views you may take in matters coming under the special jurisdiction of the University Court.&#x0201D;</note>

 Many thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> friendly feelings to me; flourishing in old age as they did in youth; memorable to me across the wrecks of so many years.</p>
          <p>It is impossible to wish quite deliberately this Elect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> had gone otherwise than it did: but the Office, thus far, does threaten to involve me in infinite small trouble and botherat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x02014;me, who perhaps of all her majesty&#x02019;s subjects most needed &#x26; affected absolute <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> at this point of time. But there is no help just yet. Nay before very long, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> appear, I have a journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ahead, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> &#x26;c&#x26;cof a painful &#x26; most unwelcome complexion:&#x02014;in the course of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one bit of consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> will be that of seeing an old friend&#x02019;s face ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surely will not prove unmanageable.</p>

 or with anybody; you are an independ<hi rend="italic">t seventh part</hi> of The University Court; elected (on such <hi rend="italic">method</hi> as there was) by all Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and all Scotland for that matter, to do what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can for the University, according to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own judgement and conscience. No more hesitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, therefore; I accept y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> conditional consent as a complete one;&#x02014;and write, by this post, to Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kelland, Secret<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of the Senatus, <hi rend="italic">that you are the man</hi>. Well convinced that I might go farther and fare worse!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>Of course if you were madly to refuse after all, you still <hi rend="italic">can</hi>: walk across to Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kelland directly on sight of this, and announce that you will not accept:&#x02014;but I am far from anticipating such a step; and confidently flatter myself that I have got the matter finished; all the more, as this (I recollect) is the last available Post-day of the Week,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC wrote on Friday.</note>
 and I cannot hear even from yourself till Monday morning.</p>
          <p>Supposing this all settled, and no more writing or thinking needed from me on the subject, the next helpful thing you can do is to ascertain for me from the proper sources, When first there is to be, or can be made to be, any real or considerable <hi rend="italic">business</hi> before the University Court?&#x02014;inasmuch as that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the good time for my appearing in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, with some kind of Inaugurat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Speech (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I much abhor, but it seems cannot avoid), after a railway journey of that length (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I <hi rend="italic">ditto d</hi>o)!

I am perfectly worn out with the shovelfuls of empty Letters that have been flying ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me all week; one in ten of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (very unwillingly) I have been compelled to write ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in return.</p>

          <p>      <salute>Dear Laing,</salute>&#x02014;I am much satisfied to have you as Assessor; and believe that I have managed this, the first and probably the most import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> part of my Office, in a way that will be satisfactory to the Public as it is to myself. It is not to be expected my own Official activity, at a distance of 400 miles, in such a state of health, and with such a horror <hi rend="italic">railwaying</hi> &#x26;c, sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be in the least considerable: but I shall always have a solidly faithful and discerning Substitute on the spot; and shall be able to promise that no dishonesty at least, or <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>conduct shall be practiced or countenanced either by him or by me. In regard to the next grand step, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you propose the &#x0201C;Month of April,&#x0201D; Sir David Brewster has already suggested that, as a <hi rend="italic">favour</hi> to me, &#x0201C;it might be delayed <hi rend="italic">till january</hi>&#x0201D;;&#x02014;my present wish being that I <hi rend="italic">had it over</hi> (hateful and horrible as it is to me) <hi rend="italic">as soon as possible</hi>,&#x02014;that then I might hope to be <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, &#x26; left mainly in silence unless where the contrary was indispensable! For <pb id="pg-43-42" n="43:42" />the rest, I am willing to conform to whatever is judged best for both parties; since, truly, except to the imaginat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, the matter is not great; and <hi rend="italic">either</hi>
            <date when="1866-04">April</date>  or <date when="1866-12">December</date>, whichever way Sir David &#x26; the rest of you may decide, ought to be nearly indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me. Say only that I do want to have it off my hands, there is no other point of preference.</p>

I have a profound respect for the liberty of an individual.&#x0201D; TC wrote at the end of Blackie&#x02019;s letter: &#x0201C;cackle-cackle &#x2F; goosey-goose: But will <hi rend="italic">you</hi> perhaps thank him for his offer of Lodging?&#x0201D; and sent it to John A. Carlyle. John wrote to Blackie, <date when="1865-11-18">18 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;This morning my brother has forwarded your letter, requesting me to thank you and Mrs Blackie for your very kind offer of receiving him in your house when he comes for the Installation; &#x26; I now do so most heartily both on his part &#x26; my own. But I rather think your house is too much exposed to noises that might hinder him from getting sleep, as he had difficulty even in the quiet back rooms of George S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> when we were there in August&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 2626.284).</note> Laing accepts, as you see;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Laing wrote, <date when="1865-11-18">18 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;If I had taken a day to think over your proposal, I would have declined accepting&#x02014;but as I hate indecision, in reply to a note from Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kelland this forenoon I have intimated my acceptance, &#x26; will do what I can to be useful. &#x02026; When you as Rector, make your appearance to give the Students &#x26;c. an Address, this necessarily must be a <hi rend="italic">very public</hi> affair&#x02014;and what I have to suggest is, not to be too anxious in the matter, but to write to Sir David Brewster, asking him his advice, &#x26; whether it would not be proper to delay this till the close of the Session next <date when="1866-04">April</date>? Our chief reason for suggesting any delay is, to avoid following close on the heels of your predecessor, who delivered his elaborate Address at the beginning of this month. &#x2F; Moreover it might save you a journey in the middle of Winter,&#x02014;and there is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> at that time a large assemblage usually an occasion of conferring Honorary Degrees, and there could be no fitter time for you to make an appearance. &#x2F; I cannot conclude without offering you my hearty thanks for the honour conferred on me.&#x0201D;</note> and in spite of his grunting way will do, I believe with you, perfectly well. I send you all my Notes (except one of Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, recomend<hi rend="italic">g you</hi> for <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, but David Aitken or John Stoddart on hint from others; Note lost, &#x26; of no use whatever): keep Laing&#x02019;s;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A.

I was not able to be present at the beginning of the meeting&#x02014;when this subject came on; but I had conveyed &#x02026; my impression, from your letter, that, although you would not object to <date when="1866-04">April</date>, yet, on the whole, it would be as agreeable to you to have the matter over sooner. It was resolved, I believe, to ask you whether the first or second week of <date when="1866-01">January</date> would suit your convenience. It was thought that your coming then, when the students will have all reassembled after the Christmas vacation, would be particularly good for the University.&#x0201D; He added: &#x0201C;We were both gratified by your truly kind letter, received on Tuesday last; and my wife means to follow your advice as regards the managing of her new element. She has always had a liking for Edinburgh, and there is abundant disposition to be kind to us.&#x0201D; Masson asked TC to come and stay when in Edinburgh: &#x0201C;The competition for you will be great; and, of course, I could not stand in the way of others. &#x02026; But might not you come to us first, use our house as your own to arrive at &#x26; recur to as you chose, &#x26; radiate from it as much or as little as you found suitable? Not even this would I ask, if I were not sure that you would be less put about with us than anywhere else. There shall be a supply of the true Glasgow pipes, and of the right tobacco, snugly at hand, but without obtrusion; and we will in all ways consult your wishes. In short, you shall be Rector within 3 Roseberry Crescent as well as without; and, if M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is with you, she shall reign too&#x02014;as my wife means to assure her.&#x0201D; TC wrote a note on Masson&#x02019;s letter: &#x0201C;very kind: accept so far as Glasgow Pipes &#x26;c,&#x02014;if only the time were <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>! (Return this; I may want the Address).&#x0201D; John replied, <date when="1865-11-28">28 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;Masson&#x02019;s letter is very kind indeed, &#x26; it seems to me that in his house &#x02026; you would be freer &#x26; feel more at home than anywhere else.&#x0201D;</note>

            <salute>Oh my Dear!</salute>

       I am so vexed that you should not have had your kind <hi rend="italic">Sending</hi> acknowledged sooner.</p>
          <p>It arrived when I was under a cloud&#x02014;last Saturday, confined to bed in a perfect agony of sick headache! I had had nothing of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> sort for many years, and it was really strange to me, the thought, how many such days I had passed formerly <hi rend="italic">without</hi> being killed by them! But I am sure I couldnt live thro&#x02019; many such at the present date! The Headache and sickness lasted only one day and night&#x02014; But the effects of it have not yet passed. I am as weak and nervous as if I had just come thro&#x02019; a course of mercury! And <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is why I have let several posts pass without returning you our Thanks; but expressing them meanwhile in an approving consumption of the eggs and fowls&#x02014; One was boiled on Monday (excellent!) the other is to be <hi rend="italic">roasted</hi> today&#x02014;according to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> views about <hi rend="italic">variety</hi> of food being requisite to the welfare of the human stomach. a consideration which M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C makes light of but exemplifys<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thus in MS.</note> in his own person, very convincingly the truth of&#x02014;</p>
          <p>I could very well account for that crisis the other day, several things had conspired to throw me on my back&#x02014; First my black Mare who enjoys the most perfect health generally, got her foot hurt by a run-away cart&#x02014;and has had to remain in the stable for more than a week, in a state of continual poultices! Not choosing to pay for another horse I agreed to go for exercise in an omnibus with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02014;the first time I had entered an omnibus since the evening I had my fall&#x02014;the beginning of all my woes!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">JWC fell in the street while trying to board an omnibus, <date when="1863-09-22">22 Sept. 1863</date> (see <ref target="volume-39/lt-18630923-TC-LLA-01">

But M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, as usual, <hi rend="italic">dawdled</hi> till we found ourselves too late, for going the whole way, and I had to get down at Charing-cross in a busy thoroughfare&#x02014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had to run after omnibuses to stop them&#x02014;and I was like to cry with nervousness to find myself left alone in an open Street!&#x02014; and couldn&#x02019;t <hi rend="italic">run</hi> after him as he kept calling to me to do <hi rend="italic">couldnt run</hi> at all!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;The omnibus at Charing Cross.

          <p>One morning when I looked out of my dressing room window to see what sort of day it was; imagine the spectacle that met my eyes&#x02014;a rubbishy hen-hutch&#x02014;erected over night, in the garden <hi rend="italic">next</hi> to ours&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">next</hi>! think of that! and <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> large hens and one <hi rend="italic">very</hi> large cock sauntering under our windows!!! I should have fainted where I stood, had I been in the habit of fainting but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I never was. As M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said nothing, I could not guess whether he had made the discovery or not&#x02014; The crowing which occurred several times during the night as well as abundantly in the morning certainly did not awake him&#x02014;his mind being at present intent on &#x0201C;Railway whistles&#x0201D;&#x02014; But when he should have once opened his eyes to the thing and as the days should lengthen the crowning would increase&#x02014;Ah&#x02014;My Heaven what then?&#x02014; no wonder that I lay awake <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> &#x0201C;what then!&#x0201D;&#x02014; I have not<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">MS Acc.7864 ends here; the letter continues on MS Acc. 7988.</note> time to give a detailed account of all that followed Enough to say the poultry is all to evacuate the premises at Xmas and meanwhile the cock is shut up in a dark cellar from darkening till after our breakfast. And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C clasped me in his arms and called me his &#x0201C;Guardian Angel&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;Some wretched people who had settled next door had brought poultry and other base disturbances; against which, for my sake, the noble soul heroically started up (not to be forbidden), and with all her old skill and energy gained victory, complete once more.

The thought is cuttingly painful while I live&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:293).</note> and all I have to pay for this restoration of peace and quietness, is giving a lesson three times a week in &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Syllables of two Letters</hi>&#x0201D;&#x02014;to a small Irish Boy!! rhyme that if you can!</p>
          <p>Excuse this illwritten letter&#x02014; I am not quite recovered from the crush of that poultry affair on my mind&#x02014;altho the secret load is removed.</p>
          <p>I will write soon when more up to writing&#x02014; This is merely thanks and a kiss for the fowls and eggs&#x02014; Oh if one never saw a fowl but like these&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">dead</hi>!</p>

          <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
          <p>Be pleased to offer my best thanks to The Senatus, and express the sense I have of their courtesy and goodness to me.</p>
          <p>Originally I had been desirous that the Installation sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take place &#x0201C;before the Xmas Holidays&#x0201D;; but finding, by what evidence I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gather, that this w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be suitable, and that on various grounds the early days of <date when="1866-04">April</date> (&#x0201C;first week or so,&#x0201D;) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the fit time, I lately settled it that way&#x02014;or empowered Mr Laing my Assessor so to settle it for me.</p>

          <p>If it be the least an object to the Senatus, or involve at all the interests of the University, we will still change to &#x0201C;the early part of january&#x0201D;: but if otherwise (and it be perhaps only a polite indulgence to myself, as I can surmise), I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> then a little prefer to abide by the settle<hi rend="italic">t</hi> already made,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had announced to my Assessor and some others.</p>
          <p>May I ask you to be so kind as communicate with Mr Laing,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Philip Kelland wrote to David Laing, <date when="1865-11-30">29 [30] Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;The Senatus had assumed that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was coming down in January, but it appears that he had previously arranged with you to come in <date when="1866-04">April</date>, as it was stated in the Newspapers. &#x2F; He requests me to consult with you as to the desirableness of adhering to this or otherwise. Perhaps it would be inconvenient for him to come down in Jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi>. I think the students would somewhat prefer it, but it would be unfair to bring him down when it would be inconvenient for himself&#x0201D; (MS: EUL).</note>
&#x02014;on the understanding that whatever you and he judge best, I intend to adopt as the practical decision, and so save farther trouble on this preliminary point. I remain always</p>

          <salute>Dear Lady Lothian,</salute>
          <p>It is not yet quite settled, at least not yet announced to me (for I have left it with Mr Laing &#x26; the Professors), what time my Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> adventure is to be; but I suppose the old date, &#x0201C;beginning of April,&#x0201D; will be allowed to hold:&#x02014;at any rate, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hospitable Ladyship shall hear <hi rend="italic">if</hi> there is any material alterat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.</p>

      Meanwhile I have to record the arrival, night before last,&#x02014;duly heralded from the woods of Blickling (in a fine hand of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I cannot read the <hi rend="italic">signature</hi>),&#x02014;of a magnific<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Wild Turkey; the like of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I did not know to inhabit this side of the Atlantic,&#x02014;and whose personal acquaintance we were, on various grounds, very proud to make. A magnanimous russet-coloured fellow,&#x02014;still in perfect order, I am assured; and who will this day fulfill his destiny, let us not doubt, in a credible and benefic<hi rend="italic">t</hi> way! Many thanks for this pretty remembrance of us, thanks from Wife &#x26; self.</p>
          <p>I know not if Lord Lothian takes any interest in these Workmen--Master Controversies that are getting so rife in late times, and are likely to grow louder and louder till they get upon the way of settlement.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC was referring to labor disputes which had been continuing since the spring, in ironworks and collieries, throughout the midlands and north of England. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported: &#x0201C;The North Staffordshire Coal and Iron Masters&#x02019; Defence Fund, recently established to support employers in resisting strikes of the men for enforcing unjust demands, is now in operation. &#x02026; The strike at Mr. Williamson&#x02019;s colliery at Tunstall, which has now continued for 12 weeks, came under the consideration of the meeting, and it was ordered that full compensation be made to Mr. Williamson from the commencement of the strike, and that the amount due to him for 12 weeks be paid forthwith&#x0201D; (<date when="1865-11-11">11 Nov.</date>). Mr. Williamson was Hugh Henshall Williamson (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867">1867</date>), land and property owner (<date when="1861">1861</date> census); his brother Robert (b. ca. <date when="1781">1781</date>), listed in the <date when="1851">1851</date> census as a coal mine owner but not listed in the <date when="1861">1861</date> census, was presumably d.; they were both mine owners, presumably including in the Tunstall area. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> then reported: &#x0201C;The colliers working in the South Yorkshire coalfield met in their thousands on Monday last, at Wombwell, Yorkshire, to take the final step as regards their demand for an advance of 10 per cent. upon the wages at present paid by their masters. &#x02026; [T]he meeting pledged itself not to rest satisfied until this, in its opinion, just demand was conceded. From present appearances there is likely to be a long struggle. &#x02026; There will not, however, be a general strike on the part of the men, nor yet a general lock-out on the part of the masters, judging from the present phase of the dispute&#x0201D; (<date when="1865-11-15">15 Nov.</date>).

       for a few minutes. As Great Brit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is growing more and more into one universal, sooty, most unlovely Blacksmith&#x02019;s Shop, this quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is evid<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> the most import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of all.&#x02014;&#x02014; What a shriekery is ris- is rising<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Repeated at turn of page.</note> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the &#x0201C;Jamaica Massacre,&#x0201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Reports were published in British newspapers from mid-Nov. about the insurrection in Jamaica, then a British colony. The immediate cause of the uprising was the trial of a Jamaican for trespass on an abandoned plantation. A group led by Paul Bogle (ca. <date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865">65</date>), deacon of Stony Cut Baptist Church, protested the proceedings; one of them was arrested and violence followed after the protesters rescued their colleague. On <date when="1865-10-11">11 Oct.</date> when around 300 Jamaicans attacked the Court House in Morant Bay, the <hi rend="italic">Custos</hi> (chief magistrate) assembled a small group of volunteer militia outside the building, and read the riot act to the assembled crowd. Hostilities ensued, resulting in deaths on both sides. The British governor of Jamaica, Edward John Eyre, concluded that the rebellion was aimed at exterminating the white population of the island. He believed that Bogle had been encouraged by George William Gordon (ca. <date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1865">65</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/74415"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), b. Jamaica; his father, Joseph Gordon, was a wealthy white sugar planter and his mother an unnamed slave; George Gordon was a Baptist preacher, a delegate to the House of Assembly, and a fierce critic of Eyre&#x02019;s governorship; although Gordon was in Kingston, a town under civil jurisdiction, Eyre had him transferred to Morant Bay, where martial law had been declared. Gordon was charged with high treason and sedition and hanged, <date when="1865-10-25">25 Oct.</date> More than 400 suspected rebels were shot or hanged, about 600 flogged, and 1,000 had their homes burnt. The controversy centered on whether or not Eyre&#x02019;s actions were excessive, not on any question of the possible justice of the insurgents&#x02019; cause. The view of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> editorial, <date when="1865-12-02">2 Dec.</date>, was that &#x0201C;[t]he importance of the events in Jamaica, and the intense interest which has been excited by them in this country, make it incumbent on the Government to give to the public at once the means of forming an accurate opinion. The English Press has no correspondents in the island, and for anything like trustworthy intelligence must be dependent on official documents or the chance letters of respectable private persons. We have not thought it necessary or right to publish the absurd and incoherent accounts from the Jamaica papers that came to hand by the last mail, bearing as they did the marks of enormous exaggeration. &#x02026; On the one hand, we find the <hi rend="small-caps">Governor of Jamaica</hi>, a man of long experience and most honourable character, with all the authorities, military and civil, of the island, declaring that the colony had been in the greatest danger, and could only have been saved by the prompt and severe measures which have been taken; on the other hand, there is a strong party at home which asserts that these people have, under the influence of rage or fear, or political hatred, indulged in a cruel massacre. For the sake of those who are thus assailed, as well as for the general satisfaction of the country, we trust that the Government will give the earliest publicity to everything that may be received from either the civil or military authorities. The executions have been numerous; it may be that some at least were unnecessary; but both soldiers and civilians on the other side of the ocean were of opinion that the danger was great, and the Legislature of the island has agreed with them.&#x0201D;</note>&#x02014;from a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> throats, I can remark, but of choicest folly.&#x02014;</p>

In a balanced and detailed assessment of TC&#x02019;s writings, Stephen classified him as a &#x0201C;Transcendentalist&#x0201D; adamantly opposed to &#x0201C;Benthamism and Democracy&#x0201D;; he rejected the assumption that Carlyle was a misguided &#x0201C;visionary&#x0201D;: &#x0201C;To those who not merely defend, but admire Mr. Carlyle, his practical sagacity will probably appear one of the most characteristic features of his character. It is entirely in harmony with the whole of his philosophy, which might almost be described as fact-worship&#x0201D; (787). His &#x0201C;strange language&#x0201D; was the result of his need to &#x0201C;express the extreme depth, earnestness, and vivacity of his own feelings. &#x02026; It is only by the use of humour and paradox that he can give full scope to his feelings&#x0201D; (786). According to Stephen, TC&#x02019;s support of slavery betrayed a lapse of historical understanding: &#x0201C;Abolish slavery says [the British nation]&#x02014;reform it says [Mr. Carlyle]. [He] entirely omits to notice the fact that it was precisely because long experience and repeated trials showed that it could not possibly be reformed that it was at last abolished&#x0201D; (794).</note>

Mrs Carlyle was dressed in black velvet. She had a pale blue ribbon round her neck, to which was attached a large gold cross; she also wore a brooch which had been given to her by Goethe. One of her bracelets (a very pretty one, pebbles of different colours, and beautifully cut, polished, and set in silver), she told the lady I had been invited to meet, was a present from the same great man&#x0201D; (Price, &#x0201C;Recollections&#x0201D; 35 and 34).</note>&#x02014; Would you come and make her acquaintance?&#x02014; <pb id="pg-43-64" n="43:64" />in spite of there being no M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C? If so, let me see you to dinner between five and six oclock&#x02014;on Wednesday 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>&#x02014; Perhaps you may get a glimpse of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C before you need to leave<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">After dinner TC returned: &#x0201C;Mrs Carlyle gave me a mischievous smile as Mr Carlyle followed by two gentlemen, entered the room. They were all in high spirits, and had been to see &#x02018;Chang,&#x02019; the Chinese giant. &#x02026; I &#x02026; was sufficiently interested in listening to the brilliant, clever talk. One of these gentlemen was Professor Tyndall, the other I did not recognise. The Professor gave me my tea, and talked to me a little, but I preferred listening,&#x02014;keeping well in Mrs Carlyle&#x02019;s shadow, and slipping quietly away when it grew late&#x0201D; (Price, &#x0201C;Recollections&#x0201D; 34).</note>&#x02014;</p>

Better Gift you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have chosen for me; and the feeling on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> parts that brings it to me may well make it still more valuable. I beg you will thank my little group of considerate Northumbrian Friends<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Although Dixon did not apparently name his friends with this gift, when he sent TC a gift for his 71st birthday, he added at the end of his letter of <date when="1866-12-03">3 Dec. 1866</date> (vol. 44): &#x0201C;I give you slight sketches of the <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> beside their Autographs in the other page&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1768.196A).

          <salute>Dear Laing,</salute>
          <p>I had written yesterday to Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kelland, offering the Senatus (what y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter of this morning is a welcome confirmation of) the choice of &#x0201C;Last week in March,&#x0201D; if they tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it preferable to First in April. I hope they will decide that way; but probably there is no need of my troubling you farther on that subject. I am also glad you have explained to me what &#x0201C;Second Week of January&#x0201D; meant.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">David Laing wrote, <date when="1865-12-08">8 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;At the College yesterday I was told Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kelland had written to you wishing on the part of the Senate that you should fix <date when="1866-01">January</date> for your Address. Asking why that month should be thought of, it seems the Professors have an Annual dinner at which they would like to have you present. Further if delayed till <date when="1866-04">April</date> many of the Medical Students might be absent from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after the 1st of that month. All this I hold to be of no great importance. Perhaps the last week of <date when="1866-03">March</date> might obviate this objection.&#x0201D;</note>

In the garden however, a waste bit of ground this long while, Phenomena presented themselves from which we could infer&#x02014;several things! For example, an excessively bad old rocking horse, with a tattered <hi rend="italic">side</hi>-saddle, indicated the neighbourhood of a female child.&#x02014;who, added to the solitary little Boy of the Dressmaker, very quiet Boy hitherto, might get up more noise than M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would like! Then, an enormous brasswired cage, taken out to be cleaned, left me no doubt of&#x02014;&#x02014;a <hi rend="italic">parrot</hi>! Good God! <hi rend="small-caps">there</hi>
       was a prospect for us when the fine weather came, and this cursed Bird should be hung outside to make the horriblest sounds!</p>
          <p>But one thing I noticed that I couldnt make head or tail of&#x02014;a great number of green spars of unequal lengths, mixed up with mats and wicker-boxes!&#x02014; Were they going to make these things into a little play-house for the children?&#x02014;or a rabbit House perhaps?&#x02014; Strange! that with all my horrible experiences, it never occurred to me, till I looked out that morning and saw the accomplished fact, that what they were going to make was a&#x02014;&#x02014;hen-house!!! just under M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s bed-room window! and just under my own bed-room window; for that matter! But, what made me all but burst a blood vessel on the spot,&#x02014;what <hi rend="italic">would have</hi> made me drop down in a faint&#x02014;if I had ever fainted in my life! was the recollections that rushed thro&#x02019; me, all in a heap, of the nights that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had wandered about, sleepless and near mad; with <hi rend="italic">cocks</hi>! <pb id="pg-43-73" n="43:73" />and the days laden with discord and dispair&#x02014;about cocks; following naturally on such nights! and of all the dirt I had been made to eat in negociating with the Cock-owners, and begging or buying their removal.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531225-JWC-CR-01">

          <p>I counted the hens airing themselves in the garden, there were nine of them, and one magnificent cock! who bewildered by the novelty of his position, maintained a golden silence! But I knew whether <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was likely to last! Next night I went to bed all in a flutter with the evil discovery of the day; was at last falling asleep, when a loud <hi rend="italic">crow</hi> seemed to issue <hi rend="italic">from under my bed</hi>!! This was at three of the morning; the crow was repeated three times! the same performance came off at four, and again at five! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C sleeping soundly thro it all! and I, with my heart thumping,&#x02014;listening not for the <hi rend="italic">crowing</hi> only&#x02014;but far worse&#x02014;for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s step on the floor overhead, telling that he had been disturbed and would make everybody know he had! Oh my Heavens! For a week I kept this bad secret in my breast; all that time M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C never discovering it for <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>! But my sleep had gone. and I had to take to bed at last with sick headache. Now I used to find, when addicted to sick headache (It is years since I had one) that I always came out of it with my wits unusually clear! and this time also, I got up out of my agony, with a clear insight into the course to be followed with this cock and a determination to follow it forthwith. Just in time! For M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the Cock and was going mad about him, the very day that I brought my operations to a triumphant close&#x02014;had got the Cock utterly extinguished from three in the afternoon till ten in the morning; and the whole bad lot to be removed from the Premises at Xmas. And <hi rend="italic">didn&#x02019;t</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C catch me in his arms, and kiss me wildly, and call me his &#x0201C;guardian Angel&#x0201D; and every denomination of Angel!&#x02014; And <hi rend="italic">scenes</hi> in which one figures as &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">angel</hi>&#x0201D; are not good for the nervous subject either!&#x02014;anything but soporific they are!&#x02014; So the sleep that had been worried away didn&#x02019;t come back all at once, when the worry had ceased&#x02014;is only <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> back slowly, and with difficulty&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">now</hi>!</p>
          <p>For the rest of my neuralgia keeps in abeyance. and tho&#x02019; my right arm continues stiff I can do wonderful things with the hand! For example I made M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C two beautiful black stocks, for a Birthday present.</p>

He called <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>, the other day, and <pb id="pg-43-74" n="43:74" />chose the time of day when every body is out driving, and left a card without a vestige of address on it!

You cannot improve them and you cannot alter them by telling soft lies about them. They are cruel, wicked men, and God lets them gang their ain gait.&#x02019; My father. &#x02026; called out: &#x02018;Listen, Froude&#x02014;listen: here is Mr. Carlyle denouncing you for making Henry VIII. a hero and a great king.

          <p>Imagine the situation! You have heard, I think, of our troubles in long past years from neighbouring <hi rend="italic">Cocks</hi>! How I had to rush about to one and another Householder, going down on my knees, and tearing my hair (figuratively speaking); to obtain the silence of these feathered Demons, that broke M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s Sleep, with their least, croupy crow; when you might have fired a <hi rend="italic">pistol</hi> at his ear without waking him! Thro&#x02019; efforts that I still shudder at the recollection of, the neighbouring gardens were quite cleared of Cocks; and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C forgetting all the woe <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had wrought him has been free, latterly, to <pb id="pg-43-76" n="43:76" />devote his exclusive attention to&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Railway whistles</hi>!! Bearing this in mind; be so good as imagine my sensations, one morning about a month ago, on being startled awake, before day-light, with the loud crowing of a full-grown <hi rend="italic">Cock</hi>, from under my very bed (as it seemed in the bewilderment of the first moments)!&#x02014; I sprang to the floor with my heart in my mouth, ran to my dressing closet window and looked out! but it was too dark to see anything; only the crowing, which continued like mad, sounded <hi rend="italic">just underneath</hi>! I went back to bed, and lay with my heart thumping, till it was light enough to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>; and then I reconoitred the ground; and just below M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s bedroom window and my own, behold! an ill-conditioned <hi rend="italic">Hen-House</hi> had been erected over night, and I counted nine hens and a Splendid Cock in quest of the early worm!!! If I had ever <hi rend="italic">fainted</hi> in my Life, I must have fainted at that sight! I no longer felt in myself strength or Spirit to enter upon the old hand to hand battle with Cocks and Hens!

          <p>For a whole week I carried the bad secret in my own breast! Thanks to the prepossession of the Railway <hi rend="italic">Whistles</hi>, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C never heard the <hi rend="italic">crowing</hi> under his nose! But night after night I expected to hear his foot descend on the floor over head, with the old frantic stamp,&#x02014;&#x0201C;preluding <hi rend="italic">Much</hi>&#x0201D;! (as himself might say). Sleep, difficult for me in the best of circumstances, was in these circumstances simply impossible! And at the weeks end I had to take to bed with a sick headache&#x02014; Now; nothing clears the brain so much as a good spell of sick headache; I find!&#x02014; Accordingly I came out of this bout with a plan of operations in regard to the poultry, and a modest determination to &#x0201C;carry it out.&#x0201D; The result of which appeared next day in Golden Silence on the part of the Cock; and in raptures on the part of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, who had discovered his Enemy the very day that he was delivered from him, when he &#x0201C;was just going off to Tyndall to beg him to supply him privately with some strychnine&#x0201D;!! a fine course <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would have been! But now there was no poisoning needed! and so he clasped me in his arms, and assured me over and over that I was his &#x0201C;Guardian Angel!&#x0201D; Humph! It is no sinecure!</p>
          <p>And one night, when doing a bit of amiability (that sort of thing never prospers for me!) I was run into by a mad cart! and my poor Bellona (the Black Mare), had her foot so bruised that till yesterday I had not driven her for&#x02014;three weeks!

            <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>

      &#x02014;I am in the usual way;&#x02014;imagined yesterday I was getting visibly better (<hi rend="italic">weather</hi> being fine); but had, unexpectedly, an ugly troubling night,&#x02014;owing I think to something at dinner. Superficially I seem to have been growing steadily <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> (worse in spirits, in rheumat<hi rend="italic">m</hi>, catarrhs, especially in nervous irritability); yet substantially I do rather believe that something of strength, purity of blood &#x26;cmay be slowly returning to me.</p>

          <p>I began a letter to you on this sheet of paper, last Tuesday&#x02014; But was interrupted, and have never had a fair chance at writing a reasonably long letter since.

In the preface Ruskin explained that the work originated in a series of lectures delivered at a girls&#x02019; school. &#x0201C;The Lectures always fell more or less into the form of fragmentary answers to questions; and they are allowed to retain that form, as, on the whole, likely to be more interesting than the symmetries of a continuous treatise&#x0201D; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi> vii).</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I devoured with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> pause, and intend to look at ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, is a most shining Performance!

A drain will be made on the south side of the road throughout its entire length and fifty cubic yards of broken stones will be put upon it. I have agreed, on your part, to pay for breaking thirty yards of these stones and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Common will lend his horses to cart them. In the coming summer, if it is your wish to have the road made an entirely superior one, when a further sum will be set aside for it by the Road Trustees,&#x02014;I could have it pared on the sides and rounded up on the middle with gravel by making a small addition to the allowance of the Trustees.

He came over here to me for a day &#x02026; &#x26; [we] talked incessantly. &#x2F; In the talk came up a scheme or dream of mine, how if I could get away from the Customs&#x02019; service after 20 years employment, with some small annual sum, I would wish to apply myself to a careful study of Irish affairs, examining libraries records &#x26; places with this view, &#x26; in the hope of doing something useful.&#x0201D;</note>
 I did then expect from you in course of time something quite superior on the History of Ireland; but you pulled up y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> tether ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, took to shifting ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; &#x26; I suppose there is nothing done.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Allingham continued: &#x0201C;I did (as you well know) a foolish thing in resigning my place in the Customs once on a time, and again did an injudicious or unlucky thing in exchanging to London.&#x0201D;</note>
 You have no idea how much a man loses by tumbling up his locat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and getting into a totally new environment of his commonplace condit<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> of existence, time after time.</p>
          <p>What chance you may have to get this increase of Pension &#x26;c&#x26;c(in short, this total <hi rend="italic">abolition</hi> of &#x0201C;tether&#x0201D;!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Allingham continued: &#x0201C;My total income, <hi rend="italic">including</hi> the recent literary pension of &#163;60, is about &#163;150 a year; &#x26; what is sought is that I might be set free at the end of 20 years&#x02019; service with this sum <hi rend="italic">in all</hi>, or something not very much less; with a reasonable expectation of my proving worth more to the country in the next 20 years as student of Irish history than as Coast Officer.&#x0201D; Allingham was awarded a pension of &#163;60, <date when="1864">1864</date>, for his contributions to poetry and literature, but his application for an increase was denied.</note>
 I do not know at all: but I must candidly tell you I have great doubts whether it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do you anything but mischief,&#x02014;whether you are not even now better situated for working out some History of Ireland than you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> anywhere else be, for the next ten or twenty years!

Rolled up in fur, and both windows up, and warm water to my feet, I caught no cold, and it is always pleasant <hi rend="italic">there</hi>! And I always sleep well after!

Then it happened that in these <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi> days I had Agnes Veitch, my old Haddington playmate (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Grahame)<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss">Agnes Graham, b. Veitch.</note> coming to dinner! and seeing that he had made up his mind to find her dreadfully in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way; I ordered my Brougham at eight oclock, to take her home to St John&#x02019;s wood;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss">About 5 mi. (8 km.) NW of Chelsea.</note> and that she mightn&#x02019;t think it was sending her off too early I went along with her, to give her another hour of my company! Prettily imagined you will allow! Having deposited her safely at her own door, I was on my way back, crossing Oxford Street, when I saw a <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> or <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> cart, bearing down upon me, at a furious rate and swerving from side to side, so that there was no escaping! My old Coachman<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Silvester.</note> is a most cautious as well as skillful Driver! but this was too much! I shut my eyes and crossed my arms tight, and awaited the Collision! Instead of, as I expected, running into the <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi>, the Wild Thing ran into <hi rend="italic">the Black Mare</hi>! threw her round with a jerk that broke part of her harness, and then rushed on! Men gathered round, and Silvester descended from his box, to knot up the broken straps my beautiful <hi rend="italic">Bellona</hi> (so named, for her imputed warlike dispositions) standing the while as quiet as a lamb! Then we went on our way again, thanking God it was no worse. But it was found on reaching the Stables that poor Bellona had got her foot badly hurt! the mad wheel seemed to have bruised it and snipped out a piece of <pb id="pg-43-91" n="43:91" />skin. She was not at all lame and was quite willing to go out with me next day; but the next again, her leg was much swelled, and for more than a fortnight she had to be attended by the Vetrinary Surgeon,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss">Unidentified further.</note> who forbid her going out, and said if the bruise had been an inch nearer the hoof, she would have been a ruined Bellona!&#x02014; also he said &#x0201C;a more sweet natured horse he had never handled.&#x0201D; After much poulticing, the inward suppuration came outward&#x02014;and she is now all right, being of an admirable constitution this one! never, even thro&#x02019; the <hi rend="italic">poulticing</hi> time <hi rend="italic">loosing</hi> her excellent appetite and excellent spirits. But it was <hi rend="italic">worrying</hi> to not know <hi rend="italic">when</hi> she could be taken out&#x02014;and meanwhile to be putting M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to the cost of a livery-horse as well!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC recorded in his checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1865-12-02">2 Dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1865</date> to Silvester (Horse &#x26;c<hi rend="italic">lame</hi>) &#163;9 .. 18 .. 2&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note> But the grand worry of all&#x02014;that which perfected my sleeplessness, was an importation of nine hens and a magnificent <hi rend="italic">Cock</hi> (!!!) into the adjoining garden!

          <p>So soon as it was daylight I looked out again, and <hi rend="italic">there</hi> was a sight to see!&#x02014;a ragged <hi rend="italic">irish</hi> looking hen-house, run up over night; and, sauntering to and fro, nine godly hens, and a <hi rend="italic">stunning</hi> Cock!&#x02014; I didn&#x02019;t know whether M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C remained really deaf as well as well as<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thus in MS.</note> blind to the new neighbours; or whether he was only magnanimously resolved to observe silence about them; but it is a fact, that for a whole week he said no word to enlighten me&#x02014;while I expected and expected the crisis which would surely come! and shuddered at every Cock-Crow, and counted the number of times he crowed in a night! at two! at three! at four! at five! at six! oh terribly at seven!&#x02014; For a whole week I bore my hideous secret in my breast! and slept none to speak of! At the weeks end I fell into one of my old sick headaches. I used always to find a sick headache had a fine effect in clearing the wits! So, even this time, I rose from a day&#x02019;s <pb id="pg-43-92" n="43:92" />agony with a scheme of operation in my head, and a sense of ability to &#x0201C;carry it out&#x0201D;! It would be too long to go into details, enough to say, my negociations with &#x0201C;Next door&#x0201D; ended in an agreement that the Cock should be shut up in a cellar inside the owner&#x02019;s own house&#x02014;from three in the afternoon till ten in the morning! and in return I give the small boy of the house a lesson every morning in his <hi rend="italic">Reading made Easy</hi>!! The small Boy being &#x0201C;too excitable&#x0201D; for being sent to school!&#x02014; It is a house full of <hi rend="italic">Misteries No 6</hi>! I have thoughts of writing a novel about it. Meanwhile M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C declares me to be his &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Guardian Angel</hi>&#x0201D;!&#x02014; No sinecure I can tell him!</p>
          <p>So I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> fall to <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> again&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">if I could</hi>! But I couldn&#x02019;t all at once! Getting back to even that much sleep I had been having must be gradual&#x02014;like the building of Rome!</p>
          <p>Jessy is going on quite well since I decided to take the upper hand with her and <hi rend="italic">keep it</hi>! I don&#x02019;t think M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren likes her any better; but I ask no questions. Best &#x0201C;let sleeping dogs lie&#x0201D;! She (Jessy) is much more attentive to me, since I showed myself quite indifferent to her <hi rend="italic">attentions</hi>, and particular only as to the performance of her <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. She is even <hi rend="italic">kindly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sensitive</hi> with me occasionally. But she can&#x02019;t come over me ever again with that dodge! She let me see too clearly into her hard, vain nature that I should place reliance or affection on her again! I do not regret having taken her&#x02014;not at all! As a Servant she is better than the average, as a woman I do not think <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> of her; but I mistook her entirely at the first. and see less good in her than perhaps there is, because I began by seeing far <hi rend="italic">more</hi> good in her than she had the least pretention to!

But I have heard of him from John Welsh (George&#x02019;s son)<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Welsh, son of JWC&#x02019;s paternal uncle George Welsh.</note> who died, and whose opinion was to be relied on; as being more like my Uncle Robert than any of the others, and a most upright, industrious, creature, who was very little cared for by the rest&#x02014;because he was less pretentious&#x02014;</p>
          <p>I had a visit lately from Agnes Veitch of Hawthorn Bank&#x02014;(M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thomas Grahame) She is such a queer, little, old, white haired, <hi rend="italic">fairy</hi>-grown! but as fond of me as when we were play fellows at home! I felt ashamed of myself that I couldn&#x02019;t feel so glad over her as she seemed to be over me! I felt to have gone so far, far away from her! into spheres of thought and action so different from the narrow monotonous sphere in which she had lived, and turned grey! But I tried to not <hi rend="italic">show</hi> that she rather wearied me! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at least I owed to her long regard. By way of being very kind indeed, I took her home, to a distant part of the Town, after dark, in my Brougham, the day she dined here; and this act of amicability cost me no end of vexation; For; on my way home, after having deposited her safe; a drunk or mad cart drove against my beautiful Black Mare, and burst her harness and bruised her foot, so that she was in the hands of the Vetrinary Surgeon for three weeks and couldn&#x02019;t be put to any use.</p>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has settled to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, to deliver that &#x0201C;Address&#x0201D; expected of him, in the last week of March&#x02014; If the weather happened to be remarkably mild, and if I happened to be remarkably well, I should like to go with him, and possibly may! Tho&#x02019; my Aunts have given me no invitation, I should be at no loss for good quarters to stay at, and the warmest welcome! But of all the invitations we have we are likely, and have indeed engaged to accept the one that came <hi rend="italic">first</hi>&#x02014;from the Marchioness of Lothian at Newbattle Abbey&#x02014; They are nice people&#x02014;and live very quietly&#x02014;the poor young Marquis being paralized in his lower limbs.

The maids now sleep in my old garret; except Jane, the whole household is now aloft, and there is no special nicety required in sliding to bed and out of it. Our weather, I believe, is on the average superior to yours; today ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is bright with sun, after an abund<hi rend="italic">t</hi> clash of rain with loudish wind for many hours ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A.

Accept many thanks for the pretty Strasburg Pot; reputed acme of the culinary art,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Presumably goose pat&#xE9;; pat&#xE9; de foie gras was known as Strasbourg pie or pat&#xE9;, Strasbourg being the chief source at the time.</note>
 and dear inexpressibly to &#x0201C;those who,&#x0201D; as the French Editor has said, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">se d&#xE9;voient &#xE0; la carri&#xE8;re des indigestions</hi> [succumb to a career of overindulgence].&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC possibly refers to the death of Julian Offray de La Mettrie (<date when="1709">1709</date>&#x02013;<date when="1751">51</date>), French physician, philosopher, and hedonist; his death, apparently from overeating pheasant pie, is recounted by Frederick the Great; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:331&#x02013;33.</note>
 Materially speaking, we here must not try to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> it; nevertheless, to us also, no part of it or of its savoury qualities has been lost;&#x02014;and on the <hi rend="italic">spiritual</hi> palate it has a taste far <pb id="pg-43-102" n="43:102" />finer than the vulgar Strasburg one, far more lasting, too, and perfectly wholesome! I can only wish you many New Years: that they may all be for <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self and others.</p>
          <p>I continue perfectly idle here, merely reading &#x26;c&#x26;c; and feel disappointed that you have never come back to me yet. I am almost always here till after 2 p.m.; daily, towards 3, I have to sally out for a walk; and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> with pleasure escort you up to Town ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>.

      &#x02014;Your appeal to me is very touching, and I am heartily sorry for you, if I could but help at all. In very great want of time, among other higher requisites, I write a few words, which, I hope, may at least do no harm, if they can do little good. Herein, as in many other cases, the &#x02018;patient must minister unto himself;&#x02019; no best of doctors can do much. The grand remedy against such spiritual maladies and torments is to rise upon them vigorously from without, in the way of practical work and performance. Our thoughts, good or bad, are not in our command, but every one of us has at all hours duties to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, and these he can do negligently, like a slave; or faithfully, like a true servant. &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> the duty that is nearest thee&#x02019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Goethe&#x02019;s expression in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320216-TC-JAC-01">

</ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 145.</note>&#x02014;that first, and that well; all the rest will disclose themselves with increasing clearness, and make their successive demand. Were your duties never so small, I advise you, set yourself with double and treble energy and punctuality to do them, hour after hour, <pb id="pg-43-107" n="43:107" />day after day, in spite of the devil&#x02019;s teeth! That is our one answer to all inward devils, as they used to be called. &#x02018;This I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do, O Devil, and I do it, thou seest, in the name of God.&#x02019; It is astonishing and beautiful what swift exorcism lies in this course of proceeding, and how at the first real glimpse of it all foul spirits and sickly torments prepare to vanish.</p>
          <p>I hope you will not often have experience of this, poor child. And don&#x02019;t object that your duties are so insignificant; they are to be reckoned of infinite significance and alone important to you. Were it but the more perfect regulation of your apartments, the sorting-away of your clothes and trinkets, the arranging of your papers&#x02014;&#x02018;Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, <hi rend="italic">do it</hi> with all thy might,&#x02019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">See Eccles. 9:10.</note> and all thy worth and constancy. Much more, if your duties are of evidently higher, wider scope; if you have brothers, sisters, a father, a mother, weigh earnestly what claim does lie upon you, on behalf of each, and consider it as the one thing needful, to pay <hi rend="italic">them</hi> more and more honestly and nobly what you owe. What matter how miserable one is, if one can do that? That is the sure and steady disconnection and extinction of whatsoever miseries one has in this world. Other spiritual medicine I never do discover; neither, I believe, does other exist, or need to exist.</p>
          <p>For the rest, dear child, you are evidently too severe upon yourself; these bad thoughts don&#x02019;t make you a &#x02018;wicked girl,&#x02019; not until you yield to them; the excess of your remorse and self-abhorrence is itself proof of some height of nobleness in you. We have all of us to be taught by <hi rend="italic">stripes</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">That is, by being beaten; cf. Luke 10:47&#x02013;48.</note> by sufferings&#x02014;won&#x02019;t learn otherwise. Courage, courage! As to fasting, penance, etc., that is all become a ghastly matter; have nothing to do with that; <hi rend="italic">work, work</hi>, and be careful about nothing else. Choose with your utmost skill among your companions and coevals some real associates; be not too much alone with your thoughts, which are by nature bottomless. Finally, be careful of your health; bodily ill-health, unknown to your inexperience, may have much to do with the miseries.</p>

          <p>I have written no letters that I could avoid since new year time, when I had a <hi rend="italic">surfeit</hi> of letterwriting, complicated with a cold in the head&#x02014;lasting (the <pb id="pg-43-108" n="43:108s" />cold) I cant say how long; for it is not yet done with!

The fame this fine vessel had acquired as a passenger ship&#x02014;partly owing to the fact of her last outward passage having been made in 59 days&#x02014;was in itself calculated to dispel all anxiety on her behalf, even during the late tempestuous weather, and it is believed that her owners and the underwriters concerned were least of all prepared for the terrible disaster that has happened to her.&#x0201D; There were 19 survivors, who managed to get into a boat: &#x0201C;Scarcely had they gone 80 yards &#x02026; when the fine steamer went down stern foremost with her crowd of human beings, from whom one confused cry of helpless terror arose, and all was silent for ever.&#x0201D;</note>

And can find in my whole mind no morsel of cheerful news to tell you!&#x02014; Perhaps I am even more stupid than sad; and no shame to me, with a <hi rend="italic">cold in my head</hi>, dating from before Xmas! It is the only illness I have had to complain of this winter; and is no illness &#x0201C;to speak of&#x0201D;; but, none the less, it makes me very <hi rend="italic">sodden</hi> and abject; and instead of having <hi rend="italic">thoughts</hi> in my head, it (my head) feels to be filled with <hi rend="italic">wool</hi>! <hi rend="italic">Fuzzy</hi> is the word for how I feel, all thro&#x02019;! But I continue to take my three hours drive daily, all the same. Since I returned from Folkstone in September, I have only missed <hi rend="italic">two days</hi>! the days of the snow storm a fortnight ago; when it was so dangerous for horses to travel that the very Omnibuses struck work. And besides the forenoon drive, I <hi rend="italic">occasionally</hi>, with this wool in my head go out to dinner!!! With a hot bottle at my feet, and wrapt in fur, I take no hurt, and the talk stirs me up. Dr Quain told me I &#x0201C;couldn&#x02019;t take a better remedy, if only I drank plenty of Champagne,&#x0201D;&#x02014;a condition which I for one, never find any difficulty in complying with!</p>

Her friend David Davidson commented on her religious doubts and her aunts&#x02019; dislike of them: &#x0201C;However frank in other matters, Mrs. Carlyle was singularly reticent on the subject of religion; and I, in my desire not to offend, may have erred by going too far on the non-aggressive side. Her godly aunts were more venturesome, and latterly were more hopeful as to her attitude in regard to the most momentous subject. It is a pleasing fact that some of her dearest friends, and those on whose affection she relied with the greatest confidence, were decidedly serious people. &#x02026; Thomas Erskine &#x02026; and last, but not least, the faithful and godly Betty Braid. In my last letter to her, I pressed upon her as earnestly and affectionately as I could the importance of making sure work for eternity. I told her that in my dressing-room were hung portraits of many dear friends who had entered into their rest; and that the only ones that represented living friends were those of her husband and herself. And I added that, as I looked at hers, I was often filled with anxious thought as to what assurance I should have, if she were taken before me, that we should meet again in the happy land. That letter closed our earthly correspondence&#x0201D; (David Davidson, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of</hi>

He was a terrible Blackguard the younger Kitchener&#x02014;squandered his money, ill used his wife&#x02014;even to beating her, till old Kitchener took her away from him, and settled her in a small house in Belgravia with her two little girls.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">William B. Kitchiner did not marry until after his father&#x02019;s death; it is probable JWC has confused Edgeworth&#x02019;s own father with her husband&#x02019;s father since Georgina Kitchiner lived at 14 Wilton Place, Knightsbridge, which was insured in <date when="1837">1837</date> by her father. In <date when="1865">1865</date> she changed her name back to Edgeworth. There were two das., Georgina Jemima Frances Edgeworth (b. ca. <date when="1829">1829</date>), and a younger da., unidentified further.</note> There she lived on, after old Kitcheners death, entirely separated from her Scamp of a Husband. People pitied her and liked her; talked a little scandal about a M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Chisholm<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Unidentified further.</note> (&#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">The Chisholm</hi>&#x0201D;&#x02014;the name he went by) making himself so much at home in her house, and acting as male to Protector to the family; and were sure The Chisholm would marry M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener if her Husband would only die.&#x02014; but The Chisholm <hi rend="italic">died</hi> instead; and, having no near relations, left all his Fortune to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener. The Heir at Law disputed the <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, but could make nothing of that! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener entered into possession of a good fortune and has remained a popular woman in Belgravia up to the present time; her eldest Daughter being now well on to thirty.</p>
          <p>The other morning&#x02014;I think they said; four days ago&#x02014; The footman<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Johnson (b. ca. <date when="1843">1843</date>).</note> who was waiting at breakfast committed some stupidity which M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener reproved him for, and the man made her an insolent answer. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> K indignant said, she did not permit insolence from her servants that he must change <pb id="pg-43-119" n="43:119" />his tone or leave the House&#x02014; He hadn&#x02019;t the least objection he said. &#x0201C;Then said M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener you will give up the plate to the Housekeeper so soon as breakfast is over, and pack up your things and be off.&#x0201D;&#x02014; &#x0201C;Oh with pleasure returned the Man when you have paid me my wages; but I will take my wife with me&#x0201D;!! &#x0201C;What have <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to do with your wife&#x0201D; asked the Lady?&#x02014; Whereupon the fellow turned round towards the young Lady sitting at the Breakfast table (Miss Kitchener) and said &#x0201C;Come along Georgie!&#x02014;you hear?&#x02014; Get ready your traps!&#x0201D; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener could think nothing but that her footman had gone suddenly <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>; and rushed out of the House, leaving the front door open, to a Street Sweeper who went messages; and implored him to run for the Police, that there was a mad man in the house! At which sight a mob began to collect about her door! The poor woman returned up stairs, and was met by the footman coming down followed by &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Georgie</hi>,&#x0201D; with a bag in her hand!!! &#x0201C;I am going Mama, said the young Lady, with my <hi rend="italic">Husband</hi>, we were married at &#x02014;&#x02014; church by Banns on Sunday gone a Fortnight.&#x0201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Johnson and Georgina Edgeworth m., <date when="1866-01-18">18 Jan.</date>, at Trinity Church, Marylebone.</note> &#x0201C;Nothing wrong said the Footman to the people outside only be so good as call me a cab&#x0201D;! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Kitchener didnt <hi rend="italic">see</hi> her Daughter drive off with the footman; for at the girls first words she had fallen down in a dead faint!</p>
          <p>&#x0201C;Did you&#x02014;ever?&#x0201D; To complete the disgrace the footman is two or three and twenty and the young Lady near thirty!</p>
          <p>There! all these pages filled with a London Scandal.</p>
          <p>It is time to give you a few details, of myself, trusting that I am more interesting to you, than ever so many scandals</p>
          <p>When you last heard from me I was badly off for sleep, and generally out of sorts; tho still quite free of neuralgia. It seemed a case for a tonic, and I had <hi rend="italic">your</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x02019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Dr. James Russell.</note> prescription made up, and persevered in taking it twice a day for a week. But the only effect I perceived from it was an ever increasing headache and sickness all the mornings&#x02014;and a sort of sore throat like what I always got from trying cod liver oil! So at the end of a week I left it off <hi rend="italic">on trial</hi>. I was immediately, almost, relieved from the headache and sickness but slept no better, and felt miserably <hi rend="italic">low</hi>. After leaving off for a week I tried the iron again, and the very second day of it the headache and sickness returned to me, so I considered it a made out case that the iron did not agree with me, and left it off altogether! I am sure <hi rend="italic">the D</hi>r would have advised me to do so, if he had been near me to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>! Since the weather has been so temperate, I have felt better, and had more sleep. Except the two days when London was so snowed up that the Omnibuses struck work; I have never omitted my daily drive; and have even continued to go out occasionally to dinner!! Dr Quain told me I &#x0201C;could do nothing more wholesome provided I drank plenty of Champagne.&#x0201D; <pb id="pg-43-120" n="43:120" />Easy to do that! and really it is a fact that the night after I have been at an eight o&#x02019;clock dinner with plenty of talk going on, I always sleep sounder than on other nights!</p>
          <p>The Town is no longer &#x0201C;empty.&#x0201D; All my most intimate friends are come back except Lady Ashburton, who alas <hi rend="small-caps">will</hi> still remain on the Continent and give no certain promise of return&#x02014; Her rheumatism is better; but there are family reasons for her avoiding England at present which <hi rend="italic">she</hi> considers imperative,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss">See <ref target="volume-43/lt-18651107-TC-LA-01">

                   it is certain the greatest man&#x02019;s &#x0201C;autograph&#x0201D; will do almost nothing for you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Blanche Atkinson, soon to be 19, later explained her request to TC: &#x0201C;In <date when="1866">1866</date> the passion for autograph collecting had seized me; and my most eager desire was to obtain the autograph of Thomas Carlyle. He was at that time my hero and spiritual master. &#x02018;Sartor Resartus&#x02019; had lately fallen in my way, and wakened me to an entirely new world; and it was genuine enthusiasm for the teacher, not a mere idle wish to have a momento of a great man which prompted me, after long dubitation, to write and make my request to him. &#x02026; So much has been written of his impatience and surliness, amounting to discourtesy, that it is time to give even this trifling proof of the other side of his character&#x0201D; (459).</note> If, on the other hand, you can find anything of credibly <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> in any of your great men, and will proceed and faithfully to <hi rend="italic">put it in practice</hi>, how useful may not that be to yourself and him!</p>

          <p>I think it will be serviceable, as certainly it will be pleasantest than any other thing of the sort can be, to stop a day or two at good old Fryston as I go northward.

 but doubtless you know how to manage that.</p>
          <p>My Wife I find will be only too willing to come; but she stipulates for the clause &#x0201C;weather permitting,&#x0201D; as is nevertheless necessary to a strict degree.

          <p>
            <salute>Dear Sir,</salute> I am infinitely obliged to the Senatus Academicus for this new mark of their favour,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Kelland wrote, <date when="1866-03-17">17 March</date>: &#x0201C;I am instructed by the Senatus Academicus to inform you that at their meeting this day they unanimously resolved to confer on you the Degree of LL.D.&#x0201D; TC wrote on Kelland&#x02019;s envelope: &#x0201C;Prof<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Kelland: <hi rend="italic">Doctorate</hi> (was refused, <date when="1866-03-21">21 March 1866</date>).&#x0201D;</note>
 so conspicuously honourable to me;&#x02014;and shall have to add <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in permanence to my pleasant recollection of their manifold and continual kindness ever since we came in contact.</p>
          <p>The offer made, on such terms, from such a quarter, is one which no highest man need hesitate to accept, and to me surely it is a possession for the rest of my life: nevertheless I should say on consideration, I should say (if I might <pb id="pg-43-139" n="43:139" />without suspicion of unthankfulness, disrespect or affectation which are all very far from me on this matter) that I could wish it not to go farther, but to remain for me in that altogether pure condition. A feeling I have that there is something of incongruous between my past history and this new Dignity; that I have a Brother, an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> M.D. who would hereby cease to be &#x0201C;the Doctor&#x0201D; in our circle, after 30 or 40 years possession; that I should never know myself, or be at home in this dignity (even tho&#x02019; I kept it secret);&#x02014;that, in short, this deliberate unanimous resolution of the Senatus is a great and signal favour, which I never shall forget, and which would not be enhanced, but the contrary, by going into actual fulfilment. Such accordingly is that practical decision I have had to form.</p>
          <p>Have the goodness to indicate all this for me, to the Senatus, in the most respectful terms that can be chosen, and to say that I demand as another act of their kindness a generous interpretation of what is written here.</p>

          <salute>My dear, kind Lord Houghton</salute>
          <p>I have been out in far worse winds than yesterday&#x02019;s; since I came to depend on my drives for <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>! And I am not afraid of the <hi rend="italic">journey</hi> to Fryston, nor of <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi> fatigue, generally. For you see I am what is pleasantly called &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">A Living Miracle</hi>&#x0201D;! meaning&#x02014;a woman who, according to Nature, should have been dead and buried away, two years ago, and is here still, going about in society alive and well! (To be sure both the aliveness and the wellness &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">may be strongly doubted</hi>,&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-JWC-JCA-01">

</ref>.</note> as they say in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>!)</p>
          <p>What I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> afraid of, and what has determined me against accompanying M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, on this &#x0201C;accursed adventure&#x0201D; (I don&#x02019;t mean the Fryston part of it!) is the agitation that was getting hold of me about <hi rend="italic">his</hi> agitation! I had visions of his breaking down in his &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Address</hi>&#x0201D;! of his lying ill with fuss and <hi rend="italic">dinners</hi>! of his going to wreck and ruin in every possible way! And <hi rend="italic">I</hi> unable to do anything, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, for his furtherance, but just to take the terrible <hi rend="italic">pain in my back</hi> which assails me under all violent emotion In intervals of good sense I perceived that my only chance of escaping an illness was to cut myself loose from him, till &#x0201C;the accursed affair&#x0201D; was over. &#x0201C;What the Eye sees not, the Heart grieves not!&#x0201D; When he is gone, out of my sight, I shall calm down! But if I should <hi rend="italic">prolong</hi> the nervousness of these days, going with Him and the others to Fryston; I should get no good of Fryston, and risk a spell of illness&#x02014; I want to go to Fryston (it would be the first time remember) in a state of mind that would not interfere with my enjoyment of it.</p>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says he &#x0201C;cannot give me any advice&#x02014;will not take the responsibility of my going; but if I dont think it wise to go with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> now; I may say that I will come in the summer weather <hi rend="italic">if you like</hi> and bring <hi rend="italic">him</hi> along with me!&#x0201D; Will you let me come later? And will you believe how much I should like it in my normal state and how much I&#x02014;like <hi rend="italic">you</hi>

          <p>You are kind, to write me a letter &#x0201C;all to myself&#x0201D; (as the Children say) about coming with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to Fryston!&#x02014; More than <hi rend="italic">kind</hi>! it strikes me as almost <hi rend="italic">heroic</hi>, to take graciously to the Bore of an extraneous Individual in one&#x02019;s House; when one has just had a bad illness, and is still feeling ill.</p>
          <p>I am afraid, however, that all in admiring your sweet nature, I should not have been unselfish enough to keep away, in the fear of being tiresome! Had not other quite selfish fears decided me to stay at home&#x02014;while my Husband is away seeking&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> a golden fleece<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">In Greek mythology, Jason&#x02019;s quest for the golden fleece was to reclaim his rightful kingdom.</note>
 (it is to be feared.</p>

 You would be quite pleased with Arthur Helps, if you heard how he speaks of your Father! I don&#x02019;t know if he have written to him; but I am very sure he has taken his illness to heart more than many who would have filled pages with words about it! He is the least demonstrative of men but faithful and kind&#x02014;to the heart&#x02019;s core! I think!</p>

            <hi rend="italic">There</hi>!&#x02014;I never sit down to write a letter I am wishful to write, but the Public bursts in! I have just had four Ladies here, and, two are here still&#x02014;will stay till the carriage comes to take me for my drive&#x02014;</p>

          <salute>My dear Aunts</salute>
          <p>It is long since I have written; and I have not leisure for a satisfactory letter even now. But I want you to have these two admissions in good time, in case you desire to hear poor M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Address</hi>, and dont know how to manage it. If you dont care about it or cant for any other reason use the admissions or either of them; please return them to me forthwith. For the thing comes off this day week and there is a great demand for them.</p>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was too modest when asked by the University people <hi rend="italic">how many</hi> admissions he wished reserved for himself and required only <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi> for men, and <hi rend="italic">six</hi> for women&#x02014;or, as I suppose, they would say in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x02014;&#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Ladies</hi>&#x02019;! Four have been given away to <hi rend="italic">Ladies</hi> who have shown him great kindness at one time or other. and the two left he sends to you in preference to some dozen other <hi rend="italic">Ladies</hi> who have applied for them directly or indirectly&#x02014;so you see the propriety of my request to have one or both returned if you are prevented from using them yourselves.</p>
          <p>I am afraid and he himself is certain; his address will be a sad break-down to Human expectation! He has had no practice in Public Speaking&#x02014;hating it with all his heart! And then he <hi rend="italic">does</hi> S<hi rend="small-caps">peak</hi>&#x02014;does not merely read or repeat from memory a composition elaborately prepared&#x02014;in fact, as in the case of his predecessor <hi rend="italic">printed before</hi> it was &#x0201C;delivered&#x0201D;!!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">William Ewart Gladstone; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18651107-TC-JAC-01">

          <p>I wish him well thro&#x02019; it, for I am very fearful the worry and flurry of the <pb id="pg-43-144" n="43:144" />thing will make him <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>. After speculating all winter about going myself; my heart failed me as the time drew near, and I realized more clearly the nervousness and pain in my Back that so much fuss was sure to bring on&#x02014; I did not dread the bodily fatigue but the mental. We were to have broken the journey into two by stopping a few days at Lord Houghtons in Yorkshire and after giving up Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I thought for a while I would still go as far as the Houghtons, and wait there till M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C returned. But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> part of the business I also decided against, only two days since! preferring to reserve Yorkshire till summer, and till I was in a more tranquil frame of mind.</p>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is going to stay while in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at Thomas Erskine&#x02019;s, our dear old friend&#x02014;not however because of liking him better than anyone else there, but because of his being most out of the way of&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">railway whistles</hi>!! It was worthwhile however to have talked of accompanying M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, to have given so much enthusiastic hospitality an opportunity for displaying itself! One of the letters of invitation I had quite pleasantly surprised me by its warmth and eagerness; being from a quarter where I hardly believed myself remembered&#x02014;David Aitken and Eliza Stodart!&#x02014; They had both grown into sticks I was thinking!</p>
          <p>But I have no time to gossip&#x02014;</p>
          <p>Do send me soon some word of Robert<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;Her dying cousin&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:311); see also <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660123-JWC-GW-01">

 to be let see M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle in some way, when in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. He is sure to be kept in a whirl of things, all the time, which might prevent him, of himself, getting out to Greenend to see her. And it would be a grievous disappointment to the dear Soul, should he come and go, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> not so much as shake hands with him! And she will have had some disappointment already, in my failing to fulfil the expectation, I had stupidly raised in her, of seeing <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> on &#x0201C;this (what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C calls) lamentable occasion.&#x0201D;</p>
          <p>I might have written to her (without troubling <hi rend="italic">you</hi>) to call at your House, and inquire for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C; but she might have happened to come at exactly the wrong moment&#x02014;when he was out or engaged, and so have had her journey in vain. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at this distance couldn&#x02019;t appoint a time for her. But you can, and <hi rend="italic">will</hi>&#x02014;won&#x02019;t you?&#x02014;or you might settle with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to go with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to her cottage.

I was in the saddest sickly mood, full of gloom and misery, but striving to hide it; she too looked very pale and ill, but seemed intent only on forgetting nothing that could further me. A little flask, holding perhaps two glasses, of fine brandy, she brought me as a thought of her own:&#x02014;I did keep a little drop of that brandy (<hi rend="italic">hers</hi>, such was a superstition I had), and mixed it in a tumbler of water in that wild scene of the Address,&#x02014;and afterwards told her I had done so; thank Heaven that I remembered that in one of my hurried Notes. The last I saw of her was as she stood with her back to the Parlour-door to bid me her good-bye. She kissed me twice (she me once, I her a second time)&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 188). Tyndall also later described the parting: &#x0201C;I drove to Cheyne Row, and found him punctually ready at the appointed hour. On a table in a small back parlour below-stairs stood a &#x02018;siphon,&#x02019; protected by wickerwork. Carlyle was conservative in habit, and in his old age he held on to the brown brandy which was in vogue in his young days. Into a tumbler Mrs. Carlyle poured a moderate quantity of this brandy, and filled it up with the foaming water from the siphon. He drank it off, and they kissed each other&#x02014;for the last time. At the door she suddenly said to me, &#x02018;For God&#x02019;s sake send me one line by telegraph when all is over.&#x02019; This said, and the promise given, we drove away&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 12).</note>

          <p>
            <salute>Dearest mine,</salute>&#x02014;You got a very bad Letter yest<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from the Professor; &#x26; I wrote none myself, lest it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been worse. Today, however, that is all changed, and I can send you <hi rend="italic">good</hi> news,&#x02014;thank Heaven! In fact my first night here, owing to railway and other <hi rend="italic">noises</hi> all thro&#x02019;, not to speak of excitat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, talkings dinnering &#x26;c, was <hi rend="italic">totally</hi> sleepless;&#x02014;a night of wandering, starting to (vain) tobacco, and utter misery;&#x02014;and little wanted but that in the morning, I had been off, post-haste, for York &#x26; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> direct; uncertain Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> too, &#x26; some wild hope of finding a <hi rend="italic">noiseless</hi> bed at Auchtertool on the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> night after taking wing! But all this, by my own reflexion &#x26; everybody&#x02019;s kindness, was wisely overruled. I breakfasted with beautiful judiciousness, by myself, a simple egg-tea (coffee not to be relied on) and dry toast just as at home; rode 14 miles with Tyndall (horses <hi rend="italic">w</hi>d gallop instead of <hi rend="italic">walk</hi>, as I meant);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall later wrote: &#x0201C;In due time we reached Freystone [Fryston], where the warmest of welcomes greeted Carlyle. &#x02026; Railways had multiplied; they clasped Freystone as in a ring, and their whistles were energetically active all night. I feared the result, and my fears were only too well grounded. In the morning I found Carlyle in his bedroom, wild with his sufferings. He had not slept a wink. It ought to be noted that the day previous he had dined two or three hours later than was his wont, and had engaged in a vigorous discussion after dinner. Looking at me despairingly, he said, &#x02018;I can stay no longer at Freystone, another such night would kill me.&#x02019;&#x02026; I spoke to Lord Houghton, who, though sorely disappointed, agreed that it was best to allow his guest complete freedom of action. It was accordingly arranged that we should push on to Edinburgh. &#x02026; As he breakfasted our projects were discussed. Once, after a pause, he exclaimed, &#x02018;How ungrateful it is on my part, after so much kindness, to quit Freystone in this fashion.&#x02019; Taking prompt advantage of this moment of relenting, I said, &#x02018;Do not quit it, but stay. We will take a pair of horses and gallop over the country for five or six hours. When you return you shall have a dinner like what you are accustomed to at home, and I will take care that there shall be no discussions afterwards.&#x02019; He laughed, which was a good sign. &#x2F; The animal bestrode by Carlyle was a large bony grey, with a terribly hard mouth. He seemed disposed to bolt, and obviously required a strong wrist to rein him in. Carlyle was no longer young: <hi rend="italic">paralysis agitans</hi> had enfeebled his right hand&#x02014;for some time my anxiety was great. But after sundry imprecations and strenuous backward pulls, the horse was at length clearly mastered by its rider, and we fleetly sped along&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 12&#x02013;13).</note> dined <pb id="pg-43-151" n="43:151" />by myself strictly <hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la Warren</hi>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">As provided by Mrs. Warren, the Carlyles&#x02019; cook.</note>
 lay down there on my <hi rend="italic">not</hi> too quiet sofa; and, by Heaven&#x02019;s blessing, had for the first time an hour &#x26; half of real <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>. Continued <hi rend="italic">retirement</hi> &#x26;cbro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me to pillow ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (having done the <hi rend="italic">civils</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">distance</hi>); &#x26; shortly after midnight I fell sound asleep, sound till ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 6 a.m., &#x26; two after hours added to boot! So that today I am a new man;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall continued: &#x0201C;At six o&#x02019;clock his simple dinner was set before him, and he was warned against discussion. &#x02026; I accompanied him to his bedroom, every chink and fissure of which had been closed to stop out both light and sound. &#x02018;I have no hope of sleep,&#x02019; he said, &#x02018;and I will come to your room at seven in the morning.&#x02019; My reply was, &#x02018;I think you will sleep, and if so, I will come to your room instead of your coming to mine.&#x02019;&#x02026; At seven o&#x02019;clock, accordingly, I stood at his door. There was no sound. Returning at eight, I found the same dead silence. At nine, hearing a rustle, I opened his door and found him dressing. The change from the previous evening was astonishing. Never before or afterwards did I see Carlyle&#x02019;s countenance glow with such happiness. It was seraphic. &#x02026; He looked at me with boundless blessedness in his eyes and voice. &#x02018;My dear friend, I am a totally new man; I have slept nine hours without once awaking.&#x02019; That night&#x02019;s rest proved the prelude and guarantee of his subsequent triumph at Edinburgh&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 13&#x02013;14).</note> &#x26; by ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> riding, ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> &#x26;c&#x26;c, hope to arrive in Edin<hi rend="italic">r better</hi> not worse than at start<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, and get thro&#x02019; my paltry bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> in some tolerably harmless way. Huxley<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thomas Henry Huxley; he was to be awarded an LL.D. on the same occasion as TC&#x02019;s rectorial address; Thomas Erskine was also to be awarded an LL.D.</note> came yesterday: we are to start ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 9 a.m. (that, at least is what I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like), and arrive in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 4&#xBD; p.m.; failing that, we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go at noon, have to dine in York ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2, &#x26; not get to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> till 8&#xBD; (say 9) p.m. Courage, Dearest; all will go right! Only let me have at &#x0201C;11. Great Stuart Street&#x0201D; a little bulletin (favourable) from thyself), &#x26; all is safe so far.</p>
          <p>This place is beautiful in the spring sun, in the fine seclusion; &#x26; everybody is intent to be good &#x26; kind:&#x02014;all considered, however, it was perhaps better for you <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to come! As well quiet at home among y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own old objects &#x26; intimates. We are not to be called an interesting society;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">The other visitors at Fryston included James Kitson (<date when="1835">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1911">1911</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34343"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Leeds locomotive manufacturer and politician; Count Adolphe de Circourt (<date when="1801">1801</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>), diplomat, scholar, traveler, and journalist; John Ferguson McLennan (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x02013;<date when="1881">81</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17666"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), social anthropologist; and Thomas Hirst (<date when="1830">1830</date>&#x02013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13364"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), mathematician. It was presumably Kitson who recalled &#x0201C;the almost ferocious way in which, turning upon him as though he were the incarnation of the guilt of which he had to complain, Carlyle said, &#x02018;They tell me, sir, that the people of Leeds have set up a roaring blast furnace in the middle of the ruins of Kirkstall Abbey; is that so or is it not?&#x02019; Even the assurance that the outrage of which he spoke had not been committed hardly sufficed to calm his temper, and that first evening at Fryston was one of somewhat mingled experiences. But a good night&#x02019;s rest made Carlyle a different creature. Next morning he was tolerant, amiable and good-natured to everybody&#x0201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 2:148).</note>

          <p>But here they all are, back from &#x0201C;Church service&#x0201D; so-called;&#x02014;and I will abruptly close. God keep my own poor little <hi rend="italic">Schatz</hi> [darling] for me; &#x26; send us soon into contact ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!&#x02014;</p>

          <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
          <p>Tyndall sent you a doleful enough Letter yesterday; but thank Heaven I can send you a very diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> one today!</p>
          <p>In fact Yesterday morning, after a night of more misery (railway trains every &#188; of an hour, and not one wink of sleep had), I was within an inch of starting at once for York, in the passionate hope of catching you there, &#x26; speeding on to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; finis,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; what you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have done for me <hi rend="italic">there</hi> was so very uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi>!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>But instead Tyndall strengthened my hands in the course I preferred of vigorous <hi rend="italic">riding</hi>, of strict dieting, absolute <hi rend="italic">seclusion</hi>; &#x26; the consequence I have got back my <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>,&#x02014;am all myself ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; resolute still for another ride &#x26; a strict day;&#x02014;and hope to join you <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> in better case than you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have hoped. Pray Heaven it be so.</p>
          <p>What our train is I cannot yet absolutely learn,&#x02014;owing to <hi rend="italic">gen</hi>l defect of Bradshaw<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Railway timetable.</note> Science here:&#x02014;but the course <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will strive for is, To leave Castleford (say 4 miles &#x0201C;down&#x0201D; from this) <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>t 9 a.m. (or perhaps it is leaving <hi rend="italic">this</hi> at 9?) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> brings us, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem, to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4&#xBD; p.m.,&#x02014;in the way recommended by his L<hi rend="italic">p</hi>

But everybody is out, or just coming home from Church; &#x26; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can&#x02019;t say.&#x02014; <hi rend="italic">Failing</hi> this plan, we may be looked for (Huxley, Ty<hi rend="italic">l</hi> &#x26; I) by the Mail train 8&#xBD; p.m.&#x02014; Tyndall, if I can manage, will, before 6 (post-<pb id="pg-43-153" n="43:153" />hour<supplied>[)]</supplied> this ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, announce wh<hi rend="italic">h is</hi> the hour really fixed on.

          <salute>Dearest</salute>
          <p>By the time you get this, you will be out of your trouble, better or worse,&#x02014;but <hi rend="italic">out of it</hi>, please God! And if ever you let yourself be led or driven into such a horrid thing again, I will never forgive you! never!</p>
          <p>What I have been suffering, vicariously, of late days, is not to be told! If you had been to be <hi rend="italic">hanged</hi>, I don&#x02019;t see that I could have taken it more to heart! This morning, after about two hours of off-and-on sleep, I awoke&#x02014;long before daylight&#x02014;to sleep no more! While drinking a glass of wine and eating a biscuit at five in the morning; it came into my mind what is <hi rend="italic">He</hi> doing, I wonder, at this moment? and then instead of picturing you sitting smoking, up the stranger chimney, or anything else that was likely to <hi rend="italic">be</hi>; I found myself always dropping off into details of a regular <hi rend="italic">execution</hi>! now they will be telling him it is time! now they will be pinioning his arms! and saying last words! Oh mercy! was I dreaming or waking? was I mad or sane?&#x02014; Upon my word I hardly know <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!&#x02014; Only that I have been having next to no sleep all the week&#x02014;and that at the best of times I have a too &#x0201C;fertile Imagination,&#x0201D; like &#x0201C;oor David&#x0201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;A lying boy at Haddington, whom his mother excused in that way&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:317).</note>
          </p>
          <p>When the thing is <hi rend="italic">over</hi> I shall be content&#x02014;however it have gone, as to making a good &#x0201C;appearance&#x0201D; or a bad one! That you have made your &#x0201C;address&#x0201D; and are <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is what I long to hear, and please God <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> hear in a few <pb id="pg-43-155" n="43:155" />hours!

          <p>I made so sure of a letter this morning&#x02014;from some of you! And &#x0201C;nothing but a double letter <hi rend="italic">for</hi> Miss Welsh!&#x0201D;</p>
          <p>Perhaps I should, that is, <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have contented myself with Tyndall&#x02019;s adorable Telegram,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Tyndall&#x02019;s telegram, &#x0201C;A perfect triumph,&#x0201D; was sent from the telegraph office nearest to the Music Hall, George St., where the address was given; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660403-TC-JWC-01">

</ref>.</note> which reached me at Cheyne Row five minutes after six last evening! Considering the sensation it made!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren and Maggie were helping to dress me for Forster&#x02019;s Birth-day when the Telegraph Boy gave his double knock&#x02014; &#x0201C;There it is!&#x0201D; I said. &#x0201C;I am afraid cousin, it is only the Postman&#x0201D; said Maggie. Jessie rushed up with the Telegram. I tore it open and read &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">from John Tyndall</hi> (Oh God bless John Tyndall in this world and the next!) <hi rend="italic">to M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle </hi>&#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">A perfect triumph</hi>&#x0201D;&#x02014; I read it to myself and then read it aloud to the gaping chorus, and chorus all began to dance and clap their hands&#x02014; &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Eh M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>! Eh Hear to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x0201D; cried Jessie. &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> told you Mam! cried M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> told you how it would be!&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Im so glad, Cousin! you&#x02019;ll be all right now Cousin!&#x0201D; twittered Maggie, executing a sort of leap-frog round me. And they went on clapping their hands, till there arose among them a sudden cry for&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Brandy</hi>! &#x0201C;Get her some Brandy&#x0201D;! &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">do</hi> Mam swallow this spoonful of Brandy!&#x02014;just a spoonful&#x0201D;! For you see the sudden solution of the nervous tension with which I had been holding in my anxieties for days nay weeks past, threw me into as pretty a little fit of hysterics as you ever saw.</p>
          <p>I went to Forsters nevertheless with my Telegram in my hand<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Forster&#x02019;s 55th birthday dinner; he later recalled JWC&#x02019;s buoyant mood that evening: &#x0201C;Tyndall had told her of the triumph just before dinner. She came to us flourishing the telegram in her hand, and the radiance of her enjoyment of it was upon her all night. Among other things she gave Dickens the subject for a novel, from what she had herself observed at the outside of a house in her street; of which the various incidents were drawn from the condition of its blinds and curtains, the costumes visible at its windows, the cabs at its door, its visitors admitted or rejected, its articles of furniture delivered or carried away; and the subtle serious humour of it all, the truth in trifling bits of character, and the gradual progress into a half romantic interest, had enchanted the skilled novelist. She was well into the second volume of her small romance before she left, being as far as her observation then had taken her; but in a few days exciting incidents were expected, the denouement could not be far off, and Dickens was to have it when they met again&#x0201D; (Forster, <hi rend="italic">Dickens</hi> 3:277). JWC was presumably basing her narrative on observations of her neighbors, 6 Cheyne Row: &#x0201C;It is a house full of Misteries No 6! I have thoughts of writing a novel about it&#x0201D; (JWC to Mary Russell, <date when="1865-12-25">25 Dec. 1865</date>).</note> and &#x0201C;John <pb id="pg-43-156" n="43:156" />Tyndall&#x0201D; in the core of my heart! And it was pleasant to see with what hearty good will all there, Dickens, Wilkie Collins,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Wilkie Collins (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x02013;<date when="1889">89</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5961"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), writer.</note>
 as well as Fuzz, received the news. and we drank your health with great glee! Maggie came in the evening and Fuzz in his joy over you sent out a glass of Brandy to Silvester!!

 sorrow on <hi rend="italic">it</hi>!) So that you may fairly go to sleep ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; as I hope the next little note will tell me you have done: the note of this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> was very kind, but very distressing withal. You may depend on it, all is finished, rather well then, and infinitely better than I often expected. You never saw such a tempest of enthusiastic excitat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as that among the student people,&#x02014;poor young souls, following me thro the streets with their vivats &#x26; vociferat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>
            <note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tyndall later recalled: &#x0201C;The eventful day came, and we assembled in the ante-room of the hall in which the address was to be delivered&#x02014;Carlyle in his rector&#x02019;s robe, Huxley, Ramsay [Andrew Crombie Ramsay (<date when="1814">1814</date>&#x02013;<date when="1891">91</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23076"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), geologist], Erskine, and myself in more sober gowns. We were all four to be doctored. The great man of the occasion had declined the honour, pleading humorously that in heaven there might be some confusion between him and his brother John, if they both bore the title of doctor. &#x02026; Carlyle stood up, threw off his robe &#x02026; and in his carefully-brushed brown morning coat came forward to the table. With nervous fingers he grasped the leaf, and stooping over it looked earnestly down upon the audience. &#x02018;They tell me,&#x02019; he said, &#x02018;that I ought to have written this address, and of deference to the counsel I tried to do so, once, twice, thrice. But what I wrote was only fit for the fire, and to the fire it was compendiously committed. You must therefore listen to and accept what I say to you as coming straight from the heart.&#x02019; He began, and the world already knows what he said. &#x02026; For an hour and a half he held them spellbound, and when he ended the emotion previously pent up burst forth in a roar of acclamation. With a joyful heart and clear conscience I could redeem my promise to Mrs. Carlyle. From the nearest telegraph office I sent her a despatch of three words: &#x02018;A perfect triumph,&#x02019; and returned towards the hall. Noticing a commotion in the street, I came up with the crowd. It was no street brawl, it was not the settlement of a quarrel, but a consensus of acclamation&#x02014;cheers and &#x02018;bravos,&#x02019; and a general shieing of caps into the air! Looking ahead I saw two venerable old men walking slowly arm-in-arm in advance of the crowd. They were Carlyle and Erskine. The rector&#x02019;s audience had turned out to do honour to their hero. Nothing in the whole ceremony affected Carlyle so deeply as this display of fervour in the open air&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 15&#x02013;16).

On the day on which Mr. Carlyle addressed the students in the large Music Hall, Mr. Erskine, knowing how great was the effort for a retired man of Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s years, and anxious how he might feel after it was over, had asked no one to dinner for that day. When the address was well achieved, and Mr. Erskine found that Mr. Carlyle was none the worse, but rather the better for the deliverance, he asked two or three of his intimate friends to come and join a quiet dinner-party. That evening Sir William Stirling Maxwell sat at the foot of the table, and with nice tact gave such turn to the conversation as allowed fullest scope to the sage who has praised silence so well, but fortunately does not practise it. Released from his burden, Mr. Carlyle was in excellent spirits, and discoursed in his most genial mood of his old Dumfriesshire remembrances, of the fate of James IV., and other matters of Scottish history, and of the then Emperor Napoleon, of whom, as may be imagined, he was no admirer&#x0201D; (J.

</ref>), which arrived 11:30 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi> (see below); it contained a report of the address prepared by Moncure Conway. The introduction noted: &#x0201C;Yesterday, Mr Carlyle, Rector of the University of Edinburgh, was installed into office in presence of a crowded audience of students and graduates in the Music Hall. &#x02026; [L]adies &#x02026; were admitted to the number of about two hundred to the front gallery, a few minutes before one o&#x02019;clock. Several personal friends of Mr Carlyle were afterwards admitted, and were accommodated with seats near the platform. About a quarter past one, the front doors were opened to members of the University Council and to students of the University. &#x02026; The Hall rapidly filled until the body of the building was crowded. &#x02026; Before two o&#x02019;clock the passages and every available inch of standing-room were taken up; and it was with the greatest difficulty that, on the arrival of the Vice-Chancellor&#x02019;s procession at that hour, a way was made for them through the central passage.&#x0201D;</note> or ordered one to be sent! I was up and dressed at 7, and it seemed such an interminable time till a quarter after nine when the Postman came&#x02014;bringing only a note about&#x02014;Cheltenham from Geraldine!</p>
          <p>The letter I had from Tyndall yesterday might have satisfied any ordinary man&#x02014;or woman; you would have said. But I dont pretend to be an ordinary man&#x02014;or woman I am perfectly <hi rend="italic">extra</hi>ordinary; especially in the power I possess of fretting and worrying myself into one fever after another, without any cause to speak of!</p>
          <p>
            <pb id="pg-43-160" n="43:160" />

      What do you suppose I am worrying about <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, because of the Scotsman having <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come? That there may be in it something about your having <hi rend="small-caps">fallen ill</hi>&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">which you wished me not to see</hi>! <hi rend="italic">This</hi> I am capable of fancying at moments; tho&#x02019; last evening I saw a man<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Alexander Macmillan.</note> who had seen you &#x0201C;smoking very quietly at Masson&#x02019;s,&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Prof. David Masson.</note> and had heard your speech, and, what was more to the purpose, (his semiarticulateness taken into account) brought me what he said was as good an account of it as any <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could give,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">already in the Pallmall Gazette</hi> written by a hearty admirer of long standing, evidently.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Moncure Conway also wrote the introductory note to the address report in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, <date when="1866-04-03">3 April</date>: &#x0201C;I have never heard a speech of whose more remarkable qualities so few can be conveyed on paper. You will read of &#x02018;applause&#x02019; and &#x02018;laughter,&#x02019; but you will little realize the eloquent blood flaming up the speaker&#x02019;s cheek, the kindling of his eye, or the inexpressible voice and look when the drolleries were coming out. When he spoke of clap-trap books exciting astonishment &#x02018;in the minds of foolish persons,&#x02019; the evident halting at the words &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">fools</hi>,&#x02019; and the smoothing of his hair, as if he must be decorous, which preceded the change to &#x02018;foolish persons,&#x02019; were exceedingly comical. As for the flaming bursts they took shape in grand tones, whose impression was made deeper, not by raising, but by lowering the voice. Your correspondent here declares that he should hold it worth his coming all the way from London in the rain in the Sunday night train were it only to have heard Carlyle say, &#x02018;There is a nobler ambition than the gaining of all California, or the getting of all the suffrages that are on the planet just now!&#x02019;&#x0201D; For the drawing of TC giving the address, see <sic>158</sic>.</note> It was so kind of Macmillan to come to me&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">before he had slept</hi>. He had gone in the morning straight from the Railway to his Shop &#x26; Work&#x02014; He seemed still under the <hi rend="italic">Emotion</hi> of the Thing Tears starting to his black eyes every time he mentioned any <hi rend="italic">moving</hi> part!!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>Now just look at that!

It gives a fair &#x26; just idea of the effect &#x26; the character of the address. There was something in it to my mind most touching&#x02014; As he looked on these young people entering on their wonderful career&#x02014;he could not but feel the deepest compassion&#x02014;especially as their reception of himself was so full of enthusiasm&#x02014; I hope to take him out to Betty&#x02019;s tomorrow or next day&#x02014;he cannot go today&#x02014;as he has to go through some of the ceremonial of his office [presiding over the University Court] . &#x02026; he is a thorough Scotchman &#x26; likes this town &#x26; his old memories of it&#x02014; &#x2F; With true love paternal &#x26; fraternal.&#x0201D;</note> David Aitken besides.</p>

Blackie [John Stuart Blackie] was just boisterous enough to carry off his peculiar species of humour. Ramsay, the geologist, sang a capital quiz of his great friend Sir Roderick [Sir Roderick Murchison], for returning to his patron the Russian Emperor, from the Ural, without finding for him any &#x02018;coal&#x02019; in any &#x02018;hole.&#x02019; Sir Wm.

          <salute>My dear Mr. Conway,</salute>
          <p>The &#x0201C;disposition to write me a little note&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Conway wrote, <date when="1866-04-03">3 April</date>: &#x0201C;I cannot resist a disposition I have tonight to write you a little note. I longed yesterday when Mr. Carlyle was speaking that you should have been present not only to witness the glowing enthusiasm of the students and the eminent men who were assembled in the Music Hall&#x02014;an enthusiasm which Mr. Carlyle well pronounced &#x02018;beautiful&#x02019;&#x02014;but that you should have heard the address itself. At no time during its delivery could you have felt nervous; for from the first it was evident that Carlyle was not only empowered by his feeling for the occasion, but by the steady tide of sympathy from his audience which fairly floated him. Like his best talks at his own fireside when his true pupils are about him&#x02014;and no higher could anyone wish him&#x02014;was his long discourse.&#x0201D;</note> was a good inspiration, and I thank you for it; or rather, accepting it as an inspiration, I thank Providence for it;&#x02014;Providence, &#x0201C;Immortal Gods,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Superior Powers,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Destinies&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590603-JWC-IEB-01">

      Indeed, by far the most agreable part of this flare up of success, to my feeling, has been the enthusiasm of personal affection and sympathy on the part of his friends. I haven&#x02019;t been so fond of everybody, and so pleased with the world since I was a girl, as just in these days when reading the letters of his friends your own included.</p>
          <p>I am not very well; having done what I do at every possible opportunity&#x02014;gone off my sleep; so I am preparing to spend a day and night at Windsor,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">To stay with Margaret Oliphant.</note> for change of atmosphere&#x02014;moral as well as material. I am in a hurry, but couldn&#x02019;t refrain from saying, &#x0201C;Thank you, and all good be with you!&#x0201D;</p>

I still refused to make out a bill, so he put down all the items he remembered, added them together, and said, &#x02018;I owe you so much.&#x02019; Looking over the account I retorted, with mock-sternness, &#x02018;I beg your pardon, you owe me fourpence halfpenny more.&#x02019; He laughed heartily, produced the fourpence halfpenny, which, with an air of business-like gravity, I pocketed, and bade him &#x02018;Good-bye&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 17).</note> he is to call on you directly after returning; <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> will call on Saturd<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, &#x26; report everything <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi>.</p>

          <p>Scotsbrig, I fancy will be the direction now.</p>

To say that it was a strange, weird, eloquent and emphatic discourse, is only another way of saying it was spoken by Mr. Carlyle in the full ripeness of his age and thought. From twenty things in the discourse we should thoroughly dissent; especially from such doctrines as that of good government by despots, and that of an heroic peerage down to the reign of Charles the First. Over some things we smile; such as the recommendation to young men to avoid literature and to read poor old Arthur Collins. But, taking these little bits of alloy with the pure gold of the discourse, we may very warmly congratulate the University of Edinburgh on this splendid exhibition of genius&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1866-04-07">7 April</date>).

          <p>I am returned from Windsor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Oliphant wrote to a friend sometime after <date when="1866-04-10">10 April</date>: &#x0201C;I have had a little visit from Mrs Carlyle, who is looking very feeble and picturesque, and as amusing as ever, and naturally has been taking away everybody&#x02019;s character, or perhaps I ought to say throwing light upon the domestic relations of the distinguished people of the period. I was remarking upon the eccentricity of the said relations, and could not but say that Mr Carlyle seemed the only virtuous philosopher we had. Upon which his wife answered, &#x02018;My dear, if Mr Carlyle&#x02019;s digestion had been stronger, there is no saying what he might have been!&#x02019;&#x0201D; (Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography and Letters</hi> 209).</note> within the last half hour&#x02014;and must now go and dress myself to dine with &#x0201C;Lady William&#x0201D; Tomorrow I cannot go to you, having invited <hi rend="italic">Sartorina</hi>

            <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>&#x02014;Yes, Conway&#x02019;s headings have struck me too as rather an obstruct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, smart tho&#x02019; they are.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Moncure Conway helped to prepare TC&#x02019;s rectorial address for publication. John A. Carlyle wrote to TC, [<date when="1866-04-08">8 April</date>]: &#x0201C;Last night I sent off the proofs of the address to you. &#x02026; I could find no errors in them as compared with the Scotsman report. But it appeared to me that the subdividings of Mr Conway rather interrupted the discourse &#x26; might have been omitted altogether, or indicated only on the margins. They want the necessary precision &#x26; rather deform the perfect symmetry of the whole. Of this however you yourself are the best judge.&#x0201D;</note>

Carlyle replied, <date when="1866-04-12">12 April</date>: &#x0201C;Both Mr Douglas &#x26; I think it will be best to put those headings of Conway &#x02026; opposite to the headings of &#x02018;Inaugural Address&#x02019; at the top of the pages &#x02026; &#x02018;Inaugural Address&#x02019; on left hand pages, &#x26; Conway&#x02019;s headings on right-hand pages.&#x0201D; The address was published in this way.

Then a <hi rend="italic">revise</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> shall return (a <hi rend="italic">slight</hi> thing) by return of post.&#x02014; If the Printer find my correct<hi rend="italic">ns difficult</hi>,&#x02014;help him; and say it is mainly <hi rend="italic">his own blame</hi>, who left me no margins!</p>

          <p>Masson&#x02019;s Irish Letters<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">John A. Carlyle forwarded two letters from James Rowley to David Masson, who had written, <date when="1866-04-07">7 April</date>: &#x0201C;Here are two notes to me from a Mr Rowley, to whom Mr Carlyle was kind enough to give an autograph admission to the Address&#x02014;the one acknowledging receipt of the admission &#x26; written from Ireland; the other from Glasgow on his return homewards. I rather think Mr Carlyle ought to see them&#x02014;as, from them &#x26; his previous notes, Rowley seems to be a very likeable &#x26; modest man.&#x0201D; James Rowley&#x02019;s first letter, <date when="1866-03-28">28 March</date>, thanked Masson for having obtained admission to the address for him: &#x0201C;For, indeed, you could have done me no greater favour: Mr Carlyle has been in my eyes for many years now the foremost man in all the world. In my loneliness here his works are priceless; and I have learned to admire and reverence him beyond all living men. &#x02026; If you would convey to [TC] my sincere thanks, when next you see him, you would oblige me exceedingly&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1775C.36). He wrote again, <date when="1866-04-04">4 April</date>: &#x0201C;Before leaving Scotland I wish to entreat you, if ever you should have occasion to require a service done you in Ireland, to reckon on me as at any rate most <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> to do it for you to the utmost of my ability. Whatever the nature of the thing may be, you will pleasure me greatly by using my poor energies without hesitation&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1775C.38). James Rowley not further identified.</note>
 I have not yet read; Spedding&#x02019;s of yesterday was really gratifying to me.</p>

          <salute>Dearest</salute>
          <p>I sent you better than a letter yesterday&#x02014;a charming <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>
            <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">The <date when="1866-04-14">14 April</date> issue (apparently available some days earlier) of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>, weekly satirical magazine.</note>

      &#x02014;which I hope you received in due course; but Geraldine undertook the posting of it, and as Ann<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Anne, servant at Cheyne Row <date when="1852">1852</date>&#x02013;<date when="1858">58</date>.</note> said of her long ago, &#x0201C;M<hi rend="small-caps">iss</hi> can write Books but I&#x02019;m sure it&#x02019;s the only thing she&#x02019;s fit for&#x0201D;!&#x02014;Well! there only wanted, to complete your celebrity, that you should be in the chief place of Punch! And there you are, cape &#x26; wideawake, making a really creditable appearance.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">&#x0201C;It came to Scotsbrig, with this letter, late at night; how merry it made us all: oh Heaven! &#x02018;merry!&#x02019;&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:328). <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> published a tribute to TC entitled &#x0201C;Lord Rector&#x0201D; accompanied by a full-page illustration, &#x0201C;Wisdom and Wind-bag,&#x0201D; by John Tenniel (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1914">1914</date>; <ref target="volume-43/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36458"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), artist and cartoonist. The article began: &#x0201C;While able and unable talkers, and others of the spouting sort, are going round the shallow political puddles, and lashing them into one knows not what mud splash and dirty water storms there riseth, brethren, in the very midst, as a silver fountain, one calm voice of a wise man. &#x02026; For, regard him how you may, this Thomas of Chelsea hath the root of the matter in him, while others do but wave branches, not altogether, it would seem, of olive. He goes for the Truth, when for the most part men are content to mumble truism, and not a few run jocundly away with lies. Uncomely may be the garb or outside form of his teaching, to those who love the trim gardens, but the Truth is with him.&#x0201D; The engraving was of TC in the forefront; the caption (taken from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> report, <date when="1866-04-04">4 April</date>, of his rectorial address) reads: &#x0201C;Wisdom Carlyle. &#x02018;For if a good speaker&#x02014;an eloquent speaker&#x02014;is not speaking the truth, is there a more horrid kind of object in creation?&#x02019; (<hi rend="italic">Loud cheers</hi>.)&#x0201D;; the parliamentary reformer John Bright is behind to TC&#x02019;s right, addressing a crowd; his caption reads: &#x0201C;Wind-bag Bright. &#x02018;The House of Commons is little better than a Sham and a Farce. Parliament is never hearty in any good work. It hated the Reform Bill, it hated the Repeal of the Corn Laws, it hates this Franchise Bill.&#x02019;&#x0201D; See 181.</note> I must repeat what I <pb id="pg-43-181" n="43:181" />
            <pb id="pg-43-182" n="43:182" />

      said before, that the best part of this &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">success</hi>&#x0201D; is the general feeling of <hi rend="italic">personal goodwill</hi> that pervades all they say and write about you. Even <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> cuddles you and purrs over you as if you were his favourite son! From <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> to Terry the green grocer,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Not further identified.</note> is a good step; but let me tell you, he (Terry) asked M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren; <hi rend="italic">was</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle the person they wrote of as <hi rend="italic">Lord Rector</hi>, and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren having answered in her stage voice &#x0201C;the <hi rend="italic">very</hi> same&#x0201D;! Terry shouted out&#x02014;&#x0201C;(quite <hi rend="italic">shouted</hi> it Mam!)&#x0201D; I never was so glad of anything!&#x02014;by George!&#x02014;I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> glad&#x0201D;!&#x02014; Both M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren and Jessy rushed out and bought <hi rend="italic">Punches</hi> to send to their families; and in the fervour of their mutual enthusiasm they have actually ceased hostilities&#x02014;for <hi rend="italic">the present</hi>.

The verses with which he concluded made a deep impression upon me, and I tried to find them in my German books, in order to learn the poem in the original. I could not find them, however, and after thinking of nothing but Carlyle and his speech for some days, I once more wrote. &#x02026;  Of course I wrote to Chelsea, not knowing his address in Scotland; and it has been interesting to me, since the publication of Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s letters [pbd. <date when="1883">1883</date>], to find that I owe the fact that Mr. Carlyle granted my (I cannot but now think, most audacious) request, to her kind and womanly sympathy. &#x02026; Perhaps it was because thus commended by his wife to his notice [see Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:330], that Mr. Carlyle, in the midst of his engagements and business, took the trouble to answer me&#x0201D; (Blanche Atkinson, &#x0201C;My Four Letters From Carlyle,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> 33 [<date when="1892">1892</date>]: 459).

I have looked through the book of his short poems, and cannot find it, and so thought perhaps you would tell me where it is, for I want to read it in German. &#x2F; I know what a great deal I am asking from you, and I am quite conscious of the great difference and distance between you and me. The difference would be less if I were even a boy instead of a girl, but as it is, I know it is the utmost presumption in me to ask such a favour, and will be the utmost condescension in you to grant it, and I have only dared to ask you because I know that you are as good and kind as you are great and wise&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> 459).</note> Just write <hi rend="italic">page</hi> and <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> at the end of what I am now writing, and despatch it in the cover she has sent.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Neuberg sent TC&#x02019;s letter on to Atkinson, with the information as instructed; she later wrote: &#x0201C;Mr. Neuberg kindly added the name of the poem, the first verse (omitted by Mr. Carlyle), and the page and volume where it would be found&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> 460).

Neuberg wrote, <date when="1866-04-12">12 April</date>, thanking him for the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> and for sending stamps for his sister&#x02019;s children: &#x0201C;&#x02018;It was very kind in D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to think of us&#x02019; said Gertrude [Neuberg&#x02019;s niece] tenderly.&#x0201D; Neuberg, unable to attend the inaugural because of ill-health, commented: &#x0201C;The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> was very welcome at Hastings where we were staying for the holidays. The report in it was an improvement upon that in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which had various obvious blunders, besides such German spelling as &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Ehrfurt</hi>&#x02019; for <hi rend="italic">Erfurcht</hi>! But both reports have &#x02018;gloomy, austere, aesthetic people,&#x02019; where the spoken word evidently is <hi rend="italic">ascetic</hi>.&#x02014; &#x2F; The address itself, with its deep-toned reality, and its appropriateness as advice to young students meant to be followed,&#x02014;forms a singular contrast to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gladstone&#x02019;s long-winded far-fetched sophistries of last year! It is very beautiful, and was to me, in several parts, very touching. On the whole it seems to have been a satisfactory and successful ceremony: a meet scene in the evening of your Brother&#x02019;s life,&#x02014;and a memorable day in the Annals of the University&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>

            <salute>Dearest, Sweetest, Beautifulest!</salute>

      &#x02014;Oh my Darling!&#x02014; How long you stay away; and Life so short!&#x02014; The night before M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C started for Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to deliver that dreadful &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">address</hi>,&#x02019; we were talking over people we knew, going from London to hear it. And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said plaintively; &#x0201C;Had Lady Ashburton been in this country, as she ought to have been, S<hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> would have been for going to hear me and we <hi rend="italic">might have done</hi>
            <hi rend="small-caps">nice things together</hi>

       !&#x0201D;&#x02014; What <hi rend="italic">did</hi> he mean? &#x0201C;nice things?&#x0201D;!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>When you come home you must make friendship with Professor Tyndall. He is a Jewel, that man! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wrote to me of him from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; &#x0201C;no adoring son ever watched more carefully and tenderly over a decrepit old Father than Tyndall has done over <hi rend="italic">me</hi>! I shall never forget him!&#x0201D;&#x02014; And myself he kept <hi rend="small-caps">in</hi>
            <hi rend="italic">my skin</hi>

       , with a constant supply of Telegrams and letters. You should have seen the arrival of the Telegram to tell me it was all well over! For several <hi rend="italic">days</hi> I had been &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">suffering Martyrs</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; a saying of Etienne Paulet&#x02019;s; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560829-JWC-TC-01">

</ref>.</note> (as a french friend of mine used to express it);&#x02014;from no over anxiety about the <hi rend="italic">success of the Speech</hi> when spoken; but from a wild idea that it might never get spoken at all!&#x02014;that what with previous sleeplessness and wild hubbub, and close air of the overcrowded room, and the whole unsuitability of the thing,&#x02014;when he rose up to speak he might <hi rend="italic">probably</hi> instead, <hi rend="italic">drop down dead</hi>! I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it was a <hi rend="italic">morbid</hi> idea,&#x02014;due partly to the shock I had received from the sudden death of a friends Husband (Major Venturi) but&#x02014;if it was my idea, what difference, in point of feeling did it make whether it was <hi rend="italic">morbid</hi> or <hi rend="italic">healthy</hi>? So you may conceive how my heart leapt into my throat at the sound of the Telegraph double knock.&#x02014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was still speaking at four o&#x02019;clock and at Three minutes after six I had the Telegram!&#x02014;</p>

          <p>I read it to myself, then read it aloud to my Cousin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Maggie Welsh.</note> staying with me, and both the maids, who all waited gaping for the contents; and forwith fell to clapping their hands and ejaculating like a Greek Chorus. &#x0201C;Eh the Maister!

And then the chorus combined in a cry for&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">brandy</hi>!&#x02014; &#x0201C;Where&#x02019;s the Brandy?&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Run for the Brandy&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Dont you see the mistress is <hi rend="italic">going off</hi>!&#x0201D;&#x02014;&#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">where </hi>
            <hi rend="small-caps">to</hi>

      &#x0201D;? I asked, in the midst of my outburst of weeping; all my Life I have so hated to be thought <hi rend="italic">hysterical</hi>; but I swallowed the Brandy.</p>
          <p>Miss Bromley was here the night before last; I had a small tea party; Saffi and his bright little Patriot-Wife,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Aurelio and Giorgina Saffi; they were both followers and friends of Mazzini.</note> Geraldine Jewsbury, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Twisleton, George Cooke.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">Edward Boyd Twisleton and John George Cooke.</note> I wanted M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Twisleton and Miss Bromley to <hi rend="italic">take to</hi> one another; I thought he would be an agreeable addition to her men.

          <p>You have sent me a message by Miss Anstruther<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss">Annie Nairn Anstruther, niece of Lady Ashburton.</note> and I have never received it. I shouldn&#x02019;t have known she had returned, had not Miss Bromley told me the other day, and expressed surprise that she (Miss Anstruther) had not come to see me, as she had said, she had &#x0201C;brought <hi rend="italic">things</hi> from Lady Ashburton to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton wrote to JWC from Menton, the Riviera, SE France, <date when="1866-03-26">26 March</date>: &#x0201C;Will you use these little Candlesticks when you take your Bedroom Candle, for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake? &#x26; believe how true &#x26; bright my love burns, &#x26; always <hi rend="italic">will</hi> burn&#x02014;&#x2F; This is a mere hurried line by Annie who takes all these things&#x02014;Please ask dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle to allow this piece of olive wood, to keep down the papers he has <hi rend="italic">nearest</hi> to him&#x02014;?&#x0201D;</note> but (she had added) it <hi rend="italic">wouldn&#x02019;t signify</hi>

Now that is all comfortably over, and a thing to look thankfully back upon, there is no feature of it prettier to me than that your kind chamber in the wall should have been my safe lodging-place (three &#x0201C;chambers&#x0201D; or almost four, as Cairns<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Erskine&#x02019;s butler; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660401-TC-JWC-01">

          <p>Yesterday was a most furious tempest, of wind &#x26; fierce showers: and I had two great griefs; <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, the immediate loss of Mary, on Jean&#x02019;s arrival; up here we had all agreed that Mary was to stay till next day; but down-stairs Jamie (jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) perem[p]torily settled it the other way,&#x02014;and poor Mary, coming up to take leave of me, &#x26; finding me writing, glided out ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and had over the hills like a dream!

 that I was left with my <hi rend="italic">lame</hi> resources to fish for &#x0201C;exercise,&#x0201D; as I pleased, in the tempestuous day!

A deep and settled happiness had taken possession of her mind; though she still could afford a flash of sarcasm for one of the Edinburgh audience who had visited her the day before. The glow of pride in her husband was obvious enough. Not before a select few, but before the world at large, he had won for himself renown, and for her choice of him, justification. &#x02026; We chatted long over the occurrences in the north, which I thought would give her a new lease of happy life. Referring to her anxiety about the Address she said she had never entertained the thought of his breaking down. As long as he had life there was no fear of that. But she thought it quite possible that life itself might snap, and that he might fall down dead before the people. It must have been her lithe fingers, and her high-strung nerves, that gave to the pressure of her hand an elastic intensity which I have not noticed elsewhere&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 17&#x02013;18).</note>&#x02014;Crossing the Hall I noticed, for the first time, that officials <pb id="pg-43-202" n="43:202" />were hurrying about, and asked the one nearest me; &#x0201C;is there to be <hi rend="italic">Lecturing</hi> here today&#x0201D;?

Mrs Carlyle was radiant, and had brought &#x02018;Punch&#x02019; for me to see. The cartoon for the week was &#x02018;Wisdom and Windbag&#x02019;: on the one side Bright lampooned as &#x02018;Windbag&#x02019;; Carlyle, with grave dignity, on the other side, was &#x02018;Wisdom,&#x02019; and an extract from his speech was given. She was full of wifely pride and triumph, and was anxious for me to share in her pleasure. My father talked with her a great deal that afternoon, and after she had gone, told me Mrs Carlyle had promised him a copy of &#x02018;Past and Present.&#x02019; &#x2F; To the end of time I shall remember that bright little visit, for it was the last.

</ref>), presumably one from Forster and one from John A. Carlyle. There are several versions of that afternoon; Jessie Hiddleston later wrote: &#x0201C;I was going to identify the body. I gave &#x02026; Mr. Blunt a letter I had with me from Mr. Carlyle to Mrs. Carlyle, which had arrived that afternoon from Scotland. &#x02026; The letter was lying on the lobby table when Silvester came for me; and I just took it in my hand, as I knew it would say where Mr. Carlyle was, and that information would be wanted&#x0201D; (Blunt, &#x0201C;CHH&#x0201D; 464&#x02013;65). Reginald Blunt recalled his father&#x02019;s dilemma: &#x0201C;When my father arrived at Cheyne Row he found a situation of sad anxiety. No one knew definitely where Carlyle was. Should they open Carlyle&#x02019;s letter? And would it be possible to avoid an inquest? With some hesitation it was decided to open the letter. He remembers that it was dated from Dumfries, and began with the one word &#x02018;Dearest.&#x02019; No more was read; the letter was replaced and the envelope closed; telegrams were sent to John Carlyle and Dr. John Brown [both in Edinburgh] asking them to break the news as best they could at Dumfries&#x0201D; (Blunt, &#x0201C;CHH&#x0201D; 465). Froude later wrote that he was called on by a Cheyne Row servant, and, collecting Geraldine Jewsbury, they drove to the hospital. He then went on to Cheyne Row, where he &#x0201C;found Forster half-distracted, yet, with his vigorous sense, alive to what must immediately be done. Mr. Blunt, the Rector of Chelsea, was also there; he, too, dreadfully shaken, but collected and considerate. Two points had to be considered: how to communicate the news to Carlyle; and how to prevent an inquest and an examination of the body, which Forster said would kill him&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:312&#x02013;13). Froude did not mention TC&#x02019;s letter in his account of the scene: &#x0201C;As to Carlyle, we did not know precisely where he was, whether at Dumfries or Scotsbrig. In that uncertainty a telegram was sent to John Carlyle at Edinburgh, another to Dr. John Brown, should John Carlyle be absent&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:314). For John Brown, see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18651122-TC-JAC-01">

He was in a state of uncontrolled distraction and excitement as to how an inquest, which he knew would be a cruel aggravation of Carlyle&#x02019;s sufferings, but which, from what had been said at the hospital, seemed inevitable, might be avoided. My father agreed that an effort should be made, and any influence brought to bear on the authorities, to obviate this, and Forster went off at once to Dr. Quain, Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s physician, and thence to St. George&#x02019;s Hospital, where, armed with the doctor&#x02019;s certificate, he was able to arrange for the removal of the body to Cheyne Row&#x0201D; (Blunt, &#x0201C;CHH&#x0201D; 465). An inquest was normally demanded in cases of sudden death but Richard Quain, who attended JWC in her illness, <date when="1863">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864">64</date>, and had seen her socially, early <date when="1866-01">Jan.</date>, certified JWC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;spinal disease as the cause of death under the circumstances&#x0201D; (Marrs 753); Froude wrote later: &#x0201C;Forster &#x02026; was a lunacy commissioner, and had weight with official persons. Dr. Quain had attended Mrs. Carlyle in her illness, and from him I believe Forster obtained a certificate of the probable cause of her death, which was received as sufficient&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:313&#x02013;14).</note>

          <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
          <p>I hold the pen for my brother who is not himself able to write at present.</p>
          <p>He telegraphed to you this morning the intention which I now describe in detail.</p>
          <p>My brother &#x26; myself, with our friend Mr Forster, will leave by the Express from King&#x02019;s Cross at 10 a.m., bringing the coffin with us. The Railway authorities have given an order by which the Express will be <hi rend="italic">specially stopped</hi> for us at Longniddry.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Longniddry, village and nearest main line stn., about 7 mi. (11 km.) W of Haddington.</note> This will be, it is calculated, at or near eight o&#x02019;clock tomorrow (Wednesday) night.</p>
          <p>We wish therefore that you will have the great kindness to have a hearse in attendance to receive the coffin&#x02014;and a carriage that will convey us three&#x02014;from Longniddry to Haddington. It is my brother&#x02019;s wish that the coffin should be taken to a private hotel or house, as you may find it possible to arrange; as he could on no account bear that the funeral should proceed from a railway station.</p>
          <p>If it be practicable to obtain a lodging in a hotel or private house for the night&#x02014;for Mr Forster &#x26; myself&#x02014;you will yourself perhaps, if your house is in a quiet locality,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Jane and William Dods lived in Court St., Haddington&#x02019;s main thoroughfare.</note>
 be able kindly to receive &#x26; lodge my brother for that night at Haddington.</p>
          <p>You will be so good as to appoint the funeral for twelve o&#x02019;clock on Thursday. The undertaker at Haddington<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Probably Thomas Ormiston (b. <date when="1825">1825</date>).</note>
 will have to make arrangements &#x26; provision <hi rend="italic">for everything that is necessary in taking the coffin from Longniddry Station to Haddington, &#x26; from thence the next day to the place of burial</hi>.</p>
          <p>What we bring with us is simply the coffin which encloses a leaden coffin within, (the outer one being of Oak); &#x26; the dimensions outside are <hi rend="italic">two feet wide by six feet four inches long</hi>.</p>
          <p>My brother desires to have the funeral as quiet as possible, so that you will please to invite only those whom it is absolute necessary to invite as old friends or acquaintances of my sister-in-law</p>

          <salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
          <p>You will read these Three Letters with a very melancholy interest;&#x02014;especially the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of them I wrote from Scotsbrig the morning we left for Dumfries; and will regret with me to the end of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> life that she did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> see it; alas, no, no; it was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> posted at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> by 6 p.m. in time for the morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> mail of London; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 p.m. by wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> time she was gone <hi rend="italic">out</hi>, never to return more&#x02014; Oh why didn&#x02019;t I post it myself at Backburn<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Backburn, nearest post office, &#xBD; mi. (1 km.) E of Scotsbrig.</note> as I rode past; why did I wait for anything,&#x02014;why did Jamie &#x02018;jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x02019; make any delay in posting! But alas what is the use of such reflexion:&#x02014;was not her own death caused by the hurt toe of a miserable little scraping of a <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> hardly even hers? That wretched animalcule has done <hi rend="italic">me</hi> more mischief than all the men and animals that have ever lived in the world in my time!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Tiny, left to JWC by Clara Chapman (see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660316-JWC-LLA-01">

</ref>. According to Jessie Hiddleston, Tiny was never brought back to Cheyne Row and was probably taken from the hospital by Count von Reichenbach; when Reichenbach later asked to keep her, TC replied: &#x0201C;Tell him to take it, and never let me set eyes on it again!&#x0201D; (Blunt, &#x0201C;CHH&#x0201D; 467).</note> We must take these paltrinesses to us, also; they were part of our bitter cup.</p>
          <p>The Letter she wrote after that of Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">sh</hi>d have arrived you will never forget reading with me last Sunday; after writing <hi rend="italic">so</hi>, she lunched with the Forsters (old friends), was never seen more brilliantly cheerful, <hi rend="italic">well</hi> beyond wont, and seemed to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> better than usual: &#x0201C;my Friend coming home to me, day after tomorrow!&#x0201D;&#x02014;and within &#xBD; or &#190; of an hour, she sat dead. Oh, that monday night, oh this week in gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">black week</hi> of my poor life.&#x02014; But <hi rend="italic">she</hi> died happy &#x26; victorious, in the way she had always wished to do.&#x02014; &#x02014; No more; this is my first writing, &#x26; my <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> is as you see.</p>
          <p>In a few days I will write ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Day by day I am getting bits of order introduced into this great overturn of my past existence; that is the only thing <hi rend="italic">she</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have wished as a consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to me. I saw her dead face twice: beautiful as Eternity, soft as an angel&#x02019;s or as a babe&#x02019;s.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Froude described seeing JWC in the hospital: &#x0201C;There, on a bed in a small room, we found Mrs. Carlyle, beautifully dressed, dressed as she always was, in quietly perfect taste. Nothing had been touched. Her bonnet had not been taken off. It was as if she had sate upon the bed after leaving the brougham, and had fallen back upon it asleep. But there was an expression on her face which was not sleep, and which, long as I had known her, resembled nothing which I had ever seen there. The forehead, which had been contracted in life by continued pain, had spread out to its natural breadth, and I saw for the first time how magnificent it was. The brilliant mockery, the sad softness with which the mockery alternated, both were alike gone. The features lay composed in a stern majestic calm. I have seen many faces beautiful in death, but never any so grand as hers&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:312&#x02013;13). Jewsbury wrote to TC, <date when="1866-05-26">26 May</date>: &#x0201C;Those who saw her at the hospital speak of the beautiful expression on her face&#x0201D; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:340). D. A. Wilson criticized Froude&#x02019;s passage in particular: &#x0201C;The mention of a great change in the face by Froude is palpable fiction. He goes far beyond Miss Jewsbury&#x02019;s fanciful statement, and is discredited not only by the silence of Blunt, who saw her at the same time and knew her better, and by the general probabilities arising from the facts beyond dispute&#x0201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 6:67).</note> Put in these 4 Letters into the Miss <pb id="pg-43-219" n="43:219" />W&#x02019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Probably the Misses Welsh, JWC&#x02019;s aunts in Edinburgh.</note> cover,&#x02014;and despatch despatch<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Word repeated with a line over it at turn of page.</note> to them by <hi rend="italic">Monday&#x02019;s</hi> mail, that you may have <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for reading them (<hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> only).&#x02014; I will walk all day; my sleep only <hi rend="italic">half</hi> come back: well otherwise.

          <salute>Dear kind Lady,</salute>
          <p>I cannot write even to you:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton wrote to TC, <date when="1866-04-26">26 April</date>, as soon as she heard the news of JWC&#x02019;s death: &#x0201C;Oh! my Beloved friend&#x02014; What can I say to you in this desolation? only weep with you&#x02014;over one we love so well&#x02014; Can it be true we shall never again be cheered, &#x26; encouraged, by her bright &#x26; tender spirit?&#x02014; How different Earth will always seem to us both, now she has left it. To <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, there can never come such another friend&#x02014; to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, what can be before you, but Desolation? &#x26; oh! Well so I know, what that word means&#x02014; May God support, &#x26; comfort you.&#x0201D;</note>
 silence (in the utmost seclusion I can get) can alone express to myself or others the state I am in since Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 21st. Sudden, like a bolt from the skies all shining bright, the stroke fell; and has shattered my whole existence into immeasurable ruin. Since that Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> (10 p.m. at Dumfries, <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3&#xBD; p.m. <hi rend="italic">in Hyde Park</hi>), the nine days that have passed are like no other I ever had since I was born. My heart feels as if broken; overwhelmed, in mean wrecks of things secular &#x26; prosaic, and in deluges of sacred sorrow, to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, except slowly from time &#x26; reflexion, there is no alleviation possible.</p>
          <p>Thursday last, she was committed to her Father&#x02019;s Grave, in the Abbey Kirk at Haddington, and now sleeps there,&#x02014;as was the covenant between us, 40 years ago or nearly so. Her death was swift, (as had always been her prayer); swift, I am led to think, almost as lightning from the skies; and she passed <pb id="pg-43-220" n="43:220" />away as in a blaze of splendour, <hi rend="italic">victory</hi> (late, but bright &#x26; complete to her) crowning her whole noble life &#x26; her. For her life from the time we met was and continued all mine; and she had fought and toiled for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, valiantly at all moments up to that last,&#x02014;how loyally, lovingly and bravely, &#x26; thro&#x02019; what sore paths and difficulties, is now known only to God and one living mortal. Sixteen hours after the fatal telegram at Dumfries, there came to me a Letter written on the Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning (perhaps two hours before her death), in the cheeriest spirits any had yet been (and they were all cheerful, prosperous, even joyful, after &#x0201C;<date when="1866-04-03">April 3</date>&#x0201D;), and I think, the <hi rend="italic">longest</hi> of all,&#x02014;in bright hope that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> meet &#x0201C;the day after tomorrow.&#x0201D; Indeed for a fortnight before, all testimony is, That she looked brighter, gayer, and felt <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, than for years past. That is the last value I shall ever get of my poor bits of &#x0201C;successes,&#x0201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, for her sake, were and now are really precious to me, but had otherwise the character mainly of mere confusions, and can henceforth have no value to me.</p>
          <p>Maggie Welsh is here, unraveling the dismal chaos to me<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Geraldine Jewsbury reported to Lady Amberley, <date when="1866-04-29">29 April</date>: &#x0201C;Miss Welsh asked me to assist her in making an Inventory of all her things &#x26; it has occupied us a good deal to get it done before his return&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 20767.84); Maggie Welsh then continued sorting JWC&#x02019;s possessions after TC&#x02019;s return, <date when="1866-04-27">27 April</date>. For the rest of Jewsbury&#x02019;s letter, see Appendix 260&#x02013;61.</note>
 (for I did not even know a <hi rend="italic">key</hi> in the house); my Brother too has attended me throughout; and I am gradually recovering my sleep;&#x02014;day after day, since Friday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> last, endeavouring slowly to settle the wreck of my existence into some incipiency of order; and to see round me me,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Word repeated with a line over it at turn of page.</note>
 instead of a gloomy confusion, something of regulat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is as yet not less gloomy, but almost <hi rend="italic">more</hi>. Except Froude yesterday I have admitted nobody;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC had been visited by John Tyndall, Mon. <date when="1866-04-23">23 April</date>; he had read the notice of JWC&#x02019;s death in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1866-04-23">23 April</date>, at Southampton railway stn. and &#x0201C;sped to London, and &#x02026; found a note from Miss Jewsbury. &#x02026; &#x02018;For Heaven&#x02019;s sake &#x02026; come and see the old man; he is utterly heart-broken.&#x02019;&#x02026; I drove forthwith to Chelsea. The door was opened by Carlyle&#x02019;s old servant, Mrs. Warren, who informed me that her master was in the garden. I joined him there, and we immediately went up-stairs together. It would be idle, perhaps sacrilegious on my part, to attempt any repetition of his language. In words, the flow of which might be compared to a molten torrent, he referred to the early days of his wife and himself&#x02014;to their struggles against poverty and obstruction; to her valiant encouragement in hours of depression; to their life on the moors, in Edinburgh, and in London&#x02014;how lovingly and loyally she had made of herself a soft cushion to protect him from the rude collisions of the world. &#x02026; Three or four times during the narrative he utterly broke down. I could see the approach of the crisis and prepare for it. After thus giving away, a few sympathetic words would cause him to rapidly pull himself together, and resume the flow of his discourse. &#x02026; While he thus spoke to me, all that remained of his wife lay silent in an adjoining room&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 18&#x02013;19).</note>

          <salute>Dear Mr. Erskine,&#x02014;</salute>
          <p>Your little word of sympathy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Erskine wrote, <date when="1866-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x0201C;What can man say to you, but; that not a sparrow falleth to the ground without your <hi rend="italic">Father</hi>&#x02014; That underlies all things &#x26; surely has endless consolation in it, if we can take hold of it&#x02014; &#x2F; I write this to you, because I feel that I have nothing else to write, &#x26; yet that I ought to express my sympathy with you in this great sorrow&#x02014; My sister joins me in kindest regards. &#x02026; &#x2F; I had hoped to be with you on thursday at the funeral&#x02014;but when I went to the station, I found it filled by a dense crowd, which I could not penetrate.&#x0201D;</note> went to my heart, as few of the many others could do. Thanks for it. Thanks also, and many of them, for your visit to poor Betty,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Erskine ended his note: &#x0201C;I have seen M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Braid, as I know <hi rend="italic">she herself</hi> would have wished me to do.&#x0201D;</note> to whom I have yet written nothing, though well aware that of all living hearts but one, hers is the saddest on this occasion. Pray go out to her again after a time, and say that so long as I live in the world, I wish and propose to keep sight of her, and in any distress that may fall on her, to ask myself what I can do to be of help to that good soul.</p>
          <p>Hitherto I write to nobody, see nobody but my brother and Maggie Welsh, of Auchtertool. Indeed, I find it is best when I do not even speak to anybody. The stroke that has fallen on me is immeasurable, and has shattered in pieces my whole existence, which now suddenly lies all in ruins round me. In her name, whom I have lost, I must try to repair it, rebuild it into something of order for the few years or days that may remain to me, try not to waste them further, but to do something useful with them, under the stern monition I have had. If I but can, that should be my way of honouring her, whose history on earth now lies before me, all bathed in sorrow, but beautiful exceedingly, nay, of a kind of epic grandeur and heroic nobleness, known only to one heart <pb id="pg-43-223" n="43:223" />now. God bless you, dear Mr. Erskine. You will not forget me, Mrs. Stirling and you; nor will I either of you.</p>

          <salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken</salute>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Caryle has asked me to write to thank you very much for your most kind letter to him. You can well believe that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is unable to do or to think of any thing but what he absolutely <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do. So he thinks you will forgive his not writing to you himself. He is on the whole, poor man, as well as one could almost have hoped to see him, (or indeed in some ways better) when one thinks of all the fearful suddenness &#x26; the sad circumstances of poor Cousin&#x02019;s death <hi rend="italic">for him</hi>. His being away from her at the time, &#x26; she herself being so very cheerful (&#x26; really well <hi rend="italic">for her</hi>) writing each day to him in such good spirits &#x26; so <hi rend="italic">much</hi> pleased with all that took place in Edinburgh, all this naturally only made the blow come more severely. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle as you know is with him; I had been spending two months in London this Spring, &#x26; had been staying <pb id="pg-43-225" n="43:225" />with dear Cousin for a few days while he M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was away.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">For Maggie Welsh&#x02019;s visit, see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660329-MW-TC-01">

</ref>.</note> I only left her the day after the Installation took place, &#x26; went to visit my brother in Liverpool. Though she has looked to me <hi rend="italic">very</hi> frail ever since that severe illness she had two years ago, she has been so cheerful &#x26; so happy these last few months, that one knew she must be <hi rend="italic">feeling better</hi> &#x26; I had fain hoped she might have yet been spared to poor M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x26; us all for some time to come. You can believe what a sad shock to me it was, when only a <hi rend="italic">fortnight</hi> after they telegraphed for me to come, but alas! it was too late to do any thing <hi rend="italic">for her</hi>. She did so dread another long illness poor thing, that one feels as if for herself her sudden, &#x26; truly <hi rend="italic">apparently</hi> painless death had been granted her in mercy. But for those she has left to grieve for her it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> very sad. I am glad to feel as if I were of some little help to poor M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle at this sad time though it is little <hi rend="italic">real</hi> comfort that any one can give him poor man. I have been very busy with little things &#x26; <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> ones too, that I feel as if I had not yet taken in the sad fact that poor Cousin will come back to us no more! She was speaking of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to me only the last time I saw her, &#x26; seemed to be looking forward with so much real pleasure to seeing you again. From her Mother &#x26; from herself I have heard so often of you dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken that though I have never seen you, I do not feel as if I were writing to a stranger. All my life I have heard of you &#x26; of your Uncle,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Eliza Aitken&#x02019;s uncle was John Bradfute (<date when="1764">1764</date>&#x02013;<date when="1837">1837</date>), Edinburgh bookseller; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191000-JBW-EA-01">

          <salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant</salute>
          <p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has asked me to write for him to thank you very gratefully for your most kind note to him. Some time by &#x26; bye, he bids me say, he hopes to see you to thank you himself. As you can believe at present, for now, he feels little able for anything but what he absolutely must do. He seems to think with great interest, &#x26; even <hi rend="italic">comfort</hi> almost, if he can feel <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in any thing just now, of those two or three happy days that she spent with you only so lately.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">JWC visited Margaret Oliphant in Windsor <date when="1866-04-06">6</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866-04-08">8 April</date>.</note>
 She wrote to him so cheerfully about the little visit &#x26; seemed so to have enjoyed it. One can hardly re-alize<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thus in MS.</note>
 to oneself that she is <hi rend="italic">really gone</hi> &#x26; not to come back to us, for all things about one look as if they were only waiting for her. Truly one <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> re-alize what a desolate home it must feel to her poor husband, &#x26; one knows that as days &#x26; weeks go by the terrible, &#x26; sudden, loneliness will only be the more sadly felt by him.</p>
          <p>He is almost better, to outward appearance, than one might have hoped to see him, but he does look <hi rend="italic">so</hi> sad &#x26; heartbroken almost. It is touching to see the patience &#x26; gentleness with which he bears his sorrow.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC wrote, <date when="1866-05-09">9 May</date>: &#x0201C;My foot still pains and lames me; I am going today (the second time after some interval to try <hi rend="italic">her</hi> black mare (awkward big stalking creature), whom she called &#x02018;Bellona,&#x02019;&#x02014;ah that &#x02018;Bellona,&#x02019; how it cuts me to the heart what a world of pathos, of melting sorrow and tenderness over her noble gratitude for the small, small gift which was all I had for her!)&#x02014;to follow her counsel in that; and at least <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> my ancle for a day. Brougham and mare offered in vain to her Aunts in Edinburgh, are to go to Walter Welsh of Auchtertool, her Cousin, who is lame,&#x02014;whose Father [John Welsh] at least she much loved. Sell it I could not, on second thoughts; how could I ever think of doing so!&#x02014; My one solace and employment hitherto is that of sorting up, and settling as I judge <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would have wished, all that pertained to her beautiful existence and her: <hi rend="italic">her</hi> advice on it all, how <hi rend="italic">that</hi> wish starts out on me strangely at many a turn; and the sharp twinge that reminds me, &#x02018;No!&#x02019; One&#x02019;s first <hi rend="italic">awakening</hi> in the morning, the reality all stript so <hi rend="italic">bare</hi> before one, and the puddle of confused dreams at once gone, is the ghastliest half-hour of the day;&#x02014;as I have heard others remark. On the whole there is no use in writing here. There is even a lack of <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> in what I write (strange but true). The thing I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> say, I cannot. All words are idle. (Here comes Forster;&#x02014;this day fortnight was her Burial-day!)&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 194&#x02013;95).</note>
 God grant they <pb id="pg-43-227" n="43:227" />may not fail him, for to him at his years &#x26; after the many many years they have gone through life together, the loss must ever be a most sore one. He almost dreads the days that are coming, only it is a mercy to see him able to bear up at all at the present time &#x26; one can but have trust for the future.</p>

            <salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>&#x02014;Your kind words from Dijon were welcome to me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Ruskin noted in his diary that he wrote to TC, <date when="1866-05-06">6 May</date>; letter untraced.

 thanks. I did not doubt your sympathy in what has come; but it is better that I see it laid before me. You are yourself very unhappy, as I too well discern&#x02014;heavy-laden, obstructed and dispirited; but you have a great work still ahead, and will gradually have to gird yourself up against the <hi rend="italic">heat of the day</hi>, which is coming on for you,&#x02014;as the Night too is coming.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Cf. John 9:4.</note>
 Think valiantly of these things.</p>
          <p>I cannot write to you; I do not wish yet even to speak to anybody; find it more tolerable to gaze steadily in silence on the blackness of the abysses that have suddenly opened round me, and as it were swallowed up my poor little world. Day by day the stroke that has fallen, like a thunderbolt out of skies all <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> (as I often think), becomes more immeasurable to me; my life all laid in ruins, and the one light of it as if gone out. And yet there is an inexpressible beauty, and even an epic greatness (known only to God and me), in the Life of my victorious little Darling whom I shall see no more.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC was probably looking at JWC&#x02019;s photograph albums at this time as he wrote, <date when="1866-05-09">9</date> or <date when="1866-05-10">10 May</date>: &#x0201C;I have no Portrait of my lost Darling; nothing but a miniature (taken by Macleay, in Edinburgh) shortly before our marriage; it has the fine sunny smile of her face, but wants the sharp delicacy of featuring; represents a much <hi rend="italic">heavier</hi> and less seriously spiritual countenance. The Photographs are <hi rend="italic">old</hi>, and one and all completely unjust, and have abolished the finer traits. Some one of them I must select as the bad-best, and treasure it. She was so anxious about <hi rend="italic">my</hi> poor portrayings; and wholly neglected her own&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 194).

          <p>This day fortnight, about this hour (1 p.m.) we were lowering her dust to sleep with that of her Father, in the Abbey Kirk of Haddington, as was our covenant for forty years back: since that day my life has been as <hi rend="italic">noiseless</hi> as I could make it; and ought to continue so till I see farther.

          <salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
          <p>It is no want of kindness or grateful affect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that prevents my writing to you. But I write to nobody,&#x02014;literally so. There is but one topic, that lies in all my tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> by day and night, in all forms high and low;&#x02014;and on that, all mortals but myself are comparatively <hi rend="italic">little</hi> concerned (however kindly sympathetic they may feel); and it is better, and more tolerable for me, that I keep that locked in my own sad mind. Universal overturn has tumbled all my little world to ruins for me; into this I am drawn &#x26; driven to look steadily, and see by degrees what there is that I can do with it.</p>
          <p>My ancle is getting at last nearly well; I rode thrice, on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> poor Horse she was so proud of;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Bellona; TC wrote, <date when="1866-05-11">11 May</date>: &#x0201C;Yesterday, paid off the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of the accounts; no desecrating intermixtures farther. I have twice ridden her poor &#x02018;Bellona&#x02019; (never would while she bade me) with many thoughts,&#x02014;for relief of my foot. See nobody; think of nothing but her, in the bustle of the Parks now all tragic to me&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 195). TC presumably referred to the check he wrote, <date when="1866-05-10">10 May</date>: &#x0201C;To <hi rend="italic">Callow</hi>,&#x02014;(messenger of <hi rend="italic">Fate</hi>, ah me!) &#x2F; &#163;48 .. 3 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).

            <salute>Dear Geraldine,</salute>

      &#x02014;Few or none of these Narratives are correct in all the details; some of them, in almost all the details, are <hi rend="italic">in</hi>correct. I have not <hi rend="italic">read</hi> carefully beyond a cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> point wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is marked on the margin. Y<hi rend="italic">r recognit</hi>n of the <hi rend="italic">character</hi> is generally true and faithful; little of <hi rend="italic">portraiture</hi> in it that satisfies me. On the whole, all tends to the <hi rend="italic">mythical</hi>; it is very strange how much of mythical there already here is!&#x02014;</p>
          <p>As Lady Lothian set you on writing, it seems hard that she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not see what <pb id="pg-43-233" n="43:233" />you have written: but I wish you to take <hi rend="italic">her word of honour</hi> that none else shall; and my earnest request to you is that, directly <hi rend="italic">from</hi> her Ladyship, you will bring the Book to me, and consign it to my keeping.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC later wrote on a scrap of paper: &#x0201C;Early in <date when="1866-05">May 1866</date>, in the first weeks of my irreparable calamity, Miss Geraldine Jewsbury, who long had been a famil<hi rend="italic">r</hi> here, sent me this little Book half written out, in her hasty and flowing hand, with a very kind Note (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> unhappily I have lost), explaining That the March<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> of Lothian, who had a little begun to know, and much to esteem, my departed Dearest, had requested to have Miss jews<hi rend="italic">y&#x02019;s</hi> recollect<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> of her, especially of what in their many dialogues tog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Miss J<hi rend="italic">y</hi> had come to know of her life; and that here <hi rend="italic">was</hi> what she had written: w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I permit the kind March<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>, herself a sorrow laden woman, to have it? My ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, I believe, is given in the little Book;&#x02014;restricting, on cert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> considerat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, the sight of it rigorously to Lady Lothian alone. Miss J<hi rend="italic">y</hi>, with a perfect sense of propriety, did not use even the permiss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> given her; but directly returned me the little Book to burn or do with what I liked.&#x02014; &#x02014; After some days, I began writing down my own <hi rend="italic">corrections</hi> &#x26;c, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> gradually swelled into <hi rend="italic">additions</hi>,&#x02014;day by day, all that I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> most brightly remember of Her bright Life beside me. This, with the pious sorting of her <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, &#x26; of all that had belonged to her, and made her lovely to me, in our Pilgrimage together,&#x02014;formed my one solace<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all that summer. And this may suff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Preface to the little Book (or Book-and-<hi rend="italic">half</hi>), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have never dared to open since.

          <p>We are now at the Summer Solstice, and there still comes no word from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> locality,&#x02014;a locality itself uncertain to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lady Ashburton wrote to TC from Vichy, central France, <date when="1866-06-18">18 June</date>: &#x0201C;I am getting quite hungry for tidings of you&#x02014; beg you to send me a few lines.&#x0201D;</note>

Your movements are not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> importance and influence for my own: I may as well confess; I have always, for above a year back (still more, for <hi rend="italic">eight weeks back</hi>), had a kind of eye on that traditionary &#x0201C;Farmhouse&#x0201D; in Melchet Park, and some &#x0201C;Apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x0201D; I might build myself there (with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> permission), as a covert from the rolling of railways, and the other noisy horrors of London, when they become intolerable to me;&#x02014;but this, as you may suppose, is more and more fading into a dream; and indeed radically, I suppose, was never much other.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">During their last visit to Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s house, Seaforth Lodge, in Devon, the Carlyles had considered buying a country house nearby; see <ref target="volume-41/lt-18650329-JWC-MO-01">

          <p>With a sad and solemn emotion I received y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> tidings of last night.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">The death of her father, George Lillie Craik, <date when="1866-06-25">25 June</date>. TC noted: &#x0201C;News of <hi rend="italic">Craik&#x02019;s</hi> death, at Belfast 27 ult. came last night&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 148).</note>
 &#x02014; I know, by painful experience, how idle are words: I will say nothing, therefore, except That y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Father&#x02019;s memory, by all that knew him, is &#x26; will be held in honourable regard here;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC also wrote in different terms about Craik in his reminiscences, Craik having offended JWC deeply when he looked at one of her notebooks; TC wrote about her notebooks and his self-imposed task, around <date when="1866-05-27">27 May</date>: &#x0201C;Why do I <hi rend="italic">write</hi> at all, for that matter? Can <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ever forget? And is not all this appointed by me rigorously to the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>? Somehow it solaces me to have written it;&#x02014;and tomorrow, probably, I shall fill out these two remaining pages. Ah me.&#x02014; She had written at one time something of her own early life; but she gave up, and burnt it,&#x02014;some disgusting fellow having got his eye on a bit of it, &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">un</hi>able to resist the temptation, such the charm, the&#x02019;&#x02014;Unforgiveable coarse soul! She wrote at various times in Notebooks; refusing all sight of them even to me: but she has destroyed nearly every vestige of them;&#x02014;one little Book, consisting of curious excerpts and jottings <hi rend="italic">not</hi> biographic (in which she would often look practically for <hi rend="italic">Addresses</hi> (Street and number) as one item), is all that remains,&#x02014;that I do not mean to burn&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 72&#x02013;73); <sic>for</sic>see also <ref target="volume-30/lt-18450413-JWC-NB-01">JWC&#x02019;s Notebook, <date when="1845">1845</date>&#x02013;<date when="1852">52</date>

TC added more, <date when="1866-07-03">3 July</date>: &#x0201C;in <date when="1856">1856</date>, too evidently, to whatever owing, my poor little Darling was extremely miserable! Of that year there is a bit of Private Diary, by chance, left unburnt; found by me since her death, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be destroyed, however tragical and sternly sad are parts of it. She had written, I sometimes knew (though she would never <hi rend="italic">shew</hi> to me or to mortal any word of them), at different times, various bits of Diary; and was even, at one time, upon a kind of Autobiography (had not <hi rend="italic">Craik</hi>, the poor Craik, now just gone, stept into it with swine&#x02019;s foot, most intrusively, though without ill intention,&#x02014;finding it <hi rend="italic">un</hi>locked, one day;&#x02014;and produced thereby an instantaneous <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> of it, and of all like it which existed at that time). Certain enough, she wrote various bits of Diary and private record, unknown to me: but never anything so sore, downhearted, harshly distressed and sad as this (right sure am I!)&#x02014;which alone remains as specimen! The rest are all burnt; no trace of them, seek where I may. The place for inserting it is now arrived at; and it shall stand <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, very mournful to me while I live&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 157&#x02013;58); <sic>for</sic>see also <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal">JWC&#x02019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10">Oct. 1855</date>&#x02013;<date when="1856-07">July 1856</date>

            <p>Reginald Blunt later described the scene when John Silvester returned to 5 Cheyne Row from the hospital: &#x0201C;About five o&#x02019;clock my father met the empty brougham returning from St. George&#x02019;s Hospital to Cheyne Row. Poor old Silvester, the coachman, pulled up on seeing him, and, terribly upset, told him what had happened: the drive first to Mr. Forster&#x02019;s house at Palace Gate; then to the park; Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s getting out near Queen&#x02019;s Gate, and giving her little dog a run as far as the Serpentine; and again putting him out near the Victoria Gate, when he was almost run over by a carriage, and his paw slightly hurt; her jumping out almost before he could pull up, lifting the dog into the carriage and getting in herself; then the drive twice round the park, and his growing alarm at receiving no order from her; finally, his appeal to a passing lady, who at once gave her verdict, ‘Dead,&#x02019; which was confirmed by another bystander; and the drive to St. George&#x02019;s Hospital, where the worst was confirmed, and where he had just left his mistress.&#x0201D;</p>

            <p>I shall tell you a sad piece of news. Yesterday Mrs Carlyle lunched with Mrs Forster,&#x02014;was in particularly good spirits: she afterwards went to drive in the Park: when there, she stopped the carriage to put down her little dog for a run,&#x02014;a dog bequeathed her by poor Mrs Chapman a few weeks ago: no sooner out in the road, than the little thing&#x02019;s foot was run over by a carriage-wheel,&#x02014;the creature screamed, &#x26; Mrs Carlyle got out and took it in again,&#x02014;no doubt, much startled by the accident: the Coachman continued his drive round the park,&#x02014;repeated it,&#x02014;then began to wonder at getting no order, looked round, and could not see his mistress: he stopped, and asked a passer-by to look in at the door,&#x02014;the person, a lady cried &#x0201C;Drive to S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> George&#x02019;s Hospital.&#x0201D;&#x02014; He did so,&#x02014;they took her out dead. Forster was sent for,&#x02014;and was at immense pains to get the body removed,&#x02014;the authorities insisting that an inquest must be held: he put forth all his admirable energy and managed the matter&#x02014;not before midnight. (I little guessed as I passed the Hospital at eleven, returning from L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Belper&#x02019;s close by, who was lying there.) Carlyle is away in Scotland,&#x02014;one can hardly venture to fancy the shock to him,&#x02014;at the end of his pleasant little triumph there. Forster, who had a deep affection for her, is in a paroxysm of grief,&#x02014;yet, strange to see, I have had no message to prevent my dining with him today, as was arranged: he may want me for some purpose, to be sure: otherwise, what a &#x0201C;dinner!&#x0201D;&#x02014; I met her the last time on the occasion of Carlyle&#x02019;s completing his seventieth year&#x02014;not very long ago.</p>

            <p>Sunday <date when="1866-04-22">April 22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi> 1866</date> / My dear friends, you will be surprized [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to hear from me again so soon, and you will be very sorry for the news I have to send you&#x02014; On Thursday, ten days after I wrote to you, I went to see M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle as I had promised her I would do during this week.&#x02014; She was going out to Richmond to see an Aunt there, and I went with her&#x02014;and we took with us a little dog that was left to her care by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Frederick Chapman, who died some short time ago. Once or twice on our way she put the little dog down to run by the carriage as she did not know how to give it excercise [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], and she found this answer so well she said she should sometimes drive in the park and let it run there&#x02014; She was as well as I have seen her for many months&#x02014;very feeble, of <pb id="pg-43-258" n="43:258" />course, and complaining of suffering from the warmer weather&#x02014;but just herself. She was interesting herself about a nephew [James C. Aitken] of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle who has come up to London. She wanted Stauros [Dilberoglue, Sarah&#x02019;s husband] to know him, and it was arranged that he and I should have tea with her to-night and meet this nephew before M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x02019;s return (who is to be here tomorrow) as in his uncle&#x02019;s presence the young man is over awed, and it is difficult to know anything about him. [Two illegible words] matters&#x02014;well&#x02014;last night I had gone to bed between 11 &#x26; 12 &#x26; Stauros was still up reading, when I heard a loud strange rapp at the door &#x26; a talking&#x02014;and Lizzie rushed up to tell me it was a nephew of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x02019;s who brought us the news that she was dead. I have just come in from Chelsea where Geraldine Jewsbury &#x26; the nephew are [sto]pping in the house&#x02014; And poor M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is looked for at &#xBD; past 4 or 10 o&#x02019;clock in the morning&#x02014;as his arrangements stood he was to return home by a train to-night[.] Yesterday it seems she lunched at M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster&#x02019;s and in her return home drove in the Park to give that hapless little dog a run&#x02014;it got hurt by a carriage and she had to get out and take it in with her, &#x26; was flurried and excited by this&#x02014; The old coachman says that for a time he heard the crying of the dog as she was turning it about to find where it was hurt&#x02014;then there was stillness, &#x26; he kept driving up and down as ordered&#x02014; Wondering at last she did not tell him to go home as it was getting late, he looked into the carriage, and seeing there was something wrong asked a lady who was passing to look in&#x02014; She did and said &#x0201C;I dare not open this door, for I am afraid the lady is dead&#x0201D;&#x02014;then a gentleman got into the carriage and ordered the coachman to drive to St George Hospital&#x02014; She was taken in and found to be quite dead&#x02014;the coachman said also she was, and of course all care was taken&#x02014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain was either there or was sent for,&#x02014;and late last night she was removed home&#x02014; / Monday morning.&#x02014;&#x02014; I went to Chelsea again last night&#x02014;through the exertions of John Forster the pain of an inquest will be spared. D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Quain has called the cause of death paralysis&#x02014;but we all believe it was an apoplexy&#x02014; To me this change from Thursday to last night when I saw her lying in her bed in that mournful house has been a great shock&#x02014; We are to hear from the nephew to-day how M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is&#x02014; He will feel as if life were [word crossed out] indeed ended&#x02014;his work done, its acknowledgment received, and his wife gone from him&#x02014;and may talk now of that &#x0201C;rest for Evermore&#x0201D; I once heard him speak of&#x02014; We feel unspeakably sorry for him&#x02014; I must finish, for Stauros will take my letter with him to put in the city, that you may hear as soon as possible&#x02014; Dear love from all to you both.</p>

            <p>THE LATE MRS CARLYLE</p>
            <p>
              <hi rend="small-caps">Mrs Carlyle,</hi>

                                           the wife of the great writer, died on Saturday under very peculiar circumstances. She was taking her usual drive in Hyde Park about four o&#x02019;clock, when her little favourite dog, which was running by the side of the brougham, was run over by a carriage. She was greatly alarmed, though the dog was not seriously hurt. She lifted the dog into the carriage, and the man drove on. Not receiving any call or direction from his mistress, as was usual, he stopped the carriage, and discovered her, as he thought, in a fit or ill, and drove to St George&#x02019;s Hospital, which was near at hand. When there it was discovered that she must have been dead some little time. Mrs Carlyle&#x02019;s health had been for some months feeble, but not in a state to excite anxiety or alarm. / The late Mrs Carlyle, the <hi rend="italic">Star</hi> says, was a woman of much intelligence and culture. She, as well as her distinguished husband, corresponded <pb id="pg-43-251" n="43:251" />with Goethe and other foreign authors of renown. In the full collections of Goethe&#x02019;s poems will be found two or three poetical scraps addressed to &#x0201C;Madame Carlyle, Scotland.&#x0201D; One of these was originally written on a visiting card, which Goethe sent to the wife of his friend and admirer, and the lines, roughly translated, run somewhat in this fashion:&#x02014; / &#x0201C;Messengers like this we send / To tell the coming of a friend; / This poor card can only say / That the friend is far away.&#x0201D; / The <hi rend="italic">Daily</hi>
              <hi rend="italic"> Telegraph,</hi>

                                                    in noticing the death of Mrs Carlyle, says that of few English [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] wives could it more truly have been said that &#x0201C;she lived unknown,&#x0201D; than of the wife of Thomas Carlyle. Gentle, affectionate, and retiring; contented to remain in the studious shade by her husband&#x02019;s home that she might look forth from it upon the gladsome sunshine of his world-wide fame; seeing through his eyes, hearing through his ears, yet never surrendering her own autonomy of thought and independence of judgment&#x02014;it is to Mrs Carlyle that in no slight degree the world is indebted for many of those grand prose epics, which are songs to humanity and martial music to working men for all future time. &#x02026; [ellipses in <hi rend="italic">H</hi>

                                                                  ] / Wherever the English tongue is spoken&#x02014;wherever noble thoughts clad in nervous, sinewy language, and illustrated by matchless imagery of thought and expression&#x02014;can be read and appreciated, there will arise a cry of commiseration for the death of her who so ministered to the greatest living teacher of his countrymen. From every corner of the earth will come words of comfort and support&#x02014;from the home of Longfellow, whence all light and hope passed when his wife was snatched away, and from the home of Emerson&#x02014;from Germany and Australia, no less than from England, Scotland, and Ireland. And we are but anticipating the universal sentiment, when we say that, in the name of every class&#x02014;from those who stand the most exalted in station or in literature, to those of his humble and unknown brethren who have also found in his words an inspiration and a passion&#x02014;we offer to Mr Carlyle a respectful tribute of heart-felt sympathy.</p>
            <p>&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
            <p>The deceased lady, to whom these parting tributes of affectionate respect and admiration have been paid by our London contemporaries, was born in Haddington in <date when="1801">1801</date>, and was thus in her 66th year. She was the only child of the late Dr Welsh, one of the most successful practitioners of the medical art that our burgh ever possessed and a man of great force and originality of character, in which respect his daughter much resembled him. Her education was, for the most part, received in the burgh schools here&#x02014;the celebrated Edward Irving, who was at that time one of the masters, having been for a considerable period her tutor. Of her early compeers at the burgh schools, Mr W. Dods, banker, is, so far as we are aware, among the few now resident in Haddington, and it was to his house that the remains of his old class-fellow were removed from London by train on Wednesday, previous to interment <pb id="pg-43-252" n="43:252" />in the parish church-yard, where her father lies buried. Mr Carlyle, accompanied by his brother Dr Carlyle and Mr John Forester [Forster], left the metropolis in the same train, and arrived in Haddington late on Wednesday&#x02014;Mr Carlyle being the guest of Mr Dods for the evening. The interment took place at one o&#x02019;clock yesterday afternoon, from the house of Mr Dods. The Rev. Dr Cook, who along with a few of the older citizens, had been invited to accompany the remains to the grave, offered up a deeply impressive prayer previous to the melancholy procession taking its way to the burying ground. On arriving at the church-yard, the body, enclosed in a coffin of polished mahogany, was removed from the hearse, and carried shoulder high to the grave, within the centre of the old aisle. Mr Carlyle took his place as chief mourner, the pall-bearers being Dr Carlyle, the Hon. Mr Twisleton, Mr John Foster [Forster], the Rev. Mr [Walter] Welsh, Mr Binnie (Seton Mains), Mr W. Dods, and Dr Howden, senr. Several of those present, who had enjoyed the friendship of the deceased, were bathed in tears as dust was being consigned to dust, but Mr Carlyle himself, though evidently by a strong effort, maintained wonderful composure, and manifested few external indications of emotion. What the nature of his feelings were could be known from the long, sad, sorrowful look that he cast into the open grave, and the tenderness of the gesture with which he stooped down, and flung the first handful of earth over the remains of her who had shared so long with him the joys and sorrows of life. / Mr Carlyle and the friends who had accompanied him from England left Haddington by the afternoon train for the south.</p>

            <dateline>THE <hi rend="italic">TIMES&#x02019;S</hi> DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNERAL CEREMONY, <date when="1866-04-28">28 April 1866</date>.</dateline>
            <p>The remains of Mrs. Carlyle were conveyed from London on Wednesday to Haddington for interment there, and the funeral took place on Thursday afternoon. Mr. Carlyle was accompanied from London by his brother, Dr. Carlyle, Mr. John Forster, and the Hon. Mr. Twisleton. The funeral <hi rend="italic">cortège</hi> consisted of a hearse and two carriages, and was followed on foot by a large number of gentlemen who had known Mrs. Carlyle and her father, Dr. Welsh, who was held in high estimation in the town, where he had practised medicine till his death in <date when="1819">1819</date>. The grave, which is the same as that occupied by Dr. <pb id="pg-43-253" n="43:253" />Welsh, lies in the centre of the ruined choir of the old cathedral at Haddington, known as the <hi rend="italic">Lucerna Loudoniensis</hi> or &#x0201C;Lamp of Lothian.&#x0201D; The pall-bearers were, in addition to the gentlemen who accompanied Mr. Carlyle from London, the Rev. Mr. Welsh, Mr. Dods, banker, Haddington; Mr. Binnie, Seton Mains; and Dr. Thomas Howden, the last-named gentleman having been the business partner of Mrs. Carlyle&#x02019;s father. The body was encased in a handsome coffin of polished wood with brass mountings. In accordance with the Scottish practice there was no service read, and Mr. Carlyle threw a handful of earth on the coffin after it had been lowered into the grave. A number of ladies and gentlemen had assembled in the churchyard to witness the funeral.</p>

            <p>You asked me to give you any early intelligence about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x02014;he returned on Friday morning. very much broken &#x26; shaken&#x02014; This sorrow has made him quite an <hi rend="italic">old man</hi> all at once he is &#x0201C;feeble &#x26; sore broken&#x0201D; &#x26; it is enough to break ones heart to see him&#x02014;he cannot talk yet. I saw him yesterday but only very brief words were spoken.&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">walking</hi> seems to soothe him &#x26; he went out yesterday in all that pouring rain but he cd not bear the weight <pb id="pg-43-261" n="43:261" />of either cape or great Coat&#x02014; I think he will remain in the house where all is as she left it&#x02014; His brother is with him also Miss Welsh&#x02014; the two servants watch him with great care &#x26; thoughtfulness&#x02014;</p>
            <p>I mentioned to Miss Welsh about the little table&#x02014;but if he remains it is a thing he [is] <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to seeing, &#x26; he sits down beside it on the floor when he smokes.</p>
            <p>Miss Welsh asked me to assist her in making an Inventory of all her things &#x26; it has occupied us a good deal to get it done before his return. Now that I am alone &#x26; in my own room again all the occupation of my life seems over. for she has been for many years the main interest I have had&#x02014;all my employments were made with a view to her</p>
            <p>I hope you will keep your kind promise or rather the pleasant <hi rend="italic">hop</hi>

              <salute>Dear D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle</salute>
            </p>
            <p>You have been very kind in letting us hear of your Brother, and we thank you heartily for both your letters. It is not to be expected that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle should get over his loss for many a day: but I am thankful to hear that he is now getting a little sleep; which is the best restoration for his nervous system which must have received a great shock. Both your brother and your self know how deeply <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are interested in him, and how earnestly we desire that he may be comforted &#x26; supported under his sorrow&#x02014;&#x02014;so I think I may venture to say&#x02014;what his Mother would have said to him under present circumstances,&#x02014;that I trust he may find God a present help in this&#x02014;his time of trouble; and be kept safely under the care of the Almighty. / I hope when the weather improves,&#x02014;he will go abroad,&#x02014; perhaps Professor Tyndall may go with him. He should not remain too long in London: where he will find it difficult to avoid seeing visitors;&#x02014;and even the kindness of friends,&#x02014;is very overpowering in sorrow. &#x02026; /</p>

              <salute>Dear Madam</salute>
            </p>
            <p>I am extremely obliged by your very kind letter&#x02014; I need not tell you that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a great pleasure if you were good enough to come to see me at any time. &#x26; I only hope that nothing will occur to prevent it.</p>
            <p>I gave M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle your letter to read and when he laid it down he said mournfully&#x02014; &#x0201C;She is a dear good child&#x02014;but I cannot see her yet&#x0201D;&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
            <p>But I think the experience of the love &#x26; reverence with w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she was regarded soothes him&#x02014;he seems to feel so bitterly that she sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been taken away just at the moment when she had seen the end, crown his life&#x02019;s work, after she had borne with him the struggle &#x26; burden of the day He has become a very old man all at once. broken &#x26; frail &#x26; very worn&#x02014;last night there was a letter from Lady Augusta Stanley, conveying a very gracious message from the Queen;&#x02014;an expression of her sympathy&#x02014; also a reference to the interest she had taken in his Speech at Edinbro&#x02014;but he did not seem to care for it&#x02014;only to feel that nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring her back again&#x02014; If ever any one deserved sorrow &#x26; regret she does&#x02014;as yet we do not feel it; it is a sorrow that will grow heavier as time goes on. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is not well &#x26; he has a very bad cold. I think the only consoling thought he has&#x02014;is that their separation will but [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for a very little while.&#x02014;of course! I wish your husband long success for your sake &#x26; I think he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> have success in life tho&#x02019; it may not come yet. the affirmation that is to <hi rend="italic">last</hi> seldom comes early&#x02014; I have had no heart to read newspapers for many days past&#x02014;but I think that now if I can get an admission to the Lady&#x02019;s Gallery I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> listen to a good tough debate with interest&#x02014; I am dear Madam</p>

            <p>He spoke of the coming back and finding the little edifice in which he had hoped to spend the rest of his days all shattered; and how hard it was to believe it true, and all the time its being an invincible reality!

            <p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle and his niece Miss Welsh are with him, and the sitting room looked much the same to a rude glance, but how vacant looked that corner of the sofa!&#x02014; How I missed the the little silver knick-knack ornaments there! <pb id="pg-43-263" n="43:263" />The last I saw of her was a bright kind smile while passing thro&#x02019; the door to go away, one morning I called after Carlyle had gone to Scotland; how much more often I should have seen her had I thought of losing her so soon. She often spoke to me of what a loss it was to her missing your Ladyships society, and how she wished you would return; poor dear creature how little she thought you were never to meet again.</p>
            <p>He came a walk with me and on parting asked me to go and see him again: when I do I will write again and say how he is and what doing.</p>

              <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
            </p>
            <p>On Saturday <date when="1866-04-21">21st April</date> I was in Edinburgh, and Tom at Dumfries, when a piece of very sad news came to me from London, late in the evening by telegraph, which I had to forward to him at once. A second telegram came the same night at a still later hour, and it too had to be forwarded. The two joined together announced that Mrs Carlyle had died suddenly in the afternoon of that day while driving in her little carriage alone in Hyde Park. A small terrier, left to her care by a friend (Mrs Chapman) who died lately (in March) of consumption, had been running alongside the carriage and had got itself either kicked or trampled on by the horses of another carriage and was left <pb id="pg-43-254" n="43:254" />lying on the road. Jane got out, took it up, and spoke a few words to the lady of that other carriage who had got out to make an apology; then entered her own carriage again, and the driver went on as before noticing nothing particular about her and seeing that the dog had got very little if any injury. There was a string close to her by pulling which she could at once have stopped him. He first became uneasy at her not pulling it after he had gone on as far as usual; looked down through the front window, saw her hands lying quiet and open on her lap; went round the Park again, and on returning to the place (again) of which she used to pull the string, he stopt and saw her hands in exactly in the same position&#x02014;which of course gave him great alarm&#x02014;and not being able to quit the horse he asked the nearest lady and gentleman to look into the carriage and see if aught had happened. They found her quite gone, reclining backwards with face looking placid in death and relieved of all sorrow. I joined Tom at Dumfries by the earliest train from Lockerbie, having come so far by the only Sunday train from Edinburgh; and we started together for London the same day (Monday), arriving here about half past ten at night. He had written to a friend on the Sunday from Dumfries, to make preparations for the funeral, and we found every thing in a state of forwardness. In the coffin her face still retained the expression of earnest placidity and relief from sorrow. / On wednesday went to Haddington with the coffin in next compartment of railway carriage before us, two friends from London accompanying us; on the Thursday the funeral took place from the house of Mr Dods, banker, an old friend and schoolfellow of hers. It was attended by many other old friends and acquaintances of the neighbourhood and passed off very quietly indeed, the weather being quite beautiful. She lies buried in the same grave as her Father, in the ruined choir of the old Abbey church. She had written to Mr Dods about her burial more than twelve months ago; and she had told Tom before he went to Edinburgh, that she durst not go with him owing to some disease of the spine which sometimes took away her breath and stopped the action of the heart when aught agitated her suddenly; and the physician who attended her before, certified this spinal disease as the cause of death under the circumstances. She had talked of it to Tom as slight and so he had felt little or no alarm beforehand. He has felt the shock most severely of course, especially since we got back from Haddington on Friday, but he is quite calm and has had pretty good sleep for the last three nights. I intend staying here sometime with him. I will put three strokes on the newspaper address, if all goes well next week, as a signal. I could get no time to write earlier, or even to send off the newspaper last week. / We hear today from Dumfries, Gill, and Scotsbrig that all was well there. From the Queen downward there have been condolences, if any good were possible from them. Tom is as well as usual in body. Let us hope he may soon be able to adjust himself patiently to his great loss. I have not time to write more today. Please either send this on <pb id="pg-43-255" n="43:255" />to Jenny without delay, or write her the substance of it, for I feel quite worn by writing.</p>

            <postscript>
              <p>The kind of death which I have described, from that disease of the spine or brain, would be as sudden and as free from all pain as a simple fainting fit. The position in which the body was found reclining also shewed that there had been no struggle or suffering. She had written a letter to Tom, in excellent spirits, on the Saturday just before going out for her drive, and reached him at Dumfries on the Sunday. She had lunched with Mrs Forster too and been in high spirits only some 20 minutes before her death. Ever since her illness in <date when="1864">1864</date> she had been frail as possible, but had kept driving out daily and had never complained to any one; so that none of us felt alarmed about her. I did not hear of her spinal disease at all, or it might have alarmed me, as it did her physician whom I don&#x02019;t know personally and who had said nothing to Tom about it. She had suffered much from want of sleep all along, though she made no complaints. To herself such a gentle death would be a real benefit, though it has left our brother desolate and without his main stay in life. / The Edinburgh Address you would get from himself, as well as the first report of it from me, by post. It was as successful as anything of the kind could be, and poor Jane of course was glad as if some great victory had been gained. / I will write two words after all by this mail to Jenny, referring her to you for particulars. / J A C / The infinite number of letters of condolence has been most troublesome to me especially as I have had to acknowledge most of them.</p>

            <p>TC&#x02019;S JOURNAL ENTRY ON JWC&#x02019;S DEATH AND FUNERAL.</p>
            <p>MS: privately owned. Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:314&#x02013;16.</p>
            <p>Saturd<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night, about 9&#xBD; p.m., I was sitting in sister Jean&#x02019;s at Dumfries, thinking of my railway to Chelsea on Monday, and perhaps of a sprained ancle I had got at Scotsbrig two weeks or so before&#x02014;when the fatal telegrams (two of them in success) came; it had a kind of <hi rend="italic">stunning</hi> effect on me; not for above two days c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I estimate the immeasurable depth of it, or the infinite sorrow wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had peeled my life all bare, and, in a moment, shattered my poor world to universal ruin. They took me out next day, to wander (as was medically needful) in the green sunny Sabbath fields; and ever and anon there rose from my sick heart the ejaculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, &#x0201C;my poor little woman!&#x0201D; but no full gust of tears came to my relief, nor has yet come; will it ever? A stony &#x0201C;Woe&#x02019;s me, woe&#x02019;s me!&#x0201D; sometimes with infinite tenderness, &#x26; pity not for myself, is my habit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> mood hitherto. I had been hitching lamely ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in the Teregles quarter, my company the green solitudes and fresh spring breezes,&#x02014;quietly but far from happily, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the hour she died. Sixteen hours <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the telegram (Sunday ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 2 p.m.) there came to me a <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> from her, written on Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> before going out; the cheeriest &#x26; merriest of all her several prior ones;&#x02014;a Note for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> written at Scotsbrig, Friday morning, &#x26; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>
              <hi rend="italic">shd</hi>  have been a pleasure to her at breakfast this morning was not put in till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> 6 at Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> (negligence of my nephew Jamie, excusable but unforgettable); had not left Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi> till 10 p.m., nor arrived till 2 p.m. next day, and lay <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
              <hi rend="italic">n</hi>opened here. / Monday morning, John set off with me for London;&#x02014;never, for a 1,000 years sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I forget that arrival here of ours,&#x02014;my first <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
              <hi rend="italic">n</hi>welcomed by her;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">She</hi> lay in her coffin, lovely in death, I kissed her cold brow next night before the Maggie Welsh here &#x26; Pale death and things not mine or <hi rend="italic">ours</hi> had possession of our poor dwelling. Very kind very helpful to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> if to no other,&#x02014;everybody was. For, as I learnt ultimately, had it not been for their John Forster &#x26; Dr. Quain&#x02019;s and everybody&#x02019;s mercy to me, there must have been, by rule, a Coroner&#x02019;s Inquest held, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been a blotch upon my memory, intolerable then, and discordantly ugly for all time coming. It is to Forster&#x02019;s unwearied and invincible efforts, that I am indebted for escape from this sad defile<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of my feelings. Indeed <hi rend="italic">his</hi> kindness then, and all thro&#x02019;, in every particular &#x26; detail, was <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
              <hi rend="italic">n</hi>exampled, of a cordiality &#x26; assiduity almost painful to me. Next day wander over the fatal localities in Hyde Park; Forster &#x26; B<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John settling, apart from me, everything for the morrow. Morrow, Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning, we were under way with our sacred burden; John &#x26; F. kindly did not speak to me (good Twisleton too was in the train with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> consulting me): I looked out upon the spring fields, the everlasting skies, in silence; and had for most part a more endurable day,&#x02014;till Haddington where friends Dods &#x26;cwere waiting, with hospitalities, with &#x26;c&#x26;cwh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> almost drove me openly wild. I went out to walk in the <pb id="pg-43-250" n="43:250" />moonlit silent streets, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> suffered to go alone: I looked up at the windows of the old room where I had first seen her,&#x02014;<date when="1820">1820</date>, I believe, on a summer eve<hi rend="italic">g</hi> after sunset,&#x02014;six and forty years ago. Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Irving had bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me out, walking, to Haddington; <hi rend="italic">she</hi> the first thing I had to see there. The beautifullest young creature I had ever beheld; sparkling with grace and talent, tho&#x02019; sunk in sorrow (for loss of her Father), and speaking little. I noticed her once looking at me.&#x02014; Oh Heaven, to think of that now!&#x02014; / The Dodses (excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> people in their honest homely way) had great pity for me, patience with me; I retired to my room, slept none all night,&#x02014;little sleep to me since that telegram night;&#x02014;but lay silent in the great Silence. Thursday (<date when="1866-04-26">26th April 1866</date>) wandered out into the churchy<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &#x26;c: at 1 p.m. came the funeral; silent, small only 12 old friends, and 2 <hi rend="italic">volunteer</hi>, besides us three, very beautiful and noble to me: and I laid her head in the grave of her Father (accord to covenant of 40 years back); and all was ended. In the nave of the old Abbey Kirk, long a ruin, now being saved from further decay, with the skies looking down on her, there sleeps my little Jeannie, and the light of her face will never shine on me more. One other time,&#x02014;after the <hi rend="italic">Inscript</hi>n is put on,&#x02014;I have promised my self to be in Haddington. We withdrew, that afternoon; posted up (by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> with its many confusions) towards London all night, and ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 or 11 a.m. were shovelled out here; where I am hitching and wandering ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, best off in strict <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> (were it only possible); my one solace and employment that of doing all wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I can imagine <hi rend="italic">she</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have liked me to do. [TC wrote similarly about this time in Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> (194) where he concluded:] I suppose it to be useless to continue these jottings (Book probably to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> from all other eyes, and to myself painful!)&#x02014;but perhaps will add something to-morrow still. (<date when="1866-05-08">May 8 1866</date>; 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, I find!).</p>

            <p>
              <salute>Dear Mr. Carlyle</salute>,&#x02014;I think it better to write than to speak on the miserable subject about which you told me to inquire of Mr. Silvester. I saw him to-day. He said that it would be about twenty minutes after three o&#x02019;clock or thereabouts when they left Mr. Forster&#x02019;s house; that he then drove through Queen&#x02019;s Gate, close by Kensington Gardens, that there, at the uppermost gate, she got out, and walked along the side of the Gardens very slowly, about two hundred paces, with the little dog running, until she came to the Serpentine Bridge, at the southern end of which she got into the carriage again, and he drove on till they came to a quiet place on the Tyburnia side, near Victoria Gate, and then she put out the little dog to run along. When they came opposite to Albion Street, Stanhope Place (lowest thoroughfare of Park towards Marble Arch), a brougham coming along upset the dog, which lay on its back screaming for a while, and then she pulled the check-string; and he turned round and pulled <pb id="pg-43-256" n="43:256" />up at the side of the footpath, and there the dog was (he had got up out of the road and gone there). Almost before the carriage stopped she was out of it. The lady whose brougham had caused the accident got out also, and several other ladies who were walking had stopped round the dog. The lady spoke to her; but he could not hear what she said, and the other ladies spoke. She then lifted the dog into the carriage, and got in herself. He asked if the little dog was hurt; but he thinks she did not hear him, as carriages were passing. He heard the dog squeak as if she had been feeling it (nothing but a toe was hurt); this was the last sound or sigh he ever heard from her place of fate. He went on towards Hyde Park Corner, turned there and drove past the Duke of Wellington&#x02019;s Achilles figure, up the drive to the Serpentine and past it, and came round by the road where the dog was hurt, past the Duke of Wellington&#x02019;s house and past the gate opposite St. George&#x02019;s. Getting no sign (noticing only the two hands laid on the lap, palm uppermost the right hand, reverse way the left, and all motionless), he turned into the Serpentine drive again; but after a few yards, feeling a little surprised, he looked back, and, seeing her in the same posture, became alarmed, made for the streetward entrance into the Park a few yards westward of gatekeeper&#x02019;s lodge, and asked a lady to look in; and she said what we know, and she addressed a gentleman who confirmed her fears. It was then fully a quarter past four; going on to twenty minutes (but nearer the quarter); of this he is quite certain. She was leaning back in one corner of the carriage, rugs spread over her knees; her eyes were closed, and her upper lip slightly, slightly opened. Those who saw her at the hospital and when in the carriage speak of the beautiful expression upon her face. / On that miserable night, when we were preparing to receive her, Mrs. Warren came to me and said, that one time, when she was very ill, she said to her, that when the last had come, she was to go upstairs into the closet of the spare room and there she would find two wax candles wrapt in paper, and that those were to be lighted and burned. She said that after she came to live in London she wanted to give a party; her mother wished everything to be very nice, and went out and bought candles and confectionary, and set out a table, and lighted the room quite splendidly, and called her to come and see it when all was prepared. She was angry; she said people would say she was extravagant, and would ruin her husband. She took away two of the candles and some of the cakes. Her mother was hurt and began to weep. She was pained at once at what she had done; she tried to comfort her, and was dreadfully sorry. She took the candles and wrapped then up, and put them where they could be easily found. We found them and lighted them, and did as she desired. /</p>

            <p>Carlyle let me in yesterday, and talked about her (Mrs. Carlyle) for near an hour. How I wish I could have taken down what he said word for word! &#x0201C;She wrapped me round like a cloak, to keep all the hard and cold world off me.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;When I came home, sick with mankind, there she was on the sofa, always with a cheerful story of something or somebody, and I never knew that she, poor darling! had been fighting with bitter pains all day.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;To think that little dog should have been the instrument to take the light of life away from me.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;What would it be for me now to have the fame of Trismegistus [see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650708-TC-JN-01">
