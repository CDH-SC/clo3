<p>Volume 38 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> covers <date when="1861-11-00">November 1861</date> to <date when="1862-11-00">November 1862</date>. Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s main preoccupation in these months may have been his continuing work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>, but his and Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s letters (whether to each other or to other people) continued to range widely in their discussion of each other, their families, and the illnesses and deaths of several of their friends. Not much attention was paid to current political affairs in London; dramatic events, such as the collapse of a tenement building in Edinburgh&#x2019;s High Street, were given almost as much attention as Garibaldi&#x2019;s invasion of Italy or the Civil War in the United States. As always, if either was away from home, there was an assumption, on both their parts, that frequent letters must be sent to each other, as JWC indicated after leaving the Russell home at Thornhill for Edinburgh: &#x201C;I am not up to a letter today at least to any other letter than the daily one to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, which <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be written, <hi rend="italic">dead or alive</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620902-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-09-02">2 Sept.</date>]</ref>). However much JWC might have used this demand as justifying a shorter letter or as a way of constructing herself as a martyr to TC&#x2019;s expectations, it is also clear that these daily letters were expected and, mostly, were written. This can be seen in the number of pages that are filled in any volume of the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Letters</hi> when they are apart, as opposed to those times when they were at home together in Cheyne Row. In this volume, there are twenty-five letters from TC to JWC and twenty-five from JWC to TC; of the letters they wrote to others, eighty-one are from TC and seventy-three from JWC. JWC&#x2019;s total of letters remains fewer than TC&#x2019;s, though not by much in this volume. But, increasingly, her letters (written to a few chosen correspondents) tended to length, giving a finely orchestrated picture of her life in London and elsewhere. TC&#x2019;s letters are often short and businesslike, with only some letters to his family or Lord Ashburton reaching any kind of discursiveness. The reason for this is that TC&#x2019;s business was the writing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> with that business the constant excuse for inactivity in any other area of his life. JWC&#x2019;s business was the writing of letters, as well as the running of the household. The length of JWC&#x2019;s letters, even though there are fewer of them, means that this volume contains more writing by JWC than by TC.</p>
<p>JWC is known for the carefully crafted portrait of herself to be found in her letters. But it is also apparent from TC&#x2019;s letters that he too presented constructions of &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle.&#x201C; In this volume he characterizes himself as a suffering martyr in relation to his interminable work on &#x201C;this unutterable <pb id="pg-38-xiv" n="38:xiv"/>quagmire&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18611110-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1861-11-10">10 Nov. 1861</date></ref>) or &#x201C;melancholy slavery&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620618-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1862-06-18">18 June</date></ref>) that was Frederick. The imagery used to describe the process was industrial, vividly describing the process of reducing a mass of research into a concise few pages, but also legitimizing his writing by comparing it to a physical process like any to which a farm or factory worker might be subjected: &#x201C;Horrors of drossy incoherency &#x2026; like a mass of mere <hi rend="italic">slag,</hi> the size of a waggon; which you have to hammer down (if you can) into <hi rend="italic">metal,</hi> the size of a pint&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18611123-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-11-23">23 Nov. 1861</date></ref>). The work did, indeed, demand much time and energy, and TC was under some pressure to keep working. Volumes 1 and 2 had been published in <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>. Volume 3 was more or less complete by <date when="1861-11-00">November 1861</date>, and Chapman clearly wanted another volume to come out rather than wait for TC to complete the fourth volume; by <date when="1862-03-00">March 1862</date> TC had agreed to let volume 3 appear. TC was already noting to his brother John A. Carlyle that volume 4 would become volumes 4 and 5 (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620330-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-03-30">30 March</date></ref>). Volume 3 appeared early <date when="1862-05-00">May 1862</date> to a generally favorable response (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620530-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-05-03">3 May</date></ref>; for a more critical response, see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620702-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-07-02">2 July</date>]</ref>). TC continued to complain about his progress with the two next projected volumes. He wrote his drafts, gave them to Robson (Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s printer, who worked on TC&#x2019;s writing for many years), and then reworked and added new material when the proof sheets were returned to him. He commented to his brother John: &#x201C;I got last night a great heap of Vol V Proofsheets. &#x2026; First half of that Vol. is going to be horridly tough (Seven-Y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> War conclusion); latter half will be I know not what! A tough climb <hi rend="italic">surely;</hi> but, once over that hill, there is no other!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621003-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-10-03">3 Oct.</date></ref>). During <date when="1862-10-00">October</date>, he persisted in this view that volume 5 would be the last volume: &#x201C;And no <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Vol. coming; none, that is it!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621023-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-10-23">23 Oct.</date></ref>). But volume 5 was not to be published until <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, and there was to be a sixth and final volume published triumphantly in <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>. TC&#x2019;s complaints about his work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> give some sense of his laborious process. Joseph Neuberg who had done so much to help with research earlier was prevented by ill health from contributing much at this stage, and TC felt overwhelmed by the process:</p>
<q>A good big lump is in type (probably a full 4th of the whole Volume); but that is only half the battle; you never saw such a jumble of horrors as the first proofs are: in my bewildering <hi rend="italic">index</hi>-less state, and with such Books and blockheadism,&#x2014;I cannot, single-handed, deal with the thing, except stage after stage in that tentative way. Often enough, I am doing the very last <hi rend="italic">revise,</hi> when (after much screwing and torturing) the really <hi rend="italic">vital point</hi> of the matter, rule of all the articulation it must have;&#x2014;will disclose itself to me; <hi rend="italic">overlooked</hi> by the fifty Dryasdusts I have been compulsing!&#x2014; I have only yet <hi rend="italic">got one</hi> sheet of Vol V fairly sent away; 2 or 3 more w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have gone in a week: but I wanted to have one, at the least &#x26; lowest, before <pb id="pg-38-xv" n="38:xv"/>Iflying off. Vol IV haggled endlessly in Robson&#x2019;s hands: but it is done, off forevermore;&#x2014;Time &#x26; the hours wear everything to finis, if you persist! (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621011-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-10-11">11 Oct.</date></ref>)</q>
<p>This picture of TC, struggling with &#x201C;the very last <hi rend="italic">revise</hi>&#x201C; and only then finding the &#x201C;really <hi rend="italic">vital point</hi> &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">overlooked</hi> by the fifty Dryasdusts&#x201C; from whom he had been drawing his material, expresses difficulties familiar to any historian. But TC also commented in passing on the difficulty he had with the preceding volume and, specifically, with the Seven Years&#x2019; War: &#x201C;Vol<hi rend="italic">me</hi> Fourth is like to be as <hi rend="italic">dour</hi> as any of the others: no end of haggling, fash and impediment; so difficult exceedingly (and never yet tried at all) to make the Seven-Years War <hi rend="italic">march abreast</hi> (the many-columned marching Entity), and shew itself for what it was, in any measure!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620806-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-08-06">6 Aug.</date></ref>). The time for questioning why he should write a history of Frederick the Great was long past, but these letters, particularly to John, the brother closest to him intellectually, provide a running commentary on both process and content.</p>
<p>TC was too preoccupied with his own concerns to comment much on the American Civil War, although there are a few passing references. When visiting The Grange, <date when="1862-01-00">January 1862</date>, he wrote: &#x201C;Nothing considerable talked of here, but the Yankee War,quite in the indifft tone henceforth, Duke &#x26; Duchess [of Argyll], who were enthusiasts for &#x2018;Freedom to the Slave,&#x2019; having made exit. No war ever waging in my time was to me more profoundly foolish-looking: neutral I am to a degree, I for one!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620130-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref>). Despite his claim of neutrality, by <date when="1862-08-00">August</date> he was writing that the &#x201C;American affairs are getting quite hideous;&#x2014;but will (after agonies enough) probably <hi rend="italic">deliver</hi> the poor Country from a &#x2018;Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> by Blackguards,&#x2019; at the long last!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620831-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1862-01-30">31 Aug.</date></ref>); this seems to indicate criticism of the government of the North, if not actual support of the Southern states. In <date when="1862-02-00">February</date>, Charles Butler wrote optimistically about the outcome of the Civil War (from the point of view of a Northerner) to Samuel Adamson, TC&#x2019;s banker in Dumfries: &#x201C;Please place the enclosed to credit of Mr. Carlyle to whom I shall shortly write. &#x2F; I am happy to assure you that the terrible conflict that has been preceding [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in this country between the Government and the slave holders of the south is rapidly drawing to a close. The rebellion will be effectually crushed and the government and union will be maintained and preserved intact. No intelligent man who understands the real state of the case can for a moment doubt the result&#x201C; (Kimball 293); it is not known whether Butler wrote to TC expressing this view, but TC could certainly have heard similar opinions from the supporters of the North at the Ashburtons. In <date when="1862-10-00">October</date>, TC reported the views of Vincenzo Botta, &#x201C;a very honest Turin Italian&#x201C; (a naturalized U.S. citizen and professor of literature and languages at the University of the City of New York): &#x201C;[He] gave us plenty of news ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> America: Nothing <pb id="pg-38-xvi" n="38:xvi"/>but &#x2018;prosperity&#x2019; visible in N. York, <hi rend="italic">trade</hi> so brisk &#x26;c;&#x2014;going to whip Creation after all, especially to swallow the South out of hand (big <hi rend="italic">fleet</hi> ready for bombarding Charlestown &#x26;c &#x26;c): war, if the South prove positive, &#x2018;may last for thirty years,&#x2019; thinks B<hi rend="italic">a</hi>! Did you ever hear of a prettier quarrel ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> nothing at all?&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621023-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-10-23">23 Oct.</date></ref>). Botta&#x2019;s report, suggesting optimistic feelings about the outcome in New York, balanced by the possibility that the South could still separate (which would have lead to a protracted civil war if the North refused to accept a separation), is a reminder for the twenty-first century reader that the outcome of the war was unknowable in <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>, with rumor, news, and opinion all playing their part in the views of onlookers outside the United States. But TC&#x2019;s closing comment to his brother John here does seem to indicate a lack of appreciation of the seriousness of the divisions over slavery, even if he understood more about the importance of power, control, and business.</p>
<p>TC and JWC had many sources of information about foreign affairs through their friendship circle. Although JWC was no longer as close to Giuseppe Mazzini as she had been in the past (see, for example, his letter to her in <date when="1846-07-00">July 1846</date> [<ref target="volume-20/lt-18460706-JWC-TC-01"><sic>20:222</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-07-06">6 July 1846</date></corr></ref>], when she was angry and upset with TC), Mazzini wrote to her in <date when="1862-08-00">August 1862</date>; she reported to TC that he had gone to Italy &#x201C;with his eyes perfectly open to the madness&#x201C; of Garibaldi&#x2019;s plans for an invasion of southern Italy (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620902-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1862-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref>). By <date when="1862-11-00">November 1862</date>, she wrote to Lady Airlie that Mazzini had told her in <date when="1862-08-00">August</date> that Garibaldi&#x2019;s enterprise was &#x201C;perfectly ruinous &#x201C;; he had written, &#x201C;I go [to Italy] in two days&#x2014;knowing that I go, merely to involve myself in the ruin which Garibaldi has prepared for us all&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621110-JWC-LAI-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LAI</corr>, <date when="1862-11-10">10 Nov. 1862</date></ref>). She also reported to Julia Schwabe TC&#x2019;s low opinion of Garibaldi: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C doesn&#x2019;t admire Garibaldi at all! Has been bored to death with all the talk of him, declares him to be &#x2018;the great dramatic Mountebank of the Age&#x2019;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621110-JWC-JSSC-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JSSC</corr>, [ca. <date when="1862-11-10">10 Nov. 1862</date>]</ref>). Meanwhile, TC gained information about Australia through Charles Gavan Duffy, known first to the Carlyles when he was a radical Young Irelander (see<ref target="volume-19/lt-18450428-TC-MAC-01"><sic>19:64&#x2013;66</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1845-04-28">28 April 1845</date></corr></ref>), but now an eminently respectable commissioner for lands and works for Victoria, Australia, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>, reappointed <date when="1861-11-00">November 1861</date>. Duffy also sent Australian colleagues to call on the Carlyles, among them Henry Parkes, commissioner for immigration, who was visiting Britain to encourage emigration. TC and Parkes had met in <date when="1861-10-00">October 1861</date> and had a long discussion, in which Carlylean opinions were expressed vigorously (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18611002-TC-HP-01"><sic>37:241</sic><corr>TC to HP, <date when="1861-10-02">2 Oct. 1861</date></corr></ref>). TC commented to Parkes, in a letter of <date when="1861-12-00">December 1861</date>, &#x201C;I have no recollection what I said to you about colonisation that ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi>&#x201C; but continued: &#x201C;The subject used to be of earnest almost of painful interest to me in old years; it seemed to me there had no Nation ever had such glorious opportunities of changing its nearly intolerable curses and choking <hi rend="italic">nightmares</hi> into blessings and winged angels, as Great Britain in our day, by <hi rend="italic">Colonising;</hi> or was so scandalously throwing <pb id="pg-38-xvii" n="38:xvii"/>said opportunity away&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18611231-TC-HP-01">TC to HP, <date when="1861-12-31">31 Dec.</date></ref>). By <date when="1862-09-00">September 1862</date>, TC wrote to Parkes about Duffy&#x2019;s &#x201C;entertaining commentary on the <hi rend="italic">New</hi> <hi rend="italic">Land Law</hi> [for New South Wales], wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had not been able to understand before&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620919-TC-HP-01">TC to HP, <date when="1862-09-19">19 Sept.</date></ref>). It is from brief references such as these in the Carlyles&#x2019; letters that we are able to construct a pattern for their sources of information on international affairs. Much of the contact was carried on by letter, but some came out of encounters with new acquaintances in London, sent by friends overseas: for example, Parkes, who was sent by Duffy; Duffy himself, originally introduced in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> by the Irish nationalist Frederick Lucas (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/171271"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); and all the American visitors sent by R. W. Emerson or Charles Butler.</p>
<p>While the men among their new acquaintances came mainly to see TC, some of the women became new friends for JWC. Margaret Oliphant, first met during summer <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601212-JWC-MO-01"><sic>37:62</sic><corr>JWC to MO, <date when="1860-12-12">12 Dec. 1860</date></corr></ref>) through her work on The <hi rend="italic">Life of Edward Irving,</hi> was now a friend. There are only occasional letters between JWC and Oliphant because they lived close enough to visit each other, Oliphant having moved to Ealing from Edinburgh in <date when="1861-10-00">October 1861</date>; Oliphant wrote, <date when="1861-11-00">November 1861</date>: &#x201C;May I call tomorrow somewhere about 2 o clock? Miss Jewsbury brought me your kind message of which you may be sure I was only too glad to take advantage&#x2014; Indeed I should have gone to see you before, had I not thought it likely you were still out of town. If I do not hear from you tomorrow morning I shall take it for granted that I may come&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18611111-MO-JWC-01">MO to JWC, [<date when="1861-11-11">11 Nov. 1861</date>]</ref>; MS: NLS 1774.214). In early <date when="1862-05-00">May 1862</date>, JWC postponed a visit to Ealing but suggested a visit the following week (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620501-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, [<date when="1862-05-01">early May</date>]</ref>). TC, the first to meet Oliphant, continued to take an interest in her; JWC reported that he thought <hi rend="italic">The Life of Edward Irving</hi> was &#x201C;worth whole cart-loads of Mulochs and Brontes and things of that sort&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620501-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, [<date when="1862-05-01">early May</date>]</ref>). Dinah Mulock, featured in JWC&#x2019;s letters as an astonishingly young author (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491112-TC-JN-01"><sic>24:288&#x2013;89</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1849-11-12">12 Nov. 1849</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491202-JWC-HW-01"><sic>304</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1849-12-02">2 Dec. 1849</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521230-JWC-HW-01"><sic>27:387</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1852-12-30">30 Dec. 1852</date></corr></ref>), was by now a well-established novelist. TC&#x2019;s reported comment must have been pleasing to Oliphant, professing admiration for her work above the more commercially successful Mulock and Bront&#xEB;s.</p>
<p>Margaret Oliphant&#x2019;s function as a new friend for JWC was perhaps to provide reminders of Scotland and of JWC&#x2019;s youthful friendship with Irving. JWC is compared by Oliphant to her own mother (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601031-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>37:32</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, <date when="1860-10-31">31 Oct. 1860</date></corr></ref>, and Oliphant, ed. Jay, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 97&#x2013;98). JWC certainly would have seen Oliphant as her junior, but, because of her professional life ( &#x201C;one of the best Novelists of the day&#x201C; [<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620414-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-04-14">14 April</date>]</ref>]) as well as her status as a widow with children, JWC would not have seen Oliphant as an equivalent to young women such as Isabella Barnes, whom JWC also adopted as recipients for enthusiastic friendship. Although there are a few surviving letters to Oliphant, written in JWC&#x2019;s best style (including her first, <date when="1860-12-00">December 1860</date>; see <pb id="pg-38-xviii" n="38:xviii"/><ref target="volume-37/lt-18601212-JWC-MO-01"><sic>37:62&#x2013;65</sic><corr>JWC to MO, <date when="1860-12-12">12 Dec. 1860</date></corr></ref>), their shared Scottishness probably precluded any full-blown swearing of eternal friendship. That was reserved for Charlotte Cushman, the American actress who lived between the United States and Italy, visiting London fairly frequently. JWC and Cushman finally met in <date when="1861-08-00">August 1861</date> (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610906-JWC-CCU-01"><sic>37:224</sic><corr>JWC to CCU, <date when="1861-09-06">6 Sept. 1861</date></corr></ref>); this volume includes the development of their correspondence; they hoped to meet when Cushman was passing through London in early <date when="1862-10-00">October 1862</date>, but may have missed each other as JWC was to be in Dover with another new friend, the &#x201C;gentle, intelligent, and perfectly well bred&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620601-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-05-01">July</date>]</ref>) Caroline Davenport Bromley. Cushman&#x2019;s and JWC&#x2019;s surviving letters vie in their expression of exaggerated friendship. JWC wrote: &#x201C;I want to put my arms round your neck, and give you&#x2014;oh! such a good kiss! And then,&#x2014;if you can stand that sort of thing, once in a way,&#x2014;I should like to lay my head on your shoulder and take a good cry! &#x2026; But alas Dear! The &#x2018;gods,&#x2019; however entreated, will not &#x2018;annihilate Time and Space, to make two Lovers happy&#x2019;!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620131-JWC-CC-01">JWC to CC, [<date when="1862-01-31">31 Jan.</date>]</ref>). They met during Cushman&#x2019;s visit to London in <date when="1862-07-00">July 1862</date>, although JWC did not refer to these meetings. Cushman signed one of her notes: &#x201C;God love you, dear, &#x26; make you always care for Your loving Charlotte Cushman&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620712-CC-JWC-01">CC to JWC, <date when="1862-07-12">12 July</date></ref>; MS: NLS 1774.233), and the other: &#x201C;I only am sure of one thing &#x26; that is my loving admiration for you. My desire to be with you &#x26; my vexation at disappointment &#x2F; Love me&#x2014;believe that I am Ever faithfully Your Charlotte Cushman&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620715-CC-JWC-01">CC to JWC, <date when="1862-07-15">15 July</date></ref>; MS: NLS 1774.235). It may be that Cushman enjoyed the frisson of possibility that JWC was open to flirtation if not actually to any lesbian affair. Certainly JWC was probably more capable of flirtation by letter than in person, but it still should be recalled that the swearing of everlasting friendship was a norm in exchanges between many nineteenth-century women in their letters (and possibly in person). JWC recognized this tendency and satirized it, noting in <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date> Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s &#x201C;blaze of enthusiasm about Miss Cushman the Actress&#x2014;with whom she swore everlasting friendship at Manchester&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460119-JWC-JW-01"><sic>20:109</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1846-01-19">19 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>). But now Cushman, at least for the moment, provided JWC with a new and exciting opportunity for the exchange of exaggerated expressions of friendship.</p>
<p>Both Carlyles can undermine preconceptions about &#x201C;Victorianism&#x201C; in what they write, however much TC himself was one of the creators of intellectual Victorianism. This might be explained by their upbringing in a pre-Victorian world, rooted as that was in the more earthy eighteenth century and, in TC&#x2019;s case, in the realistic world of peasant farmers. TC, often assumed to be detached and protected by everyone from the realities of life, wrote to his brother John, the doctor, about their niece Jenny Carlyle&#x2019;s irregular menstrual periods: &#x201C;Jane had heard from questioning Mary that the poor little Jenny was fallen quite &#x2018;irregular in her <hi rend="italic">times</hi>&#x2019; (for six months past); wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a <pb id="pg-38-xix" n="38:xix"/>very serious matter for y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> women&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620913-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref>). JWC&#x2019;s letters also showed that conversations between women were frank; after her return from visiting Mary Russell, she wrote, &#x201C;My breast is <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620915-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-09-15">15 Sept.</date>]</ref>), having apparently told Mrs. Russell about some problem during her visit. The vigor of TC&#x2019;s opinions, whether in conversation or in print, is well known, but a flavor of it can be caught in his letters, particularly those written to family or to JWC. Charles Kingsley, an equally representative Victorian, was already well known to the Carlyles. Kingsley&#x2019;s wife was the redoubtable Frances Eliza, five years older than Kingsley; TC, meeting her on his visit to the Ashburtons, reported succinctly: &#x201C;Wife is a strange blubbery, half-squinting, solemnly-contemplative Lady (religious &#x26;c)&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620129-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1862-01-29">29 Jan.</date></ref>). Meanwhile JWC made mischief with the concepts of legitimacy and illegitimacy. Her illegitimate cousin, Jackie Welsh, was fully recognized within the Welsh family; rather than using Jackie&#x2019;s status to exclude her on grounds of &#x201C;nonrespectability,&#x201C; JWC (in a letter to the wife of an old school friend in Haddington) joked about the illegitimacy: &#x201C;[I]t is a fact worth notice for both Physiologists and Moralists, that Jackie is admirably <hi rend="italic">Legitimate</hi> in her <hi rend="italic">handwriting</hi>!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620308-JWC-JD-01">JWC to JD, <date when="1862-00-00">8 March</date></ref>). Her enjoyment of outrageous gossip manifested itself to TC when she wrote about Lord Monboddo&#x2019;s daughter and the likeness of her son to Francis Jeffrey (one of JWC&#x2019;s loyalest friends in the early days of the Carlyle marriage): &#x201C;A woman who commenced with an irregular marriage, you see! quite easy to arrive later at an irregular Baby!&#x2014;&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620815-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-15">15 Aug.</date>]</ref>). Lord Monboddo, the famous eighteenth-century Scottish judge and philosopher, was renowned as much for his belief in the close relationship of man to apes and beliefs in the origin of language as for his legal judgments. Jeffrey himself, although not dying until <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, was equally a representative of the Scottish Enlightenment, one of the founders of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> in <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date> (the year of JWC&#x2019;s birth) and a harsh critic of the romantic poets. Meanwhile, the death of Prince Albert (<date when="1861-12-14">14 Dec.</date>), a defining moment of Victoria&#x2019;s reign, was referred to not at all by TC, even though he had met Albert in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541109-TC-LA-01"><sic>29:194&#x2013;95</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1854-11-09">9 Nov. 1854</date></corr></ref>), and only obliquely by JWC when she thanked Maggie Welsh for the black silk sleeves sent for Christmas and mentioned a black silk waistcoat made at Nichol&#x2019;s, both in the context of &#x201C;the present mourning crisis&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18611228-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, [<date when="1861-12-28">28 Dec.</date>]</ref>). But this was mentioned in the context of a forthcoming visit to The Grange, where such social niceties as the observation of national mourning for the death of the prince consort would be imposed and JWC would both expect and want to conform.</p>
<p>TC&#x2019;s religious ambiguities and doubts are well documented, but JWC&#x2019;s attitudes are perhaps less well known. She clearly was no more convinced of the virtues of religious observance than TC, neither of them undertaking any <pb id="pg-38-xx" n="38:xx"/>conventional observation or church attendance. In this volume JWC also used the idea of religious faith and observation to point up differences between her own upbringing as a Scottish Presbyterian and English religious observations of various kinds. Fond as she was of Isabella Barnes, daughter of JWC&#x2019;s doctor, JWC&#x2019;s attendance at her wedding to John Simmonds still led to the comment (reported to the Scottish Mary Russell) on English weddings as &#x201C;something betwixt a Religious Ceremony and a&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Pantomime!</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620223-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1862-02-23">23 Feb.</date></ref>). JWC also wrote to the equally Scottish Jane Dods about her social life, two dinners (even though she had been ill), and a particularly funny account of Isabella&#x2019;s Anglican wedding: &#x201C;And me a <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian</hi> too!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620308-JWC-JD-01">JWC to JD, <date when="1862-03-08">8 March</date></ref>). Her skepticism about religion (see, for example, 20:240) extended to her evangelical aunts in Edinburgh (see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570819-TC-JWC-01"><sic>33:38</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1857-08-19">19 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>). She reported to TC while on a visit to them: &#x201C;[S]till I am like a fish out of water in this element of religiosity; or rather, like a human being in water&#x2014;and the water hot!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620905-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-09-05">5 Sept.</date>]</ref>). To Mary Russell, she made a careful distinction between &#x201C;religion&#x201C; and &#x201C;religiosity &#x201C;: &#x201C;At Craigenvilla &#x2026; I am always reacting against the self-assumption and the <hi rend="italic">religiosity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> the <hi rend="italic">religion,</hi> mind!)&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620908-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-09-08">5 Sept.</date>]</ref>). Despite this distinction, her belief in any God was apparently as ambiguous as anything TC wrote privately in his letters or in such works as <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus.</hi></p>
<p>The reality of death, on the other hand, was not a matter for satire from either of them. TC was moved by the deaths caused by the collapse of an Edinburgh tenement (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18611201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-12-01">1 Dec.</date></ref>) and personally grieved by the death of Lady Sandwich (the mother of the first Lady Ashburton), expressing his sadness to Lord Ashburton and writing about her funeral (which he attended) to his brother John and sister Jean Carlyle Aitken (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620421-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1862-04-21">21 April</date></ref>; to <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620426-TC-JCA-01">JCA, <date when="1862-04-26">28 [26] April</date></ref>; and to <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620429-TC-JAC-01">JAC, <date when="1862-04-29">29 April</date></ref>). The months of this volume contained a litany of death; beginning with the sudden death next door of Alexander Gilchrist, they continued with the terminal illness and then deaths of Ellen Twisleton (at only forty-four) and of JWC&#x2019;s old Fife friend Elizabeth Pepoli. Failing all winter, Elizabeth refused to have family with her or to ask for her husband, Count Pepoli, to return from Italy: &#x201C;[T]here is stoicism in that but not heroism&#x2014;not lovingness&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620213-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-02-13">13 Feb.</date>]</ref>). JWC reported visiting Elizabeth daily, despite her critical view of her &#x201C;proud stoicism&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620325-JWC-LLA-01">JWC to Lady A, [ca. <date when="1862-02-25">25 March</date>]</ref>; <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620414-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-04-14">14 April</date>]</ref>), and she commented: &#x201C;[J]ust when the freshness of one sorrow was wearing off there has come another&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620605-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-06-05">5 June</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>Many of TC&#x2019;s letters were about his perceived slow progress (or lack of it) in Frederick; when he mentioned JWC it was mainly to report on her health or lack of it. But many of JWC&#x2019;s letters showed her teasing TC, protecting his reputation, organizing, or commenting on him. While on a visit to The Grange, she instructed him: &#x201C;Look up in your topographical Book for <hi rend="italic">Saltwood <pb id="pg-38-xxi" n="38:xxi"/>Castle.</hi> Lady A asked, when we were [the]re today, if I thought <hi rend="italic">you</hi> [w]ould be able to tell us about it and I said &#x2018;of course&#x2019; you would&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620702-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-07-02">2 July</date>]</ref>). But she also broadened her observations of TC into more general ones on men. After Dr. Russell had an accident, she expanded satirically on men (including TC) and illness:</p>
<q>The longer I live, the more I am certified that men, in all that relates to their own health, have not common sense! whether it be their Pride, or their Impatience, or their Obstinacy or their ingrained Spirit of Contradiction that stultifies and misleads them&#x2014;the result is always a certain amount of idiocy or distraction, in their dealings with their own bodies! I am not generalizing from my own Husband. I know that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is a quite extravagant example of that want of common sense in bodily matters, which I complain of. Few <hi rend="italic">men</hi> (even) are so lost to themselves as to dry their soaked trowsers on their legs! (as he does) or swallow five grains of mercury <hi rend="italic">in the middle of the day,</hi> and then walk or ride three hours under a plunge of rain! (as he does) &#x26;c &#x26;c But <hi rend="italic">men</hi> generally&#x2014;all of them I have ever had to do with&#x2014;even <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sensible Husband included you see!&#x2014;drive the poor women who care for them to despair; either by their wild impatience of bodily suffering, and the exaggerated moan they make over it, or else by their reckless defiance of it, and neglect of every dictate of Prudence! (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620223-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-02-23">23 Feb.</date>]</ref>)</q>
<p>JWC&#x2019;s peroration on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">men generally</hi>,&#x201C; health, and common sense, may not be a startlingly radical gender analysis, but it corroborates the consistency of women&#x2019;s observations of male behavior (whether accurate or not) from one century to another.</p>
<p>The increasing use of photography was something in which both the Carlyles were caught up. The volume begins with references to the photograph of TC on his horse, Fritz, in Hyde Park (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18611110-TC-CGD-01"><sic>7</sic><corr>TC to CGD, <date when="1861-11-10">10 Nov. 1861</date></corr></ref>). But the main excitement came in the following fall. JWC was entertained to be photographed by the Thornhill hairdresser when she was visiting Mary Russell, and circulated copies of the result, TC describing it as a &#x201C;very successful Photograph&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620701-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1862-09-01">1 July [Sept.]</date></ref>). JWC told TC that &#x201C;Mrs Russell and I got <hi rend="italic">taken</hi> one day for fun; and if I had dreamt of coming out so well, I would have dressed myself better, and turned the best side of my face!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620902-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1862-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref>). TC took a holiday in <date when="1862-09-00">September</date>, JWC commenting that this &#x201C;&#x2018;sacred week&#x2019; of idling and sight-seeing&#x201C; would be &#x201C;an exceptional week in our mutual life&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620905-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-09-05">2 Sept.</date>]</ref>), and the luring of TC to a photographer took place in this week. JWC reported:</p>
<q>An immense explosion of photographs has come off in this house! in consequence of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken&#x2019;s indiscretion in lending the print of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to <pb id="pg-38-xxii" n="38:xxii"/>a photographist in Dumfries, who tho &#x201C;bound down to take <hi rend="italic">only six copies, &#x201C;</hi> &#x2026; had nevertheless, as I thought at the time, sent these wretched photographs out in shoals for his own gain! My aunt Grace had seen a great <hi rend="italic">heap</hi> of them lying on a Booksellers counter in Princes Street! &#x2026; What all my entreaties had not been able to obtain from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;viz that he would go and be photographed by a right man here, was accomplished by his annoyance at being published over the world under so unlike a form. And having decided that last week was to be a holyday, he actually went with me to the best Photographer in London, who had been for years soliciting him to come and be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">nothing!</hi>&#x2014; He (the Photographer took a great many different ones, large and small; of which <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the large ones satisfied him, and is to be <hi rend="italic">published</hi> and I think <hi rend="italic">it</hi> the finest photograph I ever saw. &#x2026; As of course M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey (the photographer) will make <hi rend="italic">a good thing</hi> of supplying the shops with <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">C</hi>; he was very obliging in insisting on <hi rend="italic">doing me</hi>&#x2014;who had not laid my account with being <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and so, was at the same loss for a head-dress&#x2014;as you were at the Hairdressers!

<p>The passage is worth quoting at length as it illustrates the commercial possibilities of the literary celebrity in Victorian times permitted by the improving technologies of photography and reproduction. It also illustrated for Mary Russell, with whom she had just shared the enjoyment of the more &#x201C;provincial&#x201C; photography experience (for example, the edge of another backdrop showing behind the screen; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620830-JWC-MCA-01"><sic>179<!-- 178 --></sic><corr>JWC to MCA, [<date when="1862-08-30">30 Aug.</date>]</corr></ref>), her ability to organize TC into doing what she wanted because of his irritation at someone else&#x2019;s exploiting his image for financial gain. TC made humorous reference to his appearance in this series of photographs when he wrote to Lady Ashburton: &#x201C;If you be a good child, I do believe you have a chance of one of the ugliest Photographic Pictures of the human countenance you ever saw: an old grim fellow (much older than I thot he was) in wool-white hair; features full of gloom, hard as granite, and looking out quite relentless upon life&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620919-TC-LAI-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LAI</corr>, <date when="1862-09-19">19 Sept.</date></ref>). JWC then reported TC&#x2019;s comment: &#x201C;[W]e are all ugly! <hi rend="italic">some of us</hi> very ugly indeed!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18620925-JWC-LST-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, <date when="1862-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref>). The final photographic session of the year took place at The Grange with Vernon Heath, the fashionable photographer; JWC reported Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s description of his picture of TC and Lord Ashburton (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621030-JWC-EFO-01"><sic>248</sic><corr>JWC to EFO, <date when="1862-10-30">30 Oct.</date></corr></ref>): &#x201C;two Criminals in one <hi rend="italic">dock;</hi> the one (Lord A) having <hi rend="italic">received</hi> his sentence of death, and sinking away into insensibility; the other (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C) in the act of receiving his, and glaring back uneasy defiance!!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-38/lt-18621030-JWC-EFO-01">JWC to <sic>EF</sic><corr>EFO</corr>, <date when="1862-10-30">30 Oct.</date></ref>). Amusing as this was, the picture itself recorded clearly the increasing frailty of Lord Ashburton, although the death feared in <date when="1862-11-00">November 1862</date> did not finally arrive until <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-xxiii" n="38:xxiii"/>The letters of this volume continue to show the Carlyles in the full detail of their daily lives. Rooted in Chelsea, but with strong links continuing to Scotland, Europe, the United States, and Australia, they developed along with the Victorian age. Their families and friendships, their opinions, their idiosyncrasies, their talents, and their achievements are presented and explored in these letters, providing continuing evidence of the rich trove of material to be found in the Carlyles&#x2019; letters.</p>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Your friend Parkes, who did not present himself till quite lately, &#x201C;hearing I was so busy,&#x201C;&#x2014;came the other evening;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Parkes, a friend of Duffy&#x2019;s from Australia, had come to Britain for a year as a commissioner of immigration for the Colony of Victoria; he had arrived in Britain in <date when="1861-08-00">Aug.</date> but did not visit TC until <date when="1861-10-00">Oct.</date>; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18611002-TC-HP-01"><sic>37:241</sic><corr>TC to HP, <date when="1861-10-02">2 Oct. 1861</date></corr></ref>. Duffy had given Parkes a letter of introduction to TC.</note> and gave us a few pleasant hours. We <pb id="pg-38-05" n="38:05"/>find him a robust, effective, intelligent and sincere kind of man,&#x2014;extremely loyal to C.G.D.; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not one of his smallest merits here. He gave me several more precise notions ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Australian Life; seemed to be thoroughly at home in the anarchic democratic Universal-Palaver element, and to swim about in it, with a candid joy, like a fish in water;&#x2014;and indeed I could not but own that, in comparison with the old Colonial-Office &#x26; Parliamentary-Fogie methods of administration, it might be a real improvement;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parkes later recalled TC saying: &#x201C;I have been thinking over your praise of your responsible governing machine out there which you have set up in place of the Old Fogies of the Nominee days; on the whole, I think it is better&#x2014;if you must have one or other&#x2014;than the Old Fogies&#x201C; (Parkes 1:164&#x2013;65).</note> &#x26; that, in short, in the present anarchic condition of England, there was nothing for it but to let her Colonies go, in this wild manner, down the wind, whither they listed; till once it became insupportable to the poor minority of wise men among themselves, and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> (probably sword-in-hand) c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> resolve to take some course with it, Life to them having grown worse than Death under such conditions. It is my prophecy for Yankee-land, and for England, and for all Countries with National-Palaver &#x26; Penny Newspapers in them: if the gods intend that these Nations are to continue above ground, said Nations will have to abolish, or tightly chain-up, all that (so far as I can form the least opin<hi rend="italic">n</hi>),&#x2014;or if the Nation prefers not to abolish, it can at its own good pleasure go down; to very <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> quarters indeed; and will find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a resigned man, whichever way!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to Parkes, TC &#x201C;asked many curious questions about Australia, which showed the original light in which he viewed some well-threshed-out subjects of colonization. &#x2026; [H]e contended that, if governing men could only free themselves from the trammels of custom and be truly wise, they would remove the Sovereign and the Court and all the machinery of Government to Australia, where the field for national life was so wide, attractive, and unencumbered, and so leave the contracted spaces and the murky atmosphere of England behind them&#x201C; (Parkes 1:160&#x2013;161).</note>&#x2014; But I waste my paper sadly.</p>
 <p>The worst news Parkes gave us was that you did not seem to be in good health; <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> health he sometimes defined your situation to be, when we pressed him for details. That you are &#x201C;out of Office for the last 18 months,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy served as commissioner of lands and works for the Colony of Victoria, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>, and then resigned because of differences over land policy. He was reappointed to the position <date when="1861-11-14">14 Nov.</date></note> is, since you have means of modest livelihood independ<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> rather a pleasure to hear: but this of health&#x2014;alas, alas! Could not the Victoria people be persuaded to send <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as their &#x201C;Agent&#x201C; hitherward?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Colonies in Australia regularly sent agents to Britain to persuade people to emigrate, as Parkes was doing; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18611022-JWC-HP-01"><sic>37:253</sic><corr>JWC to HP, <date when="1861-10-22">22 Oct. 1861</date></corr></ref>.</note> Anything that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> bring you home, how welcome were it to us! Or w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not your means, tho&#x2019; modest, enable you to live <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> as well as at Melbourne?

If you delay too long, some of us will not be discoverable here when you land expectant.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy replied, <date when="1862-07-20">20 July 1862</date>: &#x201C;You speak of my returning to Europe. It is my constant hope to do so&#x2014;and when I am relieved from office I will probably make a visit of a year at all events, to what we still fondly call Home. I have now however six children, and one does not move so lightly or so rapidly as of old, with a suite like this. <hi rend="italic">When</hi> the event will come that makes me free to travel I cannot foretell;&#x2014;any time may be wondered probable from three months to three years.&#x201C; He and his family traveled back to Europe, <date when="1865-04-00">April 1865</date>, and stayed until <date when="1866-12-00">Dec. 1866</date>.</note>&#x2014; I write to beg for a Letter, at the greatest length you can afford, and with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> loss of time, elucidating these and the cognate points, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you need not doubt are at all times interesting to me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy replied, <date when="1862-07-20">20 July 1862</date>: &#x201C;If I delayed answering your last letter it was waiting for the termination of a parliamentary session in which I believed I was accomplishing something; and during which, at all events, I lived like a man in a besieged town.

<p>I really am ashamed under your munificences as to cigars! I was still <hi rend="italic">two Boxes</hi> strong; and here has another come today.

    <salute>Dear Mr Ruskin,</salute>
    <p>The Publisher has sent me the Book of &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Selections,</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">John Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Selections from the Writings of John Ruskin</hi> (<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), pbd. by Smith, Elder &#x00026; Co.</note> as promised; and it is my constant companion, these evenings, in the few leisure hours I have;&#x02014;awakening in me, seriously, the wish that every drawing-room in her Majesty&#x02019;s dominions were provided with a Copy, and able to read it with feelings similar to mine! It is many a day and year since I met with any Book the spirit of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (to say nothing of its lively felicitous expression) is so accordant with what I reckon best &#x00026; truest.&#x02014; The idea of the Publisher<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Smith, Elder &#x00026; Co. prefaced the volume with an &#x0201C;Advertisement&#x0201D;: &#x0201C;[T]his volume has originated in suggestions, from numerous quarters, that a book of the kind would be acceptable to a large circle of readers. &#x02026; The publishers think it right to add that Mr. Ruskin, though tacitly consenting to this publication, has taken no part in making the selections, and is in no way responsible for the appearance of the volume&#x0201D; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Selections</hi> [iii]). <hi rend="italic">Selections</hi> was compiled by William Smith Williams (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), the publisher&#x02019;s reader, and William Henry Harrison (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), Ruskin&#x02019;s editor and family friend. John James Ruskin sent TC&#x02019;s letter to his son, who replied, <date when="1861-12-05">5 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I have your nice and kind letter &#x02026; enclosing Carlyle&#x02019;s, most interesting and kind also. &#x02026; As <hi rend="italic">he</hi> says the extracts are right, I have not a word more to say against them. It is the books which must be wrong&#x0201D; (E. T. Cook, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Ruskin</hi> [<date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>] 2:42). Ruskin then wrote to his father, <date when="1861-12-09">9 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Don&#x02019;t send the book of extracts to <hi rend="italic">any</hi>body, that you can help. &#x02026; It is a form of mince-pie which I have no fancy for. My crest is all very well as long as it means Pork, but I don&#x02019;t love being made into sausages&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 2:42). Ruskin&#x02019;s crest was a boar&#x02019;s head.</note> was surely altogether good; multitudes of people, who could not get access to the big expensive works, will be furnished with this as a kind of manual; and no ingenuous soul will read any bit of it (at least any bit I have yet fallen in with) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will not have a tendency to do him <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> as well as give him pleasure.

<p>I quite agree in what you say of poor Clough.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blanche Clough wrote, <date when="1861-11-15">15 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;He has been gradually going down hill for two years past, but I never feared anything so rapid as this. It has been very lonely being so far away from home&#x2014;he has indeed not been home since last <date when="1860-07-00">July</date>, but from the first he was too ill and too fatigued I think to feel this much. And yet he was writing [&#x201C;composing&#x201C; written above] verses perpetually during the first fortnight &#x26; struggling afterwards to write themdown It seemed as if all he had been collecting during the past year had suddenly taken a form. &#x2026; Nothing is finished alas. It is very bitter to me to feel that he has passed away &#x26; left almost nothing behind&#x2014;that so many years of his life have been spent in cutting blocks with a razor&#x2014;that is making bread for us. &#x2026; I should very much like some future time to bring to you his little boy&#x2014;he is very like him externally&#x2014;as near as 2 can be to 42.&#x201C;</note> A man more vivid, ingenious, veracious, mildly radiant, I have seldom met with, and in a character so <pb id="pg-38-16" n="38:16"/>honest, modest, kindly.

As for the &#x2018;two pages&#x2019; you propose, there could, had my hands been loose, have been no valid objections, but, as it is, my hands are tied.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude was appointed editor of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> by John William Parker after the death of his son and partner, John William Parker (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">60</date>; see <ref target="volume-31/ed-31-biographical-notes"><sic>31:[2]56</sic><corr>31:biographical note</corr></ref>). &#x201C;I knew what Carlyle felt about [Clough], and I tried to induce him to write some few words which might give that memory an enduring form,&#x201C; but, Froude noted, &#x201C;[e]very available moment had been guaranteed to &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019;&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:244).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This is Sunday, the one bright dry day we have had since Sunday last,&#x2014;such a week of mud and <hi rend="italic">pluister</hi> as I have seldom seen, and many things going <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> rather than right! I am keeping this day strictly as a <hi rend="italic">holiday;</hi> having sat all week <hi rend="italic">futilely</hi> trying continually at my new &#x201C;Book XVI,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ten Years of Peace&#x201C;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:194&#x2013;410.</note>&#x2014;till, last night, I pretty nearly (but not quite) missed my sleep upon it; and so have determined that there shall be <hi rend="italic">a pause</hi> absolute. I already think my way is clearer; and that next week will not be so frustrated as this has sorrowfully been. Before going out, I write you one word on matters that have fallen out.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-17" n="38:17"/>Poor Gilchrist! I have seldom been near such a tragedy. Saturday night gone a week he knocked at our door, but did not come in, somebody being here: one of his children had scarlet-fever tho it seemed nearly well: next day (this day week), G<hi rend="italic">t</hi> himself felt ill, had himself taken the fever; and on Friday, deep in the night, he breathed his last! Such a scene of confusion (servants too falling sick, other children d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) as seemed to be in that House filled one with pity and misery. The poor wife had entirely refused the Dr Barnes&#x2019;s advice to <hi rend="italic">send away</hi> that first child;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beatrice; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18611025-JWC-AGIL-01"><sic>37:254</sic><corr>JWC to AGIL, <date when="1861-10-25">25 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note> quarrelled with Barnes (in fact, turned him off), and did other unwise things; and is now in such a mood as the cruellest might pity. Poor Jane (mostly on the sofa) did &#x26; strove what was possible; her maids<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Sullivan and Maria Chamberlayne.</note> running about continually on errands that came across, or that she herself devised;&#x2014;and, in fact, I think but for her poor head the Gilchrist House must have gone mad altogether.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Dilberoglue wrote to Charlotte Cushman, <date when="1861-12-15">15 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;[T]he grand old man has had a great deal of unfitting work lately such as being called up in the night to seek a doctor for a dying neighbour&#x2014;a Mr Gilchrist &#x2026; who did die and then going to a dreary common-place funeral&#x2014;to him one of the most horrible things under the sun,&#x2014;to gratify a poor, distracted widow,&#x2014;and doing, along with Mrs Carlyle, all sorts of neighbourly kindnesses&#x201C; (Charlotte Cushman Papers, LC). Charlotte Cushman wrote to JWC, <date when="1861-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, sending the letter via Sarah Dilberoglue: &#x201C;To hear of Cheyne Row through Barnsbury Park is very dear to me&#x2014;but I want more. &#x2026; I hear <hi rend="italic">of</hi> you &#x26; your sayings&#x2014;for my little friend is clever &#x26; knows how to fill <hi rend="italic">her</hi> letter acceptably in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> ways. I send her this letter to give to you in gratitude, for it will please her.&#x201C; Cushman described her response to JWC enthusiastically: &#x201C;I cannot write to you. I love you but I <hi rend="italic">fear</hi> you &#x26; my soul blushes as I recognise the fear within the fear that it may be more my self love which fears you than my heart. You are so wonderful to me. I think of you ever&#x2014;and of all that you said &#x26; did on that first &#x26; only day I saw you when a new heaven &#x26; a new earth was revealed to me. I remember all your looks_all your tones&#x2014;all your unchecked flow of marvellously fitting words&#x2014;all your far seeings all your subtle fancies&#x2014;your facile dissections&#x2014;your graphic description&#x2014;your inimitable behaviour&#x2014;your perfect knowledge of, &#x26; yet indifference to, what you were doing&#x2014;your self possession&#x2014;your evident indwelling sense of power to have and to hold&#x2014;even that which was ridiculous to you through its unfitness&#x2014;&#x26; the indomitable frankness with which you held it up to my view&#x2014;all, all, all are stamped upon my memory&#x2014;with an electric fire which burns me yet! I find you marvellous! &#x2026; . There is but one of you, none other in the world like you! I cannot hope to speak or think or write like you. Why should I consider myself. Why should I not minister in my own poor way? Because&#x2014;I want your consideration I want your respect&#x2014;I want your care for me&#x2014;your thoughts of me to be as good as my admiration of you &#x26; I fear to lose all through my desire to possess all. But I cannot bear not to hear from you.&#x201C;</note> Of course, it has done her no little harm (sleep <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> gone for the last 2 nights, &#x26;c &#x26;c): but what is that to the tragedy itself (other side the wall), of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all this is but the reflex!&#x2014; Her <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> is never very ill; I hope to send better news next time.</p>

<dateline>5 Cheyne Row Friday [<date when="1861-12-06">6 December 1861</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Mrs Gilchrist,</salute>
<p>I was glad and thankful to get your letter this morning. I knew thro&#x2019; the nurse<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> that the little Boy<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herbert, the Gilchrists&#x2019; younger son.</note> was going on favourably; but I needed some token from yourself, that you were not dwelling quite shut up within the black circle of your own great sorrow; without a thought for any thing beyond it, or any of us who care for you, and sympathize with you so sincerely!</p>
<p>It is a strange thing to say; but I was <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> when I heard your little Boy had taken the fever, and that you had gone off to him!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herbert had been sent to Anne Gilchrist&#x2019;s mother, Henrietta Burrows, at Earls Colne in Essex. &#x201C;No sooner was the funeral over, than scarlet fever attacked the younger son, who, some few days prior to taking it, had been conveyed to Colne&#x201C; (Gilchrist 106).</note> I felt sure&#x2014;perhaps because so much had been taken from you already&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would be spared; and in the meantime, the anxiety on his account would recall you to a sense of what you had still left&#x2014;to lose! And the very movement, and change of scene, and of air would rouse you out of that blackness of despair in which your last lines to me were written, poor dear Soul!</p>
<p>Things seem to go on very well in your house. That nurse, from all my girls<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s maids, Margaret and Maria.</note> say of her, seems to be a most anxious painstaking woman.</p>
<p>I have had good accounts of the children every day. Only yesterday Percy<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Percy Gilchrist, the eldest child and elder son.</note> had a little sickness, the nurse thought &#x201C;from the heartiness of his appetite&#x201C;&#x2014;and a pill in the form of powder would put him all to rights. I sent in this evening to ask if she wished any thing told you as I was going to write and she said she had already mentioned everything to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ireland<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Ireland.</note> who would write.</p>
<p>Anne<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne, the Gilchrists&#x2019; maid.</note> has been much better the last two days. it was announced to me quite radiantly by Maria that &#x201C;Anne had eaten a chop!&#x201D;&#x2014; The nurse thinks that &#x201C;by next week Anne will be quite up to her work.&#x201C;</p>
<p>For myself, I am quite recovered from my nervous attack, can sleep <hi rend="small-caps">some</hi> and eat <hi rend="italic">some</hi>, but the <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> and restlessness it has left behind are most depressing. I have been twice out in a fly the first time I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> most of the way, <pb id="pg-38-21" n="38:21"/>and was much worse for it but the last time (yesterday) it procured me a better night than I had had for six weeks.</p>
<p>I do hope you will tell me if there be <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> you want done, that I can do, either directly or indirectly</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Fitz-Gerald</hi>,</salute>&#x2014;What a time since we have seen you! And still it is no visit, it is only the arrival of half-yearly note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote from Woodbridge in Suffolk, <date when="1861-12-05">5 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I hope you won&#x2019;t be bored with another of my half-yearly Enquiries after yourself and Mrs. Carlyle. You can just tell me how you both are: where you have been this Summer: and how you are getting on with your Frederick now you yourself are got, as I suppose, into Winter Quarters.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;better than quite nothing.</p>
<p>We did not quit town at all this year: the wife ran to Ramsgate with a lady <pb id="pg-38-22" n="38:22"/>friend, to taste the sea airwas delighted with the sea air, but like to be driven mad by the brass bands, bagpipes, Ethiopians, hawkers, and perpetual ragings of foul &#x2026;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellipses by TC or publisher; &#x201C;foul&#x201C; possibly a misreading for &#x201C;fowl&#x201C;; for JWC&#x2019;s description of the noise at Ramsgate, including &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hundreds</hi> of cocks,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610806-JWC-TC-01"><sic>37:201</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1861-08-06">6 Aug. 1861</date></corr></ref>.</note> (not to mention the nasty fat Jews and fat-bellied Cockneys), and came home in a week. I sit here under an awning, and the shadow of the back wall, obstinately bungling along at this unblessed task of mine&#x2014;and might as well have flung it aside, for my rate of &#x201C;progress&#x201C; was frightful. We went in <date when="1861-09-00">September</date> for about ten days into Windsor Forest; some goodish galloping I had in the noble Park there (though under lumbago, etc.), and that was all the rustication vouchsafed to us this year.</p>
<p>I am now really pretty well in health considering the years I count and the drudgery I have to stick to&#x2014;if I could get done with the latter, I should really be tolerably off. But alas, the goal is still far away, and sad muddy pilgrimage, and months more than I like to reckon, are loaded with chagrin, disgust, and almost despair, before the deliverance can come. In the mean time I continue <hi rend="italic">buried</hi>; see nobody (go to see absolutely nobody), toil and struggle all hours of the day, with whatever strength is left me, towards this as the one good still possible for me. With a kind of indignation for most part (for myself among other people), which, as it is all <hi rend="italic">silent,</hi> does the less ill. In truth, &#x201C;this ten years among the Prussian pots&#x201C; has made me very grimy, and humiliated me to the very marrow of the bone. I was computing lately, in one of my rides, that I must have ridden (upon my excellent horse Fritz, who is now waxing old as doth a garment) something like 20,000 miles,&#x2014;nineteenth-twentieths of it or more in solitude, since I began this hateful adventure!</p>
<p>My poor wife is but weakly, has had a tedious cold, etc., but is now getting better. Are you never to see London again, and us again? You have still that stone to set up on Naseby Moor, remember!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald had owned land at Naseby; he and TC had discussed setting up a memorial on the battlefield (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550823-TC-EF-01"><sic>30:40&#x2013;42</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1855-08-23">23 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>), but the plan was never implemented.</note> It was indeed a miserable oversight not to go on to Edinburgh when so near it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote: &#x201C;I went to Berwick-on-Tweed in a sailing Schooner, just for the sake of the Sail: and was within two hours&#x2019; Rail of Edinburgh, which I had never seen, and always wished to see; but, like a great Ass, didn&#x2019;t go to see when all so near: but ran home again.&#x201C;</note> Courage!

<salute>Darling!</salute>
<p>I am not <hi rend="italic">up</hi> to writing you an answer according to your deserts&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> were difficult at any time; but especially out of the question at present! I have been ill&#x2014;very&#x2014;for a month; confined to my room all that time and latterly to my bed&#x2014;prohibited from all use of my brain which had become &#x201C;dangerously excited&#x201C;&#x2014;poor Brain! no wonder! The last three days I have been on the Drawingroom sofa, and am much better. But oh so completely stupified with all the mush and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">calming</hi>&#x2019; medicines I have taken into me, that a &#x201C;Bright young Being,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600830-JWC-LST-01"><sic>36:214</sic><corr>JWC to LST, <date when="1860-08-30">30 Aug. 1860</date></corr></ref>; cf. G. M. Sterne, <hi rend="italic">Tales for an English Home</hi> (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>) 277.</note> of your seraphic sort, cannot form the least idea of it!</p>
<p>Please god I will write you a letter <hi rend="italic">long</hi> enough, at all rates, so soon as I have my wits again!</p>
<p>Meanwhile bless your little heart for the offer of the white dog! all the same as if I accepted it! but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I mustnt do&#x2014; There are three reasons why I mustn&#x2019;t (women have never less than <hi rend="italic">three</hi> reasons you know) First I place my <hi rend="italic">romantic</hi> (if you like) constancy to my dear little dead Nero.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s dog, Nero, was put down <date when="1860-02-1">1 Feb. 1860</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600203-TC-JN-01"><sic>36:56</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1860-02-03">3 Feb. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> I shouldn&#x2019;t like to see a new dog in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> place!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">else where</hi> I still like dogs, and like to play with them&#x2014;but a new dog occupying <hi rend="italic">his</hi> place on the hearthrug or sofa <pb id="pg-38-24" n="38:24"/>would pain me! the little grave at the top of the garden, the little portrait of him in my brooch<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For an illustration of the brooch, see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600207-TC-JN-01"><sic>36:61</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1860-02-07">7 Feb. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;would be desecrated for me by a successor.</p>
<p>Second reason; I believe M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <hi rend="italic">couldn&#x2019;t</hi> be brought to tolerate a new dog!&#x2014; He <hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> so much thro&#x2019; that other in various ways! the worst way of all being <hi rend="italic">grief</hi> at his death!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600212-JWC-LLA-01"><sic>36:67</sic><corr>JWC to LLA, <date when="1860-02-12">12 Feb. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> and at thoughts of him since!!! Verily we are people of very persistent affections in this house! Third reason is the dogs own happiness! I never would have a dog unless I could keep it in health and bodily comfort&#x2014;which no dog can be without plenty of exercise &#x2014; Nero had plenty always I was a capital walker in his time, and took regular long walks for that little creatures sake. But now I am so often confined for months together and seldom walk at all. What would become of a little white dog&#x2019;s degestion in these circumstances? It would blow out and get puffy, and be a constant wheezing reproach to me for keeping it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>and now my Darling I am tired to death; with just this much ugly writing. But most faithfully yours Jane Carlyle</p>
<p>I think some game must have come to us from Alderly?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Stanleys&#x2019; estate in Cheshire.

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to answer, on behalf of my poor wife, that what you so kindly propose is not possible, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> otherwise w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been so agreeable to both of us! She is evidently on the mending hand,&#x2014;after a week&#x2019;s confinement <pb id="pg-38-25" n="38:25"/>to bed day and night;&#x2014;but is so utterly weak the Doctor prohibits all talking and being talked to as quite a specific enemy.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Dilberoglue apparently continued to visit JWC throughout the illness. She reported to Cushman, <date when="1861-12-15">15 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The note for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle &#x2026; came, at a good time; she was confined to her room by illness, and it was quite comforting to her to receive it, indeed. She has been ill for more than a month &#x26; during part of the time in her bed so I have felt it right to keep going over to her. She was on the sofa when I saw her on Friday [<date when="1861-12-13">13 Dec.</date>], but looking a mere shadow. She has trusted me to tell you this that you may understand why she has not written to you&#x2014;it takes more strength than she has, just to think of what <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be daily attended to with her home &#x26; her husband[.] She desired her best love to you and promises as soon as her brain feels capable of thinking you a letter, to send you one. I have le[f]t her mine to read. [TC] came to ask his wife when he was going out to ride if he might order her some &#x2026; jelly. &#x2026; he was told &#x2018;yes&#x2019;&#x2014;but some alterations must be made in it. He took his instructions very carefully, had them repeated over twice&#x2014;looking all the time with his old wiseman face &#x26; figure, so grandly fit for this task he was undertaking&#x2014;but he was so anxious, and so tender, and so childlike in being taught what he must do, it was something to see. Well, went and in about a quarter of an hour the maid came into the room to say that Master had turned back, not feeling quite sure about his message, would M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle tell it him again? So with a quiet [de]preciating patience, she went through it to the maid, and I heard when I went the other day the jelly had been ordered all right&#x201C; (Charlotte Cushman Papers, LC).

<salute>My dear Mrs Chamberlayne</salute>
<p>I cannot tell you how it <hi rend="italic">went to my heart</hi> when Maria came up to the Drawingroom yesterday, carrying a tray piled with her own boots and little presents, and the cake and the ketchup &#x26;c &#x26;c for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> her face perfectly radiant with good-child happiness!&#x2014; With the memory of my own good Mother <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> fresh in my mind,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh had d. <date when="1842-02-25">25 Feb. 1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420127-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>14:27&#x2013;28</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1842-01-27">27 Jan. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> I could enter so profoundly into her feelings &#x2014;(happy girl who has still a Mother to care for her, and send her tokens of Motherly love!)&#x2014;and could see in the contents of your parcel, spread out there so proudly, a more interesting, more beautiful sight, than I should have seen in a trayful of the finest diamonds, unsanctified by Mother-love!</p>
<p>I am often telling Maria how thankful she should be for her good Mother; not that I think she needs any telling&#x2014;but as a sort of spoken sigh over the loss of my own Mother.</p>
<p>I have nothing but the most gratifying things to tell you of Maria. She does what ever is required of her willingly and well&#x2014;and her conduct, I needn&#x2019;t tell <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> who know her, is excellent&#x2014; But she is more than a satisfactory <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> to me&#x2014;she is an intelligent, agreeable <hi rend="italic">companion,</hi> and tho&#x2019; I am slow in making friendships I already feel towards her as a <hi rend="italic">friend.</hi> My Husband also shows more interest in Maria, than I ever saw him take in any servant we have had in England!&#x2014; For the rest; I think she agrees with the place; she certainly <pb id="pg-38-27" n="38:27"/>looks stouter than when she came; and, except a cold for a few days, she has never owned to any illness&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been confined to the Drawingroom for nearly three weeks with a bad cold myself&#x2014;which I am very liable to in winter weather&#x2014;and last night I missed my sleep entirely&#x2014;so my head at this moment feels much as it if were full of wool&#x2014;which is not a good sort of head for writing with&#x2014;but I wouldn&#x2019;t let a day pass without thanking you for your kind gifts&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope to see you face to face, if we go to the Grange this winter&#x2014;as is probable&#x2014;if my health mend enough<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton wrote to TC from The Grange, <date when="1861-12-22">22 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Babe is restored. Lou is well, &#x26; I am just recovering without having taken any allopathic drugs from a somewhat tempestuous fit of gout. That means that it had more of the vigor of a strong mans gout than it has of late been in the habit of honoring me with. So I have just to throw off the enemy, without those troublesome accounts with those we have called in to help, generally the worst enemies of the two. &#x2F;&#x2F; I really am in great spirits about myself, a rather new phase, I can tell you. &#x2026; &#x2F;&#x2F; I can not say with what increasing interest I have swept through Frederic. You have preserved the minutest details that could give life &#x26; colour, &#x26; there is not a word one could omit. We shall receive you &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> C whenever it suit you.&#x201C; JWC was forced to cancel her intended visit to The Grange because of ill health, and TC went alone late <date when="1862-01-00">Jan. 1862</date>.</note>&#x2014;</p>

 But black silk sleeves were indispensable, for making any use of it in winter weather. And as it cost more than I had anticipated I was bound to make use of it! and it was going to come in &#x201C;neat and appropriate&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600830-JWC-LST-01"><sic>36:214</sic><corr>JWC to LST, <date when="1860-08-30">30 Aug. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> at the present mourning crisis!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Albert d. <date when="1861-12-14">14 Dec.</date></note> If only it had <hi rend="italic">sleeves!</hi> I knew of no shop where they were to be bought of plain silk to match the waistcoat! so I decided to buy a piece of silk and set Maria to make them. But then the buying of the silk was an enterprise beyond my poor strength. I have been out in a Fly. And drove straight to&#x2014;of all places in the world&#x2014;Madame Elise&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Madame Elise, milliner, 170 Regent St., the commercial name of Elizabeth Marie Louise Delepine (d. <date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>); see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600104-TC-JN-01"><sic>36:36</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1860-01-04">4 Jan. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;!!! but a black morning gown was <hi rend="italic">essential</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">indispensable</hi> for the visit I hope to make at the Grange as soon as I am up to the journey. and to order it from Elise, leaving the whole details to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> was the least worrying and least fatiguing way I could devise of getting it. So I drove there and said; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> for Mercy&#x2019;s sake make me a black morning gown by new year&#x2019;s day.&#x201C; and Elise answered &#x201C;Oh my God! If this lasts many more days, I shall die!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;But I am going to the Grange!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well then I suppose you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have it?&#x201C; And I drove away&#x2014;with the waistcoat in my reticule to match! But the idea of entering a haberdasher&#x2019;s shop was perfectly awful, and indeed impossible for me! So how <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that silk to be got I asked myself&#x2014;and behold the answer by post this morning!! Thank you most cordially. Such pretty sleeves they are too!</p>
<p>Mary&#x2019;s little headgear was also admired, and rejoiced over! and her little scrap of writing found rather touching! Please tell her I have certainly a good deal of the <hi rend="italic">Father of the Prodigal Son</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Luke 15:20&#x2013;24.</note> in my nature! For I should have been tempted had she hove in sight, to run and fall on her neck, and kiss her, first, and box her ears after!</p>
<p>But Oh I must not write any more to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>! Like Elise I may say &#x201C;If this goes on many more days I shall die&#x201C;!</p>
<p>God bless you all</p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>I should like to put my arms round your neck and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">give you a kiss for it</hi>&#x201C; (as the children say; in the fond idea, poor things, that their kisses are recompense for everything and anything!&#x2014; And perhaps <hi rend="italic">their</hi> kisses are; when bestowed on&#x2014;the Fathers and Mothers of them!&#x2014; Anyhow I should like to give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a good kiss! and would trust, in Providence, and long experience of your goodwill, for your taking it and returning it with the old heartiness!</p>
<p>Yes! My dear! I could give you the warmest of <hi rend="italic">kisses</hi> still; but I cannot write you much of a <hi rend="italic">letter!</hi> and if it werent that the safe arrival of a present should always be notified by return of post; that the kind sender may not be left with misgivings as to its fate; I should put off writing a little while; till I had gained &#x201C;more power to my elbow,&#x201C; and shaken off the languor and dullness produced by eight weeks confinement to the house, and a good deal of suffering, and the &#x2018;calming&#x2019; medecines given me, which have &#x2018;calmed&#x2019; me down to something in the nature of a dead fish!</p>
<p>For the rest; except that I was ill, and would much rather have been well; these eight weeks have passed rather peaceably, for myself and others&#x2014; I was never as well attended to in illness since I lost my Mother; nor did the House ever go on as comfortably in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> illness since I knew it&#x2014;as just on this last occasion. I have got two such good clever Maids&#x2014; A Welch cook (age 20&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">Roman Catholic!</hi>) &#x26; a Hampshire Housemaid (age 18 and <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodist!</hi>)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Sullivan was from Limerick and Maria Chamberlayne&#x2019;s mother worked at The Grange, Hampshire.</note> I haven&#x2019;t had a thing to find fault with while I have been laid up&#x2014; Nor M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C either which is still more extraordinary! And I have had very much to congratulate myself, and thank God for&#x2014;in their kind attentions&#x2014;so seldom to be met with from servants at the present day! My young Methodist especially, with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> warm heart, her unobtrusive piety, her clear, open mind and pleasant manners is a comfort to live beside! She brings M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Book he wants from the Library!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">in any</hi> language! and <hi rend="italic">valets</hi> him to perfection! and does all his complicated &#x201C;little <hi rend="italic">jobs</hi> of <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;with an intelligence that often strikes me as superhuman! I could tell you many amusing things of these girls&#x2014; But I so soon get tired with writing&#x2014;or reading&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> any <pb id="pg-38-30" n="38:30"/>earthly thing.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Mr Howe&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Howe (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13959"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist and politician, premier of Nova Scotia <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>. Howe was in London as part of a delegation from the British North American colonies asking the British government to give financial aid toward an intercolonial railroad (see J. Murray Beck, <hi rend="italic">Joseph Howe,</hi> 2 vols. [Kingston and Montreal, <date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>] 2:153&#x2013;57).</note> Card seems to be irrecoverably lost; and I am sorry therefore to answer that I do not know his address.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parkes later recalled that he and TC &#x201C;had some fresh conversation about Mr. Howe, which awoke in me a desire to make his acquaintance. Accordingly I wrote to Mr. Carlyle a few days after, asking if he could give me Mr. Howe&#x2019;s address&#x201C; (Parkes 1:162).</note> He merely sent up his Card; was rejected (as many have to be at this door), his name suggesting no notion or suspicion of who he was,&#x2014;not for two or three days after, when I heard that the Nova-Scotia Mr Howe was in this country. He has not called again; nor did I yet find time to make a counter-attempt on him. The Card, I can remember, had &#x201C;St James&#x2019;s&#x201C; on it,&#x2014;&#x201C;Street,&#x201C; &#x201C;Place,&#x201C; &#x201C;or Square,&#x201C; uncertain to me;&#x2014;and I have a dim persuasion that the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> was &#x201C;3.&#x201C; This is all I can say. Of course, you will have no difficulty to make out the actual Address when you return; it is only enquiring of the Postman in that locality,&#x2014;or at the utmost, investigating a little in the haunts of Colonial people:&#x2014;I should be well pleased if you found him; and (among other more important matters) were so kind as explain to him the above mistake of mine on that head. In former visits of his,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They had met in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>, when Howe visited Britain promoting emigration to Nova Scotia (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510202-TC-AH-01"><sic>26:33</sic><corr>TC to AH, <date when="1851-02-02">2 Feb. 1851</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>35</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-02-20">20 Feb. 1851</date></corr></ref>), and in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550626-TC-WAN-01"><sic>29:340</sic><corr>TC to WAN, <date when="1855-06-26">26 June 1855</date></corr></ref>).</note> I found him an intelligent, energetic sagacious man; very well worth talking to,&#x2014;of course, especially if you had business in his department of activity.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-31" n="38:31"/>I have no recollection what I said to you about colonisation that ev<hi rend="italic">g.</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18611002-TC-HP-01"><sic>37:241</sic><corr>TC to HP, <date when="1861-10-02">2 Oct. 1861</date></corr></ref>.</note> The subject used to be of earnest almost of painful interest to me in old years;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See, e.g., <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430516-TC-JSBU-01"><sic>16:167&#x2013;68</sic><corr>TC to JSBU, <date when="1843-05-16">16 May 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> it seemed to me there had no Nation ever had such glorious opportunities of changing its nearly intolerable curses and choking <hi rend="italic">nightmares</hi> into blessings and winged angels, as Great Britain in our day, by <hi rend="italic">Colonising;</hi> or was so scandalously throwing said opportunity away. I have since learned that G<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Britain will go on with her Parliamentary Palaver, her &#x26;c &#x26;c, were the Day of Judgement close at hand; and turn a totally deaf ear to all considerations of that or the like kind;&#x2014;and so I have dropped the speculation long ago, and it lies quite dead in me for years and decades past. And to tell you the truth, I am afraid my notions w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be of little or no use to you; and indeed are not executable, except on the hypothesis that we had something of a <hi rend="italic">King</hi> among us again, and that the reign of Parliamentary Jargon and Penny-Newspapering had a good deal terminated again,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to say in other words, That the current opinions of English and other men had (with the current <hi rend="italic">practices</hi>) <hi rend="italic">immensely changed</hi> for the better! Better to &#x201C;drop&#x201C; a subject of that kind, if one have practically any use to turn one&#x2019;s own poor span of life to! In a word, according to the <hi rend="italic">Anarchic System</hi> Colonisat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> seems to me to be going on quite as well as one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> expect; and <hi rend="italic">Anarchy</hi> (under fine names) being the established faith for the time being, there is nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>I was never in my life so busy; but if you came (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 8, some lucky ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> try to give you an hour again.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your Note came to me last night, long after Post-time. You are very kind; and I am very sorry! Alas, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have come gladly ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this time last week (tho&#x2019; my wife who has <hi rend="italic">relapsed</hi> &#x26;c since that magnanimous announcement of hers,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had presumably written recently to Lady Ashburton, saying that they would visit The Grange.</note> and is still too weak tho better again, could not):&#x2014;but now I am got into a New <hi rend="italic">Chapter</hi> (new section<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a new chapter in bk. 16 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> &#x201C;The Ten Years of Peace. <date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>&#x2013;<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>,&#x201C; which TC had begun by early <date when="1861-12-00">Dec. 1861</date>; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18611201-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-12-01">1 Dec. 1861</date></ref>.</note> of this unspeakable Quagmire of mine); and am good for nothing but weltering, or choking, eye-deep in <hi rend="italic">mud;</hi> and can think of nothing but of getting out again, alive if I can!

If I live thro&#x2019; summer, I shall be out altogether;&#x2014;and then!&#x2014; Weeks on weeks of The Grange, this is one of my earliest hopes!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Mrs. Gilchrist</hi>:</salute> Are we still to go on not seeing each other,&#x2014;you in sorrow, I in sickness; with just a partition between us,&#x2014;of no comfort to each other at all?</p>
<p>For more than three months now, I have been ill and confined to the house&#x2014; Three times I have seemed to be recovering, and made an attempt at getting about; but after one drive in a Fly, there was always a relapse; and since New Year&#x2019;s Day I have had the worst bout of all!</p>
<p>The visit to the Grange which has lain so long a-head of me, and to which I looked for some freshening-up, is finally thrown over altogether as far as I am concerned. Mr. Carlyle will go on Monday by himself for two or three days.</p>
<p>Since the mild weather came, I have been so much better, however, that I <pb id="pg-38-39" n="38:39"/>am again projecting a drive; being heartily sick of my two rooms. But for the rain I should have tried it to-day.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Will</hi> you come here? or must I wait till I can <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to you? that is till it is quite dry; for I should be foolish to expose myself to the damp, after such long shutting up.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have seen Mr Froude and he is ready to see you, in <hi rend="italic">re</hi> Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine. He is going out of Town, on Tuesday next, for ten days; I therefore judged it better to secure you a possibility before that; and said that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> (in all probability) call at his House, &#x201C;Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (tomorrow) between 9 and 11 <hi rend="italic">p.</hi>m.&#x201C; He lives, &#x201C;6.

You pronounce his name <hi rend="italic">Frood</hi> (in spite of the spelling). He is well disposed to listen to practicable proposals from you; and is a man of clearness punctuality and a great deal of <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>iness sense.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Downes&#x2019;s most recent periodical article was &#x201C;Edmund Burke: His Life and Genius,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">North British Review</hi> 35 (<date when="1861-11-00">Nov. 1861</date>): 445&#x2013;79.

<p>I am puzzled to understand why you send me back these miserable debts without a word of answer to my Saturday&#x2019;s note about seeing you. I must take for granted from your silence that you would still rather be left alone&#x2014;at least so far as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am concerned.</p>

Alas, and you won&#x2019;t get out today either: a dirty dropping day, as yesterday also proved tho&#x2019; it did in the middle part brighten up into an hour of sunshine, as today has refused to do. I will hope for a better <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> to the poor little soul, at any rate.&#x2014; I did not write yesterday, partly because I had no time left on getting home; partly too because I had little but <hi rend="italic">croakery</hi> and ill omens to send.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came this morn<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> a Piece I was very glad to read. I meant to write a word at any rate; so here goes with the better will.</p>
<p>The journey on Monday proved altogether comfortable for a journey; day fine, carriage nearly all to myself, nothing at all going wrong; and a safe arrival well before dark. In the same train were Duke and Duchess, and in the same Carriage <hi rend="italic">latterly</hi> were Kingsley &#x26; Missus,&#x2014;portions of the Party that had been appointed hither; there were some 7 or 8 others; Bishop of Oxford (<hi rend="italic">Soapy</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilberforce&#x2019;s nickname was &#x201C;Soapy Sam.&#x201C;</note> as ever, and ingenious as ever), Rich<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Milnes, Venables &#x26;c: the pink of them have gone today, &#x201C;to attend Cabinet Council&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The duke of Argyll was a member of the cabinet; the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1862-02-01">1 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Cabinet Council was held yesterday [<date when="1862-01-31">31 Jan.</date>] at the official residence of the First Lord of the Treasury in Downing-street.&#x201C;</note> but Bear Ellice, Milnes &#x26;c remain, and more it seems are &#x201C;expected,&#x201C;&#x2014;not at all by my voting. We have been really rather pleasant with one another for these 3 days,&#x2014;The two Graces of Argyle are really amiable and rational bits of Humanity; very affable in a simple innocent way. Our weather has been damp and dropping; beautiful &#x26; temperate when the Sun gets out: I have made out an abundant canter over the downs &#x26; dales and hills each day; and that is pretty <pb id="pg-38-45" n="38:45"/>much all my conquest here. In <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> I very far from shine; have a constant headache too (owing to the hours &#x26; diet); otherwise I feel really well. I shall make out to Saturday,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote on Thurs.</note> as I trust &#x26; calculate; and then move home to my affairs again.&#x2014; I will write to you soon after getting to my loom again; at once if there is anything to report. Jane does not send a very good acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of herself; nothing at all, this day;&#x2014;and I fear will never yet have got out, owing to the damp weather. Nothing considerable talked of here, but the Yankee War,&#x2014;quite in the <hi rend="italic">indiff</hi>t tone henceforth, Duke &#x26; Duchess, who were enthusiasts for &#x201C;Freedom to the Slave,&#x201C; having made exit. No war ever waging in my time was to me more profoundly foolish-looking: neutral I am to a degree, I for one!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish Jamie c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get that Farm if it be worth the money.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their nephew James Carlyle Jr. was looking at farms to rent, and had been to see Breckonside Farm, nr. Moffat. John A. Carlyle wrote to James, <date when="1862-01-15">15 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I am glad to hear that your father &#x26; you were pleased with the look of Breckonside. If it could be got at a reasonable rent, your occupation there might be as genial as any thing one has a right to expect for you&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). For John&#x2019;s comment to James Jr. about his letter on the Moffat farm to &#x201C;Mr Stewart,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620217-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1862-02-17">17 Feb.</date></ref></note> Mauritius w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been far suitabler; but it cannot be had.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had also been speaking to his friend James Currie, a merchant in Mauritius (then a British colony), about the possibility of work for James there. In his letter, <date when="1862-01-15">15 Jan.</date>, he also wrote: &#x201C;Apparently he [Currie] has made money enough there by sore work during nineteen years, but has also injured his health&#x2014;for which no amount of money can be a compensation. And he is now under the necessity of going out again, &#x26; exposing himself to fresh dangers in the hot climate. I do not remember what he said in talking of Mauritius Law &#x26; Lawyers; but I noticed nothing in it that could have any relation to you, though I saw you setting all your hair on end with alternate right &#x26; left hands at the time it took place&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> <closer><salute>Adieu dear B<hi rend="italic">r.</hi></salute></closer> <name>T.

According to the Hansons, JWC was upset that Mantell had not replied to one of her letters and became angry when she found out that Jewsbury had been begging him to write to her (Hansons, <hi rend="italic">NE</hi> 498). Jewsbury had certainly asked Mantell to write to JWC, but it was a year earlier, in <date when="1861-01-00">Jan. 1861</date> (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610222-JWC-WMAN-01"><sic>37:120</sic><corr>JWC to WMAN, <date when="1861-02-22">22 Feb. 1861</date></corr></ref>); JWC&#x2019;s last known letter to Mantell was <date when="1861-10-19">19 Oct. 1861</date> (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18611019-JWC-WMAN-01"><sic>37:250&#x2013;51</sic><corr>JWC to WMAN, <date when="1861-10-19">19 Oct. 1861</date></corr></ref>).

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>I have been here since Monday: I am afraid my poor Wife has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been able to call at your door on my behoof,&#x2014;the news from her yesterday, and today there was none at all. She was to return your Polish Book;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> explain how I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not call on Sunday last to take leave; and send me some word how you were. Word I have had none; but I hope there has been no falling off since I last saw you;&#x2014;in two days from this, I hope to call once more, and see with my own eyes. I <hi rend="italic">return</hi> tomorrow.</p>
<p>We have been rather a numerous Party here, and still rather are so tho&#x2019; with changes. Duke &#x26; Duchess of Argyle, Bishop of Oxford, Alick Baring &#x26;c are gone.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gilchrist</salute>
<p>Mr Larkin, whom you have seen here, came to night to ask if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were returned home. He is looking for a house,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Larkin wrote later: &#x201C;In <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date> I married; and, mainly at Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s instigation, took the house, No. 6, next door &#x2026; which was then falling vacant&#x201C; (Larkin, <hi rend="italic">BQR</hi> 75).</note> and, seeing a ticket in your window, he thought, if it was somewhere about the same rent as ours, that this house you are leaving (to my infinite regret) would suit him better than any he had yet looked at.</p>
<p>But he felt a delicacy about asking any questions, or asking to see the house if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were in it.</p>
<p>I told him that if you had advertised the house <hi rend="italic">to be let,</hi> you had of course made up your mind to its being viewed; and that the business could be transacted with your servant, without <hi rend="italic">your</hi> having to trouble yourself with him. But as he still seemed perplexed what to do, I told him I would warn you of his intention to call tomorrow afternoon; that the disagreeable visit might not take you by surprise and that you might give what instructions you liked to Ann before hand.</p>
<p>Since you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to go, I wish to Heaven you were out of all this! I know how dreadful these details must be! how little chance of calm there is for you till you have gathered yourself together in a new scene.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Gilchrist and her children moved to Shottermill, Surrey, in <date when="1862-03-00">March</date>.</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>&#x2014; Many thanks for the thrice-welcome Little Note, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has come at last. I was in great impatience about it, expecting it since Monday. I had gone to Lady Sandwich; but she knew nothing more than myself, &#x201C;that Quain<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Richard Quain.</note> had been sent for&#x201C;:&#x2014;today I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been at Lowe or somebody, had not your good news come.</p>
<p>It is now as good as certain to me that Lord A. will go on well; and visibly acquire strength from week to week and from day to day. I am convinced it was <hi rend="italic">we,</hi> and our noisy socialities, that threw him into that fit of sore throat. Of course you will do your best and utmost; be not over-assiduous, over-anxious, nor do too much. For some hours daily, his solitary self with his Books and his thoughts, will be his best society; then a drive together, looked forward to, and looked back upon, as the flower of the day:&#x2014;if you once had him able to ride on horseback again, the young woods, the spring skies and breezy downs, and the rural interests and businesses he has are wholesome occupation; above all, for the healthy mind that has the misfortune to be lodged in a body not healthy! We will look for you, in clearly improved circumstances, about Easter time, for so much of Town-life as you judge it good to venture on,&#x2014;not too much. You have never yet fairly tried a Summer of The Grange. Perhaps I exaggerate; but it seems to me there could be no healthier location in all the world. And if it were not for that defunct King of Prussia (worse luck to him!) I would myself come and try.</p>
<p>My Wife I found a great deal <hi rend="italic">better.</hi> She now gets out almost daily; takes to her household and other cares again;&#x2014;speaks of running down to Brighton for 4 days;&#x2014;and, in spite of her great weakness, looks really promising. Always keeps up her heart, poor soul; and, in the worst extremity, is wonderfully cheerful.</p>
<p>For myself I seem to have done almost nothing but <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> since my return. I suppose it is really my form of <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> in health. Never in my life have I felt wearier, <hi rend="italic">less</hi> able for despatch of work;&#x2014;and yet there is behind that, a sense that I am really somewhat better for my airing &#x26; galloping &#x26; talk with friends.&#x2014; Mill&#x2019;s American Article is a poor shrieky Piece;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Stuart Mill, &#x201C;The Contest in America,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 65 (<date when="1862-02-00">Feb. 1862</date>): 258&#x2013;68. It was written in the aftermath of the <hi rend="italic">Trent</hi> affair when Capt. Charles Wilkes (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>) of the U.S. navy seized two Confederate commissioners to Britain, James Murray Mason (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>) and John Slidell (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), from a neutral British ship, the <hi rend="italic">Trent,</hi> <date when="1861-11-08">8 Nov. 1861</date>. Seen as an insult to the British flag, this aroused widespread fury in Britain. The two men were released after prolonged diplomatic negotiations, late <date when="1861-12-00">Dec. 1861</date>, and allowed to continue on their journey. Mill praised the U.S. government&#x2019;s decision: &#x201C;Mr. Lincoln&#x2019;s Government have &#x2026; said, in direct terms, that our demand was right; that they yielded to it because it was just&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 65:260). He wrote: &#x201C;[W]e ought to dismiss from our minds as far as possible, those feelings against the North, which have been engendered not merely by the <hi rend="italic">Trent</hi> aggression, but by the previous anti-British effusions of [U.S.] newspaper writers and stump orators&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 65:259). The article also contained a passionate attack on slavery and the opinion that, although the Republican Party was not at the time an abolitionist party, it was likely that if the war went on for long it would become abolitionist: &#x201C;Those who have read, even cursorily, the most valuable testimony to which the English public have access concerning the real state of affairs in America&#x2014;the letters of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent, Mr. Russell&#x2014;must have observed how early and rapidly he arrived at the same conclusion, and with what increasing emphasis he now continually reiterates it&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 65:263).

<p><salute>Dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;Here (2 p.m.) has your Note come, the second I have had since my return.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>My motive in this present writing is purely selfish. I have nothing to tell that feels to need to be told. But I want to hear about <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> and to obtain that gratification I must write and ask for it. I have no pleasant visit to tell of. nor <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> anything  I have never left home! and only some half dozen times have been out of doors since you last heard from me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the missing letter <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620101-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1862-01-01">1 Jan.</date></ref></note> In the first week of the new year (which began I must say with the most fortunate omens!&#x2014; So much for <hi rend="italic">omens!</hi>) I had a relapse of my illness, more severe than what had gone before, and more aggravating; because a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> care, and composure, and common sense might have prevented it!</p>
<p>On newyearsday I let my House maid go for a Holyday&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Mistake the first!</hi> for the girl had been <hi rend="italic">coughing</hi> furiously for a week or two. But I had refused to let her attend &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a midnight Religious Meeting</hi>&#x201C; the previous night. and I had not strength of mind to say another &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">no</hi>&#x2019;; tho I knew it would be best for herself. She came home much excited and pleased but complained that her &#x201C;legs had never warmed all day&#x201C;&#x2014; Next day she dragged about with &#x201C;a headache,&#x201C; and the next again when she brought me my breakfast in bed She said she was &#x201C;so giddy she thought she must fall.&#x201C; I ordered her to bed at once and when I had got my clothes on went to see her. She was sleeping heavily&#x2014;again and again I found her sleeping&#x2014;and grew frightened at such heavy sleep. At last she awoke as I was standing looking at her, sat up in bed with wild, gleaming eyes, and for the rest; was&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">mad</hi> my Dear, as a <date when="0000-03-00">March</date> Hare! chattering incoherent nonsense amidst laughter and sobbs! She must have got a fever I thought, and the same fatal fever that had raged at next door and been fatal to the Master!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Gilchrist.</note> <hi rend="italic">Mistake the second!</hi> without knowing the symptoms of scarletfever I was a fool to settle upon <hi rend="italic">that.</hi></p>
<p>I sent for my Doctor: but he was out and did not come for <hi rend="italic">four hours!</hi>&#x2014;and these four hours I devoted to picturing out the other girl <hi rend="italic">and M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> laid down thro&#x2019; infection&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C of course <hi rend="italic">killed like M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Gilchrist!!</hi> Meanwhile I kept running backwards &#x26; forwards after Maria, keeping my terrors locked in my own breast, and neglecting the necessary precautions to be taken against M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">draughts</hi> in the stair-case, viz wearing a shawl and bonnet!! <hi rend="italic">Mistake the third!</hi>&#x2014;and so by the time M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes came and told me <pb id="pg-38-56" n="38:56"/>it was a case of &#x201C;Severe inflamatory cold complicated with Hysteria&#x201C; and that the Girl would probably be all right in a a<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Repeated at turn of page.</note> few days; I had realized for <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> thro&#x2019; the unusal fatigue and exposure; and above all the fright, <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a new Influenza as confined me to bed in perfect wretchedness for ten days, and to the house for weeks!&#x2014; I am only <hi rend="italic">now</hi> beginning to drive out on favourable days. The Girl was confined to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> bed for a week. And the poor little Roman Catholic Welsh woman<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret was Irish; JWC often referred to her as Welsh. Jewsbury wrote to Mantell, <date when="1862-02-25">25 Feb.</date>, that she could not give his servant, Ellen Sullivan, Margaret&#x2019;s sister, any news: &#x201C;Margaret (tell Ellen) I have not seen as of course I cannot go to Mrs Carlyle when she shews so unmistakenly that she does not want me&#x201C; (Mantell).</note> with a horrid cold of her own had us both to wait upon, besides M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, who, like most <hi rend="italic">men,</hi> has no notion that <hi rend="italic">any</hi> discription of household crisis should interfere in any one particular with the details of service he is accustomed to. Now if I had just kept myself quiet and rational, what a difference it would have made!</p>
<p>I persuaded M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C some three weeks ago to go and <hi rend="italic">get done</hi> with that long talked of visit<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To The Grange, <date when="1862-01-27">27 Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-02-01">1 Feb.</date></note> by himself&#x2014;and relieve <hi rend="italic">me</hi> of the fret of being required to get well, <hi rend="italic">sooner than I could!</hi> So he went and actually staid <hi rend="italic">a week,</hi> and I think was much the better for it.</p>
<p>Maria (the Housemaid) has quite recovered&#x2014;except that to my <hi rend="italic">imagination</hi> perhaps&#x2014;there is <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> weak-mindedness about her&#x2014;a sort of numbness of her natural intelligence, and clipping affectation in the tones of her voice! If I could give over <hi rend="italic">watching</hi> her! But when one has so little communication with the outer-world above all with the outer <hi rend="italic">air</hi> it is difficult to avoid occupying oneself morbidly with the affairs within doors.</p>
<p>The last day I was out, I went to see <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of my most intimate friends here who are both, I fear, <hi rend="italic">dying</hi> the one a beautiful bright little M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Twisleton,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Twisleton.</note> who, after having been treated for two years by all the first Doctors for Neuralgia, is discovered to have a far advanced <hi rend="italic">tumour</hi> in her left side!

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>My &#x201C;work&#x201C; (sorrow on it), at this point is such a struggle among dancing atoms, that it has been going on even with unusual confusions, slowness and difficulty: otherwise I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have been silent to you so long. I heard indeed, and I suppose you hear, thro&#x2019; the Dr (who has a peculiar tendency to stuff old Letters into his cover, by way of saving trouble to his own pen):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1862-02-20">20 Feb.</date>, to James Carlyle Jr. an apparent confirmation of TC&#x2019;s comment: &#x201C;I will send the last two leaves of your letter by this day&#x2019;s post to your uncle in order to correct his impressions of you, which I know were similar to mine stated above. I have not told him anything about your illness, so I keep back the first leaf of your letter.&#x201C; Although John may have been writing less to TC, he was corresponding frequently with James Jr., often with detailed advice; e.g., he wrote, <date when="1862-02-22">22 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I remind you of the necessity of taking only the quantity of Pills that will produce <hi rend="italic">one painless &#x26; complete evacuation,</hi> when required; &#x26; that quantity is ascertainable only by repeated trials. Too large doses might help to bring on again what you felt last Sunday, just as any undue stagnation in the bowels would tend to do. Regularity is the thing to be aimed at. I don&#x2019;t think you have any actual disease of the heart; &#x26;, by taking good care of yourself for a month or two, I hope you might get quite free again. &#x2F; Your letter of <date when="1861-03-00">March</date> last I have entirely forgotten, as well as the conversation in <date when="1861-04-00">April</date>; but I have no doubt your recollection of them is quite correct. It is really useless to return to the subject. Your magniloquent beginning, &#x2018;I need not again attempt to lay the ghost of swaggering &#x26; pretension, who seems to be a periodical visitor,&#x2019; is itself what I should call a specimen of loose swaggering. When one has to treat of serious matters, it is much better to write in a simple &#x26; clear style &#x26; avoid all attempts at irrelevant smartness. I also thought the sketch you sent me from Moffat of the offer you intended to make to Mr Stewart was written in an inflated style, with many repetitions of <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> wrongly used&#x2014;neither Scotch nor English; &#x26; last autumn my wavering in regard to the farm in Lewis [see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610924-TC-JAC-01"><sic>37:237&#x2013;38</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1861-09-24">24 Sept. 1861</date></corr></ref>] was mainly caused by the headlong style in which you wrote to me at the time. In this world it is much easier to fail than to succeed. I do believe you would succeed in anything you had made yourself fully master of; for you have many sterling good qualities &#x26; would be sufficiently zealous &#x26; industrious &#x26; prudent, if you had a fair chance. Let this suffice; &#x26; let us wholly devote ourselves to trying whether any such chance can be found for you. &#x2F; <hi rend="italic">24th</hi> &#x2F; I did not get this written till after post-time on saturday, &#x26; also missed the post of yesterday. At present I am very busy with one thing and another, &#x26; have little time for letters. I don&#x2019;t keep yours, &#x26; therefore cannot refer to any of them. In that phrase of your last, quoted above, the swaggering consists in your presuming to take it for granted that I have come to this time of life without knowing what ghosts are at least as well as you; but I feel quite sure you were quite unconscious of any tendency to swaggering at the time you wrote it, &#x26; only meant to say something very smart&#x201C; (MSS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> but it is always better if one get a word now &#x26; then from the fountain head.</p>

He has a nice clean little sitting room, is in the finest neighbour hood for Hills and airy Country walks; and yesterday I saw, for the first time, his old Landlady, who is an uncommonly nice-looking simple old body.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken had recently moved; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18611231-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1861-12-31">31 Dec. 1861</date></ref>; his landlady not further identified.</note> James I believe I may define to you as <hi rend="italic">doing well</hi> in all respects.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear what a horrid thing!</salute> It still makes my flesh creep all over, whenever I think of it!&#x2014;and I think of it&#x2014;a great deal oftener than there is <pb id="pg-38-64" n="38:64"/>occasion for! since, thank God, he is now on foot again! But&#x2014;I have <hi rend="small-caps">seen</hi> <hi rend="italic">that Safe!</hi> I can appreciate to the full, the crash of <hi rend="italic">it&#x2019;s</hi> lid, smack down on human fingers!&#x2014; Mercy! what a piece of capital good stuff <hi rend="italic">the</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> must have been made of originally, that his fingers should have stuck together thro&#x2019; such an accident instead of being all pounded into <hi rend="italic">mush! That</hi> is not what surprises me most however, in the business! What surprises me most is, that the D<hi rend="italic">r, being a D</hi>r, and a good, skilful one, should have gone about after, braving such a hurt, as tho&#x2019; he had never in his life heard of lockedjaw, or gangrene, or fever! I dont wonder that you were terrified! I wonder rather that you are not, now when your nursing is no more, needed, in a brain fever yourself! The longer I live, the more I am certified that <hi rend="italic">men,</hi> in all that relates to their own health, have not common sense! whether it be their Pride, or their Impatience, or their Obstinacy or their ingrained Spirit of Contradiction that stultifies and misleads them&#x2014;the result is always a certain amount of idiocy or distraction, in their dealings with their own bodies! I am not generalizing from my own Husband. I know that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is a quite extravagant example of that want of common sense in bodily matters, which I complain of. Few <hi rend="italic">men</hi> (even) are so lost to themselves as to dry their soaked trowsers on their legs! (as he does) or swallow five grains of mercury <hi rend="italic">in the middle of the day,</hi> and then walk or ride three hours under a plunge of rain! (as he does) &#x26;c &#x26;c But <hi rend="italic">men</hi> generally&#x2014;all of them I have ever had to do with&#x2014;even <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sensible Husband included you see!&#x2014;drive the poor women who care for them to despair; either by their wild impatience of bodily suffering, and the exaggerated moan they make over it, or else by their reckless defiance of it, and neglect of every dictate of Prudence! There! you may tell the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> what I say! It wont do him the slightest good against <hi rend="italic">next time;</hi> but it is well he should know what one thinks of him! that one does not approve of such costly heroism at all!</p>
<p>I have nothing new to tell you. Which is lucky. As the things that have <hi rend="italic">happened,</hi> this long time back, have been of a disastrous sort.</p>
<p>I go out now occasionally for a drive&#x2014;walking tires me too much&#x2014; I have even been twice out at dinner last week! and was at a <hi rend="italic">Wedding</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The wedding of Isabella Barnes and John Simmonds.</note> besides!!! The two dinners were of the quietest; at the one (Miss Baring&#x2019;s) nobody but Lord Ashburton who had come up from the Grange for a consultation&#x2014;at the other (Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s) nobody but the Marchioness of Lothian,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Cecil Chetwynd Kerr, dowager marchioness of Lothian.</note> who having lived thirty years in Scotland is as good as a Scotch woman.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Kerr was born in Staffordshire but after her marriage, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, lived at Newbattle Abbey, Midlothian, about 9 mi. (14.5 km.) SE of Edinburgh, and at Monteviot, Roxburghshire, about 45 mi. (73 km.) SE of Edinburgh.</note> But the wedding was an immense affair! It was my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2019;s little Daughter who was being <pb id="pg-38-65" n="38:65"/>married after a three years engagement, and as soon as she was engaged she had made me promise to attend her wedding. I had rather wished to see a Marriage <hi rend="italic">performed</hi> in a <hi rend="italic">Church</hi> with all the forms&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> bridesmaids &#x26;c &#x26;c<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Weddings in Scotland were generally much simpler, often taking place in the bride&#x2019;s home. The Carlyles&#x2019; own wedding was at Templand, home of JWC&#x2019;s maternal grandfather, Walter Welsh; the only guests were JWC&#x2019;s mother, Grace Welsh, her grandfather, her Aunt Jeannie, and TC&#x2019;s brother John. JWC wrote to her aunt Margaret Welsh, <date when="1826-10-1">1 Oct. 1826</date>: &#x201C;I would invite you to my wedding if I meant to invite anyone; but, to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> taste, such ceremonies cannot be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> private: besides by making <hi rend="italic">distinction,</hi> among my relatives on the occasion, I should be sure to give offence&#x201C; (4:141); for the arrangements, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261003-JBW-TC-01"><sic>4:147</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1826-10-03">3 Oct. 1826</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261009-TC-JBW-01"><sic>150&#x2013;51</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-10-09">9 Oct. 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But I had renounced all idea of going <hi rend="italic">to the church</hi>&#x2014;for fear of being laid up with a fresh cold, and meant to attend only the breakfast party after&#x2014;in which I took less interest. But imagine how good the people here are to me. Our Rector<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gerald Blunt.</note> in whose church (St Luke&#x2019;s) the marriage was to take place, being told by his wife,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Blunt.</note> I wished to go, but <hi rend="italic">durstn&#x2019;t</hi> for fear of the coldness of the Church, ordered the fires to be kept up from Sunday over into Tuesday morning!! besides a rousing fire in the Vestry where I sat at my ease till the moment the ceremony began&#x2014; I was much pressed afterwards to acknowledge how superior the English way of marrying was to the Scotch and asked how I had liked it. I said my feelings were very mixed&#x2014;&#x2018;<hi rend="italic">mixed?</hi>&#x2019; the Rector asked&#x2014;&#x201C;mixed of what? Well I said, &#x201C;it looked to me something betwixt a <hi rend="italic">Religious Ceremony</hi> and a&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Pantomime!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; So it is!&#x2014; There were 44 people at the breakfast!</p>
<p>Countess Pepoli has rallied quite wonderfully. I forced myself to pay her another visit last week&#x2014;and was rewarded by finding her less ungenial and aggravating. Erasmus Wilson<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William James Erasmus Wilson (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29702"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician, surgeon, and dermatologist.</note> told her Servants she could not possible recover&#x2014;a good many weeks ago&#x2014;but London <hi rend="italic">Great</hi> Doctors make the wonderfullest blunders!&#x2014; Poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Twisleton is suffering less for the time being</p>

He seems to hope for a visit from you this summer, after Frederic is fairly out of hand, in which case, I may have a chance of a sight of you in passing. He is somewhat annoyed by some of the unfavorable accompaniments of age, but yet seems to have the capacity of enjoying life little impaired, as his kindly affections are in full strength &#x26; exercise. &#x2026; We, domestically, are much in statu quo&#x2014;making allowance for advancing years, which as yet press lightly on us&#x2014;and we all desire to send our most kindly salutations to you &#x26; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle who I hope is well.&#x201C; Erskine and his sisters Christian Stirling and David Paterson spent winters in Edinburgh.

Yes! I am certain I could have recognised William Dods&#x2019;s handwriting <hi rend="italic">however</hi> it might have taken me by surprise!&#x2014;suppose it had fluttered down on my head from a Balloon(!)

<p>Neither was it Jackie Welsh who had written the direction. For, curiously enough <hi rend="italic">she</hi> writes our <hi rend="italic">family</hi>-hand; only with <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> crampedness from want of practice! Yes! it is a fact worth notice for both Physiologists and Moralists, that Jackie is admirably <hi rend="italic">Legitimate</hi> in her <hi rend="italic">handwriting!</hi></p>
<p>So the doubt is between <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> whose handwriting I have not been favoured with a sight of often enough (the more&#x2019;s the pity!) for recognising it infallibly without the corroborative evidence of a signature; and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Davidson who writes, I recollect (just that and no more), a wonderfully good and modern hand, for her years.</p>
<p>If it was <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> then, dear woman, who sent the good words; accept my warm thanks and a good kiss! If it was M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Davidson, do, please, write and tell me, that I may send her grateful words for her <hi rend="italic">good</hi> ones!</p>
<p>For the rest; I had ten days in bed after my last note to you; and more weeks on the sofa; and had to give up my usual winter visit in Hampshire.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both Carlyles had been invited to The Grange, but JWC was too ill; TC went alone, <date when="1861-01-27">27 Jan</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-02-01">1 Feb.</date></note> All along of my Housemaid&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hysterical Tendencies,&#x201C; and my own &#x201C;Excitability&#x201C;; which between them caused me more fatigue, and exposure, and fright, than I had strength to bear.

<salute>Dear Mrs Clough</salute>
<p>I had, the year before your marriage,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Cloughs had m. in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>.</note> three or perhaps four little Notes or Letters<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blanche Clough wrote to TC, <date when="1862-03-06">6 March</date>: &#x201C;I saw M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Froude a few days ago, who told me that you had still in your possession some letters from my husband, which he thought you would be willing to send me. I need not say how interesting they would be to me, if you do not object to letting me have them, &#x26; I am not giving you too much trouble.&#x201C;</note> (intended to give me a <hi rend="italic">business</hi> view of matters there,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough wrote to TC when he visited New England, <date when="1852-10-00">Oct. 1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-07-00">July 1853</date>.</note> but running out into pleasant snatches of general description now and then); wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I remember liking very much for their frankness, vivacity, fidelity, and very graphic power of setting both writer &#x26; subject before one.

But, alas, I consider it doubtful (in spite of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> powers of search); and, in these months, am so hurried ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> early &#x26; late, that I can myself do nothing effectual to assist.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently JWC did not find them, as none of Clough&#x2019;s letters to TC were included in the vols. of Clough&#x2019;s letters pbd. by Blanche Clough in the <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>s.

<p>Nobody can better sympathiz[e] with Lady Stanley<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Airlie&#x2019;s mother, Lady Henrietta Maria Stanley.</note> than I, who lost, as suddenly, an adorable Mother,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Grace Welsh, d. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note> and who have never had any joy in life since!.</p>
<p>And in all <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sorrows, Darling, I must ever take part; loving you as I do! and have done since you were a child, and wrote me a little half-text note about my cardcase! Do you remember?</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your Letter; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a kind bit of charity to me. You are just and good in excusing my defects and delays of writing: I did <hi rend="italic">mean</hi> to write on Friday last; do often &#x201C;mean&#x201C;;&#x2014;but it is literally true I have seldom 20 available minutes at my disposal; many days not five. Be patient with me, till I <hi rend="italic">get thro;</hi>&#x2014;by Heaven&#x2019;s favour I do still count on getting thro&#x2019;, before this Year end! The oftener you can throw me a word of tidings, it will be the better, and always a gleam of cheer to me.</p>
<p>My poor Book is going on rather better, and affairs generally are,&#x2014;surely not worse,&#x2014;since I last wrote. The Chapmans urging, I have consented to let Vol iii come out by itself; better, in many ways, they argue,&#x2014;especially now when I have discerned and been obliged to decide that &#x201C;Vol IV&#x201C; will have to <hi rend="italic">fall in two,</hi> and become Vol<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> IV <hi rend="italic">and V!</hi> No helping of it: I have taken up a great deal of time squeezing things together as with a Bramah-Press;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hydraulic press invented by Joseph Bramah (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3236"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); for his firm Bramah &#x26; Co., see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570820-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:40</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-08-20">20 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> and find that more elbow-room is indispensable for getting on with any ease. Vol iii is itself above 100 pages too long;&#x2014;capable enough of standing on its own legs:&#x2014;and now there are to be Voll IV and V, of less bulk, but equal price; &#x201C;too big &#x26; costly a lot for selling all at once,&#x201C; urge the Chap<hi rend="italic">ns.</hi> Well, well!&#x2014; Vol IV (that now is) has advanced a good way: indeed <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is all <hi rend="italic">written,</hi> and even part of Vol V), and fully half of it printed off;&#x2014;but bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> writing and printing off, it is not to be imagined what bother upon bother intervenes!

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry to deny myself the great pleasure of waiting on you as proposed: but the sad fact is, no going out to dinner<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Though he usually refused dinner invitations, TC still welcomed visitors. The poet and journalist Charles Boner (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2839"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who lived in Munich, gave an extensive description of an evening he spent with TC and JWC in Cheyne Row: &#x201C;<date when="1862-04-00">April, 1862</date>.&#x2014; Found Carlyle sitting in dressing-gown and slippers looking over the proofs of his &#x2018;Frederic the Great.&#x2019; Mrs. Carlyle sitting on the sofa by the fire. After a while the conversation fell upon Prussia. Carlyle said the Prussians were full of intelligence and activity. There was energy and perseverance in their character&#x2014;there was much resemblance to the English. If they did not do something there was little hope for Germany. Elsewhere in Germany he could see little else than talk and noise, and wretched radicalism. &#x2026; &#x2F; Parliaments, the press, the English army, he abused royally, but in language so quaint, so droll, so unlike anything I ever heard before, that once or twice I burst out laughing, though it was evident he saw nothing humorous or out of the way in his expressions. One thing was evident, his detestation of any and everything approaching dishonesty or inconsistency. Another was his utter appreciation of conscientious work. &#x2026; &#x2F; He is full of humour, but he does not seem to know it is humour, for he goes on gravely, as though the humorous thoughts were merely strict reasoning. F[roude] told me when going home, that another time he might quite probably take the opposite side, and abuse uncontrolled authority as much as he had done constitutional government. &#x2026; &#x2F; Carlyle&#x2019;s long, wild, grey hair, hangs over his forehead. His eye is bright and lively,&#x2014;his complexion healthy and his look generally betokens a man who leads a <hi rend="italic">calm</hi> life. &#x2026; His wife told me she took in the <hi rend="italic">Daily</hi> <hi rend="italic">Telegraph,</hi> in order to know what was going on in the world. Her husband never reads the papers. He speaks slowly, and as if what he says were well weighed beforehand, as if all had been thoroughly thought over long ago. His way of stating opinions shows that there is not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to their correctness. He makes you feel, too, he has no thought of changing his views, or allowing himself to be influenced by aught another may say. His mind is made up, once and for ever. &#x2F; Nothing here written conveys any idea of his conversation, for the words he used were so strange, and the flow of his conversation so copious, that it is impossible to remember all&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Letters of Charles Boner,</hi> ed. R. M. Kettle, 2 vols. [<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>] 2:5&#x2013;12).</note> is other than extremely hurtful to me;&#x2014;nor is by law permitted me at all in these hard <hi rend="italic">Prussian</hi> times, <pb id="pg-38-79" n="38:79"/>unless in cases (once in the six months or so) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are or seem to me of the most peremptorily exceptional character.</p>

<salute>Dear Froude,</salute>
<p>Ruskin, I have got to understand, is at last beginning upon his Political Economy. I think, if you were to send him a word or two of incitat<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> you might actually get a Paper out of him for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> next N<hi rend="italic">o;</hi>&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a beautiful thing to begin the Summer with! The simplest few words will do,&#x2014;if any will.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude, as editor of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> followed TC&#x2019;s suggestion. The hostile reception to Ruskin&#x2019;s first series of critical essays on political economy when they were pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601029-TC-JRU-01"><sic>37:29&#x2013;30</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1860-10-29">29 Oct. 1860</date></corr></ref>) provoked him to explore the subject in greater depth; the essays were later pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Munera Pulveris</hi> (<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), in the preface of which Ruskin wrote: &#x201C;[A]s I had taken not a little pains with the Essays, and knew that they contained better work than most of my former writings, and more important truths than all of them put together, this violent reprobation of them by the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> public set me still more gravely thinking; and, after turning the matter hither and thither in my mind for two years more, I resolved to make it the central work of my life to write an exhaustive treatise on Political Economy. It would not have been begun, at that time, however, had not the editor of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> written to me, saying that he believed there was something in my theories, and would risk the admission of what I chose to write on this dangerous subject; whereupon, cautiously, and at intervals, during the winter <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">63</date>, I sent him, and he ventured to print, the preface of the intended work, divided into four chapters. Then, though the Editor had not wholly lost courage, the Publisher [John William Parker] indignantly interfered; and the readers of <hi rend="italic">Fraser,</hi> as those of the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill,</hi> were protected, for that time, from farther disturbance on my part&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s Works</hi> 17:143).</note></p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>It has been in my head to write to you any day these three weeks. But I have put off and put off, wating<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> for a livelier mood, which has never come, and looks no nearer; so I write now in the mood that is&#x2014;a dismal one&#x2014;rather!</p>
<p>You have probably seen in the newspapers the Death of Elizabeth Pepoli.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;At 11 St. George&#x2019;s Terrace, South Kensington, on the 7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> inst., Elizabeth, Countess Pepoli, eldest daughter of the late Walter Fergus, Esq. of Strathore&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> <date when="1862-04-12">12 April</date>).</note> <pb id="pg-38-81" n="38:81"/>To the best of my recollection, when I wrote to you last, I told you how sad it made one to go and find her always so evidently ill, and getting worse and worse; yet shutting herself up in her proud stoicism, from even <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> her friend of so many years, and, as I still felt sure, the most trusted friend she had in London. But her stoicism had to give way at last poor Dear! when she was seized with violent pain (in the bowels) and absolutely <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> get out of bed. She then wrote to me a few blotched lines, the very handwriting of which showed how far gone she was, begging me to send her <hi rend="italic">my</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Alfred Barnes.</note>&#x2014;the fine Physician from town,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whom she would only see rarely, having &#x201C;done her no good.&#x201C; I went to her immediately and my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> went&#x2014;and his first words to me when he left her room were&#x2014; &#x201C;The thing which ails this friend of yours is&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">old age!</hi> and you know whether there be any cure for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x201C;! Still he gave me hopes that she <hi rend="italic">might</hi> rally a little, <hi rend="italic">for a while.</hi> And she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> seem slightly better for the new diet and medecines. But to see her <hi rend="italic">all alone</hi> there in such a critical state was very miserable for me, She was at last persuaded to let her Sister Miss Jessy come from Italy&#x2014;any of them would have been only too glad to come long before, had she not misled them to believe her nearly well! To Pepoli she had sent no such permission not wishing him to &#x201C;leave his affairs in Bologna to wait upon <hi rend="italic">her.</hi>&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620213-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-02-13">13 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> But he was telegraphed to by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fergus from another Italian city, and started half an hour after, and travelled without rest till he arrived at her bedside which he hardly ever left for the next ten days, when she died. Certainly he <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> the most devoted of Husbands. And tho dreadfully displeased at his coming <hi rend="italic">she</hi> seemed glad enough to have him&#x2014;after a little while. Miss Fergus came two days after him. So she was surrounded as she ought to be at the last. After the Sister&#x2019;s coming I went seldomer, for a fortnight before I had been with her every day. But she did not feel my visits made superfluous by the presence of the others. The cook told my maid that &#x201C;the Countess had been crying out for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201C;! And the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> day, I saw her, tho&#x2019; her mind was wandering, she was so sweet and loving to me&#x2014;like her <hi rend="italic">old</hi> self! That was a comfort! And tho&#x2019; I am very sorrowful just now about her loss&#x2014;Such an old and true friend!&#x2014;still I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> in my heart that her living on <hi rend="italic">in infirmity</hi> was not to be wished for her&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> of all people! with a Husband still in middle age, on whom she could <hi rend="italic">never</hi> have reconciled herself to the idea of being a burden.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Pepoli was four years older than her husband.</note></p>
<p>This business made me poorly, you may conceive; and I accepted an offer made providentially just then, to be taken for three days to Hastings.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With Frederic and Clara Chapman; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620407-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-04-07">7 April</date></ref>.</note> The sea-air did me the good it always does, and I took &#x201C;penny worths of it,&#x201C; like <pb id="pg-38-82" n="38:82"/>old M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hepburn of Thornhill,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mary Hepburn (b. ca. <date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>), a widow and pauper living at 153 North Drumlanrig St., Thornhill; otherwise unidentified.</note> with better success however! The last two or three days of intense cold and East-wind have undone the benifit for the present. But this sort of thing wont last it is to be hoped</p>
<p>Wasn&#x2019;t I enchanted to get a note from your Husband&#x2014; And yet&#x2014; If I had known <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was to take the trouble of thanking me for that book,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I doubt if I should have ventured to address it to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014; I have learnt, from my own Husband, a perfectly sacred respect for the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Men!</hi></p>
<p>The two numbers of the story I sent you the other day will be followed up, to the end. And I am sure you will like it, and even the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> may read it with satisfaction&#x2014; The Author is one of the best Novelists of the day.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Oliphant; &#x201C;Chronicles of Carlingford: Salem Chapel&#x201C; appeared anon., <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine,</hi> <date when="1862-02-00">Feb. 1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-01-00">Jan. 1863</date>. It was then pbd. anon. in two vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>).</note></p>
<p>Of course I had no photographs of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. or myself, or you should have received them by return of post. Plenty of Photographers have offered to bring their apparatus to the house (!) to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. But he wont be done! <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> like every thing else with him, is postponed &#x201C;till his Book is finished.&#x201C; As for me, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> photograph has been waiting these two years! till I looked a little less haggard! But I put it to you, if at my age one is likely to <hi rend="italic">improve!</hi> by keeping&#x2014;!</p>
<p>Good night. I am feeling as if I were all made up of separate particles&#x2014;of glass! a nice state! So I will go to bed soon. Love to the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I got home from my journey, safe, yesternight at 11: the expedition had been sad, but parts of it were very beautiful and touching to me. The funeral was 18 miles inland from Huntingdon; we drove to the place and back yesterday in a five or so of Carriages; found a beautiful queer old English Village, and near it the old &#x201C;Chapel of Barnewell&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The church of Barnwell All-Saints, village of Barnwell, 78 mi. (125.5 km.) N of London. The church had been pulled down in the <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>s, but the chancel was preserved as a mausoleum for the Montagu family.</note> where all the Montagues are buried for many generations for many generations:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phrase repeated by TC.</note> the Hearse &#x26;c was there attended by servants who had come with it by train from London: we walked bare-headed in procession, all very sad &#x26; silent (the only <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-kinsman was myself, and the good old Lady had been loved by everybody); and so she was laid in her last home,&#x2014;as we shall be in ours before long; apart from one another, <hi rend="italic">parted</hi> however dear, till the Eternities come! Her son a strong, solid <hi rend="italic">oaken</hi> kind of man, and her two grandsons nice lads,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John William Montagu had three surviving sons: Edward, Victor, and Oliver.</note> were weeping at last; and silence and sadness on the part of all made it a kind of <hi rend="italic">religious</hi> ceremony more than such things usually are in this loose time. I shall never forget that little old Kirk standing on its little knoll amid its graves in the green Country with the poor villagers and Spring skies looking on;&#x2014;and her whom we left there yesterday.</p>
<p>Today we were to be off for a little Holiday of 3 days at Addiscombe with the Ashburtons: Jane is actually there at this time;&#x2014;and I, on <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> this Note, expected to be on the road thither in five minutes:&#x2014;but a Servant is just come to say that poor Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s Mother (a very aged Highland Dame, beyond Inverness is just dying);<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Elizabeth Frederica Stewart-Mackenzie did not die until <date when="1862-11-28">28 Nov.</date></note> and so that is all <hi rend="italic">up</hi> for the time. My horse, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is still waiting, I shall take a <hi rend="italic">common</hi> ride; and Jane, who went <hi rend="italic">driving,</hi> will wait till her horse rest, and return direct.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC still joined JWC there the next day, Sun., <date when="1862-04-27">27 April</date>.</note> This is all at pres<hi rend="italic">t;</hi>&#x2014;my blessings added. <closer><salute>Your affec<hi rend="italic">te</hi> Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi></salute></closer> <name>T.C</name></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>For almost a week past I have been daily purposing to send you a small word; and daily,&#x2014;not by <hi rend="italic">business</hi> in my own kind, for the <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> has been a stranger to me totally all that time, and only locomotion and confused sauntering and extraneous affairs my sole occupation,&#x2014;I have been hindered by one poor thing and another from so much as writing a Note to my Brother, much more to any other person!</p>
<p>The Ashburtons had asked us out hither from about Wednesday last: Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last I had got fairly thro&#x2019; a most extremely ugly set of Proofsheets again; &#x26; was ready for a day or two of recreation: but, alas, before that there had things befallen wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> sent me elsewhither in the first place. My good old Lady Sandwich, my late Friend&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton.</note> aged Mother, always very weak, but very good, graceful interesting, age now 81,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich was 81 on <date when="1862-04-03">3 April</date>.</note> had weathered the winter, I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> rather better than usual; but in the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> gust of cold weather had caught some poor whiff of cold; and far ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my expectation, on Sunday gone a week, calling for the third time I found that she was dead the night before. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Sandwich, who is a fine solid man much in my esteem, distinguished me by an invitation to the Funeral (the only person not of kin who was there); and on Thursday I had to set off for Hinchinbrook on that melancholy business wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had to take place next day. The ride thither was silent, sad, solitary not unbeautiful; but the agitations there, the driving, the &#x26;c (all the Funeral people being there) confused me into <hi rend="italic">sleeplessness:</hi> and next day the drive of 18 miles (and as far back) in very beautiful weather, and the touching little solemnity (a fine innocent old Chapel, in the rurarl<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> midlands, not far from Oundle Northamptonshire)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oundle, village in Northamptonshire, 80 mi. (128.5 km.) N of London.</note>, followed by the hurries at Hinchinbrook, and the unpleasant railwaying home, had a good deal tired me out: so that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> much rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> have been due at Addiscombe on the morrow. But there was no help; Jane too was very eager for it. Her I got shot away, with all the luggage, in a fly or brougham; then went myself to a sofa for some snatch of sleep;&#x2014;and was just about mounting horse, when an Express arrived, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t! The Lady&#x2019;s Mother&#x201C; (far away, beyond Inverness) &#x201C;is dying; we must put you <pb id="pg-38-87" n="38:87"/>off!&#x201D;&#x2014; Well, I tho<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> as to the latter clause; and went out for a common ride. But it did not stand that way either! Jane having arrived was <hi rend="italic">kept;</hi> a new message was returned by the Sylvester Driver,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had traveled in one of the livery stabler Silvester&#x2019;s carriages.</note> &#x201C;Come on, still!&#x201D; In short I cannot tell you what confused choppings &#x26; changings there were (new telegrams from Inverness, and the poor old Lady out of danger) &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;the general result <hi rend="italic">being</hi> (in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> alone you are interested) that I am <hi rend="italic">here</hi> since sunday, not to return till tomorrow (Wednesday),&#x2014;totally idle, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> idle truly; and in spite of the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> weather, kindest of welcomes and all other furtherances, am but an unprofitable and far from a happy object! Lord A. &#x26; I went out for a ride yesterday (the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> to him these many weeks, for he is commonly in very poor health, of late); but it had nothing of sufficient emphasis of continuance: today I am going by myself, and trust to have a far more effective &#x26; properly dietetic bit of exercise. If so, it will be the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> good thing I have done here! Jane enjoys it considerably; I suppose we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> both be the better for it perhaps;&#x2014;at any rate I ride home tomorrow, and it <hi rend="italic">ends.</hi></p>
<p>I have been reading the <hi rend="italic">Life of Edd Irving;</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Edward Irving Minister of the National Scotch Church, London. Illustrated by his Journals and Correspondence,</hi> 2 vols. (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>).</note> am thro&#x2019; Vol. I. It is a work not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> some genius; and has a beautiful loyalty and venerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for poor Ed<hi rend="italic">d,</hi>&#x2014;interesting really here and there, but to us that knew him often ghastly and distressing! Correct <hi rend="italic">likeness</hi> of man or work there is little or none; that is a grievous fault:&#x2014;yet one is glad to see such a <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> done, in the absence of anything else whatever.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In an early review in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1862-04-19">19 April</date>, Henry Fothergill Chorley (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5350"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) concluded: &#x201C;Be we right, be we wrong &#x2026; the book is not one to be read lightly. It should be considered by all who grapple with those most momentous of questions, sincerity, opinion and mistake&#x201C; (526).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have just received from Mr Froude the inclosed communication;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude wrote, <date when="1862-05-08">8 May</date>: &#x201C;I am applied to to recommend some one for an English Professorship at Calcutta.&#x2014; The Salary 450 a year is not likely to tempt Oxford or Cambridge men to face an Indian Climate.&#x2014;It has occurred to me that your Scotch friend whom you recommended to me for Frasers might do. &#x2F; I do not know enough of him to recommend him on my own separate responsibility&#x2014; I have even forgotten his name&#x2014;&#x26; he has not written to me since I was obliged to refuse his first Paper&#x2014;except once to acknowledge my general reasonableness and to promise something else. &#x2F; It was plain to me however that he was a man of great straightforwardness&#x2014;integrity &#x26; industry&#x2014;with sufficient intellect for the purposes of the Indian Board and quite sure to do his duty manfully. &#x2F; If you will communicate with him to ascertain if it would suit his views&#x2014;and then endorse my opinion&#x2014;I will send in his name. He had better write direct to me&#x2014;to save time.&#x201C;</note> 
 and make all speed to send it you; hoping it may be welcome, and turn to good as he expects.</p>
<p>I will, if you embrace the proposal, certify with great readiness, and cooperate as Mr Froude wishes; so that the post seems to be yours if you care to have it. The one Condition is to lose <hi rend="italic">no time</hi>.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours sincerely &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<p>I ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Mr Froude that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am not <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of your being in London; and that he must give <hi rend="italic">a day,</hi> on the chance of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> being in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> instead. Of course you will write to him instantly. No need of writing to me till the haste is over.</p>

Then he asked if I would like to be introduced to him after dinner. I answered rather emphatically, &#x2018;No, thank you!&#x2019; which amused him. Presently afterwards it happened that with the same words I successively declined several dishes and wines that were handed round, and Caryle remarked, &#x2018;So it&#x2019;s always &#x201C;No, thank you,&#x201C;&#x2019; and he got into one of his uncontrollable and boisterous fits of merriment, laughing enormously every time I repeated &#x2018;No, thank you.&#x2019; I could not help joining in the laugh, until at last Milnes called out to us and wanted to be admitted to share the joke, which of course was impossible with Louis Blanc sitting opposite us, and so it passed&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Personal Remembrances of Sir Frederick Pollock</hi> [<date when="1887-00-00">1887</date>] 2:106&#x2013;7).

F. D. Maurice wrote to J. D. Lowell, <date when="1861-05-30">30 May</date>, after visiting TC the previous week: &#x201C;There have been times when I have accepted your judgment of Carlyle, and have added to it some bitterness of my own, arising out of the disappointment that a man who has taught <hi rend="italic">me</hi> so much should outrage some of my strongest convictions. &#x2026; I went to his house with much reluctance and some fear. After a long conversation with him, I came away with a strong conviction, that very much more is expressed in that oscillation of his mind between democracy and absolutism &#x2026; than you are willing to admit. &#x2026; There are terrible contradictions in his thoughts, which express themselves in his wild speech. But the contradictions belong to the time: we may find them in ourselves. And they cannot be resolved, as you fancy they may, into the mere worship of might. That comes uppermost at times; often he recoils from it with the intensest horror, and affirms and feels Justice to be the one ruler in heaven and earth. &#x2026; I hope you will not let your dislike of Carlyle, which if you will search into it you will find to be more democratic than divine, colour your judgment of his friend [Irving], whom, in spite of enormous prejudice against him, I was forced and am now more than ever forced to reverence and love&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Life of Frederick Denison Maurice,</hi> ed.

<salute>Dearest Mary,</salute>
<p>I cannot count the letters I have written to you <hi rend="small-caps">in my head</hi> within the last six weeks! they have been so many! I have written them mostly before getting out of bed in the morning; or while lying awake at night. But in the day time,&#x2014;with pen and ink at hand, I have been always, always, always, too <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> or too bothered, to put them on paper!&#x2014;have indeed been writing to nobody, &#x2014;if that be any excuse for not writing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>  The beginning of warm weather is as trying for me in a different way as winter was. and so many sad things have happened. just when the freshness of one sorrow was wearing off there has come another. First Elizabeth Pepoli, then Lady Sandwich, then M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Twisleton.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Twisleton d. <date when="1862-05-17">17 May</date>. <hi rend="italic">Jackson&#x2019;s Oxford Journal,</hi> <date when="1862-05-31">31 May</date>, quoting the <hi rend="italic">Banbury Guardian,</hi> reported TC&#x2019;s attendance at the Twisleton funeral: &#x201C;The remains of the lamentedlady were interred on Saturday, in the churchyard of Broughton, beneath the shade of a laburnum&#x2014;a spot she had herself specially selected for that purpose in her life time, in preference to the family vault within the walls of the church itself. &#x2026; Amongst personal friends, not related to the family, &#x2026; were &#x2026; Mr. Thomas Carlyle, Mr. R. Browning.&#x201C; &#x201C;A very beautiful and clever little Boston lady, wife of Hon. Edward Twisleton, and much about us for the six or seven years she lived here. I well remember her affecting funeral (old Fiennes Castle, in Oxfordshire), and my ride thither with Browning, &#x26;c&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:98); Broughton Castle, home of the Fiennes family.</note> the three people in all London whose friendship I had most <pb id="pg-38-97" n="38:97"/>dependence on. Nobody will believe the loss Lady Sandwich is to us. They say &#x201C;a woman of eighty!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is not to be regretted.&#x201C; But her intimate friends know that this woman of eighty was the most charming Companion and the loyalest, warmest friend, was the only person in London or in the world that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C went regularly to see&#x2014;twice a week he used to call for her&#x2014;and now his Horse makes for her House, whenever he gets into the region of Grosvenor Square! and does not see or understand the <hi rend="italic">Escutcheon</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An escutcheon given a black surround and hung at the front door of the deceased person&#x2019;s house to indicate mourning.</note> that turns <hi rend="italic">me</hi> sick as I drive past.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am obliged to you for your good&#x2014;word, and your good&#x2014;will. What you say of Vol iii is (bating what modesty forbids me to &#x26;c &#x26;c) very much the truth of the matter.

<p>Nor am I surprised, or sorry, at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> present disgust in regard to matters Literary.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note came this morning; thanks. I am glad to hear of H<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Watt&#x2019;s engage<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> I saw him here,&#x2014;and strongly advised him to stick to his trade, steadily in any form rather than in none, and to end these continual interludes.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Watt seemed to have spent much of the previous two years in Edinburgh; TC was probably referring to Henry&#x2019;s having obtained another position on a ship, rather than that he was already engaged to Jane Hunter, da. of John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s friend John Hunter (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350600-JWC-SS-01"><sic>8:161</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1835-06-00">June 1835</date></corr></ref>), whom Henry m. in <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>. John Carlyle wrote to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1862-04-16">16 April</date>, suggesting that Henry &#x201C;might be able to help you to some occupation in Liverpool, now that he has got so much more common sense than he used to have&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he himself seemed disposed to do. Of his youngest Brother he seemed to have no definite expectations.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Watt was in trouble at Woolwich; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620503-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-05-03">3 May</date></ref>.</note> Poor fellows, their little outfit of money is positively a great and almost insuperable <hi rend="italic">hindrance</hi> to them!&#x2014; I am happy to think you have nearly done with the affair.</p>
<p>James of Scotsbrig&#x2019;s adventure<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Jr. was hoping for a post with William Baird &#x26; Co., an ironworks company based in Gartsherrie, Lanarkshire, run by James Baird (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1100"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). They owned coalfields and ironworks in various parts of Scotland, as well as extensive lands in N Lanarkshire. John A. Carlyle had arranged an introduction for James Jr. to a Mr. Wallace, probably David Wallace (d. <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>), m. to Janet Weir (<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>), James Baird&#x2019;s niece. John wrote to James, <date when="1862-04-19">19 April</date>, telling him that Mr. Wallace was &#x201C;anxious to have men of good &#x26; respectable connections &#x26; character in the employment of the Bairds&#x201C; and that he wanted to see James; John concluded: &#x201C;[W]e may infer &#x2026; that Mr Wallace has really taken up your case, &#x26; perhaps also that he may have some post in view for you, if he finds your qualifications suitable&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> is, of course, far more interesting to me. <pb id="pg-38-102" n="38:102"/>The present posture of it seems to me the difficult one,&#x2014;so far as I can understand. If he likes to <hi rend="italic">undertake</hi> in real earnest the charge of their model-Farm, I have no doubt he can and will respectably do it: but hanging on as <hi rend="italic">a led horse,</hi> is not good on strange roads! If you can use any means to shorten the probat<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> or help (with him or with them) towards a good issue, it will be very charitable.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Model farm untraced; James Jr. was offered an office job; John wrote, <date when="1862-06-02">2 June</date>, that Mr. Wallace hoped to see James at Gartsherrie next week: &#x201C;He says it is a thriving place, &#x26; you will be able to get lodgings under the guidance of people in the office. &#x2026; The project of farm management can stand in the background meanwhile&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). James Jr. took the job on probationary terms; John wrote, <date when="1862-06-27">27 June</date>: &#x201C;[D]o not make yourself miserable whatever the result of the probation may lead to. Something else will be found, if you fail with the Bairds. It seems already pretty clear that you cannot stand the confinement of the office; &#x26; if the Baird you speak of seems an unreasonable man you had perhaps better keep clear of any permanent engagement with him&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note>&#x2014; Did J<hi rend="italic">s</hi> never think of fairly starting, on his own account, as Tiller of the Earth, in N.S.

The catalog of the unknown dealer from whom Breckenridge bought this letter stated: &#x201C;This letter &#x2026; was written to a now well-known writer when a youth.&#x201C; As the MS was sold and pbd. in the U.S., it is possible that the &#x201C;well-known writer&#x201C; might be Henry James Jr. (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1916-00-00">1916</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34150"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), living in Newport, Rhode Island, at this time, and writing many short stories; his story &#x201C;A Tragedy of Error&#x201C; was pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Continental Monthly</hi> <date when="1864-02-00">Feb. 1864</date>.

<salute>My Dear</salute>
<p>I dont know what would have become of me if it hadn&#x2019;t been for Miss Davenport Bromley,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Davenport Bromley.</note> whom I met on the platform at Folkestone Station! The Heavens had chosen that particular moment to pour down a deluge! I had taken no umbrella, and no outer wrappage; No &#x201C;carriage&#x201C; was waiting, nor servant; But Miss Bromley was also bound for Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s. and her Maid<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> plunged about and procured a Fly&#x2014;to which we had to walk some space as thro&#x2019; a waterfall! and in which we were packed all too close for my wetted velvet cloak; the wreck of which was total! It was a bad beginning; and I am very sorry about my poor cloak, which is not fit to be put on again! and which I got from dear Lady Sandwich. But I suppose I should be thankful that I didn&#x2019;t catch a great cold besides!</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Note Bena:</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Not to travel again without umbrella. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not to have a cloak again, which is spoiledable by rain&#x2014; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not to put my dependance on Lady A&#x2019;s memory.</p>
<p>I found Lord Ashburton on crutches<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton suffered from gout; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620127-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, [<date when="1862-01-27">27 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;Baby better&#x2014;and the Lady improving;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton was recovering from a miscarriage; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 88.</note> Miss Anstruther (the niece)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Annie Nairn Anstruther.</note> is here; and Miss D Bromely<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> who is amiable, and an acquisition. Lady A asked &#x201C;DID I think you would come?&#x201C;&#x2014;and said she &#x201C;almost expected to see you <hi rend="italic">with me</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC came <date when="1862-07-05">5</date> to <date when="1862-07-07">7 July</date>; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620702-JWC-JF-01">JWC to JF, [<date when="1862-07-02">2 July</date>]</ref>.</note> Still she didnt give me the idea of having expected you, or exactly <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> you to come just at this moment. Perhaps the party is as large as the premises admit of&#x2014;but I shall watch, and ascertain, <hi rend="italic">if possible,</hi> her precise meaning. Perhaps she would like best that you came when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> went home. It is a wonderfully quiet House, to be a Hotel. My room was undisturbed till the servants came into the adjoining sitting-room in the morning&#x2014;except for Baby who is located overhead, and who appeared to have more than one bad dream; when nurses <hi rend="italic">tramped</hi> about to the rescue, and Baby&#x2019;s cries rose to a pitch! The objection, to the bedroom, for <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> would be only the <hi rend="italic">light!</hi> there is a white muslin blind, and <pb id="pg-38-106" n="38:106"/>white muslin window curtains over a rather large window. But you could pin up your railway-rug; as you have done ere now.</p>
<p>The surrounding country&#x2014;so far as I have seen yet from the windows is flat and prosaic; the sea not so near as one could wish and, the weather being dull, not clearly definable from the sky. It isn&#x2019;t to be compared to Hastings as a place!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had been to Hastings with Frederic and Clara Chapman in <date when="1862-04-00">April</date>; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620407-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-04-07">7 April</date></ref>.</note> Still a day or two by the sea <hi rend="italic">anywhere</hi> would do you good. If Lady A would only say frankly, what she wishes as to both of us! instead of leaving one to guess! I havent a notion whether she expects <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to stay two days or two weeks or what!&#x2014; And shall have to find out before I can feel any pleasure in being here. What I should like to do is just to stay <hi rend="italic">half</hi> as long as she means me to stay. For the rest, she is as kind as kind can be, and the sea-air always revives me&#x2014;at first. And Kate<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a maid.</note> is very attentive, brought me a cup of tea at eight oclock in my bed.</p>
<p>I do hope you will be properly <hi rend="italic">fed!</hi> Elizabeth<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The new servant at Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620622-JWC-IES-01">JWC to IES, [ca. <date when="1862-06-22">22 June</date>]</ref>.</note> is very anxious to do right, and will attend to every wish you express&#x2014;if you will only give her <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plain</hi> directions.</p>
<p>But I dare say I shall soon be there to interpret for her.</p>
<p>And now I shall go and take a little walk before the rain comes&#x2014;which I see in the wind&#x2014;</p>

<p>It was, and is, y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> duty to send some tidings of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin, traveling in Switzerland and Italy, was currently in Milan.</note> to this address. We are more concerned ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you than you seem in the heart to believe;&#x2014;and therefore reigns no despair here upon the black state you are evidently in: nothing is considered the least <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> but that your bodily health sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> keep good, and clear itself of those superficial presences w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have been annoying of late. Take every precaution <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> I do earnestly counsel you! The want of every such counsel to myself, or of my following any such, has been such an item in the general invoice to me (invoice highly considerable, you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> say if you <pb id="pg-38-107" n="38:107"/>knew it) as swallows <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the others, and how fitly has with a shudder when I look back on it!

<p>I am finishing vol IV; busy as a poor spent costermonger&#x2019;s ass getting its head over the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> hill but <hi rend="italic">one.</hi> For years past I have ceased writing Notes pretty nearly altogether:&#x2014;not a wise step, I begin to see but it now cannot be mended.

<p><salute>Dear Goody mine,</salute>&#x2014;I am very sorry for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> poor velvet cloak, and poor self under these bits of mischances in your poor weak state! I hope and pray you may get some good of the sea-air, however; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a fine return for <pb id="pg-38-108" n="38:108"/>everything. Courage my poor brave Jeanniekin; come back to me a little better; that is all I want!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You were hardly gone when Blanche Lady Airlie came driving to the door; I need not inclose <hi rend="italic">her</hi> card, as there was not order given that I heard of: but some hours later, the same day, Mrs Dilb<hi rend="italic">ue</hi> with Cushman came, and expressly charged (I know not wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> of them did it, the gigantic or the middle-sized,)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;gigantic&#x201C; was presumably Charlotte Cushman; she was about JWC&#x2019;s height, 5 ft. 5&#xBE; ins. (1.68 m.) (see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450810-JWC-TC-01"><sic>19:138</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-08-10">10 Aug. 1845</date></corr></ref>) while JWC described Sarah Dilberoglue in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> as &#x201C;a little little creature neither pretty nor graceful&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530128-JWC-KS-01"><sic>28:21</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1853-01-28">28 Jan. 1853</date></corr></ref>). As TC was 6 ft. (1.8 m.), he was possibly referring to her girth, as compared to Sarah Dilberoglue&#x2019;s, rather than her height. For a picture of Cushman in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>, see <sic>opp</sic><corr>above</corr>.</note> that their &#x201C;Cards were to be forwarded,&#x201C;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> up stairs, <pb id="pg-38-109" n="38:109"/>and will inclose, accordingly: more power to them! George Cook also called (I out riding), and that was all.</p>

<p>Nothing is wrong ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the House (girls<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The maids Maria and Elizabeth.</note> <hi rend="italic">washing</hi> today &#x26;c), nor have I failed in sleep, or had other misfortune; nevertheless I am dreadfully low-spirited, and feel like a child <hi rend="italic">wishing Mammy back.</hi> Perhaps too she is as well away, for the moment! The truth is, I am under <hi rend="italic">medical</hi> appliance,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably blue pill; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620701-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-07-01">1 July</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;highly &#x201C;successful,&#x201C; and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will yield good fruits for days coming, but wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> renders me for this day the wretchedest nearly of all the Sons of Adam not yet condemned <hi rend="italic">in fact</hi> to the Gallows.&#x2014; I have not spoken one word to anybody since you went away (only to Jamie Aitken, a very few, yesternight); and, my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> lying aback too, am at a low pass for the time being.</p>
<p>No Proofsheets have come; no nothing:&#x2014;I have cleared off all my Note writing, the Ruskins &#x26;c &#x26;c; and am trying this day to <hi rend="italic">resume</hi> Friedrich the Unique in earnest. Vol V now; hurrah, after all. Don&#x2019;t bargain for my coming just now, even if you have chance. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> coming back, a little better, is the best news that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to me. But don&#x2019;t hurry; don&#x2019;t at all! Do as you are proposing,&#x2014;ready <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the good time;&#x2014;and any way let me hear largely from you. I mean largely if you can but don&#x2019;t make a <hi rend="italic">Corv&#xE9;e</hi> [required labor] of it. And Oh for God&#x2019;s sake, take care of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self.

<p><salute>Thanks Dear!</salute> especially for telling me about M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster. I had been so vexed at myself for not begging you to go again and send me word.</p>
<p>Lady A came and sat in my room a while last night&#x2014;and speaking of Miss Bromley&#x2019;s departure, I took occasion to say; that &#x201C;as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> and I <hi rend="italic">came</hi> on the same day, I felt as if I [ought] to have also <hi rend="italic">gone</hi> on the same day.&#x201C; The answer to which was a very cordial &#x201C;Nonsense! my <hi rend="italic">dear friend!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; I was expected to stay, she then said, &#x201C;as long as they did,&#x201C;&#x2014;or (when I shook my head at that) &#x201C;as long, at all events as I could possibly make it convenient.&#x201C; There was no doubt whatever about her <hi rend="italic">present</hi> wish being to that effect! And then came up the old question as a new one &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">did</hi> I think <hi rend="italic">He</hi> would come? &#x201C;It would be such a pleasure to Bingham,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton; for a lithograph of him by T. R. Way, see <sic>opp</sic><corr>above</corr>; the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Third and Concluding Exhibition of National Portraits &#x2026; on Loan to the South Kensington Museum. <date when="1868-04-00">April 1868</date></hi> noted that the portrait was loaned by Lord Northbrook and was &#x201C;After Sir Edwin Landseer.&#x201C; But A. Carlyle recorded it as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">From a Portrait &#x2018;done at one sitting,&#x2019; by Landseer&#x201C;</hi> (<hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2: list of illustrations). According to Virginia Surtees, Sir Edwin Landseer (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15984"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) gave this portrait to Lady Ashburton &#x201C;in the summer of <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>&#x201C; after he had completed his portrait of her and her da. Mary Florence (Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 85&#x2013;86); he had perhaps painted it earlier as Lord Ashburton appears in vigorous health, compared to the photograph taken of him in <date when="1862-10-00">Oct.</date> by Vernon Heath; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621030-JWC-EFO-01"><sic>248</sic><corr>JWC to EFO, <date when="1862-10-30">30 Oct.</date></corr></ref></note> now that he could move about&#x201C;</p>

It exercises a potent spell, because it is a work of genius. But we resist the fascination, and feel that the genius is not working with a beneficial influence. &#x2026; Carlyle, as an artist, may disregard all our established rules; as a teacher he is bound to regard them. &#x2026; Scorn is an attitude perilous even to a mind like his, pernicious in its influence on weaker minds.

Lewes and Greenwood complained: &#x201C;Leibnitz may not have been the greatest of men, but he is worthy of more respect than he receives from Carlyle, who not only scornfully insists on his long nose, bandy legs, and huge periwig (as if <hi rend="italic">those</hi> were the most notable points in a great thinker!), but in one place sneers at him as a &#x2018;wiseacre.&#x2019; Again, Maupertuis, the butt of this volume, is nicknamed &#x2018;Flattener of the Earth,&#x2019; and is presented to the reader in the most contemptible light. He had his vanities and weaknesses, which might have excused a little quizzing; but this achievement, which suggests the nickname of Flattener of the Earth [Maupertuis proved that the earth was oblate, rather than prolate], was very important to mankind, and removed an obstacle to the acceptance of Newton&#x2019;s theory; and his labours altogether were of a kind which render Carlyle&#x2019;s unvarying scorn as odious as it is unjust&#x201C; (6:108).</note>I couldnt help bursting out laughing at the man&#x2019;s sacred horror as if he had been speaking of Miltons Devil!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Milton, <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi></note></p>

<p>I am unwilling to add the smallest grain of trouble to the heavy burden you are having to bear! But it takes so long to hear round by Cheyne Row&#x2014;especially as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C posts his letter <hi rend="italic">before</hi> going out.</p>

<p>So may I beg you to send me just <hi rend="small-caps">one</hi> <hi rend="italic">word</hi>&#x2014;(literally)&#x2014;if &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">better</hi>&#x201C; be the word, it will be a great relief to me at this distance.</p>
<p>I shall stay here I believe till next week. It was become very needful to go somewhere&#x2014;try something&#x2014;and I am repaid for the violent effort I made in leaving home, by feeling a degree less weak and languid.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was glad to have seen yourself that day.</p>

<p><salute>Oh my Dear! my Dear!</salute> How tiresome you are! Never can, at least, never <hi rend="italic">will</hi> say a good, even down &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">yes</hi>&#x2019; till the last possible moment!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-119" n="38:119"/>At all events you must come now! for Lord A has put off going to London till Monday, in the expectation of your coming. &#x201C;A Sudden thought had struck him&#x201C; to go up on Sunday evening. He is knocked on the head by &#x201C;sudden thoughts,&#x201C; every hour, now! My Lady too talks of &#x201C;going up&#x201C; next week &#x201C;for a concert&#x201C;&#x2014;and returning here&#x2014;which latter clause of the Programme my Lord declares &#x201C;out of the question.&#x201C; In short there is a general confused movement as of Bees about to <hi rend="italic">skepp!</hi> and you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come tomorrow; if it were only that I may go handsomely away with you on Monday. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is &#x201C;what &#x2018;England expects<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18570807-JWC-TC-01"><sic>33:13</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1857-08-07">7 Aug. 1857</date></corr></ref>. No closing quotation marks.</note> of me I perceive. Happily it is also what I expect of myself!</p>
<p>You had best consult with Larkin about the hour. I was desired by him to leave my own house at twenty minutes before 1&#x2013;for the Boat.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Thames steamer from Cadogan Pier to London Bridge Station, terminus of the South Eastern Railway; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550814-JWC-TC-01"><sic>30:30</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1855-08-14">14 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> I think the Train starts at 20 minutes after two&#x2014;but I had long to wait, and am not sure&#x2014;</p>
<p>All the rest will keep without detriment until you come.</p>
<p>Oh I should tell you one thing. They will ask whether you want your ticket for Folkestone Junction or Folkestone <hi rend="italic">Pier</hi>&#x2014;and you are to say <hi rend="italic">Junction</hi>&#x2014; It is nearest to the West Cliff Hotel&#x2014; You will find plenty of Flies and Om[n]ibuses;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> if no carriage is sent. and the distance is short&#x2014;about a mile and half, I should think, or less&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you were to start in the morning wouldn&#x2019;t it be worthwhile?&#x2014;to have a long afternoon on the shore&#x2014; It is very pretty down there.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary,</salute>
<p>When you wrote last you were going somewhere&#x2014;to see your cousin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I think  Is that visit paid? and what other visits have you to pay?&#x2014;and how are you? I fear but poorly from your late letters! but are you well enough to feel any pleasure in&#x2014; &#x2014;in&#x2014;in seeing me if I should come!!</p>
<p>Look here! I am not sure about it! But Mr C said something this morning that I am determined to view as permission for me, to go away by myself&#x2014;where I please&#x2014;and when I please <hi rend="italic">for a very little while.</hi></p>
<p>We had got into words about an invitation to the Marquis of Lothian&#x2019;s in Norfolk. I had written a refusal, by his M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s desire, and Lady Lothian had written to me a second letter, holding out as inducements for altering his mind, that there was a wonderfully fine <hi rend="italic">Library</hi> at Blickling Park,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blickling Hall library, famous for its large, valuable collection of books, housed in the Long Gallery, was collected by Sir Richard Ellys (<date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>&#x2013;<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8729"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3rd bart., book collector, of Nocton, Lincolnshire.</note> and that Lord Lothian&#x2019;s health prevented <hi rend="italic">company</hi>&#x201C; and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C tempted&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">little</hi>&#x2014;by the Library, and the <hi rend="italic">no-company,</hi> had suggested I might write, that if the weather got unbearable&#x2014;! and if he got to a place in his work where he could gather up some papers and take them with him&#x2014;! and IF&#x2014;if&#x2014;if ever so many things he might <hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>&#x2014;that is <hi rend="italic">we</hi> might &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">perhaps</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;come &#x201C;by and by&#x201C;!!!&#x2014; I had said &#x201C;by no means&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;I have written a refusal, by your desire; I shall gladly now write an acceptance by your desire&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">neither yes nor no</hi>&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">yes and no both in one</hi>&#x2014;I cant and won&#x2019;t write!&#x2014;you must do <hi rend="italic">that sort of thing</hi> yourself!&#x2014; And then he told me &#x201C;since I was so impatient about it&#x201C; I had better go by myself&#x2014; To which I answered that it wouldn&#x2019;t be <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that I would go by myself; nor to the Trevelyans, nor the Davenport Bromleys,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Walter and Lady Paulina Trevelyan lived at Wallington Hall, Northumberland; Rev.

Now it wasnt a very gracious permission</p>
<p>Still it was a <hi rend="italic">permission</hi>&#x2014;at least I choose to regard it as such! and if I had been <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sure how you were situated; whether you were at home, without other visitor, well enough to be bothered with me, &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;I should have said on the spot&#x2014;&#x201C;thanks!&#x2014;I will go then on such a day!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-123" n="38:123"/>I know to my sorrow that if I should be long absent things would go to sixes and sevens and I should find mischievous habits acquired in the kitchen department which it would take months to reform&#x2014;if ever&#x2014;</p>
<p>But my week at Folkestone with the Ashburtons passed off with impunity &#x2014;and their<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;the Serv<hi rend="italic">ts&#x2019;s</hi>&#x201C; above in blue pencil.</note> moralities might surely hold out for a fortnight or so&#x2014;which would give plenty of time to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> and look about on the dear old places and go round by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for a kiss of old Betty<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>You see how it is however&#x2014;for I have told you exactly what passed&#x2014;and you see it is not a very settled question.</p>
<p>Without further speech with Mr C; I cant just say &#x201C;I am coming&#x2014;if you will have me&#x201C;!&#x2014;but, if you say you will have me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">can</hi> have me soon&#x2014;without inconvenience,&#x2014;then I will myself open the further speech, and ascertain if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> means to stand to his word&#x2014;and look favourably on my going for a week or two&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>Your letter of this morning had the same effect on <hi rend="italic">my heart</hi>, that a glass of port wine, administerd in my babyhood, was recorded to have had on a less <pb id="pg-38-124" n="38:124"/>dignified organ! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Port wine</hi>&#x201C; (I was said to have said to my Mother with the suddenness of Balaams Ass<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Num. 22:21&#x2013;33.</note>) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">maks Belly aa cozzy</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of JWC&#x2019;s childhood phrases; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:157</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 71 and 153.</note></p>
<p>So indeed did your cordial letter mak <hi rend="italic">Heart aa cozzy</hi>!&#x2014;on the stren[g]th of the cozziness, I said right out to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C sitting opposite; &#x201C;How long had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to wait at Carlisle for the train that put you down at the Gill at 7 in the morning?&#x201C;&#x2014; No opening could have been better! He was taken quite by surprise, and before he had time to consider my <hi rend="small-caps">going</hi> <hi rend="italic">as a question,</hi> he found himself engaged in considerations of <hi rend="italic">the best way to go!</hi> after <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> he couldnt well go back upon his implied assent.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Alas! how little did I ever <hi rend="italic">know</hi> of these secret wishes and necessities&#x2014;now or ever!&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:106).</note> The only &#x201C;demurrer&#x201C; he could put in with a good grace, was to ask &#x201C;what did I mean to do with my <hi rend="italic">foot?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; I meant it to get well, I said; in a few days! Of course I shouldnt think of going from home on <hi rend="italic">one</hi> leg! This related to a bruised, or sprained, or some way bedevilled foot that I came by, the very day I had written to you!&#x2014;as if&#x2014;I almost felt&#x2014;with a shudder&#x2014;at the time&#x2014;it was the monition of Providence that I should go no such journey!</p>
<p>I was returning from Islington, where I had been, to ask after the lamed foot (!) of the little Lady who was my honorary Nurse last winter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mrs. Dilberoglue (?)&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:106). Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell, <date when="1862-07-20">20 July</date>: &#x201C;I saw the Dils a fortnight ago&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Dil had sprained her foot &#x26; was a prisoner on the sofa.&#x201C;</note> The Islington Omnibus put me down within some eighth part of a mile of my own house. I had one rather dark street to pass thro first (taking the shortest way) and it was near eleven o&#x2019;clock at night. I didn&#x2019;t care for being alone so late; but I didnt want to be seen by any of the low people of that street, <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>&#x2014;so I stepped off the pavement to avoid passing close to a small group standing talking at a door&#x2014; When I had cleared these only people to be seen in the whole street I was stepping back on to the pavement, when the curb stone being higher than I noticed in the shadow, I struck the side of my right foot <hi rend="italic">violently</hi> against it&#x2014;and was tripped over&#x2014;and fell smack down, full length, on the pavement!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I remember, and may well&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:107).</note> Considering how easily I have broken my <hi rend="italic">ribs,</hi> it is wonderful that the <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> did me no harm! I scrambled up directly but the foot I had struck on the curb stone, before falling, was dreadfully sore&#x2014;and it was made worse, you may believe, by having to use it after a sort, to get myself home. How I got home at all, even in holding on to walls and railings, I cant think But once at home, on a chair, I couldnt touch the ground with it on any account!&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had to carry me to bed, at the imminent risk of knocking my head off against the lintels! so I wouldnt be <hi rend="italic">carried</hi> by him any more; my head <pb id="pg-38-125" n="38:125"/>being of more consequence to me than my foot&#x2014; It was dreadfully swelled for a couple of days. but today, tho&#x2019; I still cannot get a shoe on, or <hi rend="italic">walk,</hi> it is so much better, that I am sure it will be all right presently.</p>
<p>In a few days I hope to be able to write that I am roadworthy. and I will only wait for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.</p>
<p>It is a most provoking little accident; for delays are so dangerous. I should have wished, after my experiences of late summers, to go to you at once, before any &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">pigs</hi>&#x201C; have time to &#x201C;run thro&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I would go to the Chambers&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> to call for Mrs Veich<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x2019;s friend Agnes Veitch.</note>&#x2014;but for the shoelessness and hopping process&#x2014; But I hope she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> call for me. Tho&#x2019; to believe Miss Chambers (the only one I have seen) we shouldn&#x2019;t suit each other&#x2014; I remember when I called at their house, and spoke of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Veich this girl said; &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle I have known M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Veich a long time&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I have only seen for five minutes; but I am confident that two people more unlike, and more certain to get on ill together don&#x2019;t exist!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Yet the same Lady is the particular friend of us both&#x201C; I said. &#x201C;No matter for that!&#x201D; said the brisk young Lady.</p>
<p>And now I needn&#x2019;t be saying more&#x2014; But that god grant nothing may prevent our meeting this time!&#x2014; Love to the Doctor</p>

<p><salute>Dear Mr. Erskine,</salute>&#x2014;Here is a very bright little book of Ruskin&#x2019;s, which, if you have not already made acquaintance with it, is extremely well worth reading. Two years ago, when the Essays came out in the fashionable magazines, there rose a shriek of anathema from all newspaper and publishing persons.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Unto This Last;</hi> see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620630-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1862-06-30">30 June</date></ref>; for the hostility to Ruskin&#x2019;s essays, see also <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601029-TC-JRU-01"><sic>37:29</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1860-10-29">29 Oct. 1860</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620414-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1862-04-14">14 April</date></ref>.</note> But I am happy to say that the subject is to be taken up again and heartily gone into by the valiant Ruskin, who, I hope, will reduce it to a <hi rend="italic">dog&#x2019;s likeness</hi>&#x2014;its real physiognomy for a long time past to the unenchanted eye, and peremptorily bid it prepare to quit this afflicted earth, as R. has done to several things before now. He seems to me to have the best talent for <hi rend="italic">preaching</hi> of all men now alive.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine replied, <date when="1862-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I am thankful for any unveiling of the so-called science of political economy, according to which, avowed selfishness is the Rule of the World. It is indeed most important preaching. &#x2026; The little book is valuable on its own account, and coming from you, it is doubly so.&#x201C;</note> He has entirely blown up the world that used to call itself of &#x2018;Art,&#x2019; <pb id="pg-38-126" n="38:126"/>and left it in an <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> posture, uncertain whether on its feet at all or on its head, and conscious that there will be no continuing on the bygone terms. If he could do as much for Political Economy (as I hope), it would be the greatest benefit achieved by preaching for generations past; the chasing off of one of the brutallest nightmares that ever sate on the bosom of slumbrous mankind, kept the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of them squeezed down into an invisible state, as if they had no soul, but only a belly and a beaver faculty in these last sad ages, and were about <hi rend="italic">arriving</hi> we know where in consequence. I have read nothing that pleased me better for many a year than these new <hi rend="italic">Ruskiniana.</hi></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Since that morning when you whisked away from me again (w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you had staid a while longer!) you have written me three little Notes, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were very welcome and kind in my solitude; and I have been, day after day, of mind to write in answer; but c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never manage it,&#x2014;for the reasons you know.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the pressure of his work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note></p>
<p>The hot weather has, as you supposed, driven me out, and got the awning up,&#x2014;under wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I now sit (3 p.m.) tho&#x2019; there has been rain today. Very busy, sadly tumbled ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from post to pillar; and in general rather more <hi rend="italic">feckless</hi> than when you saw me suffic<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> so. It is not the heat only; it is, still more, I take it, the <hi rend="italic">new vegetables;</hi> the want of food that my capricious inner-man can make <pb id="pg-38-127" n="38:127"/>away with at all. An almost complete strike of work on the part of said inner man; till, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Saturday last, we got to a crisis; three considerably sleepless nights &#x26;c, till today I hope it is rather over again. Next time I must apply to <hi rend="italic">blue-pill;</hi> the poor liver, I suppose, is quite awry: a bad enemy;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1862-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;[W]hat you need above all things is some period of rest from labour just now. Most of the derangements you mention arise from nothing but overwork affecting the whole nervous system.&#x201C;</note> tho happily my worst, and almost only great one, at pres<hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
<p>Vol<hi rend="italic">me</hi> Fourth is like to be as <hi rend="italic">dour</hi> as any of the others: no end of haggling, fash and impediment; so difficult exceedingly (and never yet tried at all) to make the Seven-Years War <hi rend="italic">march abreast</hi> (the many-columned marching Entity), and shew itself for what it was, in any measure! Only one consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> there is: it is perhaps better worth doing than some of the other foul tasks I have had. At times I am quite downcast on my lonesome long interminable journey thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Mount-Horeb Wilderness,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The desert around Mt. Horeb through which Moses and the Israelites traveled after their flight from Egypt; see Exod.</note> but the beggarly &#x201C;Creca-Moss&#x201C; moss<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moorland about 4 mi. (6.5 km.) NE of Annan; &#x201C;moss&#x201C; repeated.</note> one:&#x2014;then at other times, I pick up heart; and think with myself: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Creca,</hi> and the Infinite of barren brambly moor is under Heaven too,&#x2014;what if <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> couldst shew the blockhead populations that withal!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on Mt. Horeb (see Deut. 4:10); TC hoped that his own humble work might give the people something of benefit.</note> And get honourably out of this heartbreaking affair,&#x2014;pitied by the Eternal Powers!&#x201D;&#x2014; If I can hold out another year&#x2014;surely before this time twelvemont[h]<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> we shall have done.</p>
<p>There is no visible chance of my getting to the Country. Jane <hi rend="italic">is</hi> for Nithsdale &#x26;c; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am very glad of, hoping it may strengthen the poor weak soul ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Winter that is coming on. She lamed herself, the other night; hastening home from some Brompton Omnibus, down that dark little Street (Arthur-Street,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now Dovehouse St., N of Cheyne Row.</note> I think), she had the ill luck to hit her foot ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the Curb-stone (outside part and little toe); fell, and came hirpling home in great trouble; had fallen &#x26;c, tho&#x2019; her <hi rend="italic">wrists</hi> saved her, and soon mended. The foot, too, is now rapidly mending: after that, she is for off at once. Goes by the train you went by; Larkin busy inquiring. Cannot understand J<hi rend="italic">s</hi>&#x2014;Aitken&#x2019;s &#x201C;return-ticket&#x201C;;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their nephew James Aitken, presumably going home to Dumfries on holiday.

Carlyle replied, <date when="1862-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I wish I had been at hand to give Jane instructions for her journey to Dumfriesshire. The 10 a.m. train is by far the best, as I found; &#x26; the corresponding train, which goes on to Dumfries &#x26; Thornhill from Carlisle without delay, stops at Ruthwell&#x2014;only one mile farther from Gill than Cummertrees. &#x2026; I would advise Jane &#x2026; to choose either a <hi rend="italic">monday</hi> or <hi rend="italic">thursday</hi> 10 a.m. train for her journey.&#x201C;</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c.

Jean tells me Jenny is not looking well; hurt by some bad bedroom; poor little Jenny.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their niece Jenny Carlyle; John replied, <date when="1862-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Whenever I get to Scotsbrig I set about contriving remedies for Jenny&#x2019;s room. It is now all <hi rend="italic">stoothed</hi> &#x26; papered, a good large tent bed has been put into it, instead of the close wooden one, &#x26; the upper sash of the window is hung so as to admit fresh air in small or large quantities. The bed is as big as yours, &#x26; like it curtained all round. Due ventilation will now be possible &#x26; the papering will keep the room dry. The old arrangement had gone on too long &#x26; made poor Jenny quite unwell.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>My foot has been getting steadily tho&#x2019; slowly better. Yesterday I got on a shoe&#x2014;a large one&#x2014;and today I <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> some quarter of a mile, with only a moderate limp. So at this rate of progress I guess I shall be quite road-worthy by next week&#x2014; &#x2014;the first day of it that is, first <hi rend="italic">available</hi> day&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Monday.</hi> The train leaves Euston Square at ten, that I shall come by&#x2014;and after only twenty minutes waiting at Carlisle I get on to Thornhill fifty minutes after 7 at night.</p>
<p>My first idea was to cut off a bit of the long journey at the end, and stay all night at the Gill&#x2014;as I could get set down at Ruthwell, close by the Gill&#x2014; But on reflection, I have decided to push on the whole road however tired. I shall get rested beside you, better than at Mary&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin, at The Gill.</note> where M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken might &#x201C;feel it her duty&#x201C; to come and meet me!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken, from Dumfries.</note> and I should be expected to be amiable and make myself agreeable&#x2014;which <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> dear considerate Soul will dispense me from the first night!</p>
<p>I can see Mary on the road home&#x2014;or run down and see her for a day, without luggage.</p>
<p>I got a &#x201C;considerable of a fright&#x201C; a day or two after I had written to you that I would come! Mr C came down one morning and said that he found on looking at the map, the Marquis of Lothian&#x2019;s place<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blickling Hall; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620730-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1862-07-30">30 July</date></ref>.</note> was fifty miles nearer London than he had thought&#x2014; It would not be difficult for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> to go&#x2014;&#x201C;oh well, I said, do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;But it would be best for me to go too, he said, and then, &#x201C;if I was <hi rend="italic">still</hi> bent on Thornhill I could push on there afterwards&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;No, I said&#x2014;I had best go to Thornhill first&#x2014;and then if you like I will <hi rend="italic">push on</hi> to Norfolk afterwards&#x201C;&#x2014;so the suddenly revived question was let go to sleep again&#x2014;</p>
<p>I went out in a cab this morning to buy myself a pair of <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> shoes. and the Chamberses and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Veitch came just in the <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> I was absent&#x2014; How provoking! I will try to go to her tomorrow but of course <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will be out next! I neednt be writing long and broad with the prospect of seeing you on Monday evening! I can hardly believe it! Shall not believe that I am really to get&#x2014;till I am there!</p>

<salute>My dear Mary,</salute>
<p>If you will be on the knowe when the London train passes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Gill was less than 1 mi.

And I will see you&#x2014;even at that distance&#x2014;standing out clear, the little figure of you, against the horizon. My first intention was [to]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> offer to stop and sleep at the Gill, and give you &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the first rush o&#x2019; me</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;ye first rush o&#x2019; ye tea&#x201C;; coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390413-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>11:78</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1839-04-13">13 April 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> But on considering, like the Pipers Cow,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:269</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-08-15">15 Aug. 1834</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600812-TC-LS-01"><sic>36:174</sic><corr>TC to LS, <date when="1860-08-12">12 Aug. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> and turning over all the outs and ins of the matter; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and I both agreed, &#x201C;to push on to the far end,&#x201C; would be the wisest thing to do; and arrange, from Thornhill, a meeting with you under less exhausted circumstances, than I shall find myself in, on Monday night!</p>
<p>It is all my own force of character that has brought this journey to a bearing. I am only coming for a fortnight or so; but I am coming, and mean to give you before I return the heartiest kiss, you have had &#x201C;this seven years&#x201C; (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would say). God bless you and all your belongings.</p>
<p>I am hurried.</p>

<p>It was very cheering to see the face of Mary, looking in thro&#x2019; the glass window, dimmed with human breath, at Ruthwell! (I had been forced into the middle seat, and the wretches <hi rend="italic">would</hi> keep both windows shut within an inch at the tops, so I hadnt been able to wave my pocket handkerchief opposite the Gill as I had meant to! and wasn&#x2019;t sure whether there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a figure on the knowe or not!) It was such an <hi rend="italic">old wrinkled</hi> face!, and was so full of disappointment for the moment! She had not recognised me under the spicy little black <hi rend="italic">hat</hi> and white feather! But I flew at the window, and without even a &#x201C;pardon me&#x201C; dashed it down! and Mary clambered up like a cat; and we kissed, with enthusiasm, regardless of consequences! It was only a minute&#x2019;s interview; but if short, it was sweet! and I went on the cheerier for it; tho aware I couldnt reach Thornhill till <hi rend="italic">nine</hi>&#x2014;exactly an <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> after time!&#x2014;&#x201C;owing to the <date when="0000-08-12">12th of August</date>&#x201C; being next day! At Dumfries I found Jane and her Husband, and eldest Daughter!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Aitken.</note> and the Carriage being then cleared of all but myself, and the time longer, we had plenty of talk; and I <hi rend="italic">took tea</hi> with them!!&#x2014; It was the most practically kind thing I ever saw Jane do!

<p>For myself, I am allright today.

<p>My foot, as well as my &#x201C;interior,&#x201C; is benefited by the good night. It was too lame for anything yesterday!

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>I have been meaning to &#x201C;kill two Birds with one stone&#x201C;&#x2014;(an economy of Action which never does succeed with me!) Meaning to repeat my <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi>; still lying quite warm at the heart of me, for your and James&#x2019;s welcome to Dumfries&#x2014;so hearty, and practically beneficent as it was! And at the same time to fix a time for seeing you &#x201C;more in <hi rend="italic">detail</hi>&#x201C; (as the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle.</note> would say). But I must have still a few days, for arranging my further plans, which were best left in abeyance till I had looked about me here, and rested the sprained foot I brought with me from home.</p>
<p>Hitherto it has rained pretty constantly, and I have only <hi rend="italic">once</hi> crossed the threshold,&#x2014;for a short drive between showers yesterday&#x2014; Today it is fair, <hi rend="italic">as yet;</hi> and we are going to Keir.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They visited the Hoggans at Bellevue and the Menzies at Keir Manse; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620815-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-15">15 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note></p>
<p>In a few days, I shall have subsided from the nervousness of finding myself here&#x2014;at the foot of Templand Hill! with so many houses within sight, once occupied by people who belonged to me, or cared for me! and then I shall be <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> forming plans. So far; I merely sit bewildered in presence of my own Past! How long I stay, will depend chiefly on the accounts I get from Cheyne Row. I am in hopes Lady Ashburton will persuade M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to go off with them to the Grange&#x2014;where I could join him on my return. Whether I shall go back <pb id="pg-38-141" n="38:141"/>the road I came, or round by Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Betty Braid, and her aunts Ann, Elizabeth, and Grace Welsh.</note> will depend on answers to letters which I have not yet written!</p>
<p>In a few days, as I have said, I will &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">consider</hi>&#x201C; (like the Piper&#x2019;s Cow) and then tell you whether you will next see me on the way home, or on the way to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;or merely from here, to return here. However to see you and Mary being one of the greatest <hi rend="italic">pleasures</hi> I promised myself in coming to this country, you are safe to have me plump down on you someday.</p>
<p>I will write again &#x201C;whenever I <hi rend="italic">see my way</hi>&#x201C; (to quote again from the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>)&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is the beautifulest House this a reasonable mortal could desire! But Mrs Russell cannot reconcile herself to it&#x2014;is always regretting the tumble-down old rambling House in Thornhill where &#x201C;Papa&#x2019;s room&#x201C; is! &#x201C;The room he died in&#x201C;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x2019;s father, Rev.

<p><salute>Oh my little woman!</salute> how glad I was to recognise your face thro&#x2019; the glass of the carriage window, all dimmed with human breath! And how frightened I was, the train would move, while you were clambering up like a school-boy to kiss me! And how I grudged the long walk there and back for you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruthwell Station was about 2 mi. (3 km.) from The Gill.</note> and the waiting! Still you did well to come! for <hi rend="italic">it</hi> (your coming) quite brightened up my spirits for the last miles of my journey, which are apt to be mortally wearisome!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had meant to wave my handkerchief from the window when we passed The Gill&#x2014;but I found no seat vacant except the middle one&#x2014;and disagreeable women on each side of me closed the windows all but an inch, so to make any demonstration had been impossible! The more my gladness to catch sight of your very face! And Jane and her Husband and Daughter were waiting for me at Dumfries, having heard of my coming from Doctor Carlyle. So &#x201C;the latter end of that woman (meaning me) was better than the beginning&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Eccles. 7:8.</note></p>
<p>D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell was waiting for me,&#x2014;had been waiting more than an hour, like every one else,&#x2014;with his carriage, in which I was conveyed thro&#x2019; ways, <hi rend="italic">happily</hi> for me, clothed in darkness, so that the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> object I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> was M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell at the door of their new home.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-142" n="38:142"/>It is a most beautiful house and place they have made of old Holme Hill! And I do not see Templand from the Windows, as I feared I should!&#x2014; The trees have grown up so high!&#x2014; The first night, I couldnt sleep a bit for agitation of mind&#x2014;far more than fatigue of body! the next night I slept&#x2014;last night again <hi rend="italic">not</hi>! So today I feel rather ghastly!&#x2014; Then it has rained pretty much without intermission! Yesterday we took a very short drive between showers&#x2014;and that was the only time I have crossed the threshold! Besides the bad weather, I brought away with me a recently sprained foot which makes <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> both painful and imprudent&#x2014;</p>
<p>Under these circumstances I have not yet formed any plan for my further travels&#x2014; But shall tell you in a few days whether I will pay you a little visit on the road home, or run down from here, and back again. I will certainly not let that brief meeting stand for all, unless you forbid me to come. But I have all along looked to being guided by circumstances in this journey. My stay to be determined by the accounts I get of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C from himself, and, (still more dependable), from my Housemaid Maria. And my road back, whether as I came, or by Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> to be decided on, when I shall have heard from Lady Stanley and another English friend on the North Western line.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Davenport Bromley lived at Wootton Hall, Staffordshire, and Lady Stanley at Alderley Park, Cheshire; both are in NW England.</note> But I wouldn&#x2019;t leave you wondering what was become of me&#x2014;or if it had been really <hi rend="italic">me</hi> or my Wraith you had seen!</p>
<p>In a few days then you will hear further meanwhile</p>

<p><salute>Yes indeed, Dear!</salute> You may well be &#x201C;afraid of my weather&#x201C;! I have only twice got over the threshold since I came! and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> hurriedly, between showers! I begin to have more sympathy with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2019;s melancholy impressions of her beautiful new home! But I don&#x2019;t weary as yet; the situation has still novelty enough to keep me from wearing. And within doors, it has not been so dull as you might think! The day before yesterday there plumped down to us a little man, on his way home from &#x201C;The Exhibition&#x201C;&#x2014;(can&#x2019;t get rid of <hi rend="italic">the Exhibition</hi> even here; you see!).

<p><salute>My poor <hi rend="italic">drookit</hi> Dear,</salute> what weather for you, all a drowsy lazy <hi rend="italic">soak;</hi> and ours is no better,&#x2014;except that today our rain has grown windy and colder! Along with that of mankind at large and their Harvest, I regret the weather much on your acc<hi rend="italic">t;</hi>&#x2014;and get, myself, only one benefit out of it, Those nice little Letters you write me. Patience; it is &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Lammas Flood,</hi>&#x201C; nothing more; and will probably take up soon.</p>
<p>I am, as usual, in huge hurry; but if I write nothing, you will be sure to fancy something gone wrong.

Jean has been so kind as write to me twice: she is my only source of Scottish news, at least of Annandale.

<p>No letters went from these parts, yesterday, Dear!&#x2014; A place too religious for letter writing on Sundays!&#x2014; And what is much worse so far as I am concerned no letters come here on Sundays&#x2014;have to wait reverently at Carlisle, over Sunday; making two blank London post days in succession!</p>
<p>So if you wrote to me on Saturday, (as I think you would; seeing that next day was Sunday)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were no postal collections or deliveries in many parts of Scotland on Sundays; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590920-JWC-HL-01"><sic>35:210</sic><corr>JWC to HL, <date when="1859-09-20">20 Sept. 1859</date></corr></ref>. JWC implies there were also no collections in London on Sundays.</note> the pleasure is still on the road! and may be here any minute!</p>
<p>But I had best not wait for the somewhat irregular post-boy;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Milligan (b. <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>).</note> having promised Dr Russell to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">ready punctually</hi> at eleven&#x201C; to be driven with all the rest to Glencairn,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glencairn, parish in Upper Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire.</note> where having calls to make, we cannot, he says, be home till dinner-time (four o&#x2019;clock) and the post which takes you a letter at <hi rend="italic">breakfast-time</hi> leaves at five. There is another post leaves at night;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The last post at Thornhill left at 8:30 p.m.</note> but by that you would not get the letter till the following after noon.</p>
<p>So this is just a notekin to explain why you haven&#x2019;t a letter; and to keep you from <hi rend="italic">worritting</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the letters! my gracious! such a many! I have read yours, Mary&#x2019;s Jean&#x2019;s,&#x2014;Miss Cushman&#x2019;s and Miss Bromley&#x2019;s (who I see signs herself &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">die Lerche</hi> [the Lark]&#x2019; and my Aunt Anne&#x2019;s,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Welsh in Edinburgh.</note> I must leave till I have finished with <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> and dressed myself to be ready for D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell, who is as dreadful about being &#x201C;in time&#x201C; as I am myself! Besides all these letters make me feel like die Lerche myself!</p>
<p>Poor Ronca!&#x2014; Hacking helping him to die looks to me the saddest part of it!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-148" n="38:148"/>I like extremely your notion of going to the Grange a week of idleness anywhere but especially <hi rend="italic">there</hi> would do you a world of good.</p>

<p>First: in case of forgetting again. <hi rend="italic">Did</hi> I tell either you or Maria where the key of the wine cellar was?

<p>I was delighted to see Miss Barnet, the other day, again;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bessie Barnet was the da. of a housekeeper to TC&#x2019;s old Birmingham friend John Badams (ca. <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), chemist; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 297&#x2013;99. She was the Carlyles&#x2019; first servant at Cheyne Row, <date when="1834-06-00">June 1834</date>, employed despite rumors that she had been Badams&#x2019;s mistress; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:216&#x2013;17</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> and to find that she had made so valiant a struggle in her difficult situation, and triumphantly <pb id="pg-38-151" n="38:151"/>gained for herself such friends in the world,&#x2014;such a friend, and by noble services done to him and to others!</p>
<p>I have known dear &#x201C;Bessy,&#x201C; as we always called her, since she was a little girl, one of the prettiest cleverest creatures I ever saw; full of ardour, of affection, and every fine quality;&#x2014;but tragically isolated and agitated, when I had seen her last, as a beautiful young woman:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bessie left the Carlyles, <date when="1834-12-00">Dec. 1834</date>, because of her &#x201C;unhappy unwholesome state of mind&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341028-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:330</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-10-28">28 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>); see also <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341023-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:314</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-10-23">23 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I can truly say there has nothing happened to me, for a long time back, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has given me so much pleasure as her sudden reappearance, the other day, on those new terms.</p>
<p>May your marriage be happy, dear Sir and Madam:&#x2014;so far as I can judge w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it, there is every sanction to warrant such a union; and if I have ever known a born Gentlewoman, your intended wife is one.</p>
<p>It will give us much pleasure to see you and her, when matters are all settled on their new basis,&#x2014;when I too (let me hope) may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be in such a whirlpool of confused labour as at present and for a series of years years<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated at turn of page; TC&#x2019;s line above second &#x201C;years.&#x201C;</note>

<salute>Dear Maria</salute>
<p>I want you to write me another nice little letter; which was more to the purpose than any, professing to give an account of matters at home, that I have received since!!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C writes always with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dinner on the table</hi>&#x201C;! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">dinner cooling</hi>&#x201C; and so forth!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC mentioned dinner in his letters to JWC of [<date when="1862-08-13">13 Aug.</date>], [<date when="1862-08-14">14 Aug.</date>], <date when="1862-08-16">17 [16] Aug.</date>, and [<date when="1862-08-19">19 Aug.</date>].</note>&#x2014; It takes away one&#x2019;s breath to read his hurried scraps!</p>
<p>I want to know if he is really better of that horrid blue pill?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620816-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1862-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note> and if he goes to bed not <hi rend="italic">more</hi> irrationally late than usual? You can guess well enough, (being a smart girl!) the sort of things I want to know about!</p>
<p>For <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; I am doing well in all respects except <hi rend="italic">sleep!</hi> I have the most comfortable of bedrooms! quiet too as a tomb! and still, in spite of being so much in the open air, I can seldom close my eyes before four or five in the morning. But nevertheless I feel <hi rend="italic">stronger</hi> and have a better appetite. And every body is so fond of me, and kind to me that I should be a Brute if I wasn&#x2019;t rather happy!</p>
<p>Could you lay your hands on the Haddington newspaper I sent to Elizabeth? <pb id="pg-38-155" n="38:155"/>It had been at Cheyne Row once already, and was redirected here by Mr C, and I, having no leisure to read newspapers in a general way, returned it to Elizabeth; whom it might interest, and as a sign of rem[embrance]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS torn.</note> from myself. Now comes a letter from Miss Welsh at Haddington,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s cousin John Amelia &#x201C;Jackie&#x201C; Welsh.</note> mentioning this newspaper as &#x201C;containing <hi rend="small-caps">more</hi> <hi rend="italic">fun</hi> about myself&#x201C;&#x2014;by which I have confirmed to me what somebody here said the other day, that &#x201C;not one but several &#x201C;articles&#x201C; about my youth and childhood were going the round of all the newspapers!!!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the articles was &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s Courtship,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Haddingtonshire Courier,</hi> <date when="1861-08-15">15 Aug.</date>; it was also printed at least in the <hi rend="italic">Belfast News-Letter</hi> (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1862-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref>) and the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury,</hi> <date when="1861-08-16">16 Aug.</date>; the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> was apparently sent to Chelsea (presumably by one of JWC&#x2019;s Haddington friends [see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591130-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>36:20</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, <date when="1859-11-30">30 Nov. 1859</date></corr></ref>]), directed by TC to Holmhill, and redirected back to Chelsea by JWC. The article concluded: &#x201C;Of Irving&#x2019;s pupil, long since become Mrs T. Carlyle, the last the world has heard occurs&#x201C; in TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling</hi>; the article then quoted John Sterling&#x2019;s reference to JWC&#x2019;s dialogue &#x201C;The Bird and the Watch,&#x201C; sent to Sterling in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370900-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>9:320&#x2013;35</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1837-09-30">30 Sept. 1837</date></corr></ref>, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 11:148): &#x201C;Now that Mrs Oliphant&#x2019;s book informs all men that the authoress of the <hi rend="italic">Watch and Canary Bird</hi> [as Sterling called it] conveyed in her girlish years a profound impression of her genius and accomplishments to two such men as Edward Irving and Thomas Carlyle, may we not respectfully beg that curious readers shall be permitted to hear the tick of the Watch and song of the Canary?&#x201C;</note> Pleasant!&#x2014; Now, if you could send me back that Haddington paper, I should just look to see what the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fun</hi>&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">is!</hi> as probably the reality would annoy me less than my imaginations about it! All this comes of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant&#x2019;s Life of <hi rend="italic">Irving!</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Haddingtonshire Courier,</hi> <date when="1862-07-04">4 July</date>, abridged a review from the <date when="1862-07-00">July</date> number of the <hi rend="italic">Scottish Review</hi> of Oliphant&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Irving;</hi> the unidentified reviewer wrote that Irving was &#x201C;promoted next to be the tutor of Jane Welch, now Mrs Thomas Carlyle, then a little girl, the only daughter and heiress of Dr Welch, a distinguished physician of that town&#x201C;; the reviewer then commented: &#x201C;One who has had the pleasure of meeting with that lady, with her pale and marble beauty, her statuesque figure, the fine disdain dwelling on her rather cynical lip, and her almost queen-like manners, not to speak of her varied accomplishments and powers, can hardly believe that she was once a doll-keeping girl. There have been many rumours as to the subsequent relations of these parties&#x2014;sweethearts it is generally understood they became&#x2014;but a married couple never.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now good by! Ask for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Parson and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Royston<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Parsons, carpenter (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530922-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:275</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-09-22">22 Sept. 1853</date></corr></ref>).

<p>There! That is something like a letter! And I feel my good humour restored.</p>
<p>Nothing in this Bessy-Barnet Romance surprises me so much, as the cool manner in which you seem to have taken the fact of her being alive! I at this distance <hi rend="italic">screamed</hi> to hear of her being <hi rend="italic">alive!</hi> And you&#x2014;having a &#x201C;Bessy&#x201C; announced to you, calm[l]y ask was it Bessy Barnet&#x2014;! after she had been dead and buried (according to Tom Holcroft) for a quarter of a century!</p>
<p>I do hope she wont be gone when I return! Mercy of Heaven! If I had met her at Folkestone<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC presumably told JWC in the missing letter of <date when="1862-08-18">18</date> or <date when="1862-08-19">19 Aug.</date> that Bessy lived in Folkestone, where JWC visited for about 10 days from <date when="1862-06-29">29 June</date>.</note> and she had spoken to me! what a fright I should have got!</p>
<p>We spent yesterday in an excursion to Burnfoot dining with the Miss Wighams (formerly of Allington).<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allanton, an estate in Dunscore parish, formerly owned by the Misses Whighams&#x2019; father, George Whigham (d. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>); see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321017-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:245</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-10-17">17 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> I haven&#x2019;t seen any such perfectly beautiful scenery as that betwixt here and Sanquhar, since I used to ride there on a wee pony beside my Grandfather Walter&#x2014;when he took me by new paths &#x201C;to va-arry the <hi rend="italic">schene</hi> Miss&#x201C;!

For I was <hi rend="italic">obliged:</hi> the Printers clamorous (&#x201C;idle till you send us <hi rend="italic">some proofs</hi>&#x201C;);&#x2014;and the botheration of dirty wretches calling upon me (mostly dirty, not <hi rend="italic">all</hi>) has been great and aggravating.

<p><salute>&#x201C;Snapish&#x201C; or not my Dear;</salute> it seems to have answered the end in view; and that, it strikes me, is the highest merit of a letter! With <hi rend="italic">your</hi> two little <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> in succession, and Maria&#x2019;s long one, full of interesting details, I am pretty well up in the <hi rend="italic">vie priv&#xE9;e</hi> [private life] of 5 Cheyne Row at present! Please tell Maria I was greatly obliged by her immediate attention to my request, and her excellent fulfilment of it;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Maria Chamberlayne wrote about TC&#x2019;s health and sent the <hi rend="italic">Had-ding-ton-shire Courier</hi> as requested in <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620821-JWC-MC-01">JWC to MC, [<date when="1862-08-21">21 Aug.</date>]</ref>. This may well be the letter, signed &#x201C;MI. &#x201C; that Froude published an extract from: &#x201C;I hope you do not think of returning home. Should Mr. Carlyle become rampageous I will set Mrs. &#x2014; on to pray for him. Should you, during your absence, require any transaction in London to be carried out with more than usual intelligence and finesse, remember &#x2F; MI&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:250).</note> and that I will write to her, &#x201C;all to herself,&#x201C; when I have &#x201C;seen M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Braid&#x201C; Dear old Betty! she has &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">nited</hi>&#x201C; me &#x201C;a pair of <hi rend="italic">st</hi>o<hi rend="italic">kins</hi>&#x201C;; and won&#x2019;t she be glad when I come and take them! I am afraid <hi rend="italic">she</hi> goes for more in my purpose to take Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in my way&#x2014;or rather, out of my way&#x2014;than my aunts!&#x2014; At the same time, as <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were going to be much hurt had I gone back without seeing them; and as Elizabeth has been &#x201C;very frail indeed&#x201C; of late; and as after all they are my Fathers Sisters, and my only near relatives in the world now; I should have <hi rend="italic">oughted</hi> to go whether there had been a dear old Betty in the case or not! I shall not put off time there however&#x2014;shall write to the Auchtertool people<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s cousins Walter, Maggie, and Mary Welsh, living at Auchtertool Manse in Fife.</note> to come over and see me, instead of, (as Betty used to say) &#x201C;tashing myself aboot, back and forrit ow&#x2019;r that fell water&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Firth of Forth, separating Edinburgh from Fife.</note></p>
<p>As for your suggestion about the journey; It wasn&#x2019;t without due consideration and consultation, that I agreed to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russells plan. Certainly it would have been best to go on from Scotsbrig; had trains been like Omnibuses passing every half hour or so, and setting one down where one liked. But <pb id="pg-38-162" n="38:162"/>there are just <hi rend="italic">two</hi> trains in the day; stopping at Elvin foot.&#x2014;not at all at Crawford. one twenty minutes after ten in the morning the other twenty minutes after five in the afternoon. So I must have been set down, with my luggage, at <hi rend="italic">Elvinfoot,</hi> exciting observation, and brought into contact with the Inn people;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Elvanfoot inn was owned by Alexander Cranston (b. ca. <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>).</note> and obliged to stay about there <hi rend="italic">the whole day alone&#x2014;</hi>stared at&#x2014;and very miserable! and suppose it were a pouring wet day! one can never tell in the morning just now what the day will turn to before night!</p>
<p>Then I get thro&#x2019; my Annandale visits so much more easily for myself and &#x201C;others,&#x201C; with no luggage, but my night things, in my carriage bag!

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>You have been very kind, in regard to Jane, and in the matter of writing; for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I need not utter my thanks in speech. I heard yesterday of you and y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> visitors; the Dr did not tell me, probably did not know, whether Jane was to <hi rend="italic">leave</hi> The Gill on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day for Scotsbrig, or wait till tomorrow.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

Mrs Russell &#x26; she have had little excursions almost every fair day. &#x2026; The weather today is warm &#x26; genial &#x2026; very favourable for going on to Gill, as Jane means to do by the evening train.&#x201C;</note> I guess she will be in some degree of hurry northward and then homeward; but hope [not]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> rapid.</p>

<p>The inclosed Letter will not amuse you, or the Dr to whom you are to give it.

The foundation stone was laid <date when="1861-06-24">24 June 1861</date>; in <date when="1861-08-00">Aug. 1861</date> Rogers organized a &#x201C;Supplemental Committee&#x201C; to raise further funds for a statue of Wallace on the monument (Rogers, <hi rend="italic">Leaves</hi> 185). The monument was completed in <date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>.

<p>We have East-wind here, occasionally with hot Sun; very good harvest-weather. But the harvest itself, there can be no doubt, will be bad.

<salute>Dear,</salute>
<p>Your letter, written on Sunday night, reached me yesterday morning (Tuesday) just before I started; and was read, &#x201C;with the same relish,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:331</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> on my way to the station. At Dumfries I read also a later letter from you (to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C). Then; I had been still further favoured with a note from Woolner, to tell me you &#x201C;seemed to be thriving so remarkably well, delivered from the cares of a wife; that, if I were considerate, I would stay away a long time &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x201C; So all is right on the Chelsea side.</p>
<p>It was a very confused and confusing day at Dumfries; the chief ingredient being the <hi rend="italic">D</hi>r! going back in the evening to poor Arbuckle&#x2019;s funeral.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p>The only collected act of volition I accomplished was a call on poor Miss Willie Richardson; in spite of her being represented to me, as &#x201C;insane, and a monster of fat&#x2014;the eyes invisible in her head!&#x201D;&#x2014;mad or not&#x2014;overfat or not, I thought it was right to show her the respect of calling for her; considering the kindness of her Mother<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilhelmina (Willie) Richardson and her mother, Catherine Eliza Richardson, whom the Carlyles knew in the late <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>s when at Craigenputtoch.</note> to you and me when we were less &#x201C;celebrated&#x201C;!

She opened the door to us herself&#x2014;her one domestic, a small girl,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.

Jeanie Welsh! <hi rend="italic">that my dear Mother was so fond of!</hi>) quite brought tears to my eyes!&#x2014; So far from being &#x201C;a monster&#x201C; she is a handsomer woman <hi rend="italic">now</hi> than she was as a young Lady. very like her Mother in both appearance and manners, and in wellbred kindliness.

To tell you a melancholy fact, I have been having horrible nights ever since I left home! only <hi rend="italic">two</hi> nights out of the fortnight that I have closed my eyes before 4 in the morning! in spite of the quietest of bedrooms, the wholesomest of diet, and constant exercise in the open air!

<p>Your letter has just reached me here!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC and Cushman were corresponding regularly, although few of their letters survive.</note> I have a bad habit&#x2014;I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it is a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> one&#x2014;of putting off writing to those I love, till there comes an hour when I can do it with all the concentration of heart, and all the stillness of outward things, which they seem entitled to&#x2014;and so all in wishing to express myself in the <pb id="pg-38-171" n="38:171"/>worthiest manner; I keep a silence which looks, at least, ungracious. I must try to break myself of this! were it only for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> dear sake!</p>
<p>Here is my first effort toward a better system! I have the daily letter to my Husband still to write&#x2014;several letters which may be called &#x201C;of business&#x201C;&#x2014;letters about my goings and my <hi rend="italic">trains</hi> &#x26;c&#x2014;am &#x201C;surrounded by a&#x201C; sister-in-law or <hi rend="italic">two!</hi>&#x2014;have a twelve-mile drive in a gig to execute&#x2014;had next to no sleep last night&#x2014;nor any nights this fortnight back!&#x2014;am busy, am wearied, amd<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, in error for &#x201C;am.&#x201C;</note> worried, am delirious, am <hi rend="italic">on</hi> my travels&#x2014;and amidst all this I write!&#x2014; but <hi rend="italic">well</hi> or <hi rend="italic">much</hi> you see clearly, Dear, is impossible!</p>
<p>When I told Stauros<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stauros Dilberoglue.</note> I was preparing for Edinbr, it was an <hi rend="small-caps">elliptical</hi> expression. I had several visits to pay <hi rend="italic">on the road</hi> there. did not expect to arrive there till the end of this week. And now, I am going back to Thornhill to make a fresh start for Edin<hi rend="italic">r, thence,</hi> next Monday!

<p>I had hoped to avoid going to Edinr. but my three Aunts there were going to find &#x201C;such conduct <hi rend="italic">very</hi> strange&#x201C;&#x2014;and after all they are my Fathers sisters tho&#x2019; little like him, and the only near relatives I have in the world; and one of them has been &#x201C;getting very frail&#x201C;&#x2014; Clearly it was my <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> to go on&#x2014;and there is a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>&#x2014;not much&#x2014;but a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> satisfaction in the discharge of one&#x2019;s duty!</p>
<p>Meanwhile the floods of sad and rather wild emotion that have been pouring thro&#x2019; this excitable heart of mine have ruined my sleep&#x2014;utterly&#x2014;and I am grown nervous, cowardly and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">horrid badly</hi>&#x201C; (in the dialect of these Parts)  I wish I were safe home again!</p>

<p>You must put up with an infinitessimal note today dear!</p>
<p>I have had to <hi rend="italic">compose</hi> a letter to Miss Bromley which has taken about all the writing faculty out of me for this morning! and Jane<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken.</note> is coming up the road at this moment to spend the day! and I have had <hi rend="italic">nothink</hi> from Chelsea today, to inspire me (of course you couldnt forsee I should be still <hi rend="italic">here</hi>), and tho&#x2019; I did get a fair <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of sleep last night thank goodness! it wasn&#x2019;t sleep of a very refreshing sort&#x2014;and I feel today, to tell the truth &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">badly</hi>&#x201C;!</p>
<p>So I made up my mind &#x201C;in a moment of enthusiasm&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> to have nothing to do <pb id="pg-38-173" n="38:173"/>with Wooton Hall, for <hi rend="italic">only a day</hi>, and at a mad cost of fatigue and nervous excitement; the journey occupying from ten in the morning (from Edn<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) to nine at night to Alton)!!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alton, Staffordshire, the nearest railway stn. to Wootton Hall.</note> and only to be accomplished by a change of trains&#x2014; A Lady at Ceppnoch<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Elizabeth Gladstone of Capenoch; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620819-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-19">19 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> who understands Bradshaw as well as I do, what shall I say? <hi rend="italic">George Sand!</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Sand, pseud. of Amandine Aurore Lucile Dudevant, b.

<p><salute>Dear Goody of my life,</salute> I hope you have got safe to Thornhill again; and got a little instalment of <hi rend="italic">better</hi> sleep, and rest to your poor nerves before Edin<hi rend="italic">r!</hi> But I was thankful abundantly to hear this morning of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> considerable tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> sleep at The Gill;&#x2014;any considerable sleep must have left you badly next day. I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have expected you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like Caerlaverock to such a degree: the &#x201C;fin<hi rend="italic">est</hi> ruin&#x201C;; ah, by no means,&#x2014;but there are memories connected.

I hope we shall have better news soon.</p>
<p>You are wise, surely, not to think of the &#x201C;Lark,&#x201C; on those terms; but to plunge home by a <hi rend="italic">coup-de-main</hi> [direct assault],&#x2014;if there is to be plunging, and forced-marching, at all. I counted that with Scotsbrig for a stage from Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and one not very long ride <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> Manchester, you might have done it, and made good the circuit by a rest at Wooton amid Lark-music better or worse: but a whole day of it,&#x2014;oh, no! no!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I slept too little (<hi rend="italic">till</hi> after six, how<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">know</hi> what ails me) last night and this morning:&#x2014;and am not worth my salt (at those cramp Proofs, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have fallen quite perverse at the wrong moment): I at one time tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of rushing off to Fetter Lane (to <hi rend="italic">scold the Printer,</hi> and get a little exercise): I contin<hi rend="italic">d</hi> however; &#x26; all that I have done is to take <hi rend="italic">a bigger sheet</hi> for Goody,&#x2014;and scribble it full of nothing at all.

Only, when it came to arranging about another drive; I had to own myself afraid of the exposure. &#x2014; But it had <pb id="pg-38-176" n="38:176"/>been settled the previous night that we were to drive to Margaret&#x2019;s,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin&#x2019;s da.

And just then the sun burst out into a perfect glory! and I thought perhaps the drive, after all, with sufficient wrapping, might improve my spirits at least; and we went, and I came in better rather than worse for it; took more porridge and milk; went to bed at eleven; and actually slept&#x2014;off and on&#x2014;till seven; and now, having breakfasted, I find myself with a sound throat, calmed nerves, and spirits up to the occasion!</p>

<p>There will be no time for writing tomorrow, Dear; so I shall write a few lines <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, and leave them to be put in before post-time tomorrow: the very <hi rend="italic">slit</hi> being closed,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The post box opening.</note> for the better observance of Sunday!</p>
<p>You would see, or might have seen, by the postmark on my Friday&#x2019;s letter, that I had got to Thornhill. At the Dumfries Station, I had appointed Jane to meet me; rather than be stopping between trains in Dumfries again; and she came, attended by James Aitken and the Dr, and from the last I received your note (to Scotsbrig) which had been forwarded by Jamie that morning to <hi rend="italic">him!</hi> Jenny was said to be rather better. The letter addressed here awaited me, and was the best possible welcome.</p>
<p>One of the letters you had inclosed was from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Tomline to announce the game &#x201C;that in case of my being from home I might perhaps wish to give orders that it should be given away&#x201C;&#x2014; In such uncertainty, people should really pay the carriage of the game they fire off at one!&#x2014; The other letter was from Louisa Baring asking me to &#x201C;fulfil my promise&#x201C; and come to her on the <date when="1862-09-08">8</date><hi rend="italic">th!</hi> Don&#x2019;t she wish she may get me!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550511-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:307</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-05-11">11 May 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">She</hi> says Lady A is returned home! and Mrs Tomline says she had had a letter from Lady A, two days before, inviting them to go to her!!&#x2014; I was going to add; &#x201C;how are these accounts to be reconciled&#x2014;and in the act of writing, the explanation flashes on me!&#x2014; The invitation wouldn&#x2019;t be to <hi rend="italic">Brahan</hi> as I had taken it from preliminary words about Brahan, but to the Grange!&#x2014; Have you seen them, then? or heard from them? <hi rend="italic">She</hi> has never written a word of answer to my <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> last letters.</p>
<p>Oh! so long as I remember it!&#x2014;please send me an autograph that Mrs Russell wants for a Lady<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014; It would come straighter addressed to herself&#x2014;but if you dont like inclosing it in a blank cover, and at the same time dont like to write a line with it, just send it to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at Morningside.</p>
<p>I have been <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> better at sleeping since my return from the Gill; and the &#x201C;Chill&#x201C; passed off without &#x201C;consequences&#x201C;!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>&#x2014;It is long since I began to hope some Note from The Grange, or Brahan, might drop into my mouth, with some notice how you were. I fancy you to be at The Grange, all this while, but have no certainty; and as to health &#x26;c, of you and the Tiny Jewel<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; da., Mary Florence Baring.</note> there or elsewhere, I have no hint whatever, nor can get any in this empty state of the Town. My Lady, from Brahan, sent me a pretty Note,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton wrote to TC, <date when="1862-08-09">9 Aug.</date>, from Brahan: &#x201C;Eternity seems so near&#x2014;&#x26; the world so far away&#x2014;&#x26; the world can Never be the same again to me, once her great Love has left it&#x2014;it <hi rend="italic">already</hi> seems to me colder, &#x26; more desolate&#x2014;for she is more in another world already than in this&#x2014;I cannot tell you the sadness &#x26; agony of this time&#x2014;this taking the last look on everything&#x2014;which has been hitherto part of one&#x2019;s Life&#x2014; I wish you had known her, you would have loved <hi rend="italic">me</hi> better, for having known <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014;I always see you now with <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a look of misery as there was on your face for some minutes the last night you dined at Bath Ho. Your thoughts had gone far away, to something that made you utterly sad&#x2014;&#x26; they kept you there&#x2014; Do you know that look has haunted me? I wondered if the Wife saw it. Give her my kindest love.&#x201C;</note> but nothing on those points; I have always been (very impudently) hoping she might send me something more,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I never had the heart to <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> anything, or intrude upon her sacred sorrows <pb id="pg-38-183" n="38:183"/>yonder;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s mother, Mary Stewart-Mackenzie, was dying.</note> and know not now whether she is yonder or not.

<p>I have been steady here in my garret, very busy with <hi rend="italic">Proofs</hi> &#x26;c; companion-less as sparrow on the House Top;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

In 8 or 9 months I may be over the head of that too,&#x2014;if my poor old sinews will still hold out.

However, Napoleon III (Louis Napoleon [<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">73</date>]), emperor of France from <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, stationed French troops in Rome to guarantee the Papal States&#x2019; independence from Italy, and the Italian government was unwilling to intervene. On <date when="1862-08-28">28 Aug.</date> Garibaldi and his troops were surrounded by government troops at Aspromonte, S Italy; he ordered his men not to fire against fellow Italians, and was himself shot in the thigh and left foot. After a brief imprisonment, Garibaldi was permitted to return to his home on the island of Caprera.</note> Mazzini will be thankful&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> must have reached Garibaldi; it is to be hoped <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is not taken also&#x2014;but he went with his eyes perfectly open to the madness<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini opposed Garibaldi&#x2019;s plan and instead recommended an expedition to liberate Venice. He predicted that &#x201C;if Garibaldi has to choose between two proposals, he is sure to accept the one that isn&#x2019;t mine,&#x201C; but he collected funds from English friends in support of Garibaldi and left London, <date when="1862-08-25">25 Aug.</date>, to join him (Bolton King, <hi rend="italic">Mazzini</hi> [<date when="1902-00-00">1902</date>] 201&#x2013;2).

That feeling is decidedly mine, and if I have done something towards it I feel partially responsible and bound to share in its palpable embodiment. &#x2026; I go sadly: I do not feel fit for any task; neither morally nor physically.

Had I <hi rend="italic">known</hi> the Morphine issue, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have wanted nothing. Take all pains you possibly can to be <hi rend="italic">canny,</hi> to be quiet and <hi rend="italic">well,</hi> what we have to call &#x201C;well.&#x201C; Do not even predict when you are coming, till once you handily can. To me, to the inner man of me especially (for the Lasses are really careful ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the outward), it will be &#x201C;the sooner the welcomer&#x201C;: but, in all points, I wish you to follow what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find likeliest for being pleasant and profitable.</p>
<p>There has nothing come from The Grange yet; nor need it hurry. We can have a &#x201C;week of country&#x201C; on our own basis well enough: or indeed, avoiding that horror of jumbling and squealing &#x26; of having oneself driven mad by railway tumult more or less,&#x2014;7 idle days <hi rend="italic">in the Town</hi> (Exhibit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Pictures &#x26;c &#x26;c) might do almost &#x201C;quite as well&#x201C; (in Darwinian<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Erasmus Darwin.</note> phrase)! I have still ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 7 Proof slips to do (very bad ones, mostly), then I am free for <hi rend="italic">Rus</hi> [country] or <hi rend="italic">Urbs</hi> [town].</p>
<p>Nothing has happened, nothing at all. Woolner came, and wasted one of my nights (monday, I think); Fritz galloped me yesterday on Wimbledon,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wimbledon Common.</note>&#x2014;it <pb id="pg-38-190" n="38:190"/>is now darkish by the time I get home: dinner will have to <hi rend="italic">change</hi> again before long.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to write again, in those terms. It was only yesterday I heard by accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that you were back from Brahan,&#x2014;leaving things in better posture there than you found them,&#x2014;and that L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. was very well. Let us be thankful, thankful!</p>
<p>There is no doubt but a few days of The Grange in this bright weather w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do me a great deal of good! Or even in the worst weather, with green fields, <pb id="pg-38-191" n="38:191"/>free air and kindly quiet round one; and honest Forest-trees for company (were there nothing better), instead of street Cabs, and a <hi rend="italic">Canaille</hi> [rabble] of Exhibitioners,&#x2014;worse luck to them! &#x201C;A great deal of good&#x201C;:&#x2014;and it is equally certain that I mean, and have been meaning, positively <hi rend="italic">to try.</hi> And in a very short time now, since I hear that it suits.</p>
<p>Tomorrow or on the instant I cannot quite come;&#x2014;but almost. I am on the fag-end of a sad mass of litter; and will now work with double diligence: I will try hard agt <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> next; not sooner, I fear; but <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> if it prove possible. My Train is always that orthodox old-established one wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> leaves this ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1 p.m. and lands one at The Grange for Tea or sooner. If you hear nothing more, I may be expected on Tuesday:&#x2014;alas, my rubbish is capricious in quality, and cannot quite be counted on; but I will do my very best; and surely I am anxious enough to come!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Wife, you perhaps know, is still in Scotland; at Edinbr, perhaps across to Fife, seeing cousins;&#x2014;and does not fix a day for returning. It will serve her right (and indeed be very welcome to her, I know) to find me at The Grange instead of here.</p>
<p>Addiscombe Carrier,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> punctual as the moon, has just come; brings me such butter, such cream,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I take all to myself, while housekeeping in single capacity! Thanks to some people.&#x2014; &#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> this cannot reach you till Saturday; tho&#x2019; I did not quite, at starting.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks Dear!</salute> Here is a nice little letter this morning, which has had the double effect of satisfying my anxieties, and delivering me from &#x201C;Prayers.&#x201C; I ran up to my room with it, and shut myself in, and when I issued forth again <hi rend="italic">Prayers</hi> were well over!! What luck!&#x2014; My Aunts are as kind to me as they can be, all three of them, and they exert themselves, beyond their strength, I can see, to make my visit pleasant to me; but still I am like a fish out of water in this element of religiosity;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At times, JWC found her aunts&#x2019; religiosity irritating; cf. 31:188 and 33:38.</note> or rather, like a human being <hi rend="small-caps">in</hi> water&#x2014;and the water hot!</p>
<p>I am glad you have heard from &#x2018;my Lady&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton. In his letter to JWC, <date when="1862-09-04">4 Sept.</date>, TC had not yet heard from the Ashburtons; but since he heard from Lady Ashburton the same day (see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620904-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LLA</corr>, <date when="1862-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref>), he presumably inserted her letter into the envelope with <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620904-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1862-09-04">4 Sept.</date></ref></note> at last. I was beginning to not understand it! to fear either you or I must have in some way displeased her! If you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> bring yourself to go to the Grange at once!

<p>I find I cannot get off from Auchtertool.

<p><salute>Dear Goody</salute> is perhaps on the sea at this very moment,&#x2014;and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have a calmer day (if Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> weather is like London) for returning to Morningside. It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been shocking not to see poor Walter &#x26;c, so kind and faithful always:&#x2014;but if it have done you <hi rend="italic">ill,</hi> I think that voyage sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> suffice for <hi rend="italic">extras</hi> of the kind, at present.</p>
<p>My Grange Expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> cannot by any means be Tomorrow, as one fixed! Not only is the rubbish not done (tho&#x2019; near it), but the bowels have risen in insurrection; rose suddenly, Friday afternoon (<hi rend="italic">peuple Fran&#x26;ccedil;ais debout contre <pb id="pg-38-199" n="38:199"/>les tyrans</hi> [the French people risen against the tyrants]),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi> 4:191.</note>&#x2014;and I must say, had every reason!

So I tell you they broke out (I<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s error for &#x201C;a.&#x201C;</note> tight ride home for it, I had, but did manage!) &#x2014;and they have been going for three nights and days now, at a rate wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> absolutely makes me <hi rend="italic">laugh.</hi> For there is no pain or sickness in it, or next to none,&#x2014;wholesome &#x201C;British cholera&#x201C; fit for the Season, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I expect real good from;&#x2014;but there is an <hi rend="italic">incessancy</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">small</hi> way, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is quite marvellous! Saturday I rode with caution, in the Park only; yesterday I did not ride at all (nor walk, except a few steps); but was very diligent with Proofsheets (and very successful, feeling really in better spirits, better appetite &#x26;c almost than usual); however, at midnight I had decided on sending for Barnes if there were no improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this morning. But there <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> beyond question,&#x2014;probably owing in part to a strong &#x26; hot tumbler of punch last night; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I mean to <hi rend="italic">repeat</hi> so long as needful or remedial. And so I have put off Lady A.; and think perhaps you will be home before I can set another day for her.</p>
<p>And this is my whole History; for I have seen nobody (nobody, I think, at all); and have done or suffered nothing, except in battle with refractory Proof-rubbish; battle <hi rend="italic">more</hi> successful than usual, as I said, and now I trust within one day almost (<hi rend="italic">say</hi> 2!) of being <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> Neuberg&#x2019;s beautiful &#x201C;lark&#x201C; you will find proposed in his Note.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg perhaps suggested some jaunt.</note> I had asked Jamie Aitken for Sunday night to neutralise him; even he did not come: nothing but two clear candles, and a clear little fire, with work before me (in moderation), and Books if I had needed them.

<p><salute>So long as I am in Scotland, my Darling,</salute> I cannot help feeling that my head quarters is Holme-Hill! tho&#x2019; I go buzzing here and there, like a &#x201C;Bum-bee,&#x201C; in the neighbourhood of <hi rend="italic">its hive!</hi>&#x2014; Everywhere that I go, I am warmly welcomed and made much of; but nowhere that I go, do I feel so <hi rend="italic">at home,</hi> in an element so congenial to me as with you and the D<hi rend="italic">r!</hi>&#x2014; At Craigenvilla; tho&#x2019; treated as a niece, and perhaps even a favourite niece, I am always reacting against the self-assumption and the <hi rend="italic">religiosity</hi> (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> the <hi rend="italic">religion,</hi> mind!); and <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> tho&#x2019; I am &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cousin,</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;their <hi rend="italic">one</hi> cousin&#x2014;for whom their naturally hospitable and kindly natures are doubly hospitable and kindly; still I miss that congeniality which comes of having mutually <hi rend="italic">suffered,</hi> and taken one&#x2019;s sufferings to heart! I feel here as if I were &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">playing</hi>&#x2019; with nice, pretty-behaved <hi rend="italic">children!</hi> I almost envy them their lighthearted capacity of being engrossed with trifles!

<p>And after all my haste&#x2014;at least haste <hi rend="italic">since leaving Holme Hill</hi>&#x2014;the chances are I shall find M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C just gone to The Grange.

<p>Dont he wish he may get me? He will have to stay considerably longer than the &#x201C;one week&#x201C; he talks of, before I shall feel disposed to take the road again!

<p><salute>Oh my Dear!</salute> Here am I just arrived from Auchtertool and find your letter&#x2014;and Betty!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note>&#x2014;and &#x201C;dinner to be ready in a few minutes Jeanie&#x201C;! And I am all upset with the sailing; and vexed about your bowels; and hurried and flurried; and the post will be leaving Morningside by the time dinner is well over  And so&#x2014;no letter is possible in return for your long nice one; nice if the news about yourself weren&#x2019;t bad.</p>
<p>I was meaning to stay <hi rend="italic">over</hi> tomorrow to rest from the bother of todays journey. But I can&#x2019;t stay in any comfort with the notion tormenting me that you are perhaps needing some thing to stop that bowel-complaint and are putting off sending for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Barnes.</p>
<p>So I shall start tomorrow night, and hope to reach home about the time Elizabeth came<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles&#x2019; maid, who came from Haddington to Cheyne Row mid-<date when="1862-06-00">June</date>; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620622-JWC-IES-01">JWC to IES, [ca. <date when="1862-06-22">22 June</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;between ten and eleven I think.</p>
<p>For Mercy&#x2019;s Sake dont be either coming or sending to meet me! I really transact my railway business <hi rend="italic">far best</hi> with nobody to trust to but myself!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The visit to Auchtertool has been successful on the whole&#x2014;good sleep and &#x201C;nourishing diet&#x201C;; but it was probably just as well that I made my head quarters elsewhere.</p>
<p>And I don&#x2019;t feel as if that place could ever be a home for me again! at least never, so long as <hi rend="italic">both</hi> Maggie and Mary are there to receive me! As soon go to live in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Happy Family</hi>&#x201C; at Trafalgar Square,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Happy Family</hi>&#x201C; was the name given to a collection of small animals (including cats, mice, rabbits, owls, pigeons, and hawks), kept in a cage in Trafalgar Sq., all supposedly living together in harmony; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610415-JWC-WDO-01"><sic>37:150</sic><corr>JWC to WDO, <date when="1861-04-15">15 April 1861</date></corr></ref>.</note> only &#x201C;kept from <hi rend="italic">fighting</hi> by having their crops full Sir&#x201C;!

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>This is a great disappointment indeed! I had calculated on having one complete week of holiday and interval, after finishing out the last tag-rags of &#x201C;Vol IV,&#x201C; and flinging <hi rend="italic">it</hi> off from me forevermore,&#x2014;one bright week, in the <pb id="pg-38-207" n="38:207"/>pleasantest place I know in the world, and with the best friends I have now left in the world:&#x2014;my bit of disorder is over, or as good as over; my rubbish is all fairly done; I expect my wife home tonight; and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> most probably have written tomorrow, appointing <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi> as the first day of my sacred week,&#x2014;the very day on wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you are to take wing. In this way we poor mortals go hopping and hoping after one another, to very little purpose oftenest!</p>
<p>I am to have my holiday at any rate, from practical considerations; but I must now spend it here, in sauntering about, riding out to Henry Taylor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor, who lived in East Sheen, SW London.</note> (whom I have not seen for above a year), trying for a sight of &#x201C;the Pictures&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The fine art collections at the International Exhibition were of the English school of oil painting (<date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), English watercolors, sculpture, engraving, architecture, and foreign schools of painting; see Francis Turner Palgrave, <hi rend="italic">Handbook of the Fine Art Collections of <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date></hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>).</note> (in that blessed Exhibitn Edifice),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The International Exhibition was housed in a purpose-built structure designed by Francis Fowke (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10002"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), which consisted of a central building ornamented with two gigantic glass domes and two adjoining annexes; it was mostly demolished in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>.</note>&#x2014;and otherwise sucking my paws, after the fashion of bears who are idle, in these dusty purlieus, instead of at The Grange beside you both.</p>
<p>If you pass thro&#x2019; Town on Monday on y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> new route, and will give me notice, I shall have the pleasure of a transient interview, if punctual attendance at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hour (<hi rend="italic">barring</hi> accidents always!) will yield it me;&#x2014;no better item in my Holiday will turn up.</p>
<p>If you do go to Nice<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons rented the Villa Jaune in Nice for the winter; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 89&#x2013;90.</note> for the Winter, it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> go hard with me but I will see you before going! But there will be no &#x201C;Holiday&#x201C; afoot then; nothing but the old gin-horse, tugging in his old harness then, earnestly struggling and hoping to get <hi rend="italic">in</hi> before he die. Perhaps L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> will still <hi rend="italic">relent</hi> to The Grange? I cannot pretend to the least faculty of counsel;&#x2014;and pray only, for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> sake, and my own, that you may be guided to the plan wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is <hi rend="italic">best.</hi> Adieu for today,</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;Thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter and the glimpses you give us of Scotsbrig, Craigenp<hi rend="italic">h</hi> &#x26;c. I am glad to hear that Jenny is at The Gill: Jane had <pb id="pg-38-208" n="38:208"/>heard from questioning Mary that the poor little Jenny was fallen quite &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">irregular</hi> in her <hi rend="italic">times</hi>&#x201C; (for six months past);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny Carlyle&#x2019;s condition was more than physical. John A. Carlyle wrote to her older brother James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1862-09-12">12 Sept.</date>, that he had gone to The Gill and found her &#x201C;much better&#x201C;: &#x201C;The disease she had at Scotsbrig was mumps at first, &#x26; mismanagement of diet &#x26;c. confined her to bed &#x26; made her much worse than she would otherwise have been. &#x2026; One cause of languor &#x26; tending to illness lies in the discouragement she must feel from never having got things in the house at Scotsbrig put into any order resembling what her Mother used to keep; &#x26; yet she seems quite capable of accomplishing that if she were duly seconded by your Father &#x26; John [the brother living at Scotsbrig]; &#x26; would find the greatest comfort in it if it were done &#x26; kept done. I spoke to your Father on the subject &#x26; he will try what he can. &#x2026; To Jenny herself I found difficulty in doing any thing farther than merely hinting at the defect &#x26; its remedy. She is very good &#x26; affectionate, &#x26; had an excellent training; but has hitherto been too young for managing servants effectively, &#x26; seems to have had no assistance of a steady sort from anybody, &#x26; she is very thin-skinned and sensitive&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a very serious matter for y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> women;&#x2014;a good lass of ours had to quit, last year, on that acc<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and seemed to be almost dying: but is now recovered into bloom again, by &#x201C;change to the Country.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Piggott; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620828-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-28">28 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">Change,</hi> it seems, is what they recommend as the very first likely measure.

<p>As for me, here I am still; and am like to be! I had settled Tuesday last for The Grange; and was busy getting ready, shoving Proofs aside at my swiftest, when,&#x2014;on the Friday&#x2019;s ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> ride, there arose a <hi rend="italic">mutiny</hi> in the interior man (you will understand of what kind), and I had to make <hi rend="italic">rapidly</hi> for home! This lasted over Sunday, so that on Monday I had to write &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Wait</hi> for me, please!&#x201D; On Monday the affair seemed over (<hi rend="italic">fash</hi>ous [vexatious] and ridiculous, I reckoned it, and even beneficial rather than dangerous); but on Monday, by mismanage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it on again, &#x26; it did not fairly go till Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> morning; and just then arrived a regretful message from the Grange Lady, &#x201C;We are <hi rend="italic">for Devonshire</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly to visit Sir Walter and Lady Pauline Trevelyan, who had a house at Seaton, Devonshire.</note> (called thither) on Monday&#x201C; (i.e. day after tomorrow), &#x201C;and going to Nice for the winter!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014; Very well, very well; my Proofs were all comfortably done; I had determined on my &#x201C;8 days of complete holiday&#x201C;;&#x2014;and I am having it <hi rend="italic">here,</hi> and will have! Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may probably be quite as well. No more today.

<p><salute>Dear Owen,</salute>&#x2014;I hope you will get y<hi rend="italic">r Museum</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard Owen was superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum from <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>, and came to believe that the natural sciences needed a publicly funded museum of their own.</note> I am, for my own share, no great judge of such matters; and have never myself been able to do much good in Museums: but it seems to me that a Nation ready to spend any amount of millions on any foolery that turns up, really might as well take counsel of its Chief Naturalist, and build such a Museum as will satisfy him, while its hand is in!</p>
<p>I read y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> little Book,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owen&#x2019;s recently published <hi rend="italic">On the Extent and Aims of a National Museum of Natural History</hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), a plea to the general public to support a dedicated museum. The book discussed both the contents and the structure of the proposed building in S. Kensington, complete with plans and measurements. As a result of political and scientific rivalry, his scheme was not approved until the early <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>s and officially opened <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>.</note> with intelligence more or less complete, and always with pleasure in proportion to my clearness. But what interested me more than the Museum Question was certain characteristics, brief, incidental, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> started up here and there,&#x2014;characteristics of the now <hi rend="italic">Pleader</hi> for such a Museum. For instance, that of the winged gentlewoman (in New Holland, I think) who gathers rotten leaves &#x26; fermenting substances, to do her <hi rend="italic">hatching</hi> for her,&#x2014;and how she fared in the Zoological Gardens here. Or still better, that of the cone-billed <hi rend="italic">Passeres,</hi> who have &#x201C;a marriage-bower&#x201C; (better luck to them); and how the British Jack-daw is still a <hi rend="italic">Passer</hi> of that kind, retaining his old propensities, but checked in a crowded country, and in the meanwhile stealing bright objects to right and left, in hope times may mend in that respect!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owen described how a &#x201C;pair of Talegallas, or brush turkeys, at the London Zoological Gardens, occupied themselves during the spring and summer of <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> in forming a large hatching-mound. The females laid and buried twenty eggs, in a circle, &#x2026; and on the <date when="1862-08-26">26th of August</date> a young talegalla emerged from the mound, and ran about in quest of worms and insects; feeding independently, and without care or concern on the part of the parents&#x201C; (Owen, <hi rend="italic">On the Extent and Aims</hi> 46). After describing the activities of Australian bower-birds, he continued: &#x201C;It is possible, that the odd propensity of the Magpie, Jackdaw, and some others of our conirostral Passeres, to which the Australian Bower-birds are allied, to pilfer glittering objects, may be the remnant of a similar bower-building, bower-ornamenting, instinct, which the increase of human population has scared out of them; the conditions of our well-peopled, widely-cultivated island having reduced the daws and magpies to restrict their constructive propensities to the nests essential for the continuance of the species&#x201C; (48&#x2013;49).</note> These and the like of these seem to me eminently beautiful indications.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-212" n="38:212"/>And in short my opinion is, If the said Pleading Professor w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gather <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> steadily ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such a thing, and devote his whole soul to it for a few years, he might write, to be read by the like of me who am esoteric altogether,&#x2014;say in two voll. with Portraits (for it ought to be very brief, and distilled to the utmost),&#x2014;such a Book of Nat<hi rend="italic">l</hi> History as was never written before! Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> far outshine the biggest <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi> even the British Nation c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> build, and might a long time outlive such;&#x2014;done by one&#x2019;s own right hand or head, independ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Comittees!

<p><salute>Here I am, dearest Friend!</salute> Here I have been since Thursday night. I had fixed to arrive on Thursday morning. But I took a horror at the notion of the night journey, and stayed in my bed at Morningside instead. Travelling by night is all very well when one is having bad nights in one&#x2019;s bed. But that morphia had not only got me a nights sleep; it seemed to have broken the spell of sleeplessness I was under. The journey as it took it, by Express&#x2014;from ten in the morning till ten at night did not fatigue me in the least&#x2014;I had the carriage all to myself during the last three hours&#x2014;and could get both windows kept open&#x2014;and by dint of having insisted on nobody meeting me, I got myself and luggage put in a cab, without any Professor-Huxley fussing,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Henry Huxley, whom JWC had met at Carlisle Station on her journey north; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620812-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-12">12 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> by a railway porter. and walked into my own house as cool and fresh as if I had just been out for a little airing.</p>
<p>Mr C was very glad of course to see me back. As for Maria; she went into a sort of hysterics over me! seizing me in her arms, and kissing me all over, and laughing in a distracted manner. A charming reception from one&#x2019;s House-maid, certainly! if it weren&#x2019;t that such <hi rend="italic">emotional</hi> natures have always <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sides; this loving and loveable one; and another, as quick to anger and jealousy and all unreasonableness!&#x2014; All this impetuous affection for me, wouldn&#x2019;t prevail with her to make any <hi rend="italic">sacrifices</hi> for my sake; or to exert herself for my sake in any manner which was not agreeable to her inclinations. It is just the emotionalness of the Wesleyan Methodist! having its source in the Senses rather than in the Soul!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-213" n="38:213"/>All Friday I was so busy unpacking, and putting things in their places, and (what the American housewives call &#x201C;reconciling things,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18571119-JWC-MR-01"><sic>33:122</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1857-11-19">19 Nov. 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> that I put off writing to anybody even to you&#x2014;till Saturday. and then&#x2014;a horrid remembrance flashed on me. That Thornhill kept the Sabath in an all too exemplary manner, and that I might spare my haste!&#x2014; On Sunday it is London which keeps the Sabath<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC means there was no point writing on Sat. as there were no Thornhill deliveries on Sun., nor writing on Sun. when there were no collections in London; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-18">18 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; So this is the first feasable day for writing.</p>
<p>I send along with this letter, but separately a packet containing the neck-brooch which you were to &#x201C;like better&#x201C; than your old thistle&#x2014;perhaps you wouldn&#x2019;t like it better or as well, <hi rend="italic">singly</hi>&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">the set,</hi> to my taste, is prettier; and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> care more for the old thistle&#x2014;its oldness being its very charm to me!&#x2014;the brooches can be worn as clasps down the front of the dress, also&#x2014;and look very well on a dress of any colour)</p>
<p>Nevertheless my Dear if you don&#x2019;t entirely like the exchange tell me truly &#x2014;and your thistle shall return to whence it came.</p>
<p>Now, I shall feel rather anxious about that packet until I hear you have got it safe. So I beg you will write one line by return of post to say if you have it or not&#x2014;it will be posted along with this letter&#x2014; I shall not <hi rend="italic">register</hi> the box because it draws the letter-carrier mind to the reflection &#x2018;here must be something of value&#x2019;!!&#x2014; I have never <hi rend="italic">registered</hi> anything that I sent by post, and never yet <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> anything. Still I shall be uneasy till I know the brooches are in your hands.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C thinks, as every body does that I am much improved in health and I myself, who should know best, think so too.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC later wrote &#x201C;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>?&#x201C; here.</note> &#x201C;What could he do to show his gratitude to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell for taking such care of me? Well he had read a really nice book that would suit her, he would send her that&#x201C;&#x2014; I shall send the book by railway parcel so soon as I hear the other packet has reached its true destination</p>
<p>You can&#x2019;t think with what new interest my little picture of Ripp<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Russell&#x2019;s dog, whose picture was in JWC&#x2019;s dressing room; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590208-JWC-MR-01"><sic>35:28</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1859-02-08">8 Feb. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> looked out on me on my return!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>Here I am again, safe and sound! I came home last Thursday night, and made a prosperous journey of it. I found M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C looking pretty well in spite of a little bowel-complaint he had had, and which had afforded him a pretext for putting off his visit to the Grange; and now it cannot come off at all, the visit, for the Ashburtons are gone away into Cornwall<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to TC they went to Devonshire; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620913-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-09-13">13 Sept.</date></ref></note> He is really getting as hard to move as the Mountains! However he is giving himself a weeks Holyday at Home, which is better than nothing</p>
<p>I wish you would write me a little letter, and tell me about &#x201C;Scotsbrig Jenny,&#x201C; who was with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> when I last heard of her. And tell me if you liked my Photograph? &#x201C;The smallest contribution will be gratefully received&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441105-JWC-MR-01"><sic>18:261</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1844-11-05">5 Nov. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I spoke to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell about Margaret&#x2019;s child<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary&#x2019;s grand-da. Mary Stewart, da. of Margaret and Thomas Stewart.</note> and described the <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> as well as I could. He said he had seen a good many such, but not so large as I described this one. And sometimes, he said, the thing had decreased of itself, sometimes he had removed it by tying it with a thread. <hi rend="italic">Cutting</hi> he considered a risk. but when the child is a little older I have no doubt from the way he spoke that something could and should be done. If I were Margaret, I would go at all costs to Syme<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Syme (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26876"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish surgeon; he treated John A.

The &#x201C;Holiday&#x201C; has since been going on, if not in a triumphant, in a punctual and faithful manner;&#x2014;that is to say, I have strictly abstained from work; gone to ride at the best not the worst part of the day; slept at discretion, and in short, been perfectly idle, with or without advantage. My feeling is one of greater fatigue, not of less; my poor muscles seem actually to have lost all their strength at once,&#x2014;and are taking (I suppose) their profit out of this <hi rend="italic">unbraced</hi> condition of affairs! I have been to see Henry Taylor; found him greatly recovered from the worst symptoms of his disorder,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Taylor suffered from asthma; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601128-TC-HT-01"><sic>37:49</sic><corr>TC to HT, <date when="1860-11-28">28 Nov. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> and reconciled to what remains of it;&#x2014;in fact, very happy and contented. I staid too long with him in the hot day; had to ride home double-quick in the teeth of the east-wind; got something of a cold, and felt tired as if I had been fighting the Battle of Waterloo all day,&#x2014;such my potency of strength at this time. Another day, I went to see certain &#x201C;exquisite Historical Miniatures&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of the &#x201C;Special Exhibition of Objects of Art on Loan,&#x201C; South Kensington Museum, opened early <date when="1862-06-00">June</date>.</note> in the Brompton Boilers.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Popular nickname for the buildings of South Kensington Museum; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590510-TC-FMB-01"><sic>35:91</sic><corr>TC to FMB, <date when="1859-05-10">10 May 1859</date></corr></ref>. The exhibition was held in a new building at the back of the museum.</note> I had waited many weeks for a &#x201C;Catalogue,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The exhibition opened without a catalog, an omission deplored by early reviewers.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>As there is &#x201C;Holiday&#x201C; established here, I must not neglect a little word to you at closure of the week. I have been as idle as need be; but doubt I have made little of it in that course. My weakness of muscle, my utter fatigue at the least labour were never so great in my life before! I went to see some &#x201C;Historical Miniatures,&#x201C; in the Brompton Boilers, one day, Tait<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Tait.</note> accompanying (result <pb id="pg-38-217" n="38:217"/><hi rend="italic">zer</hi>o or minus quantities); I rode to see Henry Taylor again (weariness of body very great, in the burning sunshine of going, and the violence of grey east-wind in returning):&#x2014;on the whole, the one thing we have accomplished, which is due to Jane withal, not to me except passively, is certain Photographs big and little;&#x2014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you will get copies by and by. Jane had been talking of this bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> for years past: at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> latterly she found on sale, and going off at a great rate, some unpleasant scrub of a thing (&#x201C;Came from Dumfries, Mam,&#x201C; said the Stationer;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bookshop or stationers of Princes St., Edinburgh; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620921-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1862-09-21">21 Sept.</date>]</ref>; unidentified further.</note> &#x201C;we tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it had been like!&#x201D;)&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had set her quite on edge on the matter. So, under guidance of Woolner,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Woolner wrote to F. T.

Highly important to think of!&#x2014; In about 10 days, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> imagine, there will be copies lying for Jean &#x26; you. Jean need not fret in the very least; only know her Dumfries Artist for a dishonourable scout in time coming.</p>
<p>I do not think I can stand the Exhibition at all,&#x2014;especially under Tait tomorrow. Tomorrow seems to be my last chance; and I rather grudge (tho&#x2019; not much either) to miss the Pictures: the huge miscellany of <hi rend="italic">remainder</hi>, it is like a <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> of a hundred acres in extent presented to a dyspeptic individual, who needs one mutton-chop, and is not ravenous even for that;&#x2014;I know nothing in the world of a more distractive overwhelming and distressing nature.</p>
<p>The Ashburton Lady (who is full of zeal &#x26; kindness, but witht vestige of method in her habits) has had the vacant Grange, all this while, lying ready for <hi rend="italic">us two;</hi> and writes <hi rend="italic">today</hi> to say that it is so! We <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to go for a week, middle of <date when="1862-10-00">Oct<hi rend="italic">r,</hi></date> and that will do for Country.&#x2014; Unless you dispatch, what becomes of &#x201C;Aryshire Coast&#x201C;?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.

Photographic portraits mostly fail from want of tact or taste in their producers. Men sit stiffly, or are thoughtlessly posed with regard to the light,&#x2014;misfortunes the too faithful camera scorns to remedy. Mr. Jeffrey has thoroughly understood what he had to do, and so skillfully posed his sitters, with real feeling for the characters of each, that his works, both as portraits and photographs, are worthy of the originals&#x201C; (398). The National Portrait Gallery, London, lists several examples of Jeffrey&#x2019;s photographs of TC, JWC, and Tennyson (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npg.org.uk&#x2F;collections).</note> (with the wide-awake) and one of <hi rend="italic">Mazzini,</hi> which you are to substitute for the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> I gave the D<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> as giving a better notion of him, and besides, having his autograph on it.</p>

My aunt Grace had seen a great <hi rend="italic">heap</hi> of them lying on a Booksellers counter in Princes Street! When I went to enquire at this Booksellerer, <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> he had received them from, I was told &#x201C;from <hi rend="small-caps">dumfries</hi>&#x201C; and likewise the agreeable fact that the whole stock were already bought up!! &#x201C;not one left!&#x201D; What all my entreaties had not been able to obtain from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;viz that he would go and be photographed by a right man here, was accomplished by his annoyance at being published over the world under so unlike a form. And having decided that last week was to be a holyday, he actually went with me to the best Photographer in London, who had been for years soliciting him to come and be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">nothing!</hi>&#x2014; He (the Photographer took a great many different ones, large and small; of which <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the large ones satisfied him, and is to be <hi rend="italic">published</hi> and I think <hi rend="italic">it</hi> the finest photograph I ever saw. But we have got no copies of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> yet, except <hi rend="italic">one</hi> for myself. Four or five different little ones will be published, and of these I like the one here sent the best. As of course M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey (the photographer) will make <hi rend="italic">a good thing</hi> of supplying the shops with <hi rend="italic">M</hi>r <hi rend="italic">C;</hi> he was very obliging in insisting on <hi rend="italic">doing me</hi>&#x2014;who had not laid my account with being <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and so, was at the same loss for a head-dress&#x2014;as you were at the Hairdressers! But fortunately M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeffrey&#x2019;s Aunt, who assists him, offered me a white lace thing,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellenor Ruding.

To complete my luck I had on, the day being cold, my last winters gown (from <hi rend="italic">Madame Elise</hi>); so that I came out a better <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi> than at the Hairdressers!! Still I have a certain regard for the queer little Thornhill likeness of myself;&#x2014;not as a likeness&#x2014;but as a memorial of the three happiest weeks that I have lived for a long long time; so I will ask you to get me another from the Hairdresser&#x2014;as the one I sent to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has been given away to Sarah, the Housemaid who went away ill som 14 months ago, and who came last night to see me, before starting for Australia.

<p>I was quite relieved to find the brooches had arrived safe. People always say it is so rash to send anything of consequence unregistered.

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley</salute>
<p>Your letter affords a fresh example of a rule in Human Life, not taught us at school, but which every one has to learn for him or herself&#x2014;namely; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Wished for comes too late</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:112.</note>&#x2014; To the energetic wisher whatever thing he sets his heart on is pretty sure to come; but only, <hi rend="italic">never in the right time!</hi> Yes&#x2014;everything in this world shares the fate of Lord Chesterfields patronage of Johnsons Dictionary, offered him when he was &#x201C;old and could not enjoy it&#x201C;; was &#x201C;solitary and could not impart it&#x201C;; was &#x201C;known and did not want it&#x201C;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philip Dormer Stanhope (<date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26255"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 4th earl of Chesterfield, failed to give Samuel Johnson (<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14918"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) the support Johnson thought he had been promised while writing his dictionary. When the book was about to be published, Lord Chesterfield wrote two articles in praise of it. Johnson then wrote to Lord Chesterfield, <date when="1755-02-07">7 Feb. 1755</date>: &#x201C;When, upon some slight encouragement, I first visited your Lordship, I was overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by the enchantment of your address &#x2026; but I found my attendance so little encouraged, that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue. &#x2026; Seven years, my Lord, have now past &#x2026; during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties &#x2026; and have brought it, at last, to the verge of publication. &#x2026; The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it; till I am solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Boswell&#x2019;s Life of Johnson</hi> 1:261&#x2013;62).</note></p>
<p>Thus the announcement of your return, and your kind invitation to Alderly reaches us at oh such a perverse moment! the very day after Mr C&#x2019;s holyday had <hi rend="small-caps">expired</hi>, and he had set himself stiffly to &#x201C;work&#x201C; again! Only one week&#x2019;s holyday had the infatuated man granted himself, made almost necessary by a slight derangement of his health, and falling in, as it happened, conveniently with a pause at the printers. And that week I know he would have gladly spent with you at Alderley. But tho&#x2019; I have pleaded with him on my knees, with streaming eyes and flowing hair<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Her streaming eyes, wrung hands, and flowing hair,&#x201C; John Gay, &#x201C;An Elegy on a Lapdog.&#x201C;</note> (figuratively speaking) to take another weeks idleness, which would be so good for both the body and soul of him, no answer could I obtain but this: &#x201C;My Dear! it is out of the question! I am up to the ears in a quagmire of Things again! Say every thing that is most kind from me to Lady Stanley; and&#x2014;I say!&#x2014;if you like&#x2014;you can send her one of the little Photographs of me!&#x201D;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">My</hi> disappointment at not getting to you myself is great&#x2014;for I was very happy at Alderley! But I may not say much about it; having just had a month&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-38-223" n="38:223"/>holyday in Scotland, <hi rend="italic">I!</hi> I was feeling so ill and suicidal in London that I had to fling over all conjugal delicacies and leave <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to the tender mercies of the Maids! merely writing to him a long letter every day to keep him in heart.</p>
<p>It is amazing how well he seems to have done without me!</p>
<p>Will you give my kindest remembrance to the &#x201C;Bright Beings.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s name for the younger Stanley das.; cf. <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600830-JWC-LST-01"><sic>36:214</sic><corr>JWC to LST, <date when="1860-08-30">30 Aug. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept my thanks for your great kindness,&#x2014;for the distinguished honour you do us. I forbade Woollner twice over to trouble you on that subject; but he had beneficently persisted,&#x2014;and procures me admission, after all, into that Edifice, under such terms as I did not expect. Next Sunday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The International Exhibition was not open to the public on Sundays.</note> my Wife and I mean to proceed thither, and try the Gainsboroughs and Reynoldses: next Sunday again, if W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> have returned (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it is by no means worth his while to do for that object), perhaps he will be able to accompany some farther survey, in the &#x201C;six miles of gallery&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The picture gallery was 1,150 ft. (351 m.) long; the whole exhibition building covered nearly 25 acres (10 ha.).</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am told there are.</p>

That is more like <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I think! Now; there being such a difference of opinion between us; the only way to please us both would be, to let each keep the one he and she likes best  Can you <hi rend="italic">spare two?</hi> I keep the composed sensible Lady in the bonnet, in conformity with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s orders&#x2014;and I return the other two as in honour bound.

<p><salute>Darling of the World!</salute> Here is what you ask for, and honour me by asking for!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a photograph of herself.</note></p>
<p>I would try to set off <hi rend="small-caps">its</hi> questionable charms, with a long letter of interesting news; if there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> any interesting news known to me just now; except about&#x2014;the Glasgow murder,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie McLachlan (<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1899-00-00">99</date>) was accused of the murder of her friend and fellow servant Jess McPherson, <date when="1862-07-05">5 July</date>, at Sandyford Pl., Glasgow. McPherson was butchered with a meat cleaver. The initial suspect was their employer&#x2019;s father, James Fleming, but further evidence implicated McLachlan; her contradictory replies to questioning led to Fleming&#x2019;s being released and McLachlan&#x2019;s being charged. Found guilty, <date when="1862-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, her agent read a statement from her after the verdict; she claimed that Fleming had murdered McPherson, because she resisted his advances, and then persuaded McLachlan to help cover it up. Despite this she was sentenced to hang <date when="1862-10-11">11 Oct.</date>, but, because of the strength of public feeling, an investigation was begun, with the execution delayed until <date when="1862-11-01">1 Nov.</date> She was reprieved but spent 15 years in Perth prison. She d. in the U.S. The case was widely reported in both Scottish and English newspapers. See <hi rend="italic">The Trial of Jessie M&#x2019;Lachlan,</hi> ed. William Roughhead (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1911-00-00">1911</date>). For JWC&#x2019;s response to the reprieve, see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621030-JWC-LAI-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LAI</corr>, <date when="1862-10-30">30 Oct.</date></ref></note> and that is daily reported in the &#x201C;Public Prints&#x201C;;&#x2014;and if, having some news worth telling, I had any time for telling! But I am in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a hurry Darling! executing as wild a gallop thro&#x2019; the Rain <hi rend="italic">morally,</hi> as you did the other day physically! I am going to Dover tomorrow, <pb id="pg-38-227" n="38:227"/>for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days or at most three; on a visit to a Lady I &#x201C;swore everlasting friendship with, this summer&#x2014;Miss Davenport Bromley. I had undertaken to visit her at Wotton Hall, on my way home from Scotland; and, after giving her no end of trouble in writing out Bradshaw details for me; I had taken fright about changing trains at Manchester, in an &#x201C;unprotected Female&#x201C; phase; and about leaving M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C so long by himself, (poor interesting Babe in the <hi rend="italic">wood!</hi>) and in a manner at once impolite and ungrateful had rushed from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to London by the straight road! She is now at Dover, and is goodnatured enough to still want to see me; and so, as it is not far, and as I neednt be gone long enough to be missed. I have agreed to go to her tomorrow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wants a new coat and new trowsers! And Oh! if you knew what a job <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is for both the tailor, and <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> I have already been seeking vainly thro&#x2019; half the cloth-shops in London for &#x201C;a piece of <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> cloth, free from <hi rend="italic">devils dust</hi>&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Flock (wool or cotton refuse), made from old cloth, reduced by a machine called a devil; for an earlier use by TC indicating rubbish, see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551005-TC-JAC-01"><sic>30:77</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-10-05">5 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> that may suit his ideas; and today I have to seek thro&#x2019; the other half!

<salute>Dearest of Friends</salute>
<p>I am writing two lines at this late hour; because I don&#x2019;t want the feeling of <hi rend="italic">closeness</hi>, that has outlived the precious three weeks we were <hi rend="italic">together,</hi> to die out thro length of silence. For the rest; I am not in good case for writing a pleasant letter; having had no sleep last night, and the bad night not having been compensated, as my bad nights at Holme Hill were, strangely enough, by a good day! And I am bothered too with preparations for a journey tomorrow!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Went <date when="1862-10-01">October 1</date>&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:123).</note> What a locomotive animal I have suddenly become! Yes! it is a fact, my Dear, that tomorrow I am bound for Dover! to stay till Monday with that Lady we call &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">flight of Sky-larks</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Miss Davenport Bromley; her great-grandfather at &#x2018;Wooton,&#x2019; in Staffordshire, was the &#x2018;Mr. Davenport&#x2019; who gave shelter to Rousseau&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:123). Wootton Hall was leased, <date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1767-00-00">67</date>, to Jean-Jacques Rousseau (<date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">78</date>), French philosopher; he wrote part of <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> there. Caroline Davenport Bromley&#x2019;s great great grandfather Richard Davenport (ca. <date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>-<date when="1771-00-00">71</date>) owned Wootton at the time.</note> who was wanting me to come home by <pb id="pg-38-228" n="38:228"/>her Place in Derbyshire. She is now at Dover, in lodgings, for benefit of sea-air; and has invited me <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> since I wouldn&#x2019;t go to Wotton Hall, and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C who thought I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have come home <hi rend="italic">by her,</hi> wishes me to go. And I am sure I have no objections! for I like her much and I like the sea much. But I &#x201C;am not to be <hi rend="italic">staying</hi> away <hi rend="italic">this</hi> time, he says, and leaving him <hi rend="italic">long</hi> by himself again&#x201C;! No fear! I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> return to London on Monday, or I should not see Charlotte Cushman (who is now in Liverpool, and returns here on Thursday) before her departure for Rome. Indeed, charming as I think the &#x201C;Flight of Sky Larks&#x201C; I should not be unsettling myself again; if only I had kept the better health and spirits I brought back from Scotland. It was too much to hope however that I would keep all that <hi rend="italic">long.</hi> The clammy, heavy weather we have had for the last week has put me all wrong somehow. I am sick at <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi>&#x2014;or at <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> (I cant tell which) and have a continual irritation in my bits of bowels; and horrid nights. for all which I dare say <hi rend="italic">the sea</hi> is the best medecine. I will tell you how it has answered when I come back.</p>
<p>Yes Dear. decidedly I should like much to have a photograph of poor Robert Macturk. and since Mrs Kennedy will only <hi rend="italic">bargain</hi> about it; I send not only the one she demands, but one of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C also&#x2014;being <hi rend="italic">liberal,</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">i</hi>!&#x2014; &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">twelve stamps</hi>&#x201C; Bless you! it was <hi rend="italic">the shilling</hi> for the hairdresser. You know I wanted another photograph of myself from him. And I am accurate in business matters you may have observed. When people <hi rend="italic">give</hi> me anything voluntarily, I take whatever is given me gladly&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if</hi> I <hi rend="italic">like</hi> the giver  But when I <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> to have a <hi rend="italic">commission</hi> done&#x2014;however small or great I insist on paying for it. love to the D<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> <closer><salute>Your own &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>J W C</name></p>

Is it <hi rend="italic">I</hi> who have made a huge mistake, or <hi rend="italic">you</hi> who have changed your programme? It was clear in my mind, that you <pb id="pg-38-229" n="38:229"/>were not to start for Rome till the middle of <date when="1862-10-00">October</date>! How I came by that impression God knows; but there it was! and if it had only <hi rend="italic">been there!</hi> but&#x2014;I have acted upon it! thought myself safe to engage to spend a week at Dover, with a Lady whom I promised to visit in Derbyshire on my road home from Scotland; and I broke that promise, and so <hi rend="italic">must</hi> keep this one! I was to have gone today, but put off till tomorrow being unwell. And now to day comes your dear letter telling me you return the very day after I shall have gone, and, far worse, that you leave for good before my &#x201C;week&#x201C; is out! But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> must never be! I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come back on Monday, to get one look of you&#x2014;will <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to come back on Saturday tho&#x2019; of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I am doubtful. I will write which day I shall be back, when I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> what can be managed&#x2014;without ungraciousness to the person concernd who is adorably kind to me, tho&#x2019; a <hi rend="italic">fine Lady!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>And you&#x2014;can <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;not stay in London till Wednesday and spend Tuesday with <hi rend="italic">me?</hi> all day write to me directly to the care of Miss Davenport Bromley, 1 Sidney Villas, Dover&#x2014;one line will do.</p>
<p>I have been too ill all this day to pack my things or do any thing&#x2014;so you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see why I write hastily and briefly now about midnight? I will come in the forenoon of Monday at latest and then couldn&#x2019;t you both<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cushman and her friend Emma Stebbins.</note> come here for the evening</p>

<p>I may take a reasonable sheet of paper, Dear, for besides being not &#x201C;too tired for writing,&#x201C; I have abbundance of <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for writing. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Larks</hi>&#x201C; being <hi rend="italic">all</hi> far up, out of sight beyond the visible sky! looking for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> there!&#x2014; My journey was successful, and I stepped out at Dover worth &#x2018;half a dozen of&#x2019; the womon I left Chelsea &#x26; curious what a curative effect a rail-way journey has on <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> always while <hi rend="italic">you</hi> it makes pigs and whistles of! Is it the motion? or is it the changed air?&#x2014;&#x201C;god knows&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460823-JWC-TC-01"><sic>21:22</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-08-23">23 Aug. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>The first thing that befell me at Dover was a disappointment. no Larks waiting! not a feather of them to be discovered by the naked eye! The next thing that befell me was to be deceived, and betrayed, and entirely discomfited <pb id="pg-38-230" n="38:230"/>by&#x2014;a sailor! After looking about for the Larks, some ten minutes and being persecuted as long by pressing proposals from Cabmen and omnibus conductors, I was asking a porter how far it was to Sidney Villas. the Porter not knowing the place, a sailor came forward and said <hi rend="italic">he</hi> knew it&#x2014;that it was &#x201C;just a few steps,&#x201C; I &#x201C;would be there in a minute if I liked to walk&#x201C; and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> &#x201C;would carry my trunk for me!&#x201D; And without waiting to have the question debated he threw my trunk over his shoulder and walked off. I following, quite taken by assault!</p>
<p>And we walked on&#x2014;and on and oh <hi rend="italic">on</hi>&#x2014;such a distance&#x2014;certainly <hi rend="italic">two miles</hi> at least! the sailor pretending to <hi rend="italic">not hear,</hi> every time I remonstrated assuring me &#x201C;I couldnt find a prettier walk in all Dover than this!&#x201D;&#x2014;at last we reached 1 Sidney villa. and when I accused my sailor of having basely misled me, that he might have a job&#x2014;he candidly owned: &#x201C;Well, things are dear just now&#x2014;and few jobs going&#x201C;!! wiping the sweat from his brow at the same time, and looking delighted with the shilling I gave him! I thought it was all gone to the Devil together, when the man who answered the bell denied that Miss Bromley was there! On cross questioning however he explained that she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> reside there; but was not at home. was &#x201C;gone to the railway to meet a Lady&#x201C;! and his eye just then squinting on my portmanteau, he exclaimed with sudden cordiality&#x2014;&#x201C;perhaps <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are the Lady!&#x201D; I owned the soft impeachment,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:170</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>; see Sheridan, <hi rend="italic">The Rivals</hi> 5.3.</note> and was shown to the bedroom prepared for me&#x2014; And have washed and unpacked. Meanwhile Miss B&#x2019;s maid<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> who had gone to one Station, while Miss B went to the other, to make sure of me, returned. and gave me a cup of tea, and then went off to catch the poor dear Larks who was waiting for me at a <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> station! There being a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Station (the one, at which I landed)!

<p>Now upon my word this is a fairly long letter to be still in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> day of absence!!</p>
<p>It will at least show that I am less ghastly-sick and with less worry in my bits of bowels, than when I left in the morning</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have hardly a moment, and must be shorter than ever. Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> two Notes came; and were very welcome to me. I also read Jean&#x2019;s yesterday, as it passed here towards Dover. I am very glad to hear of little Jenny&#x2019;s being better;&#x2014;and the hint you give of a likely visit to London is a pleasure and a surprise at once! We shall be right glad to see you beyond bargain: y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> old room is vacant for you here;&#x2014;and I will wish you every success in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> errand; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will of course be a great kindness to the poor foolish Boy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Watt, who had been in trouble at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620503-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1862-05-03">3 May</date></ref>.</note> if you can succeed in it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope is not impossible, since you do not judge it so.</p>
<p>Jane went to Dover Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last (day before yesterday): talked of being back &#x201C;on Monday at latest.&#x201C; The miserable weather, of tepid mud for days,&#x2014;I supposed it to be that,&#x2014;had quite upset her again; and I was glad this little chance turned up. She reported great good from the <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> merely: this morning I heard nothing,&#x2014;but hope it may be for a favourable reason, and that she is driving ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all the more largely with her Hostess in the fine weather.</p>
<p>I am to have a week of The Grange after all: &#x201C;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the middle of this month&#x201C; (such is the program at pres<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> none of the <hi rend="italic">surest</hi>) &#x201C;to take leave before they go to Nice.&#x201C; He<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton.</note> is not strong by any means, tho&#x2019; better than usual just now; and after a great deal of swaying and shifting, has decided as above.</p>
<p>I got last night a great heap of Vol V Proofsheets;&#x2014;sight of them enough to make one shudder! First half of that Vol. is going to be horridly tough (Seven-Yrs War conclusion); latter half will be I know not what! A tough climb <hi rend="italic">surely;</hi> but, once over that hill, there is no other!&#x2014; Say when you are coming.

<salute>Dear Mr Larkin</salute>
<p>I shall come by the train which leaves here at 12.20 and arrives at 3.30&#x2014; I am afraid that hour will be too early for your convenience; in which case dont mind me&#x2014;but if you can <hi rend="italic">conveniently</hi> meet me of course I shall be glad. Also&#x2014;should it be a pouring wet day, it will be better for me to go by a train stopping at the Victoria Station, and go from there in a cab&#x2014; But let us hope it wont be pouring wet.</p>
<p>There is no use telling you about myself by letter when I am to see you so soon&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;I firmly intended to write on Thursday, then on Friday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Sat., <date when="1862-10-11">11 Oct.</date></note> but was so hustled ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> among Proofsheets and botherations, I absolutely c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> <pb id="pg-38-237" n="38:237"/>not. I have only got <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> and saved a minute for you this morning, by&#x2014; awakening at six (very prematurely), and bolting out <hi rend="italic">to my sheets again,</hi> since there was heavy rain, and I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not bolt out into the air!&#x2014; &#x2014; A good big lump is in type (probably a full 4th of the whole Volume); but that is only half the battle; you never saw such a jumble of horrors as the first proofs are: in my bewildering <hi rend="italic">index</hi>-less state, and with such Books and blockheadism,&#x2014;I cannot, single-handed, deal with the thing, except stage after stage in that tentative way. Often enough, I am doing the very last <hi rend="italic">revise,</hi> when (after such screwing and torturing) the really <hi rend="italic">vital point</hi> of the matter, rule of all the articulation it must have;&#x2014;will disclose itself to me; <hi rend="italic">overlooked</hi> by the fifty Dryasdusts I have been compulsing!&#x2014; I have only yet <hi rend="italic">got one</hi> sheet of Vol V fairly sent away; 2 or 3 more w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have gone in a week: but I wanted to have one, at the least &#x26; lowest, before flying off. Vol IV haggled endlessly in Robson&#x2019;s hands: but it is done, off forevermore;&#x2014;Time &#x26; the hours wear everything to finis, if you persist!</p>
<p>We are just going off to The Grange, for probably a week or nearly so&#x2014;certainly not for <hi rend="italic">longer</hi>. &#x201C;To take leave,&#x201C; it is, they are going <hi rend="italic">to Nice</hi> directly, there to pass the winter, L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A. being weakly &#x26; dreading the climate here in the Sun&#x2019;s absence.&#x2014; &#x2014; I will keep this open; and add a word <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> if I can tell you we are come. Adieu, therefore, till tea-time at The Grange. Go to Erskine&#x2019;s by all means.</p>
<p>The Grange (4&#xBC; p.m.)</p>
<p>Here we happily are, then; after a pleasant enough three-hours drive (not four hours from our own door to this); and feel already greatly comforted by the free sight of Mother Earth after so long an interval. All is green &#x26; bright here; a <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has something of heavenly. Neither Lord nor Lady (coming home themselves today) are yet arrived: only expected every minute.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>If I do not write you a word at present, it cannot be said to be for want of <hi rend="italic">time</hi>,&#x2014;there being nothing but utter idleness provided as my portion here today and every day:&#x2014;no lack of &#x201C;time&#x201C; at all; but a plentiful lack of every <pb id="pg-38-238" n="38:238"/>other requisite, as composure, silence, news to send, or even a feasible human <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> to write them with! Never mind: here is a scrap of a word to you; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will convey what is needful before the week quite end.</p>
<p>We came hither last Saturday, are to stay till tomorrow,&#x2014;one week of perfect inaction and rural exposure: it is the only taste of country I have had for a year past.

<p>What a Brute you must be thinking me; that I should have been all this while without thanking you and&#x2014;kissing you, for your Book!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georgiana Craik, <hi rend="italic">Winifred&#x2019;s Wooing.

<p>In the first place the Book came when I was away&#x2014;at Dover. On my return I found that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had engaged we should both go to The Grange in a few days. And I had toilets to get up &#x201C;at the shortest notice, and on the most reasonable terms&#x201C; (as the Undertaker signboards have it) And the trouble it costs to make one&#x2019;s outside presentable amongst Lords and Ladies, (especially when it is an old and worn outside) on pin money of twenty pounds per annum is &#x201C;only to be felt not described&#x201C;! Nevertheless I found time, or <hi rend="italic">made</hi> it, to read your Book before setting off; and the hours spent in reading it were the only pleasant ones of that week;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lena Eden (<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>) reviewed it in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1862-10-18">18 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;It is sometimes a relief to meet with a novel &#x2026; which has no plot whatever, and no mystery, and no hidden meaning, and no particular moral,&#x2014;with no pretention to being witty, or learned, or philosophical, or metaphysical, or religious, or, in short, to be anything at all, except just what it is&#x2014;a thing &#x2018;to take up in some tired or idle hour, when a better book might be thrown away&#x2019;&#x201C; (492).</note> and I &#x201C;did design&#x201C; to write to you from the Grange, and tell you I liked this Book best of all you had written.

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>I am not doing &#x201C;what England expects of me&#x201C;&#x2014;my duty!&#x2014; I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to begin writing, at least, half a dozen letters that are troubling my conscience; and here am I writing to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> from no sense of duty at all, but because I like it!</p>
<p>Well! my wanderings for this year are over! and it must be owned they have been far and wide! The Grange visit was very successful. Every time, I come <pb id="pg-38-241" n="38:241"/>away from there with increased affection for the Lady, and in a sort of amazement at her excessive kindness to me. That she is naturally a very kind woman, and also a very demonstrative woman, is not enough to account for the sort of passion she puts into her expressions of fondness and unwearied attentions to me! I always wonder, will it last?&#x2014;but it has lasted a good while now; and I begin to feel ashamed of myself for not accepting it all with absolute faith.</p>
<p>Mrs Anstruther came for two days. and pressed me to spend my Xmas with <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> as Lady A would be away at Nice all the winter. But the answer to that was simply &#x201C;impossible&#x201C;! I told her about meeting M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Smith<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. David Smith; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620815-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1862-08-15">15 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> at your house, and she said in her soft silky, rather drawly voice. &#x201C;Oh! dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle! did you ever in all your life see so ugly a man?&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Bishop of Oxford was there too&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C set him right in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Scripture quotations!!! But the most interesting visitor was M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Storey the Americain Sculptor, who sang like an angel!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Wetmore Story. He had arrived in England in <date when="1862-05-00">May</date> to visit the International Exhibition, where his sculptures the <hi rend="italic">Libyan Sibyl</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) were being shown. His letters to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News,</hi> <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>, on the American Civil War, pbd. as <hi rend="italic">The American Question</hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), sharply influenced English opinion in favor of the Unionists. Story recalled an evening at The Grange, where TC described the Civil War &#x201C;as the burning-out of the smokiest chimney of the century,&#x201C; and engaged in debate with Wilberforce: &#x201C;&#x2018;Good conscience, my Lord Bishop&#x2014;what was ever the use of such a thing to any man? Take two of the best men that ever lived&#x2014;what good did his good conscience ever do to Oliver Cromwell or to St Paul?&#x2019;&#x201C; The Bishop protested at their mention in the same breath. &#x201C;&#x2018;Well then, confine it, if ye will to St. Paul. With <hi rend="italic">his</hi> good conscience he was the most meeserable of men&#x2019;&#x201C; (Henry James, <hi rend="italic">William Wetmore Story and His Friends</hi> [<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>] 2:199&#x2013;200). According to a college friend, Story had &#x201C;a beautiful bass voice, and was a member of the only college glee club existing at that time&#x201C; (Mary Elizabeth Phillips, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences of William Wetmore Story</hi> [<date when="1897-00-00">1897</date>] 49).</note> There was a Photographer down for three days taking views of the place at the easy rate of five guineas a-day! and Lady A made him photograph me sitting with herself standing beside me;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A photograph of JWC and Lady Ashburton sitting under the Portico of The Grange (see Fielding and Sorensen opp. 155) may have been taken at this time.</note> and he did another of Lord A and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C sitting on the same bench, under the Portico<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-38/lt-18621030-JWC-EFO-01"><sic>248</sic><corr>JWC to EFO, <date when="1862-10-30">30 Oct.</date></corr></ref> For The Grange&#x2019;s front elevation, see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580117-TC-JWC-01"><sic>33:159</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-01-17">17 Jan. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and another of a whole party of us sitting about on the steps of one of the Porticos. That one was half good, and the other half spoiled. Lord A, one of his Sisters, and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther &#x201C;had moved&#x201C;&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and Lady A, and the other Sister, and myself &#x201C;came out perfect&#x201C;&#x2014; And so we &#x201C;perfect&#x201C; ones were all <hi rend="italic">together,</hi> we were to be &#x201C;cut out&#x201C; from the failed ones. I haven&#x2019;t seen the Photographs on <hi rend="small-caps">paper</hi> yet; but hope to have them in a few days. and if they are worth anything I will send you them&#x2014;to look at at least! But the rose-coloured petticoat! Oh my Dear!&#x2014;I must tell you about <pb id="pg-38-242" n="38:242"/>the first appearance of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> I put it on, the second day, and the black silk tunic trimmed with half a yard wide black lace (immitation) with long falling sleeves lined with rose colour&#x2014;and a great bunch of rose-coloured ribbon on my breast, and smaller boughs at the wrists of my white under sleeves. It was really (as Miss Baring said) &#x201C;quite a costume&#x201C;! And in spite of its prettiness, I couldnt help feeling nervous about appearing, for the first time, in a guise which would make me remarked by all the <hi rend="italic">women</hi> at least! So I dressed in good time, that I mightn&#x2019;t have to walk into the drawing-room when many people were down. There had been some uncertainty about the dinner hour that day, as people were coming from London by a late train. At all events I should hear the gong sound for dressing I thought half an hour before dinner; and in the mean time I sat down, all ready, to read a novel. How long I had sat, without hearing either bell or gong I can&#x2019;t say; but I was startled from my reading by a sharp knock at my bedroom door and the voice of one of the menservants informing me &#x201C;every body was gone in to dinner&#x201C;! Upon my honour, I can believe some hardened wretches have gone out to be hanged with less emotion than I had in hurrying along the corridor and down the great staircase, to have the two leaves of the dining-room door flung wide open before me by two footmen! and then to walk up the great room to my seat at the dining-table; every body&#x2019;s head turned to see <hi rend="italic">who</hi> was so late! To put the finishing stroke to my agony, the rose coloured petticoat was a trifle too long in front for the stooping way in which I walked, and was like to trip me at every step! But bad moments and good moments and all moments pass over! I got into my seat, Lord knows how, and any one who had heard me complaining aloud to Lady A up the table, that the gong had never been sounded, would have fancied me endowed with all the self-possession I could have wished!</p>
<p>Another ordeal was in store for me and my &#x201C;costume&#x201C; later. Being Sunday night, the Bishop was to read a chapter and say prayers in that same dining-room before all the Servants, and such of the visitors as would attend. Eight and thirty servants were seated along two sides of the room; the men all in a line, and the women all in a line; and with these thirty eight pairs of eyes on me (six pairs of them belonging to <hi rend="italic">Ladies maids!!</hi>) I had to sail up, in all that rose-colour to the top of the room, on the opposite side, <hi rend="italic">first!</hi> the other Ladies being all members of the family pushed me into that horrid dignity. And the same in going out, I had to walk the length of the room&#x2014;like to trip myself at every step, with the petticoat and the embarrassment!&#x2014;befor one of that frightful line of servants budged!</p>
<p>It took all the compliments paid me on the costume to give me courage to put it on a second time! As an old Aunt of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s said when she had become somehow possessed of a one pound note and didn&#x2019;t know where on earth to <pb id="pg-38-243" n="38:243"/>hide it for safety. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re troubled that <hi rend="italic">have</hi> the <hi rend="italic">world;</hi> and troubled that want it&#x201C;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s grandmother Margaret Aitken; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420814-JWC-TC-01"><sic>15:15&#x2013;16</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1842-08-14">14 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> And now my letter is long enough.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;Your welcome Notes and kind remembrances of me all arrived duly: besides the Grange Note, a <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> on Tuesday after we had got home, and were settling; and the day after that, a more articulate message, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> did me good in my then low estate. The Review <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> was by Venables;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Stovin Venables commended the broad sweep of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>: &#x201C;As a biographer, and &#x2026; as a philosophic teacher, [Carlyle] professes to notice events and persons only as they affect the character and career of his hero; but it is fortunately as necessary that he should connect Frederick&#x2019;s life with the contemporaneous history of Europe as that a physiologist should expound the relation of food or of air to animal organization. In the midst of the digressions &#x2026; Mr. Carlyle will be found to have &#x2026; written a history of the war of the Austrian Succession which can be understood and remembered&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> 14 [<date when="1862-10-18">18 Oct. 1862</date>]: 478).</note>&#x2014;not a bad thing at all; excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in comparison to much that I suppose to be going, tho&#x2019; I have read only this, and long ago one other. They really do me no ill, the adverse ones, or inconceivably little; and hardly any good, the most flattering of the friendly: in my bitter solitary struggle continued almost to the death, I have got to such a contempt for the babble of idle ignorant mankind about me as is sometimes almost apalling<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to myself! &#x201C;What are they to me; what am I to them,&#x2014;in the presence of very Fate &#x26; Fact!&#x201D;&#x2014; However, as two other Copies of the Venables were pleased to come (one from Venables himself, who had spoken of it recently to Jane at the Grange, and one I guess from James Aitken),&#x2014;I have sent them all off among <pb id="pg-38-244" n="38:244"/>the kindred this day, fair wind to them;&#x2014;the rather as I had plenty of waste-paper, and the tables needed clearing.</p>
<p>Saturday in Hampshire was one of the wettest days I ever saw; but it dried towards ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, &#x26; we came up by a very good train,&#x2014;home here ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 9 o&#x2019;clock, and very glad one of us to be so. I had one or two wild gallops on blood horses overfed; the company was harmless (interesting in part, some N. American people called <hi rend="italic">Story,</hi> Roman by common residence); and the kindness of Lady A; to say nothing of her Lord, was really a thing to be recognised as altogether perfect and unusual. Nevertheless I felt tumbled completely heels-over-head; in very considerable pain and derang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of body all the time;&#x2014;and staggered about for a couple of days here before I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get fairly to work again. I calculate it has done me good too;&#x2014;but nothing can be really <hi rend="italic">good</hi> except <hi rend="italic">Finis</hi> to that sad Volume now dragging itself along under all the strength of pull that I have left for it. Courage, we shall get done! There is hardly above one sheet of it fairly away from me forever; but there will soon be 5 or 6 in that happy condit<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> I hope; and certainly <hi rend="italic">above</hi> &#x2153; of the Volume stands roughly in type.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>The news of you would have been too long in coming, if I had not gone and inquired about you at Frederick Chapman, and learnt from <hi rend="italic">him</hi> that you were &#x201C;greatly better&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Forster had been ill for some time; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620701-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1862-07-01">1 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I am sure nobody out of your own family can be <pb id="pg-38-247" n="38:247"/>gladder of that than I am!&#x2014; Another time, you will go away more hopefully&#x2014;with more faith in the benifit of &#x201C;a change&#x201C;&#x2014;won&#x2019;t you? even with a long fatiguing journey to front. Decidedly when one is weakly, and poorly &#x201C;a change&#x201C; is new life&#x2014;for us women! It is almost ridiculous, the number of times that I have left London with a private idea I should not live to come back, and come back &#x201C;another creature&#x201C;! The wisest D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I know (a scotch one<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dr Russell&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note on MS).</note> of course) told me when I was in Nithsdale the other day; &#x201C;whenever you feel to be getting weak and low&#x2014;nervous&#x2014;sleepless&#x2014;all that sort of thing; don&#x2019;t sit still, listening to your sensations&#x2014;dont send for a Doctor, and take &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mixtures</hi>&#x201C;; but pack your carpet-bag and put yourself on a railway&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">to anywhere</hi>&#x201C;! Since I have been following that advice, I have made experience of its soundness. And look at your Husband (Bless him!) What a change for the better has been wrought on him, since he had to pack <hi rend="italic">his</hi> carpet bag so often, and go on railways to somewhere!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster was a member of the Lunacy Commission, traveling throughout England and Wales to inspect hospitals for the insane; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610817-TC-JF-01"><sic>37:213&#x2013;14</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1861-08-17">17 Aug. 1861</date></corr></ref>.</note> I expect you to return without that tired look which I understand so well! and with your eyes as bright as the<supplied>[y]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> are by nature. And then I shall expect you to drive very often to Cheyne Row. and let us try to Cheer one another up a bit. Hang it! why mightnt we go sometimes, with a mutual carpet bag, and spend a day and night at some way-side Inn, when we feel to need &#x201C;a change&#x201C; from our own comfortable homes, and men-of-genius Husbands!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But <hi rend="italic">do</hi> be careful in the meantime, not to over-do your strength. Such long walks are rash. And for all so anxious as your Husband is about you, he is&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">man!</hi> And men I have had occasion to observe always estimate a woman strength by their own&#x2014;have too much leaning to Miss Dombey&#x2019;s idea of the expediency in all cases to &#x201C;make an effort.&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dickens, <hi rend="italic">Dombey and Son,</hi> chap. 18.</note></p>
<p>Our visit to the Grange was as pleasant, as &#x201C;beautiful Nature,&#x201C;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510827-JWC-HW-01"><sic>26:142</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1851-08-27">27 Aug. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x201C;High Art,&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470623-TC-RB-01"><sic>21:240</sic><corr>TC to RB, <date when="1847-06-23">23 June 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> and the perfection of human kindness could make it! All the more pleasant that the party was not so large as usual. The Bishop of Oxford was there two days, and He and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C argued extensively; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C being always on the religious side and the Bishop on&#x2014;the other side! But &#x201C;if he is a Humbug (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said) and of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> there can be no doubt; at least it must be owned he is a very amiable Humbug! and has a great deal of natural stuff and manly vigour in him,&#x201C;&#x2014;Storey the Sculptor was there too, with wife and daughter. And we got quite fond of the whole lot before they left; altho&#x2019; they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> Yankees.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-248" n="38:248"/>Elise got me up in a rose coloured petticoat, with a black tunic (good god!), which made me the envy of surrounding women. &#x201C;Quite a <hi rend="italic">costume</hi>!&#x201D; said one, &#x201C;May I ask, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle what Madame Elise charged you for that dress&#x201C;? said another. (Emily Baring) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">No</hi>&#x2014;you may <hi rend="italic">not,</hi> I answered, I can only tell you, it was not more than I could easily pay&#x201C;!</p>
<p>The same high bred Lady asked if she might ask whether Lady Sandwich had mentioned M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle or me in her will!!! &#x201C;Dear me! no! (I said) she did not mention Lord Ashburton in her will; how could you dream of her mentioning <hi rend="italic">us!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>We staid just the one week M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had agreed to stay&#x2014;and he was very <pb id="pg-38-249" n="38:249"/>impatient to be &#x201C;home to one&#x2019;s work&#x201C; all the while. The little mouthful of <hi rend="italic">human</hi> Life did him good however; in spite of the terrific growling he carried on <hi rend="italic">in my room.</hi> There was a Photographer (Vernon Heath) there, taking &#x201C;Views&#x201C; and &#x201C;Interiors&#x201C; at the easy rate of five guineas a day and as much french cookery and champagne as he could stow into him</p>

<p><salute>Dearest Lady Airlie!</salute> don&#x2019;t think it!&#x2014; I am not&#x2014;indeed I am not an ungrateful little Brute, I was right glad of your letter; I am always glad of any sign of remembrance from you; and my long delay in thanking you for it, has been a proof&#x2014;if you could only see it&#x2014;of my particular regard!&#x2014; You can&#x2019;t see it?&#x2014; Let me explain.&#x2014; If it had been Lady some-other-name that I didn&#x2019;t care about, who had written me a letter; I should have dashed off an answer in two lines,&#x2014;such an answer as can be written under any &#x201C;pressure of things&#x201C;&#x2014;such an answer as even &#x201C;Field Marshall the Duke of Wellington&#x201C; found always time to write.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Wellesley (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29001"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st duke of Wellington, field-marshal, and politician; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 105&#x2013;6; &#x201C;His normal routine was to rise at six and write letters until nine&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29001"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note> But being <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> care for, and have cared for ever <pb id="pg-38-250" n="38:250"/>since you wrote me the queer wee letter in half-text, I wished to write a more elaborate and &#x201C;purpose-like&#x201C; answer, than I had then leisure of mind for; and so waited for leisure of mind! Do you accept the logic of my apology? Hardly? Well never mind! The chances are, you have never turned it in your thoughts whether I had answered or not! I am so extraneous an item in your life! If I had kept my own secret, I might have been now addressing you on the (seemingly) &#x201C;Voluntary Principle&#x201C;&#x2014; But I never <hi rend="italic">do</hi> keep my own secret! that was the fatal weakness which the &#x201C;old bad Fairy,&#x201C; who came &#x201C;uninvited&#x201C; to my Xning,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;christening.&#x201C;</note> <hi rend="italic">bewished</hi> me&#x2014;to spoil all the other giftings!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the fairy tale &#x201C;Sleeping Beauty.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>Can you imagine <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, the most still standing woman of your acquaintance, suddenly made &#x201C;like unto a wheel&#x201C;?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Five weeks in Scotland, up and down among my own relations and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s; then a week at Dover with my new friend Miss Davenport Bromley! then a week at the Grange. And all the time except the one week at the Grange was M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C left at home by himself&#x2014;to try how he liked it! It was a great strain on my wifely conscience to leave him to the tender mercies of the maids, one a Methodist and a Poetess, the other a Blockhead or as he calls her a &#x201C;mooncalve&#x201C;! But I must either have done that, or sent for a Doctor and entered on a new carreer of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Mixtures for M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle.</hi>&#x201C; I think I chose the better part, and really he stood my absence extremely well&#x2014;so well that my vanity was a little aggrieved. And as a woman must always give a varnish of duty to her pleasures; I try to persuade myself&#x2014;or &#x201C;others&#x201C;&#x2014;that my larking about will have the effect of keeping off my usual winter-long Influenza, and so making me a more helpful and cheerful companion for him!&#x2014; I wish to Heaven <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would have gone too, for a longer &#x201C;change&#x201C; than that one week at the Grange; so as to make <hi rend="italic">him</hi> a more cheerful companion to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> which he &#x201C;is anything BUT&#x201C; (as my housemaid says)&#x2014; &#x201C;All work and no play makes Jack a dull Boy&#x201C;! Ach! Doesn&#x2019;t it?</p>
<p>It was very pleasant at the Grange. That Lady is adorably kind! I never in all my life met with a more considerate, unselfish Hostess. As for the caprice which I hear her frequently accused of; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have never seen a trace of it! She seems wholly occupied from morning till night in making her Husband and all about her as happy as possible in a conditional world.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:370 and 20:129.</note></p>
<p>They are going off to Nice next week&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">His</hi> gout. Nice!&#x2014; I wish they <pb id="pg-38-251" n="38:251"/>were all safe back from that fatal place, which I should have thought he would never have chosen.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s first wife, Lady Harriet, went to Nice for her health; she was returning to England when she d. in Paris, <date when="1857-05-04">4 May 1857</date>; see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570518-JWC-MR-01"><sic>32:147</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1857-05-18">18 May 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<p>Oh such a photographing there was at the Grange!

<p><salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>&#x2014;On, at last, fairly considering the Horse Question, &#x201C;Fritz&#x201C; (my own poor old quadruped) <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> your noble Grey (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might be mine), I have to admit:</p>
<p>1&#xB0;. That poor old <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi> is adequate apparently to carry me thro&#x2019; his <hi rend="italic">Namesake</hi>&#x2019;s sad Business (<hi rend="italic">more</hi> adequate, at least, than I am to be carried);</p>
<p>2&#xB0;. That <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is my old friend (almost the one friend I am to have in these dark winter months); whom it were a sin, and a remorse, to desert in his decay;</p>
<p>3&#xB0;.. That <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of any kind will be attended with trouble, with uncertainty, &#x2014;better to be avoided in this my nearly extinct condit<hi rend="italic">n;</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>And, in fine, that I am not permitted to accept your flattering Offer; but only to regard it (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I always will and must) as a beautiful bit of friendly munificence,&#x2014;and in that way, retain the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of it, as a lasting possession.&#x2014; This is the real truth of the affair.</p>
<p>Till Friday night it had never struck me that the Horses were going to Tattersall&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tattersall&#x2019;s, horse auctioneers, Hyde Park Corner, Knightsbridge, est. by Richard Tattersall (ca. <date when="1725-00-00">1725&#x2013;95</date>; <ref target="volume-38/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26996"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), <date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>.</note> <hi rend="italic">probably on Monday</hi>; and that it was necessary to have the full List of them!

<p><salute>Now Mary Dear!</salute> pray don&#x2019;t let the echoes of your voice die out of my ears&#x2014;if you can help it! It makes the difference betwixt feeling near and feeling far away!&#x2014;the difference betwixt writing offhand, as one speaks, and writing cramped apologies! You may not have anything momentous to tell; but I am not difficult to interest when it is you who are writing! Just fill a small sheet <pb id="pg-38-254" n="38:254"/>with such matter as you would <hi rend="italic">say</hi> to me, if I were sitting opposite you; and I shall be quite content!</p>
<p>Neither have I myself anything <hi rend="italic">momentous</hi> to tell, except&#x2014;I was going to say&#x2014;that I had got a new bonnet&#x2014;or rather my last winter&#x2019;s bonnet transformed into a new one&#x2014;but it suddenly flashes on me; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is by no means the most momentous thing I have to tell! a new bonnet is nothing in comparison of a new&#x2014;maid! Ah my Dear! Yes! I am changing my housemaid!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Chamberlayne.</note> I have forseen for long,&#x2014;even when she was capering about me, and kissing my hands and shawl; that this emotional young Lady would not <hi rend="italic">wear well;</hi> and that some fine day her self-conceit and arrogance would find the limits of my patience! Indeed I should have lost patience with her long ago if it hadn&#x2019;t been for her cleverness about M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s books which I fancied would make <hi rend="italic">him</hi> extremely averse to parting with her; as cleverness of that sort is not a common gift with Housemaids. But not at all&#x2014;at least not in prospect&#x2014; He says she is &#x201C;such an affected fool,&#x201C; and so heedless in other respects that it is quite agreeable to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> &#x201C;that she should carry her fantasticalities and incompetences elsewhere&#x201C;! She had calculated on being indispensable, on the score of the Books; and was taking since soon after my return from Scotland a position in the House which was quite prepostious; domineering towards the cook, and impertinent towards <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> picking and choosing at her <hi rend="italic">work</hi>&#x2014;in fact not behaving like a <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> at all, but like a <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> who,&#x2014;for a caprice, or a wager, or anything except wages and board,&#x2014;was condescending to exercise light functions in the house; <hi rend="italic">provided</hi> you kept her in good humour with gifts and praises! When M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">attention</hi> was directed to her procedure; he saw the intolerableness as clearly as I did; so I was quite free to try conclusions with the Girl&#x2014;either she should apologize for her impertinence and engage (like Magdelen Smith) &#x201C;to turn over a new leaf&#x201C;; or she should (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said) &#x201C;carry her fantasticalities and incompetences elsewhere&#x201C;! She chose, of course, the worser part; and I made all the haste possible to engage a Girl in her place, and make the fact known&#x2014;that so I might protect myself against <hi rend="italic">Scenes</hi> of reconciliation, which to a woman as old and nervous as I am, are just about as tiresome as Scenes of altercation! All sorts of <hi rend="italic">Scenes</hi> cost me my sleep, to begin with! and are a sheer <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> of vital power; which one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">servant</hi> at least ought really not to cost one!</p>
<p>I am going to try a new arrangement; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> of keeping two <hi rend="italic">women,</hi> experienced, or considering themselves so,&#x2014;to do an amount of work between them which any one good experienced Servant could do singly,&#x2014;having hitherto proved unmanageable with me. I have engaged a little girl<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Florence Morrison.</note> of the neighbourhood (age about fifteen) to be <hi rend="italic">under</hi> the Scotch woman&#x2014; She is <hi rend="italic">known</hi> to me <pb id="pg-38-255" n="38:255"/>as an honest, truthful industrious little girl. Her Parents are rather superior people in their station&#x2014; The Father a <hi rend="italic">Collector</hi> on the boats&#x2014; She is used to work, but not at all to what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s Father would have called &#x201C;the curiosities and niceities&#x201C; of a House like this. So I shall have trouble enough in licking her into shape. But <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> is always a bearable thing for me in comparison with <hi rend="italic">irritation.</hi> The chief drawback is, that the Mother is sickly and this child has been her main stay at home; and tho&#x2019; both Parents have willingly sacrificed their own convenience to get their Child into so <hi rend="italic">respectable</hi> a place; my fear is, that after I have <hi rend="italic">had</hi> the trouble of licking her into shape, the Mother under the pressure of her home difficulties may be irresistible tempted to take her home again&#x2014; Well! there is an excellent Italian Proverb. &#x201C;The person who <hi rend="italic">considers</hi> everything will never decide on anything&#x201C;!&#x2014; Meanwhile Elizabeth looks much more <hi rend="italic">alive,</hi> and cheerful since she had this change in view&#x2014;and I shall be delivered from the botheration of two rival queens in the kitchen at all events! That I shall have to fetch the Books and do the sewing myself, will perhaps&#x2014;&#x201C;keep the Devil from my elbow&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I had a letter from my Aunt Ann the other day. The first I have had from any of them since I was at Craigenvilla&#x2014;in spite of entreaties and remonstrances onmy part. She tells me that maidservant<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Ferguson; unidentified further.</note> whom Grace &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">converted</hi>&#x2019; some years ago, is still <hi rend="italic">praying</hi> earnestly for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle! She has been at it a long while now, and must be tired of writing to my Aunts to ask whether they had heard &#x201C;if anything had happened through her prayers&#x201C;!!!&#x2014; I will send you Anns letter; burn it before or after having read it; as you like! Does it amuse you to read letters (good in their way) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> addressed to yourself? Tell me that; for if it does, I could often, at the small cost of an extra stamp, send you on any letter that has pleased myself, without putting you to the trouble of returning them.</p>
<p>I am afraid you will not have so many visitors to enliven you in the winter; and then you will take to thinking it was livelier at Thornhill, with your window looking on the street. Oh my Dear! I wonder how the Doctor is so angelically patient with your hankering after the old House, when he has made the new one so lovely for you! Yet I can understand all that about the old House. I can, who am a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi></p>
<p>5 Cheyne Row &#x2F; <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> [<date when="1862-11-04">4 November 1862</date>]</p>
<p>Dearest Mary</p>
<p>I wrote to you last night; but was interrupted before I had finished. And this morning, I had to go up to Bath House soon after breakfast, by appointment, <pb id="pg-38-256" n="38:256"/>to see Lady Ashburton, who was to have set off for Nice tomorrow. I calculated on being home in time for finishing and posting my letter. I could not get away till four o&#x2019;clock which would have made me too late for our Chelsea General Post.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Letters for the Provincial Mails can be posted at the Town Pillar Boxes till 5 p.m.&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Post Office Directory</hi> [<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>]).</note> but it was just as well so; for the first thing I saw on coming in was your letter on the table.</p>
<p>So I begin a new letter for you to read <hi rend="italic">first</hi>; that you may not have to read all thro the other, under the impression that your letter had not reached me&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest; I have already pretty well said my say for this time, on the accompanying two sheets.</p>
<p>I found a wonderful complication at Bath House. and only the <hi rend="italic">Baby</hi> starts tomorrow!! of course accompanied&#x2014;by two nurses, men servants. and Lady A&#x2019;s sister in law.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two nurses were Corbett (unidentified further) and Jane (Jeannie) Bean (b. ca. <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) from the Isle of Skye; the footman was James Bailey (b. ca. <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>). Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s sister-in-law was Maria Louisa Stewart-Mackenzie, known as &#x201C;Mrs. George.&#x201C;</note> It was settled while I was there that Lord A should follow on Saturday&#x2014;and as for the Lady; she has suddenly taken a notion she is in the family way again!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pregnancy was apparently &#x201C;imaginary&#x201C; (Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 91).</note> And her D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Dr. Richard Quain.</note> declares she must not stir from the sofa (on which I found her) the whole winter!!&#x2014; While Lord A again cannot stand a winter in London! A pretty mess!</p>
<closer><salute>Yours lovingly</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>It may seem impertinent, when you have a <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="small-caps">DR</hi></hi> &#x201C;all to yourself. to offer you advice about your treatment of yourself&#x2014; But surely, with that nice carriage it would be good for you to <hi rend="italic">not</hi> stay so much at home!&#x2014; If i were to be taken care of you would make me <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> somewhere <hi rend="italic">every day,</hi> to stir me up! Why not take the same care of <hi rend="italic">yourself.</hi> I am sure staying at home alone and <hi rend="italic">thinking</hi> is very apt to bring on &#x201C;feverish colds.&#x201C; A journey to Dumfries now and then, not doing more than you have strength for at one time; but just to amuse you and see your friends there, would be better for you I am sure than blue pill. Falling into stagnation and <hi rend="italic">lowness</hi> is always the first step with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to falling into a long <hi rend="italic">cold.</hi></p></ps>

<p>The last week has been a little enlivened for me by almost daily visits at Bath House; where the Lord and the Lady were going on like two buckets at a well in point of health<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Taking turns at being ill.</note>&#x2014;and their journey postponed until today. They were to start this morning at ten finally&#x2014;but I shall not be sure, till I have been up and seen the gates closed.</p>
<p>They were very urgent that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and I would go with them or to them for two or three months. I should have liked it so much! I who was never out of this Island!

Countess Pepoli dead, dear clever litte M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Twisleton dead, Lady Sandwich dead, almost all the rest gone away, not to return till the winter is past and gone. And the winter, it is inferred from premature Robin-red-breasts&#x2014;multitudinous &#x201C;red-rowans&#x201C; &#x26;c&#x2014;will be a long and severe one.

Do not <hi rend="italic">say</hi> or hint to her anything of that:&#x2014;and on the whole, knowing how excessively unwilling I am to write the smallest Note, you will so lead the matter as to spare me any trouble but a minimum! This is all I wanted,&#x2014;in a kind of sad honour to old days now far away. And if the Lady is to stay &#x2018;all Winter,&#x2019; there is of course no hurry in it. Report to me when you see good.</p>
<p>For ten days past, or more, I have been below par: had to take blue pill, got a whiff of cold, have been endlessly hurried about, and so tormented as I never yet was with Proofsheets (<hi rend="italic">un</hi>manageable altogether!)&#x2014;in the dark muddy frosty foggy, and every way bitter &#x26; disagreeable weather. Heigho! Maria is gone too,&#x2014;&#x201C;no work to be had out of her, except her small utilities to <pb id="pg-38-263" n="38:263"/>me in the Book way&#x201C;;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">went</hi> last week; and a new <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> specimen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Florence Morrison.</note> is come, and of course <hi rend="italic">novelties</hi> and bother in the small way.</p>
<p>However I fancy myself fairly round the corner now; <hi rend="italic">getting</hi> mastery of my sorrows &#x26; Proofsheets; and rising to the old moderate elevation. Tell Sister Jean; she has sent me two or three Notes (the last this morning); and, sinner that I am, there was no possibility hitherto of replying.</p>
<p>Poor Lord Ashburton lies dangerously ill at Paris:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons were at the H&#xF4;tel Bristol, rue du Faubourg St. Honor&#xE9;, Paris. He &#x201C;fell ill within a few days of their arrival &#x2026; and remained seriously so for eight months&#x201C; (Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 91).</note> they were so far on the road to Nice for winter,&#x2014;no end of struggling &#x26; confusion in getting away;&#x2014;and at Paris he was found, last thursday morning, to have got inflammation of the lungs! You may figure our anxieties  Nothing definite of report comes this morning: the one thing we can build upon is that the inflamn does not spread. His death w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a heavy loss &#x26; sorrow to us,&#x2014;a black consumat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of what there has already been!</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>This is only a line to announce the safe arrival of the ham, with absolutely &#x201C;nothing to pay&#x201C;! which I found most extraordinary! for altho you might have paid the <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi> to London; I can&#x2019;t conceive how you managed to pay the <hi rend="italic">porterage</hi> from the Station to Chelsea! Pray tell me, for it is a possibility worth knowing. You cant think how much more respectable my larder looks since that ham was dangling from its ceiling. Thank you, thank you! Dearest! for all your kindness! <hi rend="italic">It</hi> came (after the general post hour) yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Why then not have time enough to write a decently long letter by <hi rend="italic">todays</hi> general post?&#x2014; Because Dear I am full of anxiety and have no heart to write pleasantly.</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton is lying dangerously ill at a Hotel in Paris, and day after day it is a waiting for the French Post in terror that it will bring the news of his death, and the news it <hi rend="italic">does</hi> bring every day is not of a sort to make one look forward more hopefully to the morrow</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s sister.</note> wrote to me last Friday, by Lady A&#x2019;s desire, to tell us he <pb id="pg-38-264" n="38:264"/>was dreadfully ill. She (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> A) did not mean to go to them at first her own Husband being ill in London. But the Saturdays accounts being still more alarming, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther left here for Paris by the night train and such is the rapidity of travelling and of Posts in these days that tho&#x2019; she only left London on Saturday night, I have had two letters from her since her arrival in Paris<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trains left Victoria Station, London, at 8 p.m. and arrived in Paris at 7:20 a.m.</note> one yesterday morning!! and one today (Tuesday)!!</p>
<p>Oh my Dear! think of the supposed cause of this illness damp sheets! Could such things as happen to these immensely rich people even happen to your Husband or mine?&#x2014; But he is so <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> this man so broken in constitution, that one must fear the worst for him in any violent attack&#x2014;he has no stamina to hold out long against it.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>The last of the four notes I inclosed, which had come a few hours before I wrote to you, made us expect the worst; and as the day went on, we could not help expecting the worst with more and more of certainty. The same night we were talking very sadly of Lord Ashburton almost already in the past tense, M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C saying; &#x201C;God help me! since I am to lose <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> the kindest, gentlest, friend[l]iest man in my Life here! I may say the one <hi rend="italic">Friend</hi> I have in the World&#x201C;!&#x2014; And I, walking up and down in the room, as my way is when troubled in mind, had just answered; &#x201C;It&#x2019;s no use going to bed and trying to <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> in this suspense&#x201C;; when the door opened and a letter was handed me. It was from Paris, a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> letter that day! I durstn&#x2019;t open it. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C impatiently took it from me; but was himself so agitated that he couldnt read it when he had it, At last he exclaimed &#x201C;better&#x201C;! &#x201C;I see the one word &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">better,</hi>&#x201C; nothing else! look there! is not that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">better</hi>&#x201C;? To be sure it was! And you may imagine our relief! and our thankfulness to Lady A and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anstruther for not losing a moment in telling us! The letters go on more and more favourable.</p>
<p>The D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. David Christison (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1912-00-00">1912</date>), who had gone to Paris with Lord Ashburton, and probably Dr. Richard Quain.</note> say &#x201C;they cannot understand it.&#x201C; When do these grand D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> understand <hi rend="italic">anything?</hi> But no matter about <hi rend="italic">them!</hi> So that he is recovering whether they understand it or not!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-265" n="38:265"/>I may now tell you of my household crisis which has been happily accomplished. Maria has departed this scene, and little &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Flo</hi>&#x201C; (!) has entered upon it&#x2014;not a little <hi rend="italic">dog</hi> as you might fancy from the name, but a remarkably intelligent well-conditioned girl between 14 and 15, who was christened &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Florence,</hi>&#x201C; too long and too romantic a name for household use! She is so quick at learning, that training her is next to no trouble. And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is so pleased with the clever little creature that he has been much less aggravating than usual under a change. Maria wished to make me a <hi rend="italic">scene</hi> at parting (of course) But I brutally declined participation in it; so she rushed up to the study with her tears to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C who was &#x201C;dreadfully sorry for the poor creature.&#x201C; The &#x201C;poor creature&#x201C; had been employing her mind latterly in impressing on Elizabeth, who is weak enoug[h] to believe what mischief-makers tell her rather than the evidence of her own senses, that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was going to be overworked (!) with only an untrained Girl instead of a fine-lady Housemaid for fellow servant. and in making herself so charming and carressing for Elizabeth, that her former tyranies were forgotten, and Elizabeth who had looked quite happy at the idea of Maria&#x2019;s going, and &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> under her,&#x201C; turned suddenly round into wearing a sullen look of victimhood and declining silently&#x2014;to give me the least help in training the girl! All the better for the Girl! and perhaps also all the better for <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> But [it]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> is a disappointment to find that my Scotch Blockhead is no brighter for having her &#x201C;Bubblyjock&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A turkey; cf. <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440416-TC-JCA-01"><sic>18:14</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1844-04-16">16 April 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> taken off her! <hi rend="italic">Such</hi> a woman to have had sent four hundred miles to one!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth was from Haddington; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620622-JWC-IES-01">JWC to IES, [ca. <date when="1862-06-22">22 June</date>]</ref>.</note> M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C always speaks of her as &#x201C;that horse&#x201C; &#x201C;that Cow&#x201C; &#x201C;that Mooncalve&#x201C;! But upon my honour, it is an injustice to the horse, the cow, and even the mooncalve!&#x2014; For sample of her procedure; there is a glass door into the back court consisting of two immense panes of glass; the Cow has three several times smashed one of these sheets of glass! thro the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> carelessness, neglecting to latch it up!! <hi rend="small-caps">three</hi> times in the six months she has been here!&#x2014; And nobody before her ever smashed that door! Another thing that nobody before her ever did, in all the twenty eight or nine years I have lived in the house, was to upset the kitchen table!! and smash at one stroke nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the tumblers and glasses we had, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the china breakfast things, a Christal butter glass (my Mothers) a christal flower vase and ever so many jugs and bowels! there was a whole washing tub full of broken things! Surely honesty, sobriety, and steadiness must be grown dreadfully scarce qualities, that one puts up with such a Cook; especially, as her cooking is as careless as the rest of her doings. No variety is required of her, and she has been <hi rend="italic">taught</hi> how to do the few things M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C needs; she <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do them when she cares to take pains but <pb id="pg-38-266" n="38:266"/>every third day or so, there comes up something that provokes him into declaring &#x201C;That <hi rend="italic">Brute</hi> will be the death of me! It is really too bad to have wholesome food turned to poison.&#x201C; But I suppose she understands herself engaged by the half year, tho&#x2019; I never had any explanation with her as to the second half year. And so&#x2014;Heaven grant me patience!</p>
<p>What a pack of complaints but my Dear there is nobody but you that I would think of making them to! and it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a certain easing of nature to utter them! So forgive the mean details.</p>
<p>Love to the Doctor&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest Lady Ashburton</salute>
<p>Most sincerely do I thank you for writing to me just now! for remembering me at all with so much else to think of! what between the kindness and the sadness of your little note, I fairly fell to crying over it!&#x2014; We had been wishing so much for a word of news about Lord Ashburton; and I &#x201C;did not like&#x201C; to write to ask, for fear of bothering you. When M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C saw me crying, he fancied Lord Ashburton must be worse, and showed so much emotion, that you would have loved him for it, had you seen, and pardoned him all his &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">rongs</hi>&#x201C; (as my old nurse<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> would say).&#x2014; His eloquent praises of your dear Husband, his declaration emphatically repeated twice over &#x201C;He is the only man in the world that I care for! that I have still any pleasure in meeting! the only <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> I have left in the world!&#x2014; God help me! I wish he were well again!&#x201D;&#x2014;all that, and still more his look and tone in saying it would have gone to your heart!</p>
<p>I don&#x2019;t believe Lord Ashburton suspects how much true love is felt for him, beyond his own immediate circle. He is without exception the most unselfish man I ever saw in my life!&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C thought he looked &#x201C;so much better&#x201C; that evening we were at Bath House; he had been quite in good spirits about him since. &#x201C;if he would only stay quietly at home in his own comfortable house there, and take care of himself; it would be all right!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-38-267" n="38:267"/>You will write us two lines soon again?&#x2014; I wish to God I could do any earthly thing for your or His good!

<p>I was very disappointed at not seeing you again, but did not at all wonder!&#x2014; I knew how occupied you must be, both heart and hands.</p>

<p>I got your letter several days ago; but have not had the least minute to myself; and this is literally the first note I have written since to any address whatever. Never in my days was I kept in such a perpetual whirl of hurries and botherations,&#x2014;you know with what, and how extremely profitable <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is likely to be! In six months, if it be possible to hold out so long, I shall be thro&#x2019; the worst; and in eight or nine months hence shall have done with it altogether&#x2014;that is the one blessed quality I know in the affair.</p>
<p>I do not intend much upon the <hi rend="italic">Furstenbund</hi> [Federation of princes];<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Faced with the threat of aggression from Austria under the new emperor Joseph II (<date when="1741-00-00">1741</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), Prussia, Saxony, and Hanover, together with a number of smaller German states, instituted a confederation, with Prussia at its head, <date when="1785-07-23">23 July 1785</date> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:279). TC regarded the F&#xfc;rstenbund as the &#x201C;victorious summit of Frederick&#x2019;s Public History&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:249).</note> but of course I shall have to mention it; and if your pleasure and opportunities do lead you to examine those old Fascicles at the Hague<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strachey wrote that he had &#x201C;discovered in Holland some secret diplomatic documents calculated to throw light on the latter years of Frederick&#x2019;s life&#x201C; (G.

I am curious to know, had he any smell then (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785-00-00">5</date>, I think) of the terrible French conflagration which was so near breaking out,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Strachey found nothing; TC wrote that Frederick saw no signs of the approaching French Revolution; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:3.</note> to consume all <pb id="pg-38-269" n="38:269"/>manner of Princes and their covenants, or reduce them to a charred!&#x2014; Yours, with the kindest regard to a certain lady,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Catherine Doveton, whom Strachey m. about this time. He wrote that TC&#x2019;s letter began &#x201C;with the congratulations of Mrs. Carlyle and himself on a sentimental incident of which he had been informed&#x201C; (G.

Take one line written to you, as symbol &#x26; sample of many that I cannot get written.</p>
<p>Things have come round with me again; mostly in the old beat now again. Lord A., what was a very great relief to us, has got round; and is now waiting hopefully at Paris to gather strength, and get weather for the rail to Nice. At one time, things did look very miserable there; and we were nearly hopeless, when good news came next morning.&#x2014; The frost too is away today, thank Heaven; on <hi rend="italic">my score</hi>, as well as his.</p>
<p>Moreover, I finished a Chapter yesterday; and have had such a burning of rubbish &#x26; clips! The <hi rend="italic">sorest</hi> Chapter of all (so I think it, but they are all sore) lies now close ahead; but I shall do that too, please Heaven. Inch by inch! If one stick to the ugliest monster in Nature, hour after hour, &#x26; day after day, one does get him down, and all the <hi rend="italic">dirt</hi> &#x201C;eaten.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014; My poor old <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> is getting cracky and uncomfortable this winter; no wonder after so long tear and wear. But I get a canter on my good old Fritz (who really is a half-rational compan<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> in the absence of others) almost every afternoon; then a pipe with suspicion of brandy-and-water;&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> half an hour of real sleep; well packed under your quilt on a sofa, with old wide-awake (worn light as duffel) set on the side of face and head. Wonderfully helped, poor old wretch, in the middle of so many hindrance.</p>
<p>Jane is still afoot; not so ill at all, were not she so plauged<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scots variant of &#x201C;plagued.&#x201C;</note> with her maids and their ineptitudes just now. Our weather has been <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>, cold and ugly; especially, dark, hanging like a mortcloth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Funeral hangings, usually a black cloth draped over the coffin.</note> round all one&#x2019;s tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> &#x26; feelings.</p>
<p>Could not you get us a Photograph done of that Portrait,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014;if some chance turned up? It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very welcome here.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Blessings on you all</salute></closer></p>

Woolner reported to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1862-12-02">2 Dec.</date>, on his earlier meeting with Osborn and Lay: &#x201C;I had a glorious night this day week [<date when="1862-11-25">25 Nov.</date>] with Sherard Osborn and Mr. Lay his chief: I learned more of Chinese nature and the future politics of their government than I ever knew before. Both of them are coming here this evening and Mr. Gladstone is coming too to discuss matters Chinese; so that I expect it will be highly entertaining&#x201C; (Woolner 229).</note></p>
