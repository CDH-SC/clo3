<p>The editors wish to express their continued appreciation to individuals and institutions acknowledged previously. In addition, there are some who deserve particular mention. Among these are the National Library of Scotland and Dr. Iain Brown; the Edinburgh University Library and John Howard, Keeper of Special Collections; Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea, and the National Trust and Colonel Bruce Holford-Walker and Mrs. Geraldine Elwes; and Joe Rees. Since the last set of volumes special thanks are also due to the University of Edinburgh General Council Appeal for its extremely generous support of the project in <date when="1988-00-00">1988</date>&#x2013;<date when="1989-00-00">89</date>, and to the University of Edinburgh Development Fund, Dr. Diana Henderson and her staff, especially Alistair Lawson. Further acknowledgments will be due on publication of the next set of volumes, but among those who can already be thanked are the Pilgrim Trust; the British Academy; the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland; the Saltire Society; Emmanuel College, Cambridge; and among individuals Professor Carlisle Moore and Eluned M. Brown. Continued help has also been received, in other ways, from John Hall, new Sub-Librarian of Cambridge University Library, and Timothy Hobbs, Sub-Librarian, Trinity College, Cambridge.<pb id="lastpage-16-vii" n="16:vii"/></p>

<p>Full as the record of the Carlyles seems, they are unknown in many ways, and the present set of volumes continues to show what a high proportion of their letters is new to readers. The introduction to volumes 13 to 15 reviewed the situation at that stage, when we claimed that as many as 70 percent of their letters had not been completely printed before and that well over half had not been previously published. Of 633 letters in the present set, over 42 percent have never appeared before: 233 by Thomas and 37 by Jane; and of the remainder though 22 percent can be found with some difficulty in various collected volumes, the others have appeared incomplete, so that once more well over half these letters are only now delivered to whatever new readers they will find.</p>
<p>It might possibly be said that they tell a familiar story, with no other advantages than being complete, correctly transcribed, properly dated, explained and chronologically arranged. But this would hardly be true. They are also qualitatively different, affecting our judgment of the writers and their times. The Carlyles have often been seen as typically and conventionally Victorian; but the question arises whether we know either of them well enough for such judgments. Some of their activities are certainly unfamiliar.</p>
<p>As Jane, for example, begins to play a greater part in these years, the emphasis falls differently; more of her letters began to be kept and, as well as having an increasingly prominent role in Carlyle&#x2019;s circle, she developed one of her own. Among many who belonged to it were her feminist Liverpool and Manchester friends, Elizabeth Paulet and Geraldine Jewsbury, with whom she had meant to write a novel after the manner of George Sand; and although Jewsbury was left to finish it alone, she continuously discussed it with Jane, who arranged with Chapman and Hall for the publication of the three-volume <hi rend="italic">Zoe</hi> in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. It is only recently that we have begun to appreciate the extensive influence of Sand on early Victorian fiction and opinion, which with Jane Carlyle was reinforced by her friendships with Mazzini and Godefroy Cavaignac, who knew the French writer personally; but she was also generally alert to advanced ideas from France, Germany and Italy. It would be wrong to overstress her liberality, but we can find similar feelings focused through such friends as Anna Jameson or correspondents such as the novelist Martha Lamont, congratulated by Jane for her protests at male complacency (<ref target="volume-17/lt-18431229-JWC-MML-01"><sic>17:222&#x2013;23</sic><corr>JWC to MML, <date when="1843-12-29">29 Dec. 1843</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-16-x" n="16:x"/>This is only one example and it would be easy to illustrate Jane&#x2019;s originality and independence, whether in her personal behavior, moral and religious opinions, or political judgments in which she differed little from her husband. It is less usual to recognize that Carlyle himself was a spokesman for independence and political freedom. Their friendship with the Italian revolutionary Mazzini was chiefly kept up by Jane, but it was Carlyle who took a strikingly outspoken liberal position on the British government&#x2019;s interception of Mazzini&#x2019;s mail. Carlyle&#x2019;s letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> (<ref target="volume-18/lt-18440618-TC-EOT-01"><sic>18:72&#x2013;4</sic><corr>TC to EOT, <date when="1844-06-18">18 June 1844</date></corr></ref>) was strongly effective in its support of justice and liberty, and was repeated in private company with a re-proof to the arrogant Lady Holland for absurdly believing the slander that Mazzini had &#x201C;kept a gaming-house&#x201D;: &#x201C;the proudest person&#x201D; in their company could not be further above it than Mazzini (<ref target="volume-18/lt-18440708-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:115&#x2013;6</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-07-08">8 July 1844</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>We are reminded that in these years Carlyle was seen as a champion of national independence, and was the friend of many European revolutionaries, German, French, Polish, and Italian. We notice his caring little for the Prussian ambassador (&#x201C;Alas, Bunsen is not beautiful to me!&#x201D; [<ref target="volume-18/lt-18441222-TC-LHB-01"><sic>18:295</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1844-12-22">22 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>]), but much for Richard Plattnauer, a Prussian political exile, even to the extent of cheerfully welcoming him to their own home after Plattnauer&#x2019;s cautious release from a lunatic asylum. Much of this independence came from Carlyle&#x2019;s Scottishness, his &#x201C;Covenanting&#x201D; sympathies, or can be found in his attraction to the seven-teenth-century Puritan revolution; and his essential truth and integrity were recognized at this time in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> and were to attract even the national and revolutionary leaders of Young Ireland (Gavan Duffy and others) who were to meet him in 
<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.</p>
<p>The Scottishness of the Carlyles has had surprisingly little attention, and for the moment can have no more than a momentary reference. But these were the heroic years of the Disruption of the Scottish Church, when more than a third of its ministers were ready to give up their homes and stipends in the cause of independence. To the visiting American Julia Ward Howe it seemed a rather inexplicable &#x201C;movement tending to disestablishment&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-16/lt-18430527-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:184</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-05-27">27 May 1843</date></corr></ref>), but to Jane it was a concern for tears (<ref target="volume-16/lt-18430714-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:275&#x2013;6</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-14">14 July 1843</date></corr></ref>), and to Carlyle, as to many of his countrymen&#x2014;for he cared little for the Church itself&#x2014;a matter of national pride and independence. He rises to admiration at the &#x201C;lump of an old woman, half-<foreign>haveril</foreign> [idiot] half-genius&#x201D; who acted in defiance of the great magnate the Duke of Buccleuch by giving for a new church the only unoccupied patch of ground he did not control: &#x201C;&#x2018;I got it from the Lord and I will give it to the Lord&#x2019;;&#x2014;and there the Free Kirk it seems in spite of Duke and Devil is to be!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-17/lt-18430830-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:102</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-30">30 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>Carlyle&#x2019;s published works can speak for themselves, but the letters <pb id="pg-16-xi" n="16:xi"/>of this time show the completion and reception of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> and the end of his persistent struggle to find the right form for his work on the Cromwellian period; and only by collecting the letters and studying them with his scattered drafts for <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> has it been possible to see why he found the book so difficult to write. In both <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> he turned from history to fundamental questions of the day: &#x201C;There is no use in writing of things past,&#x201D; he told Emerson, &#x201C;unless they can be made in fact things present&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-14/lt-18420719-TC-RWE-01"><sic>14:229</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1842-07-19">19 July 1842</date></corr></ref>). Nor was his radicalism confined to the rhetoric of the published works. His chosen correspondents were often radical or reformist, such as Samuel Bamford, friends such as Mill, Harriet Martineau, the Wedgwoods, or the younger Charles Buller, or Thomas Ballantyne, the free-trading liberal editor of the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian</hi>.</p>
<p>Both the Carlyles carried their convictions into practice. His sense of distress among the people runs through his letters, like his recollection in <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> of how the voice of the Viennese populace &#x201C;crying to their Kaiser: Bread! Bread!&#x201D; had given Gl&#xfc;ck &#x201C;the ground-tone of the noblest passage&#x201D; in his opera <hi rend="italic">Iph&#xE9;genie en Aulide</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 2:194). Early in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> such distress seemed less in London than elsewhere, &#x201C;yet you cannot walk along the streets without seeing fearful symptoms of it. I declare I begin to feel as if I should not hold my peace any longer&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-16/lt-18430106-TC-MAC-01"><sic>16:6</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1843-01-06">6 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>). As best they could, both he and Jane tried to help individuals directly, and both were closely bound to Carlyle&#x2019;s family&#x2014;shopkeeping, tenant-farming and housepainting in Scotland&#x2014;who kept them in touch with everyday realities.</p>
<p>Carlyle writes to his emigrant brother Alick, &#x201C;No abatement &#x2026; yet visible of the <hi rend="italic">Universal</hi> distress. Rejoice that you are out of it&#x201D;; for the younger brother and family had felt driven to leave for North America. Most of the letters they exchanged have been published before; but we can now see how the whole Carlyle family was involved, not only giving financial help but in preparation, obtaining expert advice, helping with the actual departure and continued communication which was eventually to lead to a family reunion through the marriage of Carlyle&#x2019;s Scottish niece Mary Aitken to Alick&#x2019;s son Alexander, who went on to live with him at 5 Cheyne Row and edited many volumes of his letters. Nor was it only Alick who experienced emigration: he had been preceded by their elder stepbrother, John, their brother-in-law Robert Hanning, numerous friends, and several more distant relatives. There is, in fact, no other collective contemporary record which so vividly tells what the experience of emigration meant, from the scene of departure among their tearful neighbors (<ref target="volume-16/lt-18430623-TC-MAC-01"><sic>16:214</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1843-06-23">23 June 1843</date></corr></ref>) to Carlyle&#x2019;s imagining (from his brother&#x2019;s description) the family on their <pb id="lastpage-16-xii" n="16:xii"/>new farm, &#x201C;planting Indian corn, the Father digging holes, and the little ones dropping-in grains&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-18/lt-18440818-TC-AC-01"><sic>18:186</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1844-08-18">18 Aug. 1844</date></corr></ref>). It is an aspect, like others, neglected by historians.</p>
<p>These are no more than a few examples of many changes in our conception of the Carlyles and their times which biography has not been able to take into account; and, extensive as the whole archive is, new letters are still being found. The last set of volumes made use for the first time of a large collection of family letters which came from a solicitor&#x2019;s office in Arbroath. The present one begins to draw on the vast correspondence of both Carlyles with the Barings and Ashburtons, to which we have been able to add many letters previously unknown. Later volumes will begin to reveal much more of the remarkable circle which gathered round the Ashburtons.</p>
<p>The introduction to volume 13 briefly mentioned the extent to which texts in various collections of the letters have been bowdlerized or modified for the convenience of both biographers and editors, and this continues to be apparent. In the present volumes we have continued to follow, as exactly as possible, what the Carlyles wrote. As Jane&#x2019;s letters increase in relative extent, her misspellings and other eccentricities begin to be an embarrassment, but only a proportion of them are noted. It is hoped that readers will feel that they can trust the editors and will not be inconvenienced.</p>
<p>One editorial complexity connected with Jane was not explained in the introduction to the first volume. Almost all of her letters are given from her own manuscript, but many of the notes that Carlyle wrote for them are taken from what are referred to in the headnotes as &#x201C;long-hand copies&#x201D; in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library (and which in subsequent volumes will be referred to as &#x201C;copies&#x201D;). These were from copies of the letters made for Carlyle and bequeathed to Froude, who had agreed to finish Carlyle&#x2019;s undertaking, most of which eventually appeared, mainly as the <hi rend="italic">Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle Prepared for Publication by Thomas Carlyle edited by James Anthony Froude</hi>. In fact, as Alexander Carlyle tells us and newly discovered papers confirm, there were once two such sets of copies, though the second, less-complete one now seems lost. Hence it arises that we have a partial explanation for the survival of some of Carlyle&#x2019;s notes as recorded by Froude even when they are not to be found with the copied letters in the Berg Collection. If this mainly concerns the editorially minded, it raises the hope that there may be still further letters of the Carlyles yet to be found and added to their great record.</p>

<p>Your Bulletin of yesterday gave us a great alarm.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About the health of John Sterling (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26408"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), living in Falmouth.</note> Mr Sterling instantly proceeded to pack portmanteaus, be in readiness for a race to Falmouth;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26408/26406"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist, John&#x2019;s father; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350600-TC-JHLH-02"><sic>8:144</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1835-06-14">14 June 1835</date></corr></ref>. He lived at South Pl., Knightsbridge.</note> but your Sister&#x2019;s news today,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Maria Fox (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), Caroline&#x2019;s sister, also living in Falmouth.</note> for which a Servant from South-Place was in waiting, have happily stilled all that; and given us, as you may imagine, the welcomest relief. We are now terribly angry at your Patient; now that we are no longer so terribly frightened about him! We trust and hope the danger is now past&#x2014;till the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> imprudence, at least!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >While helping the cleaning maids lift a heavy table, Sterling broke a blood vessel and hemorrhaged extensively; see <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:242.</note></p>
<p>Mrs Sterling is kept in the dark;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hester Sterling, b. Coningham (d. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), John&#x2019;s mother; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:130</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>. She had been in ill health herself.</note> and yet, as we may suppose, not wholly. She sees, by her Husband&#x2019;s packings, and disconsolate looks, that something is wrong at Falmouth; tho&#x2019; hitherto she knows not what. This is a twilight more annoying to her than the clear light, as we now have it, would be. I conclude that Mr Sterling will instruct her accurately how it stands, today or tomorrow. She is in her usual state of strength, or a degree beyond it. If we had but tomorrow&#x2019;s post also favourable,&#x2014;we should then give free scope to our <hi rend="italic">anger</hi>, casting the terror mostly away!</p>
<p>Many thanks to you for your care of poor Verran.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Michael Verran (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>), who helped save a fellow miner and thereby evoked TC&#x2019;s praise and starting of a small fund for his benefit; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421111-TC-JOST-01"><sic>15:175</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-11-11">11 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421214-TC-JOST-01"><sic>228&#x2013;29</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-12-14">14 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jenny sent me a small welcome Note last week;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet (Jenny) Carlyle Hanning (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>), TC&#x2019;s sister. Her husband, Robert (d. <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320123-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>6:99</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1832-01-23">23 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>), had emigrated to the U.S. and Canada, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, and she was staying with her mother.</note> and I have felt ever since as if I were <hi rend="italic">doubly</hi> in your debt. I am terribly busy; and so many interruptions occur;&#x2014;but surely I might contrive to find half an hour some day for scribbling half a word of news to my dear good Mother! Well; I decide on doing it today,&#x2014;today when my whole day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">task</hi>, by one foolish botheration and another, has gone to the winds; and it is now time for my going out without having got <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> done! I will have it to say at least: I wrote a scrape of a pen to my Mother!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane is taking some medicines of John&#x2019;s, and really finds some benefit, I think,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she has to complain sadly that Jack will <hi rend="italic">take no hold of her</hi>, but seems almost to forget both that she is a Patient and he a Doctor. He is indeed terribly <hi rend="italic">loose;</hi> in great <hi rend="italic">haste;</hi> for most part; and flies round everything, too like a bundle of loose <foreign><hi rend="italic">thrums</hi></foreign> [threads],&#x2014;not at all like a hard <hi rend="italic">hammer</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">hit</hi> it well!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; The good Doctor: we saw him yesterday, <hi rend="italic">incidentally</hi> here, his Patient being out on some excursion;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle served as personal physician to William Ogilby (usually spelled Ogilvie by TC), who suffered from mental illness.</note> so that Jack could get down to us. He and I walked up far into the Town together; and had talk enough, amid the noisy <foreign><hi rend="italic">glarry</hi></foreign> [muddy] streets: he seems as well as I have seen him for many years; a great comfort to us to see here once a week!</p>
<p>My own health keeps good; better than it used to do. I am fast getting ready something for publication too,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is not <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> yet; it is something more immediately applicable to the times in hand.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, to be pbd. in <date when="1843-04-00">April</date>.</note> I do hope you will see it soon,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is a terrible business getting a <pb id="pg-16-6" n="16:6"/>thing wriggled out of the confusions it stands amid, and made ready for presenting to mankind! It is like <hi rend="italic">building</hi> a dry <hi rend="italic">brick-house</hi> out of a <hi rend="italic">quagmire</hi> of clay and <foreign>glar!</foreign>&#x2014; As Tom Garthwaite said of his strained leg, &#x201C;we must not stop for strained legs, we will <hi rend="italic">work out the <foreign>strean</foreign></hi> [strain].&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite, Ecclefechan tailor; coterie speech.</note> Tom did &#x201C;work out the <foreign><hi rend="italic">strean</hi></foreign>&#x201D;: how much more ought I!</p>
<p>We have had hardly any winter here yet; hard<supplied>[ly]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted in MS.</note> a half-dozen days of frost, and never more than two at a time; the weather often warm as in the fine days of Spring. I doubt, it is no good sign of a season; perhaps there will be a cold enough summer to make up for this. However, we ought to be glad of good weather in the meanwhile, and not <hi rend="italic">anticipate</hi> evil too much.&#x2014; The distress of the Poor, I apprehend, is less here at present than in almost any other large Town: yet you cannot walk along the streets without seeing frightful symptoms of it. I declare I begin to feel as if I should not hold my peace any longer; as if I should perhaps <hi rend="italic">open</hi> my mouth, in a way that some of them are not expecting! We shall see, if this Book were once done.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Sterling continues very weak; not immediately in danger, but Jane thinks her radically all wrong. We had a notice too yesterday that <hi rend="italic">John</hi> Sterling the son, far away off at Falmouth, had been straining himself with some heavy lift, and had burst a bloodvessel in his lungs, which had as near as possible killed him! He is getting slowly better, we now understand; but is as weak as water.</p>
<p>Poor Isabella does not improve,&#x2014;nor will she, till she have been
<hi rend="italic">worse</hi>, I suppose.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle, b.

Margaret Carlyle also lived there. In poor health for some time, Isabella was pregnant and seems to have been mentally depressed.</note> It is a great comfort to me to think of Jenny being with you. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> lights the fire; that is right.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>You find here inclosed a Document, which you have to carry over to Postie at Ecclefechan and sign; whereupon Postie will hand you two sovereigns for it. You are to give one of these to Isabella, and the other to Jenny who is now up stairs with my Mother; and say that they are New-Year&#x2019;s Gifts from me, with many brotherly salutations and &#x201C;good wishes for the season,&#x201D; to both the one and the other. Having done this, your commission for the present is ended; and I will thank you beforehand.&#x2014; Solely farther, if you have an old Newspaper, you may direct it hither in token that the thing came <hi rend="italic">safe;</hi> and in that case you can ask of Alick too whether his <hi rend="italic">two</hi> things were safe; and I will take the Newspaper as a sign in the affirmative from him too. I have little doubt but all goes safe that one hands in that way: but an express word or sign to that effect is also satisfactory. You are all terribly <foreign><hi rend="italic">sweer</hi></foreign> [reluctant] to write; therefore I suggest a Newspaper as handier; not by any means as equally good.</p>
<p>But, in truth, my dear Brother, I consider that you might easily do worse than actually set about <hi rend="italic">learning to write freely</hi>, and have more than once counselled. Suppose, you went up stairs, to the end-room, some day, with a fire lighted (which will dissipate the damp too), and all your men fairly at work out of doors; and then, taking a good roomy sheet of paper, honestly set yourself to fill it for me! It would be productive of several good effects, and no evil one at all! You have only to commit yourself heartily to the business, and <hi rend="italic">try</hi>. Your rugged Annandale <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uptake</hi> is altogether right for us; good and sound: you have only to learn <hi rend="italic">writing it down</hi>. Mind the <hi rend="italic">periods</hi> and points; the spelling; the dividing at the end of the line by syllables &#x26;c;&#x2014;above all to <hi rend="italic">try</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">persevere!</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>My news are all in the bit of Paper which I write to my Mother; which she will communicate to you. I am very busy; have many <hi rend="italic">interruptions</hi> which I cannot stave off. <closer><salute>My blessings with you dear honest Brother, and farewell!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Miss Wilson,</salute>
<p>Thanks, hearty tho&#x2019; in the utmost hurry, for your good kind Note of yesterday. How happy for me too, were I on the Malvern Hills, with the green earth under me, the eternal sky over me, and God&#x2019;s Silence round me, that I might consider deeply of many things! Instead of Belial&#x2019;s Tumult,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of TC&#x2019;s many terms for London.</note> in which one can consider nothing! Ballad-singers, &#x201C;without food for the last three weeks,&#x201D; bray under my windows; an enchanted young lady drums her hapless piano to no purpose on the other side of the wall,&#x2014;an emblem to me of a whole world <hi rend="italic">enchanted;</hi> possessed by Falsities&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">Devils</hi> as they used to be called); following merely one another and the Devil! Truly one had need to be a &#x201C;man of genius&#x201D; to do anything considerable here.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesterday I straightway despatched your order to the Booksellers; explaining it, as I hope, to the meanest capacity. On the first Monday of every month, what is called &#x201C;Magazine Monday,&#x201D; any London Bookseller can with perfect ease do such a feat as you require: but these people of mine, &#x201C;Chapman and Hall, 188 Strand,&#x201D; have superior facilities for conveyance; and probably can manage directly what you want. I impressed upon them your probably <hi rend="italic">speedy</hi> return to Town,&#x2014;which I myself wanted to believe. I sent them a Cover with your Address, in which they were to announce to you what they <hi rend="italic">had</hi> found it possible to do; and where the Book, if any Book, was to be inquired for in Wor&#x2019;ster or Malvern. There is little doubt but it will be all right.</p>
<p>John Sterling has alarmed us all by a new hemorrhage,&#x2014;rupture of a blood-vessel, brought on by most imprudent useless over-working of himself; &#x201C;lifting of tables,&#x201D; they say, &#x201C;to save servants trouble&#x201D;! He lies very weak, but happily thought out of danger for the present; and will have to lie, the Doctor says, for at least a month to come.</p>
<p>Well; I think you had better <supplied>[come?]</supplied> back to London now, Belial&#x2019;s tumult tho&#x2019; it be!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks, far heartier than thanks often are, for the munificent Gift of Books that arrived here yesterday. I think I may say,&#x2014;considering both the outer body of these ten handsome massive Volumes, and the spirit of sterling enduring Wisdom that lies contained in them,&#x2014;I never received so valuable a Present of Books before. It happens too that of all these works, known to me from old times, I possess no complete legible copy till now, except of Shakspeare alone.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the books sent by Moxon, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430112-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [ca. <date when="1843-01-12">12 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> I might long have gone without making the due effort to get them; and now here they all are, to consult, and commune with, when I like! I hold myself, very literally, much <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to you; <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> by a real service done me, to do you the like, if I ever can.</p>
<p>This Enterprise, of serving all the world by offering them good Books on cheap terms, is one that ought to prosper! Small handy volumes, one page cut into four, would please me better, as I said to you the other night. But these too are right handsome volumes, tho&#x2019; weightly ones; and all the world ought to be very well content. I bid you, Go on, with more and more success.</p>
<p>Hoping some chance may lead you hither again before long.</p>

Robert Baillie (<date when="1599-00-00">1599</date>&#x2013;<date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>), presbyterian divine.</note> I have read the <hi rend="italic">Life;</hi> which I find profitable to correction, for illumination, on this hand and on that. It is as clear and complete as a <hi rend="italic">Life of Baillie</hi> could, at this date of time, be made; I suppose we shall never know more of him than you have contrived to make out.</p>
<p>And now I think you have a right to feel, your long rough task fairly done, that you have accomplished a very genuine piece of service to all men, in thus culling <hi rend="italic">Baillie&#x2019;s Letters</hi> from the tombs; fairly into visibility, into new centuries of accessible continuance!

I have yet fallen in with no Book, on those Times, better worth printing. In the name of all readers of English History, I give you thanks.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Woodrow Society</hi>, among others, sends its Books into our London Library.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Wodrow Society, founded, Edinburgh, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, for the pbn. of the works of early writers of the Church of Scotland; dissolved, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, after publishing twelve works; named after the Scottish ecclesiastical historian Robert Wodrow (<date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>&#x2013;<date when="1734-00-00">1734</date>).

<salute>Dear Caroline,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your excellent news.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About John Sterling&#x2019;s health.</note> We will not scold the poor fellow much,&#x2014;at least not till he get fully well again.</p>
<p>As to the Hero Verran, I wish you to understand that, at such a distance, and with such friends&#x2019; eyes close on the very scene, I cannot presume to form any farther judgement of his interests, but will leave them altogether to the eyes and hearts of said friends. Do, therefore, what seems to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wisest.&#x2014; Perhaps if there be, as it seems there is, in Verran&#x2019;s personal neighbourhood, a good discerning man, who will take charge of this &#xa3;20,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For details of subscription to the Verran fund, see Foot 38&#x2013;40.</note> to do his best therewith for the poor Miner&#x2019;s behoof,&#x2014;it will be wise, in several ways, to give it up to that man at once and for altogether; saying merely: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Do</hi> thy best with it for him.&#x201D; Verran may thus gain another friend, and occasional guide and patron; which may be worth more to him than several guineas. &#x201C;Twenty,&#x201D; I think, is no bad result. To find twenty persons, in any locality, who reverence worth the extent of paying one pound sterling to it, is verily something in these days. Days (as I some times feel, when I reflect sorrowfully on them) altogether unexampled since the Creation of the World, in the respect! [Even the fickle Athenians did at least put Socrates to death, had a least the grace to hate him, did not merely seek to amuse themselves with him!]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Someone (presumably Caroline Fox) has overwritten this sentence with a comment beginning &#x201C;O Thomas Carlyle why dost thou,&#x201D; the rest being illegible. Someone else, presumably at a later date, has written above the line those of TC&#x2019;s words that the superscription made illegible.</note> It is unutterable;&#x2014;and will lead to conclusions by and by.</p>
<p>Meanwhile what the good Caroline has to do is happily utterable enough,&#x2014;not abstruse or fearful at all! What I have to do is also, alas, too plain: namely to go about my business; and, with many wishes and salutations, <hi rend="italic">vanish</hi>, as one in haste and double haste; subscribing myself cordially once more</p>

<salute>My best Babbie</salute>
<p>I would have written to you yesterday forenoon; if it had not rained last Monday&#x2014; The connection of cause and effect here will not be very apparent to you&#x2014;what the rain of Monday had to do with the writing of yesterday&#x2014;but so it was&#x2014;as certainly, as that my husbands having received a <hi rend="italic">seductive</hi> letter from the <hi rend="italic">Lady Harriet</hi> a few days since will be cause of Mazzinis hearing a corn law lecture in the Strand tonight!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Baring (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1384"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), m. to William Bingham Baring (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1384/1386"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), of the Baring banking firm; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390308-TC-MAC-01"><sic>11:40</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1839-03-08">8 March 1839</date></corr></ref>. The lecture was to be in the Lowther Rooms, on the Strand.</note> &#x201C;Ah&#x201D; things are very curiously linked together in this <pb id="pg-16-20" n="16:20"/>little world&#x2014;the Chinchinopoli<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally, of the city of ceremonious greetings.</note> chains of invisible workmanship are not half so intricate as some of the connecting chains between the simplest causes and the simplest effects&#x2014;and I cannot fancy a readier way of losing one&#x2019;s wits, than just sitting down to consider how <hi rend="italic">this</hi> comes out of <hi rend="italic">that!</hi> or a readier way of settling one&#x2019;s pride on the great question of man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">free-agency!</hi></p>
<p>If you would know how the rain of Monday produced the silence of yesterday&#x2014;I should be sorry to balk your scientific curiosity&#x2014;so attend and you shall hear&#x2014; On Monday at one oclock there being every appearance of a clear, dry day I set out in an Omnibus&#x2014;to buy tea &#x26; coffee at <hi rend="italic">Fortnum &#x26; Mason&#x2019;s</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Purveyors of comestibles, in Piccadilly.</note> meaning thereafter to pay a <hi rend="italic">charitable</hi> visit to poor Darwin who was (&#x26; is) confined to the house with cold.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erasmus Darwin lived at 43 Gt. Marlborough St., Oxford St.</note> but no sooner had I issued from the Omnibus according to programme, than contrary to all human expectation, it began to rain on me&#x2014;so I made for the nearest refuge that offered itself <foreign>viz</foreign>: the London Library! being in the Library what could I do but choose myself some books?&#x2014;every thing I asked for was as usual &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">out</hi>&#x201D; so <hi rend="italic">as usual</hi> it ended in bringing away french novels&#x2014;a book of Sand&#x2019;s which I had not before seen and two of&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;Paul de Kock!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Sand, pseud. of Amandine Aurore Lucie, Baroness Dudevant, b.

JWC borrowed <hi rend="italic">Rose et Blanche</hi> (Paris, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), written by Sand in collaboration with Jules Sandeau, and de Kock&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Fr&#xE8;re Jacques</hi> (Paris, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Georgette</hi> (Paris, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>).</note> Having still however some sense of <hi rend="italic">decency</hi> remaining&#x2014;I cooly entered my name in the ledger for these books <hi rend="italic">Erasmus Darwin!</hi> to the wonderment of the bookkeeper doubtless, who must have thought me an odd sort of Erasmus! (this&#x2014;by the way) Well having the books in the house, it was natural that I should read them&#x2014;yesterday after breakfast I took up <hi rend="italic">Frere Jacques</hi>&#x2014;meaning to read in it only till the table was cleared for writing&#x2014;but it proved so amusing that hang me if I could lay it down till dinner-time when I had quite finished it&#x2014; So you see if it had not rained on Monday I should have gone to Darwins&#x2014;if I had gone to Darwin&#x2019;s I should have had no time to go to the Library. if I had not gone to the Library I should not have fetched away <hi rend="italic">Frere Jacques</hi> and but for the fascinations of <hi rend="italic">Frere Jacques</hi> I should have written to you!&#x2014; So now you see how the two things hang together the same as Lady Harriet Baring&#x2019;s love-making to my husband and Mazzini&#x2019;s hearing M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fox on the corn-law!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Johnson Fox (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10047"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), unitarian minister, journalist, and polititcian; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:240</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.

I <pb id="pg-16-21" n="16:21"/>will tell you that also&#x2014;for it is good for your morality that you should be made to reflect on this subject of cause and effect&#x2014; One can never be too much alive to the consideration that one&#x2019;s every slightest action does not end when it has acted itself, but propagates itself on and on, in one shape or other, thro&#x2019; all time and away into eternity. Lady Harriet writes to my husband that she is ill&#x2014;that she dines at four o&#x2019;clock and is allowed to go nowhere in the evenings&#x2014;to do nothing but speak&#x2014;that &#x201C;there is nobody&#x2014;(she may really say almost nobody in the world) she likes so well to speak with as him&#x201D;&#x2014; Pray mark the fine truth-giving effect of the modifying parenthesis!&#x2014; &#x201C;So he sees what a work of <hi rend="italic">charity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">piety</hi> is cut out for him&#x201D;! When a handsome, clever, and reputedly <hi rend="italic">most haughty</hi> woman appeals to the <hi rend="italic">charity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">piety</hi> of a simple man like Carlyle you may be sure she will not appeal in vain&#x2014; So he writes to her engaging to visit her on Thursday evening&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">forgets</hi> to tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi> he has done so&#x2014; Then comes a ticket of admission for one gentleman and one Lady&#x2014;to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fox&#x2019;s lecture for the same Thursday evening&#x2014;and he asks me would I like to go? The Devil puts it in my head to answer unexpectedly &#x201C;yes&#x201D;&#x2014; In fact I have been long wanting to hear this Fox lecture&#x2014;for I understand him to be a first rate speaker&#x2014;and observing that his place was this time on the straight line of the Omnibus I thought I could never have so good a chance&#x2014; &#x201C;Very well says he rather perplexedly&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot go with you&#x2014; I promised to go to Lady Harriet tomorrow evening&#x2014; Can you get any other man?&#x2014; Mazzini is the never failing man in every case of need but I would not propose him&#x2014;for young Italy<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Giovine Italia</hi>, founded <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>, in support of republican principles and national unity and independence.</note> has been horribly out of favour this long while&#x2014;seeing that I remained silent he himself however proposed him&#x2014; As <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was going <hi rend="italic">his</hi> road he felt the fairness of allowing <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to go <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>&#x2014; So now you see that chain of consequences also&#x2014;so far as it yet extends&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I myself have written a letter the consequences of which I feel more interested in than in any conceivable consequences that can follow out of the Lady Harriet&#x2019;s. After reading the Seaforth manuscript I wrote to Geraldine some of my notions about it, and she answered me in a whole <hi rend="italic">pamphlet</hi> of witty, devil-may-care objections to my objections&#x2014; &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">C&#x2019;est assez</hi></foreign> [It is enough]&#x201D; I said to myself &#x201C;if she <hi rend="italic">will</hi> run about the streets naked it is not I who am her keeper&#x201D;&#x2014; However <pb id="pg-16-22" n="16:22"/>&#x201C;she had sent on my protest to Betsy&#x201D; and accordingly in a few days came a letter from &#x201C;Betsy&#x201D; also<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Paulet.</note>&#x2014;extremely clever&#x2014;and what was more to the purpose perfectly <hi rend="italic">rational</hi>&#x2014;assuring me that I had merely &#x201C;said in other words what <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had been telling Geraldine all along&#x201D;&#x2014; Since my letters were sent from one to another I saw no need of writing to both&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Paulet being clearly the most reasonable of the two I addressed my next to her, and certainly did not conceal the displeasure which Geraldines levity had occasioned me&#x2014; Now things said <hi rend="italic">at</hi> one are more annoying than what is said <hi rend="italic">to</hi> one&#x2014;and so poor Geraldine &#x201C;moped,&#x201D; and has had &#x201C;sore eyes&#x201D;&#x2014;and seems to have been sincerely vexed&#x2014;and finally writes me the best natured, most penitent little letter in the world As nobody knows better than I do the difficulty of confessing oneself <hi rend="italic">gravely</hi> in the wrong, there is nobody more touched by such confession from another,&#x2014;so I could not help reading a part of her last letter to Carlyle and declaring that she was after all a good little soul&#x2014; Carlyle seemed never to have doubted it and winded up his praise of her with &#x201C;you should ask her to come up here for a little while; it might be of great use to her&#x201D;!&#x2014;a proposition of such a <hi rend="italic">novel</hi> character on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> part quite took me by surprise, and I sat staring at him without making any answer&#x2014; &#x201C;Why says he you seem <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi> about it&#x2014;she is very easy to do with is she not? and you like her company&#x201D;? &#x201C;Oh said I at last as to the <hi rend="italic">doing with</hi>&#x2014;have no misgivings about <hi rend="italic">that</hi> but&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;but what&#x201D;? &#x201C;Why I am afraid that having her beside me from morning till night would be dreadfully <hi rend="italic">wearing&#x201D;!</hi> &#x201C;You had Jeannie beside you from morning to night&#x2014;what would be the difference&#x201D;?!!&#x2014; &#x201C;Jeannie! Jeannie was not always in a state of emotion! dropping hot tears on my hands, and watching me and fussing me as Geraldine does!&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh as you like! only I think it would be a kindness to <hi rend="italic">the poor lonely girl</hi>&#x2014;and that her company might be useful to yourself when you have so little of mine&#x201D;&#x2014; I lay awake half the night endeavoring to resolve whether I should ask her or no&#x2014;but there was so much to be said for and against!&#x2014;a little of her would be very enlivening&#x2014;but a continuance of her does really fatigue one&#x2014;and then to say the truth&#x2014;tho I am not jealous of my husband (pray read all this into yourself and burn the letter) tho I have not only his <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of preference for me over all other women (and <hi rend="italic">habits</hi> are much stronger in him than <hi rend="italic">passions</hi>) but also his indifference to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> women <hi rend="italic">as women</hi> to secure me against jealousy&#x2014;still young women who have in them, as Geraldine has, with all her good and great qualities, a born <hi rend="italic">spirit of intrigue</hi> are perilous sort of inmates for a married pair to <pb id="pg-16-23" n="16:23"/>invite&#x2014;they may make mischief in other ways than by <hi rend="italic">seducing the husband&#x2019;s affections</hi>. Then again; it might as he said really be of use to her in several ways&#x2014;and should I let my purely selfish misgivings hinder her of the possible good&#x2014;professing as I do both to herself and other people to have a friendship for her? another argument <hi rend="italic">for</hi>, the invitation arose out of my consciousness that I am letting myself grow too indolent&#x2014;perhaps I should be the better of being roused out of my habitual still life and forced to exercise my faculties again in human speech&#x2014;especially of the intellectual sort which Geraldine takes delight in&#x2014; Still the thought of those ecstatics she goes on with introduced an immense questionability into the project&#x2014; So that it was with a hesitating mind I wrote to her finally inviting her <hi rend="italic">in a sort of a way</hi> to come &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">for two or three weeks</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and it is with an unsettled mind that I await her answer&#x2014;not knowing whether I wish it be a <hi rend="italic">yes</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">no</hi>&#x2014;and foreseeing that if she come, there will be consequences from her coming either good or evil&#x2014; I took precious good care not to tell her that the invitation originated with Carlyle&#x2014;that fact would have <hi rend="italic">been sufficiently</hi> flattering for her to have founded a whole prospective Romance on it!&#x2014;and really the sober sadness of this life weigh too heavily on me that I should have much patience with the romances of other people!&#x2014; I wish I might talk with you for a couple of hours about this and other matters&#x2014;ones mind does sometimes make such a foolish uncertain figure on paper!</p>
<p>But enough for the present&#x2014; The watch stand was for <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi>&#x2014; I sent it to her instead of the small one which I could not part with&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">other Helen</hi> has plainly not the slightest idea of going away<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Welsh and the &#x201C;other&#x201D; Helen Mitchell; for JWC&#x2019;s irritation with the latter, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421215-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:233</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-12-15">15 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and as she has behaved quite satisfactorily <hi rend="italic">since last time</hi>, I had best I think let her be doing for the present&#x2014;till some really desirable looking servant comes in my way&#x2014; I should be very much put about in exchanging her for an entire stranger, while I am capable of making so little exertion in the house myself&#x2014; I can never feel affection or confidence for her after her last misconduct&#x2014;and should no longer keep her <hi rend="italic">for her own sake</hi> As I have so often done before&#x2014;but my own interest will be best served by taking the matter leisurely and keeping her such as she is and has shown herself till I have a distinct prospect of bettering not worsening my position&#x2014; I was charmed at your discovering that gallows-expression in Carlyle&#x2019;s picture&#x2014; I have all along been calling it <hi rend="italic">Greenacre-Carlyle</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Greenacre was a notorious murderer, executed <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, the picture was Anna Fox&#x2019;s copy of Laurence&#x2019;s drawing of TC.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear good Mother,</salute>
<p>I am sitting here with a nasty <hi rend="italic">rheumatism in the back</hi>, what they call <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi>, which I caught the day before yesterday in the damp; and, what is far worse, with the obligation to go out into the country to dinner and stay all night:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Lewisham, S of the Thames and SE of London, home of Stephen Spring Rice (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>), commissioner of customs and son of TC&#x2019;s friend Lord Monteagle; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420728-TC-JOST-01"><sic>14:241</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-07-28">28 July 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> so that I am good for nothing at all as the hours go; and after an attempt at a days work, have flung it by, and taken to answer Letters!&#x2014; To whom ought I to write, in that case, if not to dear Mother withal? I will scribble you also a line before I go:&#x2014;then I will go, and dine, and stay all night (as really I was partly bound to do, having already <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> three times, in quick succession),&#x2014;and they shall look with clear eyes that see me in any adventure of the sort again for a while!</p>
<p>This rheumatism is nothing but the fruit of my own negligence in the damp &#x26;c, and perhaps the very dinner will drive it away; for I feel still whole at heart; and am indeed getting on with my work in a reasonable measure&#x2014; I have learned too not to tear myself in pieces, but to <supplied>[take]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a reasonable rest now and then: so, at bottom, there is nothing to be complained of; and I shall get my bit <supplied>[little]</supplied> Book done by and by,&#x2014;and I hope it will be a useful kind of Book; which is the best of all! It goes rather in a fiery strain, about the present condition of men in general, and the strange pass they are coming to; and, I calculate, it may awaken here and there a slumbering blockhead to rub his eyes and consider what he is about in God&#x2019;s Creation: a thing highly desirable at present. I found I could not go on with <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, or with anything else till I had disburthened my heart somewhat in regard to all that: the look of the world is really quite oppressive to me,&#x2014;eleven thousand souls in Paisley alone living on three halfpence a-day, and the Governors of the Land all busy shooting partridges and passing Corn-Laws the while: it is a thing no man with a speaking tongue in his head is entitled to be silent about!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420510-TC-TSS-01"><sic>14:183</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1842-05-10">10 May 1842</date></corr></ref>. and cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:3, 171. Paisley, then a textile town in SW Scotland, is 7 mi. WSW of Glasgow.</note> My only difficulty is that I have far too <hi rend="italic">much</hi> to say, and require great address in deciding how to say it.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane continues on foot; really better than she has been in past winters. <pb id="pg-16-27" n="16:27"/>Our winter here, indeed, is more like a nasty, slobbery sunless Summer; <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign>[mud] and damp are the only things we complain of, no <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> to hurt even a sickly Jane. There have been only two days that I have noticed with decisive ice; no snow but one shower that lay only a few hours, and then was all <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> again. I believe you have it harsher in the North: but I hope you, dear Mother, take <hi rend="italic">good</hi> care of yourself; and as Jenny is there to light the fire, never rise till things are all aired about you. <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> you follow this course? I have sent you no flannel jackets this year,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have good warm stockings of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> spinning on me! I wish I knew what to send, or <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing I could do for you: it were surely <hi rend="italic">much</hi> my part, a duty and a great happiness alike, to do it and send it. You look down from the picture-canvas here upon me, so patient and good;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maxwell&#x2019;s portrait of Margaret Carlyle had been painted the previous summer and hung in Cheyne Row in <date when="1842-10-00">Oct.</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421017-TC-JCA-01"><sic>15:129&#x2013;30</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1842-10-17">17 Oct. 1842</date></corr></ref> and 13:frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the vol. 13 table of contents page].</note> and will not tell me what you want!

One of my Notes today has been to decline the proferred visit till at least &#x201C;bright summer weather come,&#x201D;&#x2014;if then!</p>
<p>Last night Jane went, under due escort, to hear an Anti-Corn-Law Lecture, which seemed to have amused her somewhat;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1843-01-21">21 Jan.</date>, reported that Buckingham, the speaker, &#x201C;concluded amidst tremendous applause &#x2026; followed by three times three cheers for free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws.&#x201D;</note> and I went, the while, to sit for an hour with a certain family called Baring (the American <hi rend="italic">Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Baring (<sic><date when="1777-00-00">1777</date></sic><corr><date when="1773-00-00">1773</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1380"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st Baron Ashburton, was trained in his father&#x2019;s financial house and later sent to the U.S. to extend its business operations.

It was melancholy enough, in my <hi rend="italic">rheumatic</hi> humour, to look round on all that. A proud, clever woman, of great birth and wealth, in the middle of splendour there; and very probably dying of consumption; certainly very miserable in heart, independent of her illness. I said to myself, &#x201C;What is the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of your greatness, poor Lady Harriet? Why <hi rend="italic">do</hi> men fret themselves to death for what is worth, it would seem,&#x2014;nothing!&#x201D;&#x2014; They are extremely polite people; and a little talk with <hi rend="italic">such</hi> is really almost the chief good I get of talking at all at present. Very few men have any fund of truth in them. I prefer holding my peace, and following my work,&#x2014;which gets on best always in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>.</p>
<p>Thank Jamie for his Letter till he get better payment. The Scotch Kirk it would seem is in a really alarming predicament;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For earlier crises in the Church of Scotland, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:43</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420617-TC-MAC-01"><sic>14:205</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1842-06-17">17 June 1842</date></corr></ref>. The General Assembly, <date when="1842-05-24">24 May 1842</date>, had passed the Claim of Right, which stated that civil actions taken in favor of patronage were a threat to the position of the Church guaranteed by the <date when="1707-00-00">1707</date> Treaty of Union and by the statutes of the realm. Its object was to seek protection from what was seen as the encroachments of the civil courts on the spiritual jurisdiction of the Church. The govt. took so long to reply that a convocation of ministers was called in Edinburgh, <date when="1842-11-17">17</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-11-24">24 Nov. 1842</date>, at which 354 ministers signed a statement undertaking to resign from the Church unless the govt. accepted the Claim of Right and at which Thomas Chalmers (see below) put forward his plan for financing a Free Church. After this convocation preparations were made at local level for the threatened disruption. Sir James Graham (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11204"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), home sec., issued the govt.&#x2019;s reply, <date when="1843-01-04">4 Jan.</date>, saying that they assumed that &#x201C;nothing less than the total abrogation of the rights of the Crown and of other patrons will satisfy the Church&#x201D; and completely rejecting the Claim of Right. A special meeting of the Commission of the General Assembly, <date when="1843-01-12">12 Jan.</date>, declared that the legislature could either force a disruption of the established Church, &#x201C;with all its attendant evils,&#x201D; or restore the Church to the position of <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>, when the Veto Act of the General Assembly (which allowed rejection of a minister introduced by a patron) was still legal. The opposition of the civil courts to these claims was confirmed by the Stewarton decision in the Court of Session, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, which declared illegal the setting up of <foreign><hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi></foreign> (concerned with sacred matters) parishes by the Church and that the ministers of these parishes had no right to a place in Church courts. This threw into doubt every decision of the Assembly since <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, when such ministers had been admitted. A petition containing the Church&#x2019;s grievances, agreed <date when="1843-01-31">31 Jan.</date>, was put before the House of Commons, <date when="1843-02-10">10 Feb.</date>, by Fox Maule (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>;<ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18365"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for Perth, and debated <date when="1843-03-07">7</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-03-08">8 March</date>, when by 211 to 76 (the majority made up of mainly English M.P.s belonging to the Church of England, a source of bitterness in Scotland) the Commons refused to consider the petition. The Disruption of the Church of Scotland duly took place, <date when="1843-05-18">18 May</date>, when 474 ministers out of 1,200 seceded to form the Free Church of Scotland.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter, and still earlier the Book it was to announce,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Divine Inversion</hi> (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>).</note> arrived here several days ago. Many thanks for both. The friendly inscription you have prefixed to the Book is all the more gratifying to me, or rather is alone gratifying, as I can discern by clear indications, what I already knew by credible report, that you are a man of sincerity,&#x2014;a very rare kind of man at present. I am accustomed to say, and do not mean any paradox, that Intelligence and Integrity are twin faces of the same thing, and cannot be divorced at all; a fact which is very important and very cheering to me in looking at these sad days. If praise be of any value, as certainly it sometimes is withal, then praise from such a man is precisely the kind for another man.</p>
<p>I have not yet got your <hi rend="italic">Divine Inversion</hi> sufficiently examined; nor am I sure that I shall ever fully succeed in penetrating into the peculiar centre where you stand and look: but I already seem to myself to discern indubitable analogies with much that is deepest and most central in what I otherwise have come to believe; and I may venture already to express my persuasion that the Doctrine you state and enforce there, is, in the real essence of it, <hi rend="italic">true</hi>.</p>
<p>Wishing you good success, wishing you faithful continual endeavour, <pb id="pg-16-30" n="16:30"/>which is the best success, in all your strugglings, and strenuous life-battles (for such, I see, yours are), <closer><salute>I remain, / Dear Sir,</salute></closer></p>

My persuasion is that I can cure it, by blue-pill and castor; for I feel as if the mischief, and even the very pain, were <hi rend="italic">within</hi> as much as without; and I do not feel nearly so heart-sick as I did on Sunday. This night I mean to experiment.</p>
<p>I go on with my work; which is an infinite comfort, indeed the only comfort I have any need of. To be <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> is miserable,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:157.</note> and there is no other misery.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>They have called me down to dinner; I have dined, and here in the ultimate dusk finish off my response to you.</p>
<p>There has a curious Book, <hi rend="italic">Bamford&#x2019;s Passages in the Life of a Radical</hi>, come to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Bamford (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1256"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and weaver; champion of the working class; unjustly imprisoned at time of Peterloo Massacre, <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>; worked as a journalist in Lancashire, beginning ca. <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> and apparently giving up journalism, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; special constable in Middleton during Chartist troubles, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; moved to Blackley, nr.

<p>Can you ask Cochrane too if he has got Robertson&#x2019;s account of Dr Francia (or whatever the title is)?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. P. and W. P.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>I had the honour, several days ago, to receive your invitation to the Annual Meeting of the Athenaeum; for which I can now only return <pb id="pg-16-33" n="16:33"/>my thanks and regrets. The state of my arrangements here rendered it impossible for me to come; and, in some accidental confusion, your Note itself has been lost, so that I have too long neglected even to reply. Pray accept my excuses; attribute my delay to something better than neglect.</p>
<p>Your Institution, if I rightly understand it, is one to which all rational men will wish success. To provide the working people with a Place of Reunion, where they might enjoy books, perhaps music, recreation, instruction; and at all events, what is dearest to all men, the society and sight of one another: this is a thing of palpable utility, a thing at once possible and greatly needed;&#x2014;it is a thousand pities <hi rend="italic">this</hi> were not brought to pass, straightway, in all working Towns! I have regretted much, in looking at your great Manchester, and its thousand-fold industries and conquests, that I could not find, in some quarter of it, a hundred acres of green ground with trees on it, for the summer holidays and evenings of your all-conquering industrious men; and for winter-season and bad weather quite another sort of social meeting-places than the Gin-shops offered!&#x2014; May all this, and much else, be amended. May good and best speed attend you and your benevolent associates in your attempts to amend some part of it.</p>

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for <hi rend="italic">Dunlop;</hi> thanks also for your hint of this morning, which I understand!</p>
<p>I investigated forthwith, with much satisfaction, the &#x201C;attempt to cut Oliver down&#x201D;; a valiant and very honest attempt on the part of our <pb id="pg-16-37" n="16:37"/>good John,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">rope</hi> proves a little toughish for him, good man!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott had apparently sent TC a copy of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell: A Poem, in Three Books</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>), by John Dunlop (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), Scottish-born author and temperance reformer (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410122-TC-JDU-01"><sic>13:22</sic><corr>TC to JDU, <date when="1841-01-22">22 Jan. 1841</date></corr></ref>). TC presumably refers to Dunlop&#x2019;s defense of Cromwell&#x2019;s reputation in his pref. as well as the poem: &#x201C;No character in British history has been so mercilessly dealt with as that of Oliver Cromwell&#x201D; (vi).</note></p>
<p>I did not write straightway in answer; because I had to be in Lewisham in a few days, and hoped to get across to Woolwich with the thing in my pocket as I returned. Alas, at Lewisham I found myself &#x201C;seven miles of intimate country&#x201D; from Plumstead;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A parish in the borough of Woolwich, S of the Thames, where Scott lived.</note> with a sleep-less night close in the rear of me, and a thing they call <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi>, as if the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tigre National</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Literally, &#x201C;National Tiger&#x201D;; unexplained.</note> had struck his claws into my back: I was totally inadequate for Woolwich that day! I wrapt up the printed leaves, and laid them in the shelf with your address; hoping you might call soon; and now, failing that, here under the escort of your two blue stamps they return to you.</p>
<p>Do not fail to come and see me whenever you get to Town. I will see Woolwich too before very long.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I should send you half a word to say that my <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> is all gone, by the aid of some medicines I took; that I am <hi rend="italic">terribly</hi>, and every moment of my time, <hi rend="small-caps">busy</hi>; and that my poor Book is going on apace. I expect to be at press with it before a couple of months and to have you a copy of it before the Summer come! It is a fiery thing; and tells lumps of the truth, in a franker manner than I have ever done hitherto. The time is come for it, I think! When men are dying round you of want of bread, and two millions of them sitting in workhouses or living otherwise on Parish Alms, and the Governors busy only with their partridge-shooting, I think one ought to speak.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here is the last Note I had from Jack: on the back of it are scribblings and preparatory scrawlings which have now gone safe into the Book. I scrawl on any bit of loose paper that is near me.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I had a Note from Jean at Dumfries: she is better now, she says; your flannel gown and the shamoy leather waistcoat assisted her. Poor thing, she has a struggling time of it among those unhealthy <foreign><hi rend="italic">bairns</hi></foreign>. A new <hi rend="italic">charge</hi>, it seems, is awaiting her before long.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A son, John, b. <date when="1843-04-00">April</date>.</note>&#x2014; Poor Isabella, I grieve to hear from her, is at present worse rather than better. Jenny, I calculate, still stays with you: I like better to fancy her there.</p>
<p>Curious enough, I happened, last time, to send you a Note of Henry Drummond&#x2019;s.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430120-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan.</date></ref></note> I had just answered him before I went off to my engagement (it was with young Spring Rice) at Lewisham: my omnibus, up in the town, was to start from this Henry&#x2019;s Bank at Charing Cross; on arriving there I found the street all in emotion,&#x2014;the assassin Macnaughten had just fired his pistol into this Henry&#x2019;s brother! Nobody could give me the smallest account of it; the only thing too sure was that Henry Drummond&#x2019;s Brother was shot; and the criminal instantly taken up. Next morning, we read in the Papers, that there was no danger. Alas, in two days more, the poor man had died! Mac-naughten, it appears, now confesses that he took his victim for Sir R. Peel. That is a fact for the Corn-Law men! M&#x2019;Naughten is from Glasgow, not a poor man at all; I suppose, a fanatic for Corn-Law Repeal.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Drummond (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8064"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Henry&#x2019;s 2d cousin, not his brother; private sec. to the prime minister, Sir Robert Peel (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21764"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), was shot in the back, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, as he was walking toward Downing St., by Daniel McNaughtan, age 27, a wood-turner of Glasgow, in mistake for Peel. Drummond was able to walk to his brother&#x2019;s bank, 49 Charing Cross, where the bullet was extracted, but d. <date when="1843-01-25">25 Jan.</date> At his trial, <date when="1843-03-03">3 March</date>, McNaughtan, who was under the delusion the tories were persecuting him, was acquitted on grounds of insanity, the case providing the so-called McNaughtan Rule for defining insanity as a defense in court. Though no link with McNaughtan was found, there was much speculation about the possibility of the Anti-Corn Law League&#x2019;s responsibility for incitement to violence. McNaughtan was the spelling he used in his signature; there are many variants.</note> The world is getting to a strange pass!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-16-39" n="16:39"/>Poor Henry Drummond has written me a second time.

Forster, whom TC had met only a few mos. previously, was in the woolen trade and, like Marshall, lived in Yorkshire. TC considered them both enlightened businessmen.</note> that you will find one another mutually supportable Phenomena in this world, where it is not pleasant to be alone!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What you report of your recession from Public Radicalism is altogether agreeable to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411027-TC-JGM-01"><sic>13:288</sic><corr>TC to JGM, <date when="1841-10-27">27 Oct. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> You have chosen the better part, I do honestly think. It needs that you go on in the same, to higher and higher heights; that hundreds and thousands gradually fall into the same, and escort and encourage you thereon! This is actually my opinion. A <hi rend="italic">real</hi> Aristocracy. in place of a false imaginary Aristocracy, is becoming and already become indispensable for English Society,&#x2014;and the Captains of Industry, not the Captains of Idleness whatever array and honours they may for the present hold, are the men for that.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:271&#x2013;72.</note> Not &#x201C;arms and <pb id="pg-16-40" n="16:40"/>the man&#x201D; now our epic; no, it is &#x201C;Tools and the man.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi> 10:209. &#x201C;Arms and the man&#x201D;: <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 1.1.</note> Not &#x201C;arms and the man&#x201D;; how much less &#x201C;White waistcoats and the man!&#x201D; I counsel you to go on, and <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a real King, and guide, and just <hi rend="italic">Law-ward</hi> (antique for &#x201C;Lord&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s etymology is mistaken: &#x201C;Lord&#x201D; comes from &#x201C;hlafweard,&#x201D; bread-keeper.</note>) or Preserver of God&#x2019;s Law, among your people. The first man that effectually accomplishes such an example will be a blessed man in England. Go on, and fear not! Indeed, &#x201C;it is not pleasant to be alone,&#x201D; as I say; but every man must hold himself ready, on occasion, to be it. All good fellows I have ever heard of were often-times in that same &#x201C;minority of <hi rend="italic">one</hi>&#x201D;: they stood there, worked there, and it gradually became a minority of <hi rend="italic">two</hi>, of many; gradually a <hi rend="italic">majority</hi>, and at length a <hi rend="italic">universality!</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Book I am writing will be at Press, if I prosper, in some six weeks, and out before the summer. It is properly a development of the very things I am now writing here to you. I think of calling it &#x201C;Past and Present,&#x201D; or some such title: it is partly historical, partly oratorical,&#x2014;dreadfully difficult to bring under any of the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;icals&#x201D;</hi> or <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;oricals,&#x201D;</hi> and keep from looking too bedlami<hi rend="italic">cal!</hi> A &#x201C;Tract for the Times&#x201D; full of the most portentous Speculative-Radicalism ever uttered in Governess-English, or even in <hi rend="italic">Carlylese</hi> as they call it!&#x2014; All this is a dead secret hitherto, and you need not speak of it to anybody.</p>
<p>Mrs Marshall sends me a beautiful Postscript; for which pray return her in my name most kind thanks;&#x2014;I will thank her in speech again, some day, by and by.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Alicia Pery Marshall, b.

<salute>Darling</salute>
<p>Do you know, between ourselves, I am not at all sure that I have not got a little of&#x2014;the spirit of prophecy! and why not? My Great Great Ancestor John Welsh the Covenanter had the gift of prophecy beyond all doubt&#x2014;he displayed it on many remarkable occasions&#x2014;once; I remember he foretold to a certain City in France which had used him scurvily that the Plague would devour it in a few days&#x2014;as it actually did<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welch or Welsh (<date when="1568-00-00">1568</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1622-00-00">1622</date>), presbyterian minister, m. Elizabeth (d. <date when="1625-00-00">1625</date>), youngest da. of John Knox. JWC&#x2019;s ancestor was not John Welsh but his elder brother, David of Collistion; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251128-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:420</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-11-28">28 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref>. She may have confused several stories about John Welsh&#x2019;s prophetic gifts: two concerned the plague breaking out in Ayr and the turning away of two travelers who then took the plague to Cumnock; the other was about the second siege of St. Jean d&#x2019;Angely by Louis XIII when Welsh prophesied that the city would fall. No story has been traced about the plague and a French city.</note>&#x2014; Now why not fancy a little of a turn for prophecy to be still in the blood as well as a tendency to consumption &#x26;c &#x26;c?&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-42" n="16:42"/>Even Carlyle tells me sometimes that I have &#x201C;the intelligence of <hi rend="italic">Schuping sing</hi>&#x201D; (you remember that Chinese young Lady?)&#x2014;&#x201C;who <hi rend="italic">resembled</hi> a disembodied spirit&#x201D; in the accuracy of her insight;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Shuping Sing, a fictional character who could see through stones; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:319</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> being able to tell always what her enemies were plotting on the other side of stone walls&#x2014; The occasion on which my spirit of prophecy&#x2014;or Shuping-sing-intelligence&#x2014;call it what you like&#x2014;has just evinced itself, relates to you and your dose of physic&#x2014;both Tuesday and Wednesday when I returned disappointed from the letter box I said to myself&#x2014;there is something strange in this&#x2014;if it be not that she has worn herself out in Manchester, and has had to take physic since her return!&#x2014; When today I came to the <hi rend="italic">physic</hi> in your letter I felt a sort of fear&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>&#x2014; really shuddered at the superhuman in me! Along with your letter today came one from Geraldine which I allowed to repose on the mantlepiece till I had read yours all thro, and behold when I opened it; the first words were that she would be here on Monday! good heavens and <hi rend="italic">this Thursday</hi> I feel as if I should have little enough time to get up the steam&#x2014;I do not mean the <hi rend="italic">house-steam</hi> for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> you know will not be put out of its natural course but may own internal steam&#x2014; Carlyle now says &#x201C;My dear I wish that girl may not fatigue you dreadfully?&#x2014;&#x201D; ! &#x201C;it is needless to be getting up such apprehensions, after the matter has reached its actual stage&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh I hope not says I Jeannie like the judicious little soul she always is, has told her that it will be best she should let me alone, and not fuss me when I am ailing&#x201D;&#x2014; He reflected a moment and then asked&#x2014;&#x201C;would it not be better if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wrote to her myself and impressed the same thing on her before she arrived at all&#x2014;&#x201D;? Poor Geraldine! I declined this considerate offer&#x2014;for really I thought if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should write to that same effect, she might be driven to carry the letting-alone system to an extreme&#x2014;and I should be as much worried with her unnatural stillness as with her natural superabundance of emotion. Indeed I am so prepared for <hi rend="italic">the worst</hi> that I do not think she will drive me out of my composure. At all events it is very absurd to ask her to come and then to take fright at the thought of it&#x2014;the beautiful confidence of sixteen with <supplied>[which]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted in MS.</note> she is <hi rend="italic">rushing to my arms</hi> on the first word&#x2014;deserves a kinder return&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now Babbie never pique yourself any more on the <hi rend="italic">crimping</hi> of <hi rend="italic">that collar</hi>&#x2014;I grant you it was a <hi rend="italic">devoted</hi> proof of affection but I flatter myself I have done as much, and more, for you in the copying of my whole correspondence with Robertson for your delectation!&#x2014; I who have an absolute horror of copying&#x2014;especially my own letters!&#x2014;there <pb id="pg-16-43" n="16:43"/>it is nevertheless! manuscript enough to curl your hair with for a month&#x2014;besides the &#x201C;intellectual feast&#x201D; it will be to you!&#x2014;a feast, by the way, not unlike that which was once set before me at a fine country-town-evening-party where I happened to find myself in appetite (I was young then, and not above feeling <hi rend="italic">hungry</hi> at times) well supper came in due course, and each person received&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">wineglass</hi> heaped with white froth (of milk) with a teaspoonful of redcurrant jelly at the bottom! devil a thing else!</p>
<p>I can sympathize with you in your Manchester&#x2014;&#x201C;miseries of human life&#x201D;&#x2014; Oh yes. I know the irritation of feeling oneself entirely superseded in the heart and life of an old companion by a little troublesome monkey of a child.

Socinianism denies the essential depravity of man and holds that salvation is to be achieved by virtuous action.</note>&#x2014; Well! but if these moral reflections are not a preamble to something more relevant; I find such a commencement of a letter&#x2014; &#x201C;what shall I say&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">strange</hi>&#x2014;upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; expressions of Mazzini.</note>&#x2014; Do you so? my sweet little Cousin&#x2014;be thankful then! we live in a world of commonplace&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> letter&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> cousin, so far from being taken sharply to task, should be accepted graciously as a sort of refreshing novelty.</p>
<p>But if I cannot show you that my moral reflections lead to something. I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> show you that <hi rend="italic">some</hi>thing lead to <hi rend="italic">them</hi>. I had been looking over the last budget of autographs that I had got together for you&#x2014; Such distinguished names! To be sure, I said to myself, these will make her fortune&#x2014;ni<supplied>[ce]</supplied> autographs. And then I felt a certain self-complacency&#x2014;a certain presentiment of your satisfaction in seeing your collection swelling into something really worthwhile&#x2014;and having the pen in my hand to write to you, I was on the point of putting on the paper some such <foreign><hi rend="italic">fadaise</hi></foreign> [nonsense] as <hi rend="italic">this</hi>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was a capital thought in me dearest Helen, the making of this collection for you&#x2014; My own pleasure in sending you the autographs being greater I am sure than any you can feel in receiving them&#x201D; But the sentence having reached a full stop&#x2014;in my head&#x2014;my better judgement said&#x2014;Bah! Beware of the socinian jargon <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">ma chere</hi></foreign> [my dear] there is always &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">do</hi> at the bottom of it&#x201D;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360401-JWC-HW-01"><sic>8:330</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1836-04-01">1 April 1836</date></corr></ref>. A &#x201C;do&#x201D; is a trick.</note>&#x2014;and so my pen dashed off, of itself, as it were, into a reactionary tirade against &#x201C;the wellfare-of-others&#x201D;-principle&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks again for your kind present of Books; for your two kind Letters, the latter of which arrived with Asher&#x2019;s Book-parcel duly, a few nights ago.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adolf Asher (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>), German bookseller, founder of Asher &#x26; Co., Berlin, book importers and exporters.</note> The only unfriendly news you send is that of your own health; which I wish you had been able to make a little pleasanter to me! Summer weather at the Baths, and no permission to enjoy it except <pb id="pg-16-48" n="16:48"/>thro&#x2019; carriage windows, is very sad work. And you are still a prisoner in Berlin, or nearly so;&#x2014;yet, thank Heaven, not an idle one, not a discontented one: this too is something to be thankful for. We have to take the Light and the Dark as they alternate for us here below; and try to make the right use of both. I say often of myself that if I had suffered no ill health, I should have known nothing. The stars shine out, as Friedland&#x2019;s did, when it is grown rightly <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> round us!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25:133.</note>&#x2014; Yet I hope to hear, as the summer advances, that you emerge again, and see good under the Sun. Nay, so long as you can continue writing, with whatever pain it be, how many sons of Adam are there who ought to <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> you; who are not rather called to envy you?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I know not if I ever reported with what pleasure I read that little Delineation of the Prussian Field-Marshal Schwerin.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Varnhagen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben des Feldmarschall Grafen von Schwerin</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>). Count Kurt Christolf von Schwerin (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), created field marshal by Frederick the Great.</note> One has pleasure in it because it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a &#x2018;Delineation,&#x2019; which so many Books only pretend to be: one <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> a certain section of Human Life actually painted, rendered credible and conceivable to one. That last Battle is clear to me as if I had fought in it:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">History of Frederick the Great, Works</hi> 17:133&#x2013;35.</note> there is a kind of gloomy dumb tragic strength in the Phenomenon, as in some old Norse-Mythus, for me,&#x2014;as if I looked into the old Death-Kingdoms, whereon Living Prussia, with what it can say and do, reposes and grows! Those long ranks of speechless Men standing ranked there, with their three-cornered hats and stiff hair-queues and fighting apparatus; dumb, standing like stone statues to be blasted in pieces with cannon-shot:&#x2014;there are &#x2018;inarticulate meanings&#x2019; without end in such a thing for me!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Surely I much approve your farther Biographic projects; and bid you, &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Frisch zu</hi></foreign> [Go ahead]!&#x2019; How true also is that of Goethe in his advice to you:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), &#x201C;Varnhagen von Enses Biographien,&#x201D; vol. 6 of <hi rend="italic">Uber Kunst und Alterthum</hi> (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>): &#x201C;We wish that he [Varnhagen] may proceed, with his biographical representations, more and more to the eighteenth century, and promote, by delineating the individualities and the spirit of the time with which they stood in action and reaction, clearness of the whole state of things.
Clearness necessitates insight, insight creates tolerance, tolerance alone is able to procure a peace active in all parts and talents&#x201D; (trans. <hi rend="italic">Last Words</hi> 215).</note> I have felt it a hundred times;&#x2014;indeed it is properly the grand difficulty with my own poor <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> at present; that he lies buried so deep; that his dialect, thought, aim, whole costume and environment are grown so obsolete for men. What an English Puritan properly <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> and struggled for in the Seventeenth Century: I say to myself, &#x201C;Is all that dead? <pb id="pg-16-49" n="16:49"/>Or is it only <hi rend="italic">asleep</hi> (not entirely with good consequences for us); a thing that can never <hi rend="italic">die</hi> at all?&#x201D; If it be <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>, we ought to leave it alone! &#x201C;Let the dead bury their dead&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 8:22.</note> is as true in Literature as elsewhere. Hence indeed so few <hi rend="italic">Histories</hi>, and so many <hi rend="italic">Pedantries</hi> and mere Sham Histories,&#x2014;which, if men were resolute enough, they would verily fling into the fire at once, and make an end of!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Stuhr, as you predict, is heavy; but I find him solid and earnest, I believe I shall find it well worth while to travel thro&#x2019; him.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Feddersen Stuhr (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), Prussian historian.

<p>My stock of Autographs which I have had much pleasure in gathering for you is of much more bulk than value! Hardly a half dozen of men very interesting to you will you find here; the rest are transitory notabilities,&#x2014;on many of whom, as they are like to be entirely unknown out of their own Parish, I have had to mark some brief commentary in pencil.

<salute>Dear Lady Harriet,</salute>
<p>Luckily I can, and right gladly I will! I have been out nowhere these three months; but my term expires before Friday.&#x2014; I will also treat myself to a sight of you in the interim, perhaps on Monday evening. I am just finishing a dreadful <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> on these Times and Aristocracies; which (tho&#x2019; we by no means will have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> killed in this general Twilight of the Gods) will most likely deprive me of your friendship for evermore:&#x2014;wherefore I must make the best of my few opportunities that remain!</p>
<p>You get Bamford&#x2019;s Book by applying, or directing any Bookseller (I suppose) to apply, to the Author himself, &#x201C;Samuel Bamford, Silk-Weaver, Middleton, near Manchester.&#x201D; If you have the smallest difficulty, let me know, and I will find a man in Manchester to do it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430413-TC-SBA-01">TC to <sic>SB</sic><corr>SBA</corr>, <date when="1843-04-13">13 April</date></ref>.</note> You deserve to be saved for reading such Books, were it for nothing more.</p>

<p>I want you to take a copy of my Chartism with &#x2018;from the Author&#x2019; in it and dispatch it addressed to &#x2018;Mr. Samuel Bamford, silk weaver, Middleton, Manchester&#x2019; &#x2026;</p>
<p>A copy of the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> is wanted, elsewhere; but this must first be bound, not in a sumptuous but in a reasonably handsome manner; and I must first write the name in it myself &#x2026;</p>
<p>The new book we were speaking of is coming near a conclusion. I <pb id="pg-16-53" n="16:53"/>think it were as well if the Printer very soon had a piece of it, to go through his preliminaries upon; for I desire much that there should be no delay in it. I have yet mentioned the matter to no bookseller whatever but yourself;&#x2014;nor probably shall I. You must consider what is the utmost you can do for me; and let us try if we can settle it soon!</p>
<p>The book will be as large, I calculate, as a volume, perhaps as any volume of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution;</hi> I propose to call it <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;Past and Present&#x2019;;</hi> and it might be announced in the Papers with this addition, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">A Chartism</hi>, Part Second,&#x2019; which would probably explain the purport of it there. I consider that probably it will be found readable: but that is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> field of prophecy rather than mine &#x2026; compliments to Mr. Chapman, which of course he will not fail to get notice of, reading this along with you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), Hall&#x2019;s partner. Chapman tended to take care of literary matters and Hall to look after the business side.</note></p>

<p>What makes me more delicate in my exactions, is my incapability of making you an adequate return&#x2014;one while it is Helen&#x2019;s illness,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The maid&#x2019;s.</note> then my own&#x2014;with the continual running accompaniment of worry&#x2014;that makes me feel really as if the faculty of letter-writing were a thing I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> possessed in some previous state of existence!</p>
<p>My cold is gone&#x2014;but yesterday and today&#x2014;I am quite stupid with headach&#x2014;attributable however to <hi rend="italic">natural causes</hi>&#x2014; In fact <hi rend="italic">the</hi> presentiment seeming in fair way to work itself out&#x2014;without leaving me <hi rend="italic">one</hi> exceptional day&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes Mazzini is a friend worth having&#x2014;one that is always best in the hour of need&#x2014; If he had heard of the illness of his Mother in Italy he could not have been more anxious than he has been in these days to learn the last news from Liverpool<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In an accompanying undated letter Mazzini asked JWC, &#x201C;Will you be so kind as to let me know what news, if any, you had this morning from Liverpool?

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is an Order for Two pounds on Postie; which cash when you have got into your hands, I wish you to dispose of it for me as follows:</p>
<p>One pound to Mary Carlyle, our poor Cousin,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Harkness, b. Carlyle (d. <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), TC&#x2019;s paternal cousin; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401216-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:364</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-12-16">16 Dec. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> whose Weaver husband and household must be, I fear, in a state of <hi rend="italic">unusual</hi> wreck at present. She comes into my head sometimes; and I say, Why dost thou <pb id="pg-16-55" n="16:55"/>not assist her according to thy poor means?&#x2014; I would have you give her the money without mentioning much of me,&#x2014;without mentioning me at all, if you could help it;&#x2014;simply as a gift that comes to her from Providence by your hands. Poor creature: one <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> assist her or hers: nobody can.</p>
<p>The other pound I wish you to cut into two halves: give five shillings each to poor Rob Scott and the poor old Plate Morrison, if they are still alive;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rob Scott the blacksmith and Jamie Morrison; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18391100-TC-AC-01"><sic>11:211</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1839-11-01">1 Nov. 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;the remainder, in such proportions as you like, to such wretched objects as you think may be most benefited by it. My heart is sore for them. I send this to buy <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> some ease from pain; I cannot call it charity at all. Be you my Almoner,&#x2014;as I think you once before were. And may a blessing be in the poor mite, far beyond its own value!</p>
<p>This morning I sent the first portion of my Book off to the Printer.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Levey, Robson &#x26; Franklyn, 23 Gt. New St., Fetter Lane.</note> There are still two good weeks or more of right hard labour before the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> portion be got written: but the Printer will not overtake me; and I want to be <hi rend="italic">out</hi> as soon as possible, that I may have quite done with it. Great things are announced in it, more or less clearly; I hope it may tend to the stirring up of here and there a human soul! My soul, at any rate, is very anxious to <hi rend="italic">have done with it</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A dated note on the Forster MS f.119v. shows that TC may have been eager to get back to working on Cromwell and certainly that he had not given this up entirely while writing <hi rend="italic">Past and Present:</hi> on &#x201C;<date when="1843-02-20">20 feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>&#x201D; he made &#x201C;almost a complete copy&#x201D; of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Harl Mss</hi>. N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 265.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; I deal with my old Booksellers (present ones, I mean);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall.</note> they are to give me &#xa3;200 for an Edition of 2,000 Copies;&#x2014;which is no great shakes of a bargain; but I cannot go hawking about for a better.</p>
<p>Yesterday there came a Note from Jenny; for which, and the news it brought, I am very thankful. Tell our good Mother to keep out of the cold! We have had rigid grim weather even here, tho&#x2019; it is now gone again in mud and thaw. Jane keeps pretty well; the young lady from Manchester is still here.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury.</note> Jack was well and brisk on Sunday. I am in good heart for my Book; and able for the rest of it yet.</p>

<salute>Dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>Blessings on your pen once more! You have given us a terrible fright, and must not make any fresh &#x201C;experiments&#x201D; of that nature! We are right glad to see your hand again; to understand that you are steadily tho&#x2019; slowly getting built together again. Possess your soul in patience there: it is actually a better &#x201C;progress&#x201D; a thousand times than you are aware of! I cannot get you to understand this of <hi rend="small-caps">Silence</hi>; but the Fates, I hope will,&#x2014;for it is of the highest moment to you. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festina lente</hi></foreign> [Make haste slowly],&#x2014;O Heavens there is a thousand times more in Silence than that: &#x201C;Self-Annihilation, the beginning of all good and wisdom,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 186ff.</note> this is in it among other things. The gods have somewhat in store for you,&#x2014;if you will not spill it! Be quiet, I say, and thankful to the gods.</p>
<p>No man was lately busier, and few sicklier, than I now am. Work is not possible for me except in a redhot element, which roasts the life out of me. I have still three weeks of the ugliest labour; and shall be fit for the hospital then.</p>
<p>This thing I am upon is a volume to be called &#x201C;Past and Present&#x201D;: it is moral, political, historical &#x26;c;&#x2014;a most questionable, redhot, indignant thing: for my heart is sick to look at the things now going on in this England; and two millions of men sitting in Poor-Law Bastilles<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Workhouses established under the poor law act, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, where the poor were given relief and set to work; named after the Bastille.</note> seem to ask of every English soul, &#x201C;Hast thou no word to say for us?&#x201D; On the whole, I am heartily sorry for myself,&#x2014;sorry that, I could not help writing such words, and had none better to write.&#x2014; Whether any <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> or what lies in the rear of this? The Fates know.</p>
<p>It was John Sterling, I think, that first told me my nature was Political; it is strange enough how, beyond expectation, that oracle is verifying itself.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Caroline Fox paraphrased the letter in her journal, <date when="1843-02-26">26 Feb.</date> (Fox 178).</note></p>
<p>If you lay within distance of me, what better could I do than run into the Spring sunshine and your neighbourhood, were this horrid load of hodwork off my shoulders! But you are two hundred miles away; and my vehement speeches would do you no good at present.</p>
<p>I have seen nobody, except in glimpses, these several months. Today I am going over the river, to crawl about in the Lethe Flats of <pb id="pg-16-57" n="16:57"/>Battersea,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the S bank of the Thames, opp. Chelsea. Lethe is the river of oblivion in Hades; cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.5.</note> if nothing better. Your Brother called yesterday; complaining of slight cold; otherwise brisk, hardy, victorious as ever.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Coningham Sterling (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26405"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), capt. in 73d Foot, on half pay from <date when="1842-12-00">Dec.</date>: see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361202-TC-JAC-01"><sic>9:103</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-12-02">2 Dec. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<salute>My dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>If by the alchymy of affection, or other alchymy, you can manage to extract any comfort at all, out of such rags of letters as it is possible for me to send you under the actual circumstances&#x2014;have them, my child, and welcome, Only I wish you could teach me your secret for transmuting stupidity into comfort&#x2014;it is a secret as well worth discovering as the philosophers-stone.</p>
<p>I opened your letter today with less agitation than usual&#x2014; I felt myself quits with destiny in the way of fright before I broke the seal of yours&#x2014;for I found in the box along with it, one of those horrid black bordered notes which make ones heart jump into ones mouth&#x2014; addressed to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and bearing the <hi rend="italic">Ecclefechan</hi> postmark&#x2014;nervous as I am in these days you may fancy the dreadful things that crossed my mind&#x2014;but when I opened it&#x2014;myself&#x2014;I found it nothing worse than the announcement of the death of a Brother of William Graham&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham of Burnswark (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>). His brother John, who d. <date when="1943-01-19">19 Jan.</date>, aged seventy-one, had been a merchant in New York; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200915-TC-WG-01"><sic>1:274</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;bad enough for poor Graham&#x2014;but for us who never saw him! accordingly your news was more disappointing that I was not prepared for any falling back&#x2014;it seems indeed to have been the result of imprudence&#x2014;but that is small comfort&#x2014; Oh dear me how I wish for all our sakes that he<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh.</note> were going about again&#x2014; The little touch of <hi rend="italic">impatience</hi> about the Doctors was the most comfortable part of your intelligence&#x2014; I hate to see a man who is not naturally a <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>&#x2014;behaving like one&#x2014;it is always a good sign when a patient begins to get cross</p>
<p>Hang that cook&#x2014;to be plaguing you with enquiring after servants just now&#x2014; Be sure to tell me if Helen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, who as the eldest da., was chiefly responsible for running the household.</note> have got one&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> good ones left you have not such reason to dread changing as I have&#x2014;still on any principle changing is bad&#x2014; Helen<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell, the maid.</note> has not plagued me with her temper much of late&#x2014;but the reason of that is only I am afraid, that she is conscious of having been a sufficient plague to me in another way&#x2014;for a great many weeks back she has not been at all up to her work&#x2014;part of the time up to nothing&#x2014; I am rather disposed to think that she will never be again the servant she was some years ago <pb id="pg-16-59" n="16:59"/>in point of work&#x2014;these drinking bouts have undermined her constitution&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">nerves coughs</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c are likely to be henceforth her portion&#x2014; I am not brute enough to <hi rend="italic">be angry</hi> with the poor wretch for having her house all in a mess&#x2014;and doing no one earthly thing as it ought to be done&#x2014;while she is liable to be choked with coughing at every turn!&#x2014;but&#x2014;as she has got to the end of my affection for her which could have made me overlook such inconveniencies for the sake of having her beside me, I see very clearly that an easier place would suit her better&#x2014;and a healthier woman would better suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014; However&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">laissez fair</hi></foreign> [let be] is my motto for the present&#x2014;till the summer plans have assumed some positive shape&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle has sent the first part of his Book to press in a month or so I hope it will be off his mind&#x2014;and then he will take to revolving fifty different projects&#x2014;out of which I shall find some one I hope compatible with my private wishes and make that one predominant&#x2014; What think you of a cottage on the other side of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> water?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., across the river Mersey in Cheshire.</note>&#x2014;why not there as well as elsewhere?&#x2014;it were near Annandale for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;near Maryland Street for me&#x2014;Maryland Street being all that remains for me&#x2014; But at present the chief thing is to get my uncle well again&#x2014;it were also a good thing if Geraldine would lay it to heart that I asked her just for two or three weeks&#x2014;it will be three weeks on monday since she came<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She apparently came on <date when="1843-02-06">6 Feb.</date></note>&#x2014;three most uncomfortable weeks&#x2014;and when she received a note yesterday from a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Green in St Johns Wood<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Take another brief word from me, rather than none at all! I am driving along my poor Book, and in a terrible pucker and puzzle, every minute of my time occupied:&#x2014;but I ought to be busier than I ever yet was, if I could not send my dear good Mother a syllable of salutation now and then! In few weeks I shall be more at leisure, and be able to write as before.</p>
<p>We have got very nasty weather since <date when="1843-02-00">February</date> came in; plashy sleets, cold east-winds, <foreign>reek</foreign> and mud: I do not care much for all that; but it is somewhat hard on Jane;&#x2014;who however still keeps her feet, and even goes out when the Sun by chance shews himself. Ellen our servant has got a cold in these days; and cannot even be kept lying in her bed: she is a very distracted kind of creature, under any pain or pressure of the nerves, and runs about almost as a poor burnt whelp might do,&#x2014;entirely astonished at the state it finds itself in! To add <pb id="pg-16-61" n="16:61"/>somewhat to the perplexity we have a vister in these weeks; a Miss Jewsbury from Manchester, a great friend of Jane&#x2019;s and mine, whom Jane had invited lately to come and pass a three weeks with her. But she is a good lively young woman, and perhaps rather <hi rend="italic">likes</hi> messing about in the kitchen on such an occasion: we do not in the least put ourselves about for her. Jane has, today, got in a good handy little girl of the neighbourhood, who is used to the house: all will get on pretty well now. I proposed to her: &#x201C;Cannot you put Ellen into bed, and turn the key upon her?&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am myself in fully the average state of health; often in rather good spirits about getting forward with my Book! I walk considerably, and do not overwork myself. Jack Ritchie&#x2019;s maxim is decidedly good: &#x201C;The slower thou ridest, the sooner thoul&#x2019;t get to thy journey&#x2019;s end!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>8:271</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>), attrib. to John Richie, evidently an Annandale neighbor. &#x201C;Vister&#x201D; in the preceding paragraph is thus in MS.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;  This Book will probably be of some use: it &#x201C;gives up&#x201D; a good many classes of men and things, &#x201C;their <hi rend="italic">fit</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Gives up their <hi rend="italic">fit</hi>,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;rebukes.&#x201D;</note> as you say in Annandale; tells them what <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> they are of,&#x2014;which they are terribly ignorant of, at times. At any rate, it will as usual be a great relief to me <hi rend="italic">to get rid of it;</hi> to say, &#x201C;There, that is what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had to do with the business: and now&#x2014;what you have to do, let us see that!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Peel will not change the Corn-Laws this year: but next year both he, it is likely, and they, and much along with them, will go! He has certainly no very blessed place of it at present.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of the widespread hunger and continued agitation for repeal of the Corn Laws.</note></p>
<p>If Alick can get me another quarter of a stone of that Tobacco without much trouble, tell him he may do so. The present stock is done; and I am thrown on London again. I have found a rather better kind than usual, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do, however.</p>
<p>Jack is well; I had Jenny&#x2019;s Letter, and Jack sent me the one he got about the same time. I will write to her by and by. I will write to Jamie,&#x2014;to everybody, so soon as I am &#x201C;my own man&#x201D; again! To Jean I am indebted a Letter too: be patient with me!</p>
<p>Dear Mother, keep out of the bitter weather. Take care of yourself for my sake. Blessings on you, on one and all of you. My sympathies and regards to poor Isabella. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> dear Mother!&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
<p>You wrote me a very kind but Melancholy letter about the New Year time, which I was almost of Mind to write and admonish you about;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham had written from Burnswark, <date when="1843-01-07">7</date> and <date when="1843-01-09">9 Jan.</date>, about the death of his sister, Jane Howatson (in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410820-TC-JAC-01"><sic>13:221</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-08-20">20 Aug. 1841</date></corr></ref>), his own deep conviction of sin, and his faith in TC: &#x201C;you are the only living man to whom &#x2026; I could unbosom my deep grief &#x26; Sorrow, to this extent; if I had loved you less, my confidence would have been in proportion, perhaps altogether withheld.&#x201D; The second part of his letter, <date when="1843-01-09">9 Jan.</date> was about the churches, the distress in the country, Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s death, and David Hope and Margaret Carlyle at church, &#x201C;looking really <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.&#x201D; He ended by asking TC not to show the &#x201C;enclosed sheet,&#x201D; that written <date when="1843-01-07">7 Jan.</date>, to &#x201C;any mortal.&#x201D; TC wrote on the cover: &#x201C;Await the issue. In all battles if you await the issue, each fighter has prevailed according.&#x201D;</note> and now another brief, but too emphatic missive announces that a new great sorrow has fallen upon you,&#x2014;your good Brother lives no more under this sun. Alas, Alas, what are all human sympathies? the friendliest pity of one man for another? It is a great loss that has fallen on you, a bitterness which no sympathy can sweeten. He was your Eldest Brother, I think, the Pioneer of you all in this adventurous life-pilgrimage, and a dark cloud has suddenly hid him from your sight. He is away with God who made us all!</p>
<p>The reflection that can tend to compose a man and Brother in such extremities is this, of the ancient Psalmist we shall go to him, he shall not return to us!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 12:23, a favorite quotation of TC&#x2019;s; see, e.g., <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240519-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:68</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-05-19">19 May 1824</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310122-TC-G-01"><sic>5:219</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1831-01-22">22 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> No, not to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, but we are travelling swiftly towards <hi rend="italic">Him</hi>, out of a long Eternity he has but gained a little hour upon us, we have to bow our heads and keep silence, or say only God&#x2019;s great and just will be done.&#x2014; Your reflections and speculations in the former letter were full of undue gloom. You were wont to be of a cheerful hoping heart, and have often admonished me for my despondences, and what was far nobler, encouraged me under them. I would fain here, if it were in my power, do the like for you. A rational man is bound by all considerations and necessities to look fixedly and with the unspeakable awe into that great Eternity, towards which at all moments he is travelling, and of which his whole earthly work is as it were a symbol, but reverence, not fear or despondence beseems us nevertheless.</p>
<p>My despondences have been many and long continued, and will not quit me while I live, but looking into Eternity, I could never see it to be other than a still home, unknown, but still and safe where the weary were at rest. I consider that we do know nothing more of it, <pb id="pg-16-63" n="16:63"/>that no man ever did or will know more of it while in this life; and that in all ways our attitude towards it is that of Hope, the very essence of us seems to be <hi rend="small-caps">Hope</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 158&#x2013;59.</note> God is love and <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>, I had almost said; we have ever more to trust in God.</p>
<p>My dear friend, you must not let gloomy remembrances, gloomy anticipations overcloud you. On the whole I wish the sun would shine out, that you could get abroad in the fields, to the Hillsides again, look if that be a world made by one unkind to us! I find the green grass and the blue sky worth a thousand homilies to me when in distress.</p>
<p>My hurry in these weeks &#x26; months is enormous. I am writing a book again&#x2014;near done now, let that account for all things.</p>
<p>My true sympathies and regards to Miss Graham,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His surviving sister, Elizabeth Graham, who lived with him.</note> God bless you both.</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate,</salute></closer>

<salute>My dearest Helen</salute>
<p>After (in Dumfries &#x26; Galloway-courier<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Dumfries newspaper.</note> phraseology) &#x201C;taking <hi rend="italic">a birds-eye view</hi>&#x201D; of all modern literature, I am arrived at the conclusion; that to find a book <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> suited to my Uncle&#x2019;s taste I must&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">write it myself!</hi> and alas, that cannot be done before tomorrow morning!</p>
<p>&#x201C;La Motte Fouque&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Magic Ring</hi>&#x201D;?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Friedrich Heinrich Karl de La Motte Fouqu&#xE9; (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), German writer and romanticist, <hi rend="italic">Der Zauberring</hi> (N&#xfc;rnberg, <date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>).</note> suggests Geraldine&#x2014;&#x201C;too mystical!

<p>But in my own suggestions I have been hardly more fortunate&#x2014; All the books that <hi rend="italic">pretend</hi> to <hi rend="italic">amuse</hi> in our day come in fact either under that category which you except against&#x2014;&#x201C;the extravagant clown-jesting&#x201D; sort or still worse under that of what I should call the galvanized death&#x2019;s-head-grinning sort&#x2014; There seems to be no longer any genuine, heartfelt mirth in writers of books&#x2014;they sing and dance still &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">vigoureusement</hi></foreign> [vigorously]&#x201D;&#x2014;but one sees always too plainly, that it is not voluntarily but only for halfpence.&#x2014; and for halfpence they will crack their windpipes and cut capers on the crown of their heads&#x2014; poor men that they are!</p>
<p>I bethink me of one book however, which we have lately read here, bearing a rather questionable name as a book for my uncle&#x2014;but nevertheless I think he would like it&#x2014; It is called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Passages from the life of a Radical</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;by Samuel Bamford&#x2014;a silk-weaver of Middleton&#x2014; He was one of those who got into trouble during the Peterloo time, and the details of what he then saw and suffered are given with a simplicity, an intelligence and absence of every thing like party-violence, which it does one good to fall in with&#x2014;especially in these inflated times&#x2014; There is another book that might be <hi rend="italic">tried</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I am not sure that it has not a little too much affinity with water gruel&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">The Neighbours</hi>&#x2014; A domestic novel translated from the Swedish by Mary Howit<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederika Bremer, <hi rend="italic">The Neighbours: A Story of Every-Day Life</hi>, trans.

<p>Oh I must tell you for my uncles benefit a domestic catastrophe that occurred last week&#x2014;one day after dinner I heard Helen lighting the fire which had gone out in the room above&#x2014;with a perfectly unexampled vengeance!&#x2014;every stroke of the poker seemed an individual effort of concentrated rage. What ails the creature now? I said to myself&#x2014;who has incurred her sudden displeasure? or is it <hi rend="italic">the redherring</hi> she had to dinner which has disagreed with her stomach? (for in the morning you must know when I was ordering the dinner she had asked might <hi rend="italic">she</hi> have a red herring? &#x201C;her heart had been set upon it this good while back&#x201D;!&#x2014;and of course so modest a petition received an unhesitating affirmative&#x2014;) on her return to the subterranean the same hubbub wild<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:951.</note> arose from below which had just been trying my nerves from above&#x2014;and when she brought up the tea tray she clanked it on the lobby-table as if she were minded to demolish the whole concern at one fell stroke&#x2014; I looked into her face inquiringly as she <pb id="pg-16-66" n="16:66"/>entered the room, and seeing it black as midnight (<hi rend="italic">morally</hi> that is) I said very cooly&#x2014;&#x201C;a little less noise if you please&#x2014;you are getting rather loud upon us!&#x201D;&#x2014; She cast up her eyes with the look of a martyr at the stake, as much as to say &#x201C;well if I must be quiet, I must! but you little know my wrongs&#x201D;! By and by Geraldine went to the kitchen for some reason.&#x2014; She is oftener in the kitchen in one day than I am in a month&#x2014;but that is irrelevant&#x2014; &#x201C;Where is the cat&#x201D;? said she to Helen&#x2014; &#x201C;I have not seen her all night&#x201D;&#x2014;she takes a wonderful most superfluous charge of the cat as of everything else in this establishment&#x2014;&#x201C;the cat&#x201D;? said Helen grimly I have all but killed her!&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;how?&#x201D; said Geraldine&#x2014; &#x201C;With the besom&#x201D; replied the other&#x2014; &#x201C;Why? for goodness sake?&#x2014;&#x201D; Why? repeated Helen bursting out into new rage &#x201C;Why indeed? <hi rend="italic">because</hi> She eat my red herring!

<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x2014;</salute>Many thanks for your Notes; which were sufficient for my purpose. I had already written down &#x201C;some 13&#x201D; as the cipher of the Manchester business;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The number killed at Peterloo, the meeting held at St. Peter&#x2019;s Field, Manchester, <date when="1819-08-16">16 Aug. 1819</date>, in favor of parliamentary reform. TC said in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present:</hi> &#x201C;Some thirteen unarmed men and women cut down,&#x2014;the number of the slain and maimed is very countable: but the treasury of rage, burning hidden or visible in all hearts ever since &#x2026; is of unknown extent&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:16).</note> and so it may now stand.</p>
<p>The Book is to be called <hi rend="italic">Past and Present:</hi> one stiff volume, treating of the grand &#x201C;Condition of England Question,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The title of ch. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi>.</note>&#x2014;I suppose, in a somewhat unexpected way. But you will see in not many weeks. The Printer is already at work,&#x2014;though the poor <hi rend="italic">Writer</hi> has still a rather heavy fortnight in store before ending; and was seldom busier.</p>
<p>The Booksellers Chapman and Hall have forwarded, from me, a copy of <hi rend="italic">Chartism;</hi> addressed &#x201C;Mr. Samuel Bamford, Silk-weaver, Middleton near Manchester.&#x201D; The Book, they tell me, now lies or will straightway lie, at the shop of Syms and Dinham (if I remember the name right) in Manchester, &#x201C;to be called for.&#x201D; Will you be so kind as call for it, or apprise Bamford that he must call.</p>
<p>I could rejoice to hear that Bamford had decided on sticking to <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> Prose; writing down many a thing that he with his own heart and eyes has <hi rend="italic">known:</hi> that seems to me his true vocation as an Author; for Poetry I could trace no decided call in him. You need not mortify the brave man by telling him this straight out; &#x2014;but if he could get in some oblique way convinced of it, I feel certain there were good and not harm done to him. He is certainly a remarkable man; calculated, one would say, to be the spokesman of much that lies dumb at present,&#x2014;with no way of speaking itself but Chartist Insurrections, Trades Unions and such like; which are a very imperfect way indeed! It will be well worth your while to go and see him, to <pb id="pg-16-68" n="16:68"/>keep your eye upon him, if at any time there be possibility of helping him on his way.</p>
<p>I am spending my allotted minutes <hi rend="italic">here</hi>,&#x2014;and must end!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>At present I am much too busy for any extraneous kind of writing: nor indeed, tho&#x2019; my convictions about Free Trade as they well can be, should I, most probably, prove worth much as a writer on it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently TC had refused to write anything on free trade for Ballantyne because he was busy.</note> I am as it were <hi rend="italic">too</hi> well convinced for speaking on the subject at all, with the due patience. <hi rend="italic">It</hi> lies before me as an axiom;&#x2014;and innumerable things lie behind it!</p>
<p>None wishes your Cause speedier success than I; but I think as before that perhaps <hi rend="italic">my</hi> best on behalf of it is to be done <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>
<p>For the rest I shall rejoice to see a set of competent Papers, together or apart, on this matter, set in circulation. The heavy public ear must be flagitated and agitated: there seems to be no other way of getting even Bread for England, but that somewhat melancholy one.</p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I was very disappointed yesterday forenoon, when no letter arrived from you&#x2014;and over and above, a little out of humour&#x2014;but my humour was quickly restored to its natural calm, by what was meant to aggravate it. The fussy officiousness and superfluous enthusiasm with which Geraldine struck into the concern, wondering how it ever should happen that &#x201C;any one whose letters I was at the pains to wish for should not feel it worth the pains to write&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c produced a speedy reaction in your favour, just as the wife who getting herself beaten by her husband&#x2014;fell foul of the stranger who interfered in her behalf&#x2014;demanding what it was to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> if her husband chose to beat his own wife&#x201D;?&#x2014; After dinner came the parcel&#x2014;truly a beautiful and most luxurious wrapage! but in spite of my admiration of it, I did not willingly <pb id="pg-16-73" n="16:73"/>leave off shaking it, and shaking the books, in hopes that a letter would fall out&#x2014; &#x201C;Perhaps, I said the letter will be coming by tonights post&#x201D;&#x2014;and at this same moment Helen who had come in without my noticing her, my attention being absorbed in the shawl, put the letter into my hand&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">then</hi> finally my contentment was complete! When I had finished reading it I put on the shawl drew the delicious little hood over my head&#x2014;and stretched myself on the sofa to be supremely comfortable&#x2014; I had been in the forenoon to the Chinese exhibition<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Chinese Collection, Hyde Park Corner, advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1843-03-04">4</date> and <date when="1843-03-11">11 March</date>, as a collection &#x201C;of objects <hi rend="italic">exclusively Chinese</hi>, [which] surpasses in extent and grandeur any similar display in the known world.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;which like all <hi rend="italic">exhibitions</hi> had tired me dreadfully&#x2014;
I was soon asleep&#x2014; Carlyle was stretched on the green chair and two others&#x2014;he had yesterday finished his book! he also slept profoundly&#x2014;as he had good right to do&#x2014; Geraldine makes herself a bed with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">priedieu</hi></foreign> [prayer desk]&#x2014;chair and a sofa cushion and the hearth rug&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">every day</hi> after dinner&#x2014;and sleeps like a person under the influence of liquor&#x2014;or drugs&#x2014;a singular phasis of a young lady&#x2014;yesterday evening she was stretched out and sound as usual!&#x2014; Into this enchanted looking room walked Garnier&#x2014;considerably distracted&#x2014;singling out me to chatecise he asked &#x201C;why do you <hi rend="italic">tender</hi> yourself in this way? or are you really not well?&#x201D;&#x2014; Geraldine who had got on her end, and always bursts out of sleep into volubility&#x2014;poured forth a torrent of words a<supplied>[bout]</supplied> &#x201C;the poor creature having been to that <hi rend="italic">confounded</hi> Chinese exhibition &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D;&#x2014;but she was cut short by Garnier&#x2019;s uplifting his two hands, and saying to me with an affectation of dismay&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh my goodness! how fast that Lady does talk! it is quite impossible for me to follow her! M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle is she a relation of yours&#x201D;?&#x2014; She pretended to be vastly amused&#x2014;and vastly amused with the quizzing which he carried on the whole evening&#x2014;but I believe she had her own private misgivings about it! After tea Carlyle and Garnier went down to smoke&#x2014;and in the interim a gentleman sent in his card&#x2014;Helen whispered it was the gentleman of next door<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Lamberts lived next door, 6 Cheyne Row, and had two das. who sang and played the piano to the Carlyles&#x2019; great annoyance; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421116-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:191</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-11-16">16 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and that you may understand all the awfulness of this announcement for me&#x2014;I must tell you that Carlyle had yesterday put into effect his long matured purpose of trying the fair musician with a letter! I was out at the time and did not see it&#x2014;but he gave me to understand that it was of the most chivalrous discription, professing his conviction that &#x201C;a young beautiful female soul working in the most beautiful element that of <hi rend="italic">music</hi> would not willingly give annoyance to any fellow worker&#x201D;!! &#x26;c &#x26;c <pb id="pg-16-74" n="16:74"/>&#x26;c&#x2014; What he required of her practically to do&#x2014;or rather to not do was to refrain from playing all days of the year till after two oclock!!!&#x2014;a modest request to a young lady whose whole existence seems to be in practicing!&#x2014; I feared &#x201C;the gentleman next door must be come to make <hi rend="italic">a shine</hi> [scene]. But the first glance at him as he entered, hat in hand, reassured me&#x2014; He lookd at me most benignly from head to foot&#x2014;sat down on the chair I motioned him to and then observed &#x201C;We have had a delightful day Mam&#x201D;!&#x2014; I myself led the conversation to the piano&#x2014;saying that I understood my husband had been invading his house today with a most unheard of remonstrance&#x2014;but the amiable gentleman would not let me finish&#x2014;he bewailed the annoyance his daughters must have given us&#x2014;bewailed our patience in having suffered so long without protest&#x2014;would do unheard of things to spare us in future&#x2014;the piano should be drawn into the middle of the floor&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> should never be opened&#x2014;there should be no playing in forenoons unless when the mistress came on Wednesdays&#x2014;and if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> could possible change the hour it should be done&#x2014;in short there never was such a complaisant gentleman as &#x201C;the gentleman of next door&#x201D; since this world began!&#x2014; When Carlyle came he seemed ready to fall on his knees before him to implore his forgiveness for having daughters who played on the piano&#x2014; I assure you we were quite melted by his superhuman politeness and he seemed to find himself quite melted by our greatful sense of it&#x2014;and he staid talking&#x2014;till suppertime!&#x2014;and then there was such a shaking of hands&#x2014;and repetition of civil speeches on both sides&#x2014;nobody knows what he can do till he tries! the putting down of a piano under such circumstances would have seemed desperate even to me!&#x2014; Today the <hi rend="italic">faintest</hi> sound of it was heard as if for trial for about a minute&#x2014;it was hardly audible&#x2014; Heaven knows how they have deadened the sound&#x2014; So pray my dear have a fly at your chimney cans [pots]!&#x2014;that is an insupportable thing and ought not to be tolerated for twentyfour hours&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>I know not whose turn it is to write; tho&#x2019; a suspicion has long attended me that it was yours,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written a note of introduction for the Rev. Orville Dewey, <date when="1843-02-26">26 Feb.</date>, which was not used till <date when="1843-06-00">June</date>. Emerson had last written on <date when="1842-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, TC on <date when="1842-11-17">17 Nov. 1842</date>.</note> and above all an indisputable wish that you would do it: but this present is a cursory line, all on business,&#x2014; and as usual all on business of my own.</p>
<p>I have finished a Book, and just set the Printer to it; one solid volume (rather bigger than one of the French-Revolution Volumes, as I compute): it is a somewhat fiery and questionable &#x201C;Tract for the Times,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> by a Puseyite, which the horrible aspect of things here has forced from me,&#x2014;I know not whether as preliminary to <hi rend="italic">Oliver</hi> or not; but it had gradually grown to be the preliminary of anything possible for me: so there it is written; and I am a very sick, but withal a comparatively very free man. The Title of the thing is to be <hi rend="italic">Past and Present:</hi> it is divided into Four Books, &#x201C;Book I. Proem,&#x201D; &#x201C;Book II. The Ancient Monk.&#x201D; &#x201C;Book III. The Modern Worker&#x201D;; and &#x201C;Book IV. Horoscope&#x201D; (or some such thing):&#x2014;the size of it I guessed at above.</p>
<p>The practical business, accordingly, is: How to cut out that New-York scoundrel, who fancies that because there is no gallows it is permitted to steal?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The New York publishers, D. Appleton &#x26; Co.; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410418-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:103</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-04-18">18 April 1841</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410521-TC-RWE-01"><sic>140</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1841-05-21">21 May 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have a distinct desire to do that;&#x2014;altogether apart from the money to be gained thereby. A friend&#x2019;s goodness ought not to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> frustrated by a scoundrel destitute of gallows.&#x2014; You told me long since how to do the operation;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had told TC, <date when="1841-04-30">30 April 1841</date>, to have his MS copied and sent to the U.S. in time for simultaneous publication in England and America.</note> and here, according to the best way I had of fitting your scheme into my materials, is my way of attempting it.</p>
<p>The Book will not be out here for six good weeks from this date; it could be kept back for a week or two longer, if that were indispensable: but I hope it may not. In three weeks, half of it will be printed; I, in the meanwhile, get a correct Ms. Copy of the later half made ready: joining the printed sheets and this <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>., your Bookseller<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Little &#x26; Brown, of Boston, Mass.</note> will have a three-weeks start of any rival, if I instantly despatch the Parcel <pb id="pg-16-77" n="16:77"/>to him. Will this do? This with the announcement of the Title as given above. Pray write to me straightway, and say. Your answer will be here before we can publish; and the Packet of Proofsheets and Manuscript may go off whether there be word from you or none.&#x2014; And so enough of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>. And indeed enough of all things for my haste is excessive in these hours.</p>
<p>The last <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> came to me about three weeks ago as <hi rend="italic">Post-Letter</hi>, charged something like a guinea of postage, if I remember; so it had to be rejected, and I have not yet seen that N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi> was a quarterly magazine, founded <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, as the organ of American transcendentalism, ed. by Emerson, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">44</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400926-TC-RWE-01"><sic>12:267&#x2013;68</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1840-09-26">26 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.

<dateline>[<date when="1843-03-13">13 March 1843</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>Dear Sir&#x2014;</salute> Some time ago your letter was delivered me; I take literally the first free half hour I have had since to write you a word of answer.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-16-82" n="16:82"/>It would give me true satisfaction could any advice of mine contribute to forward you in your honourable course of self-improvement, but a long experience has taught me that advice can profit but little; that there is a good reason why advice is so seldom followed; this reason namely, that it so seldom, and can almost never be, rightly given. No man knows the state of another; it is always to some more or less imaginary man that the wisest and most honest adviser is speaking.</p>
<p>As to the books which you&#x2014;whom I know so little of&#x2014;should read, there is hardly anything definite that can be said. For one thing, you may be strenuously advised to keep reading. Any good book, any book that is wiser than yourself, will teach you something&#x2014;a great many things, indirectly and directly, if your mind be open to learn. This old counsel of Johnson&#x2019;s is also good, and universally applicable:&#x2014;&#x2018;Read the book you do honestly feel a wish and curiosity to read.&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Boswell, <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> 393&#x2013;404, 1080.</note> The very wish and curiosity indicates that you, then and there, are the person likely to get good of it. &#x2018;Our wishes are presentiments of our capabilities;&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> that is a noble saying, of deep encouragement to all true men; applicable to our wishes and efforts in regard to reading as to other things. Among all the objects that look wonderful or beautiful to you, follow with fresh hope the one which looks wonderfullest, beautifullest. You will gradually find, by various trials (which trials see that you make honest, manful ones, not silly, short, fitful ones), what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> for you the wonderfullest, beautifullest&#x2014;what is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> true element and province, and be able to profit by that. True desire, the monition of nature, is much to be attended to. But here, also, you are to discriminate carefully between <hi rend="italic">true</hi> desire and false. The medical men tell us we should eat what we <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> have an appetite for; but what we only <hi rend="italic">falsely</hi> have an appetite for we should resolutely avoid. It is very true; and flimsy, desultory readers, who fly from foolish book to foolish book, and get good of none, and mischief of all&#x2014;are not these as foolish, unhealthy eaters, who mistake their superficial false desire after spiceries and confectionaries for their real appetite, of which even they are not destitute, though it lies far deeper, far quieter, after solid nutritive food? With these illustrations, I will recommend Johnson&#x2019;s advice to you.</p>
<p>Another thing, and only one other, I will say. All books are properly the record of the history of past men&#x2014;what thoughts past men had in them&#x2014;what actions past men did: the summary of all books whatsoever lies there. It is on this ground that the class of books specifically named History can be safely recommended as the basis of all study of books&#x2014;the preliminary to all right and full understanding <pb id="pg-16-83" n="16:83"/>of anything we can expect to find in books. Past history, and especially the past history of one&#x2019;s own native country, everybody may be advised to begin with that. Let him study that faithfully; innumerable inquiries will branch out from it; he has a broad-beaten highway, from which all the country is more or less visible; there travelling, let him choose where he will dwell.</p>
<p>Neither let mistakes and wrong directions&#x2014;of which every man, in his studies and elsewhere, falls into many&#x2014;discourage you. There is precious instruction to be got by finding that we are wrong. Let a man try faithfully, manfully, to be right, he will grow daily more and more right. It is, at bottom, the condition on which all men have to cultivate themselves. Our very walking is an incessant falling<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Sir Walter Scott,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:30.</note>&#x2014;a falling and a catching of ourselves before we come actually to the pavement!&#x2014;it is emblematic of all things a man does.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I will remind you that it is not by books alone, or by books chiefly, that a man becomes in all points a man. Study to do faithfully whatsoever thing in your actual situation, there and now, you find either expressly or tacitly laid to your charge; that is your post; stand in it like a true soldier. Silently devour the many chagrins of it, as all human situations have many; and see you aim not to quit it without doing all that <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, at least, required of you. A man perfects himself by work much more than by reading. They are a growing kind of men that can wisely combine the two things&#x2014;wisely, valiantly, can do what is laid to their hand in their present sphere, and prepare themselves withal for doing other wider things, if such lie before them.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many good wishes and encouragements, I remain, yours sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<p><pb id="pg-16-84" n="16:84"/>On Saturday, after I saw you, there came a young man, apparently with satisfactory copying talents;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For copying the MS of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430309-TC-GLC-01">TC to GLC [ca. <date when="1843-03-09">9 March</date>]</ref>.</note> whom, however, I apprised of the state we were in, and put off without any final response till Wednesday. He too was ignorant of the rate &#x2018;per 1000 words&#x2019;; nor have I yet learned that anywhere.</p>
<p>But the question at present is, How much <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. can the young lady copy <hi rend="italic">before the evening of the</hi> <date when="1843-03-29">29th <hi rend="italic">of March?</hi></date> The American Packet sails on the 1st of <date when="1843-04-00">April</date>; and I hope to get the Printer, with his share of the job, driven up to the mark at that time. The&#x2018;words&#x2019; are probably about 50,000; not fewer! If the young lady cannot do them all, the young man might have a share of them. But indeed I have not yet got the Printer&#x2019;s response;&#x2014;his devil having absented himself yesterday. At all events I wish you would ask your young lady, and let me know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Wilson is a capital singer; but last night we had only his Highland Songs, an inferior sample of the article. It was on an old engagement with the Wedgwoods that we went.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430116-JWC-FW-01">JWC to FW, [<date when="1843-01-16">16? Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> You and I must go some night, and hear the Jacobites.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <date when="1843-02-06">6 Feb.</date> and <date when="1843-03-06">6 March</date> concert had been billed as &#x201C;Adventures of Princes Charles,&#x201D; i.e., Jacobite songs.</note></p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>About four days ago I wrote to you about a new Book to be called
<hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>. I learn now that this letter, which I will make &#x201C;No. 2,&#x201D; can still go along with the former: and so, having made a variety of calculations and arrangements, I will now with all brevity (my haste being boundless) communicate to you the practical result of them.</p>
<p>Our next Steamer for Boston will sail on the <date when="1843-04-01">1st of April</date>. I have secured a copyist for the second portion of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, who is to be ready with his work all done, in time for that conveyance; the Printer, a punctual man, undertakes on the other hand to be ready with his share of the operation: wherefore, in brief, you can instruct your Boston Bookseller to expect a Complete Copy of the work by that said Steamer, so that his Printers may fall upon it, tooth and nail,&#x2014;and overtake ours if they can; at all events, completely distance the New-Yorker, it is to be hoped.</p>
<p>This is the essential of &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2.&#x201D; I will do what is in me to be punctual; and as my subordinates are steady people, I think we shall manage it.&#x2014; Our Book, as I compute, may be still some four weeks, after the <date when="1843-04-00">April</date> Steamer goes, in a hidden nascent state. If a Letter of yours in answer to this arrived before Publication, as is possible, and informed <pb id="pg-16-86" n="16:86"/>us that another week or two of delay will be essential, that too can easily be granted.</p>
<p>I send no &#x201C;Apologies&#x201D;: for they would but occupy my time and yours. I am very busy. Among my other operations I have undertaken to hear Lyell lecture on Geology,&#x2014;a somewhat superfluous enterprise, at once wearisome and ineffectual; our Geologist being dreadfully <hi rend="italic">Neptunean</hi> in his qualities, I fear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John Sterling arrived yesterday, to see his Mother who is very poorly. I have not got eye on him yet, but shall attempt it today.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On his return to Falmouth, Sterling told Caroline Fox that TC was &#x201C;very unhappy about the times, thinking everything as bad as ever, and conducted on the least happiness for the greatest number principle; the only thing good is, that people are made to feel unhappy, and so prove that enjoyment is not the object of life. His book is now being copied, and is to be printed simultaneously in England and America, so that he, being the Prophet to both lands, may receive the Profits from both&#x201D; (<date when="1843-03-24">24 March</date>, Fox 179).</note> Blessings and desert of blessings on you!</p>

<p><salute>My dear good Babbie</salute> to write me such a big letter! But <foreign><hi rend="italic">ecco la combinazione</hi></foreign> [here is the combination]! In reading your paragraph about the servant I said to myself like you &#x201C;that sounds well&#x201D;&#x2014;and I felt strongly minded to prosecute the scent&#x2014;for even when Helen is not in a temper I have no longer any comfort with her&#x2014; I do not know whether it be that she is fallen into that sort of chronic ill health which shows itself in listlessness and <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;confusion of ideas&#x201D;</hi> more than in any other way&#x2014;or whether it be that she has lost all care about pleasing me and so does not exert the faculties she has but certain it is the work of the house is always trailing behind her&#x2014;herself always untidy&#x2014;and nothing going on in the kitchen department as it ought to go on&#x2014; Carlyle as well as myself is out of all patience with her, and for a long while back, I have only kept her because I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> kept her, because I have a horror of changes&#x2014; Plainly however this posture of affairs could not be allowed to last for ever&#x2014;waited only <hi rend="italic">the fullness of time</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gal. 4:4.</note> to have itself altered&#x2014;and the result of my cogitations as to <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it would be best to part with her has always been that something would be finally settled when we should be leaving <pb id="pg-16-87" n="16:87"/>town&#x2014; I should try to find her a place then and get rid of her in a peaceable way&#x2014;for to leave <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in the house to invite all the thieves of Chelsea into it by publishing her terrors about them, was not to be thought of&#x2014; &#x2014;and to &#x201C;<foreign>clatch</foreign> [move awkwardly] her about the country&#x201D; with me as I did formerly, at great expense and trouble, required that she should be worth the expense and trouble&#x2014; Always understood however, in mental reservation, that someday I might give her her leave &#x201C;quite promiscuously&#x201D;&#x2014; If she broke out on me with any more insolence, my mind was made up to bring things to a termination at once&#x2014;and let her seek herself a place where she could find one&#x2014;</p>
<p>When I received your letter this morning then&#x2014;tho pleased to hear there was such a promising-sounding woman in the world&#x2014;I did not immediately jump at her&#x2014; In all probability she would be hired, before I could conscientiously put Helen away&#x2014;unless she committed some new <hi rend="italic">violence</hi> and that was not to be calculated on&#x2014; I meant to write then that all I could do in the matter for the present was to beg that you would keep an eye on her&#x2014; But <foreign><hi rend="italic">ecco la combinazione</hi></foreign> as I said before&#x2014; The sun being shining very bright this morning&#x2014;Helens <hi rend="italic">dirtiness</hi> showed itself more flagrant than usual&#x2014; Already Bingham Baring has been and others were likely to follow in so beautiful a day&#x2014;so for the credit of the house I begged her to get herself cleaned a little as soon as possible&#x2014;she was going to the door at the moment to speak to the Butcher&#x2014;she finished a long confabulation with him and then flouncing open the parlour door she presented herself with an air of fiery determination and asked me &#x201C;what was dirty about her? what I meant by desiring her to get herself cleaned&#x2014;her cap (a great frouzy yellow night cap) was clean&#x2014;her face was clean&#x2014;what did I mean at all&#x201D;? I told her; &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> that she had been going about for months back in a state of untidyness that gave the house the air of a dirty Lodging-house&#x2014;and that I wished her to reform herself in that particular &#x201C;I do not at all know what you would have?&#x201D; said she furiously&#x2014;&#x201C;I can keep myself no cleaner than I am&#x2014;and if your not content I cant help it&#x2014;you are always finding fault with something, and in short there is no pleasing of you&#x201D;!&#x2014; &#x201C;I will tell you how to please me&#x201D; said I&#x2014;&#x201C;by going and seeking yourself another place&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh! thank you&#x2014;thank you kindly,&#x201D; says she making a curtsey (!!) I want nothing better for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> part&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Very well then said I&#x2014;let it be understood you leave this house&#x201D;&#x2014; She slammed the door and ran down stairs&#x2014; In half an hour after she came flying up again&#x2014;with her face crimson and her eyes sparkling like a wild cats&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;Do you wish me to go <hi rend="italic">to day</hi> said she, or am I to do out the clothes?&#x2014;if you do not want me I can be ready in half an hours time&#x201D; &#x201C;You will do out the <pb id="pg-16-88" n="16:88"/>clothes and you will do your work for <hi rend="italic">a month</hi>, said I very cooly&#x2014; I do not choose you to run out into the streets again like a wild animal as you have done on former occasions&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;Oh&#x201D; says she saucily I can get myself a lodging&#x2014;you need not keep me a moment longer than you like&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Compose yourself said I&#x2014;it is not for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> sake I am keeping you but for <hi rend="italic">my own</hi>&#x2014; I do not choose to be without a servant&#x2014;go down stairs and remember that for another month you are <hi rend="italic">my servant</hi> neither more nor less&#x201D;!&#x2014; So under these sudden and <hi rend="italic">decisive</hi> circumstances&#x2014;I fling aside a coat I was lining for Carlyle (who is gone to Woolich)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the promised visit to Mary Rich, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430314-TC-MRI-01">TC to <sic>MR</sic><corr>MRI</corr>, [<date when="1843-03-14">14 March</date>]</ref>.</note> and write to you by return of post&#x2014;to beg that you will throw yourself vigorously into the matter of investigating this woman&#x2014;the account of her qualifications is perfectly satisfactory&#x2014;but can it be ascertained if she be <hi rend="italic">honest&#x2014;sober</hi>&#x2014;and not an absolute <hi rend="italic">fury</hi>&#x2014;a little heat of temper I do not mind&#x2014;all good servants have it&#x2014;and will you see her&#x2014;and judge whether <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should like her countenance&#x2014;I never saw any good come of a disagreeable-<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> servant with whatever recommendations.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Here is another little Note, written in a small minute which I have been able to snatch from the general gulph; for I am still kept incessantly busy, and have no time at all to spare, of late days. Our Printers are hard at work; and I think have now about the fourth part of their job done: perhaps the worst with them is over, which generally is the getting of them fairly set under way,&#x2014;in the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> they are to travel. But I have also had a good deal of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] with certain <hi rend="italic">Copyists</hi>; persons, namely, that I had to get in great haste to copy a portion of the Manuscript for the use of the Americans; to prevent a certain &#x2018;free and enlightened citizen&#x2019; there from stealing the Publication of the thing from me. In short, I am and shall be kept in a perpetual <foreign><hi rend="italic">fike</hi></foreign> [fidget] till this business be off my hand: I send you a printed leaf to shew what kind of look it is like to have;&#x2014;and will say no more about it at present.</p>
<p>The other day I had a letter from John Carlyle, our half-brother in Canada:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), TC&#x2019;s half-brother, had emigrated to Canada via the U.S. and settled nr. Brantford, Ontario, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18180902-TC-JCE-01"><sic>1:139</sic><corr>TC to JCE, <date when="1818-09-02">2 Sept. 1818</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400815-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:228</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-08-15">15 Aug. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> poor fellow, he does not explain much of his situation; but writes in an affectionate manner; and does seem to be busy and in health, and making the way about as long as the day, in a tolerable manner. His first Farm-lease is out; but he has taken another Farm, and planted himself there, about 5 miles from the old place,&#x2014;his former <hi rend="italic">address</hi> still serving. He says he has not money enough to buy a cleared Farm; and his sons rather incline &#x201C;to be mechanics&#x201D; than farmers.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His eldest son, John, became a farmer; James and William became, respectively, a school principal and a school inspector. John and Peggy Carlyle also had two das., Janet and Mary.</note> I sent the Letter over to Jack, and he was to forward it to Alick.&#x2014; Alick seems to have made up his mind to quit his present business at Ecclefechan; but nothing other that is satisfactory hitherto suggests itself to him. Poor Alick, I wish greatly he could fall into something: but I cannot give him any advice; indeed nothing but his own choice could give him a fair chance in whatever enterprise he took to. A small Farm might suit him: but I doubt there is none attainable in your part of the world at present.</p>
<p>Jane keeps tolerably well; and now we have got sunshine again too, beautiful spring weather. Our servant Helen is about to bundle; she has long been discontented, very useless, inclined to insolence withal; <pb id="pg-16-90" n="16:90"/>so yesterday she was finally apprised to make ready. Jane thinks a good successor may be procured from Liverpool, by aid of her cousins. We can do either way, for a while, as it is not our expectation or purpose to continue thro&#x2019; the summer here, but to flit somewhither towards the sea-coast.</p>
<p>Jenny I suppose is come up to you by this time: give her my kind regards, and encourage her to write again. Sucess to James at Thornhill.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently James Aitken had taken a lease of a business at Thornhill (13 mi.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>&#x2014;</salute>I wrote on Saturday to my Russian; he called yesterday with his answer. I, unfortunately, had gone out, and he had to leave it with my wife. Still more unfortunately, the answer itself proved to be entirely negative, and very little better than zero.</p>
<p>He does not think that there is on sale in any shop in London a single Russian book. Nobody learns the language here; a few English merchants about Petersburg are the only English persons that do. He knew of a teacher of Russian here at one time, but he could get hardly any shadow of encouragement, and after long struggling had to withdraw to Brighton, where probably he now is.</p>
<p>My Russian (probably a <hi rend="italic">German</hi> merchant, and a most obliging man)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Robert von Glehn, merchant; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430227-JWC-HW-01">JWC to HW, [<date when="1843-02-27">27 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> is persuaded that there must be extant some kind of Russian-English grammar, Russian-English dictionary, for the use of the St. Petersburg English clerks, if no otherwise, but he himself is entirely ignorant of any. The like as to Russian-French, though probably the hope is greater on that side. This is all that he knows. For the rest, he will &#x201C;send to St. Petersburg&#x201D; for me, &#x201C;send to Paris,&#x201D; do all that a zealous man can do. If you think, in these circumstances, it is worth while prosecuting such an outlook, pray entrust me, and I will most cheerfully employ this gentleman, who, I think, will like to be employed by me. If your brother be <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> to learn Russian,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), who joined the colonial office, rather than George (b. <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>), still at school but later minister at the Court of Saxony; there were three other brothers, all of whom served in India.</note> it might be possible for him, but such books as we are like to get will almost infallibly be <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>, and the difficulties will be greatly increased thereby. They can be got, it seems, by sending to St. Petersburg, and St. Petersburg can be sent to.</p>
<p>I am afraid I shall not get so far eastward to-day as to see you again this time.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strachey at Mount St., Grosvenor Sq.</note> Let us hope you will return before long. Pray take care of yourself; keep up and encourage the improvement you are already making; exercise and regimen, not medicine or doctors.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strachey was partly crippled by inflammation of the knee.</note> And so Good speed you.</p>

<p>I cannot make out from your Tuesday&#x2019;s letter whether you had received mine of Monday&#x2014;or no. Appearances are against your having received it&#x2014;for you make no allusion to any part of its contents nor yet to the letter of our immortal Cousin James which was enclosed in it<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Baillie, JWC&#x2019;s maternal cousin; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400715-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:196</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-07-15">15 July 1840</date></corr></ref>. JWC had forgotten to put Liverpool on her letter of <date when="1843-03-20">20 March</date>.</note>&#x2014; Yet I cannot fancy how it could have miscarried&#x2014;or failed to arrive at the right time (Tuesday morning) being that I as good as put <supplied>[it]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> in the post office with my own hand&#x2014;on Monday at midday&#x2014; that is to say I saw with my own eyes Robertson put it into the post office with his hand&#x2014; But perhaps I had forgotten to address it! I sometimes do such things. &#x2014;yet no&#x2014;for I remember Robertson asking <pb id="pg-16-95" n="16:95"/>me in looking at the letter &#x201C;Where is Maryland Street&#x201D;?&#x2014; Am I sure however that I put <hi rend="italic">Liverpool?</hi> if not&#x2014;the letter of course <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have a rather discursive progress&#x2014;</p>
<p>In the case of your not having had that otherwise of-no-consequence-letter you will be thinking me no better than I should be&#x2014;and to put an end to such misappreciation I write to day merely to say that I had written&#x2014;for today my head is specially bad and I am not up to a decent letter&#x2014;in compensation I send you a document from Thackeray&#x2014;which has wit enough in it to make up for any sort of scrap&#x2014; To understand it aright I must tell you that he and Fitzgerald came here that evening we were at the musical lecture<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1843-03-13">13 March</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430314-TC-GLC-01">TC to GLC, [<date when="1843-03-14">14 March</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> evening in which they <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have failed to find at least one of us at home&#x2014; Ever since I had been thinking occasionally that I should write him a note of regrets and fix an evening&#x2014;but my intention like too many others during the last week had gone to the paying of <hi rend="italic">the bad place!</hi>&#x2014; To sharpen my sense of hospitality there arrived this letter from Fitz-boodle<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Thackeray&#x2019;s many pseudonyms.</note> two days ago which would have made even old Pistrucci &#x201C;in the Character of Heraclytus&#x201D; laugh.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Filippo Pistrucci (ca. <date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), actor and improvisatore (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360625-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:360</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1836-06-25">25 June 1836</date></corr></ref>) in Mazzini&#x2019;s circle, nicknamed Heraclitus, after &#x201C;the weeping philosopher&#x201D; of Ephesus (fl. <date>500 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>).</note> Pray return it to be present among my genuine treasures&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Having a few minutes to myself today, I will again scribble you a line. The Doctor sent me down Alick&#x2019;s Letter; the best news in which was that you were in your usual tolerable state of health; that you had walked out with him &#x201C;to the top of the Potter Knowe.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The hill behind Middlebie, a few mi. NE of Ecclefechan.</note> I am very glad to hear so much authentically particularized.&#x2014; Since yesterday, in order to be farther from the fire in these warmer days, and have my <hi rend="italic">side</hi> to the light, which I like better, I have shifted my writing-table; <pb id="pg-16-96" n="16:96"/>and now every time I look up, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> affectionate sorrowing face looks down on me from the Picture-frame above the mantel-piece:&#x2014;my dear good Mother! It has a sorrow in it, that face, which goes into my very heart. But it is not to be called a mere &#x201C;sorrow&#x201D; either; it is a noble <hi rend="italic">weariness</hi> rather, as of much work <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. I will wish all men and all women such a &#x201C;sorrow.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Our Printing here goes on with tolerable success; and is not about half finished. He is a good clever man my Printer, whom I discovered several years ago, and whom I have insisted on sticking to ever since.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robson, of the printers Levey, Robson, &#x26; Franklyn, had printed vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> and done most of TC&#x2019;s printing since <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>.</note> They say, &#x201C;He is a little dearer.&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well,&#x201D; I answer, &#x201C;ought he not; being considerably <hi rend="italic">better?</hi>&#x201D; A <hi rend="italic">better</hi> man ought to be had in respect, and by all methods encouraged, whereever we fall in with him.&#x2014; My Copyists (for the American Market) give me somewhat more trouble: but they also, as I trust, will be all over in about a week. The Packet of Paper will then go off from Liverpool, and I shall have no more to do with it: if they can thereby save themselves from the American thief, it shall be well: if not, why then he must steal; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could not hinder him!&#x2014; One of my chief Copyists is a poor young woman who has been bedrid for almost a year, totally unable to stir from the spot, with a disease in the back-bone. There are two sisters of them; daughters of a Widow: the Widow married again, and they could not live with the new Father; accordingly they removed into a lodging of their own to support themselves by being governesses in Schools: they were doing extremely well, till this one was lamed in the way I speak of,&#x2014; and now, poor thing, she is striving to write, or to sew, or to do anything she possibly can for herself, lying fixed on her back! The writing she makes is not good; but it is very pains-taking: how can I complain of it? By and by I mean to go and see the poor girls myself, and ascertain whether any other aid be possible for them.</p>
<p>The distress of many thousands of people is extreme at present. The silent distress, as usual, is often the worst. Jane, walking out the other day, was struck with the look of a poor middle-aged woman, crawling along the streets with a staff, who seemed to be &#x201C;more dead than alive&#x201D;; one of the saddest wasted spectres, Jane said, she ever saw in this world. Jane went to her house; found the woman lying on some tatters of <foreign>clouts</foreign> on the floor, patiently &#x201C;dying of a deep decline&#x201D;: the Doctor had ordered her mutton-broth, but she could not get any, so the Doctor ceased to come near her. Her husband was a farm-servant, 18 miles off,&#x2014;her eldest daughter, fifteen years old, was at a kind of charity school, out all day; they had to pay 2/ a-week for rent <pb id="pg-16-97" n="16:97"/>of their garret-room: the rent-payment had gone with their last penny, that day Jane had seen her out on the street,&#x2014;ever since which exertion she had been obliged to lie still, &#x201C;being rather worse for the exertion.&#x201D; Jane managed to get her an old bed-tick and fill it with clean sound straw, an old blanket,&#x2014;also to get the daughter a besom, and charge her to clean up the house: finally, what was best of all, to get the poor woman a little broth;&#x2014;and now <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of them are in hopes the poor creature may not die; for her &#x201C;decline&#x201D; seems first of all to have been cold and hunger, with some slight ailment in the winter time! The woman has a good character; and, Jane thinks, a hard proud temper, which perhaps has driven her husband, who was a dissipated fellow, away from her, tho&#x2019; he still sends 10 shillings a-week, an astonishing sum of money for him,&#x2014;but inadequate here for a mother and four children.&#x2014; I must not omit one other feature of the business: the wretched people, neighbours of the woman, seemed struck with spite that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had got anybody to look after her; and one of them, probably some boy or the like, out of some window had <hi rend="italic">spat</hi> upon Jane&#x2019;s shawl as she came out! Nothing more miserable was in all the concern than that.&#x2014; I suppose such cases exist by the thousand in all quarters of this ill-fated country at present.</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s Letter, both his Letters are very gloomy, as indeed is not surprising: he seems decided for leaving Ecclefechan, and does not know yet whitherward he shall go. Jack wrote to me that he did not think Haregills Farm would do,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 4 mi. N of Ecclefechan.</note> the land being all scourged out, and the requisite outfit of capital very large. He seemed to think, however, that perhaps some small farm of a feasible sort, like the Gill<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The farm 4&#xBD; mi. NW of Annan where TC&#x2019;s sister Mary (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>) and her husband, James Austin (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300129-TC-MAC-01"><sic>5:68</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1830-01-29">29 Jan. 1830</date></corr></ref>), had lived since <date when="1839-10-00">Oct. 1839</date>.</note> or so, might be worth looking after. As for me I do not know how to give a word of advice to Alick, this way or that: I can only give him my deep sympathy, and be ready any moment to assist him in what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> advises himself to do. Certainly he has need of forming a manful decided resolution; but it is <hi rend="italic">he</hi> that must form it, if there is to be a fair chance of his succeeding in it: we cannot much assist him, poor fellow, in that! There is a gloomy energy in his late Letters, which is very painful, but is not without hope to me. I prophesy sometimes, with inexpressible satisfaction, that he will get <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of the thing that has been <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> with him; and rise, in the name of God, and rectify it! If he can, it will be a victory more glorious than all he ever yet contemplated even in his boyish dreams. God assist him, my poor much-erring, much-enduring, brave, kind and truehearted Brother! I believe <pb id="pg-16-98" n="16:98"/>it really will be useful for him to quit Ecclefechan, at any rate: he ought never to have gone thither; among such a set of &#x201C;infamies,&#x201D; as he himself correctly names them.&#x2014; You will give him my heart&#x2019;s love, dear Mother: and as for yourself, you will behave in this matter hence-forth as you have done hitherto, in the brave silent manner he describes to us.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Poor Isabella gives us all much uneasiness;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Generally unwell, Isabella was expecting a baby within four or five weeks. She had evidently asked John Carlyle for his advice, for he wrote to her, <date when="1843-03-03">3 March</date>: &#x201C;there can be little room for expecting any decided improvement till after your confinement but I hope you will then recover your health &#x26; strength again as you did under almost similar circumstances before&#x201D; (NLS Acc. 9086.199).</note> but we will hope whatever is good nevertheless. My blessings and prayers with one and all of you! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mother, for this day.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On the foregoing leaf is a piece of German writing,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An extract of a letter to TC from Varnhagen, dated Berlin, <date when="1843-03-12">12 March 1843</date>, and copied in TC&#x2019;s hand. In trans. the extract reads: &#x201C;The life of Jean Paul is a <supplied>[word illegible]</supplied> very painstaking piece of work, which I greatly prefer to the German sources from which it is drawn; thus also the Hon. Mitchell&#x2019;s life of Wallenstein, which provides the nucleus from the uncritical desert of Forster&#x2019;s biography and, as it were, presents it purified. The document regarding this historical figure are not yet available for a complete winding-up; for that, further publications from the Austrian archives, or, failing these, freer points of view, must be awaited, than those which our historians now have. Schiller the poet has without doubt correctly seized the character of Wallenstein as such, and through empathetic creative power penetrated to the historical situation. Exactly seen, the most vigorous historian is on the whole the most certain. The mind is always a master of circumstances and objects are formed through perception&#x201D; (MS: Yale). The life of Jean Paul was by Eliza B. Lee, and the life of Wallenstein by John Mitchell; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430205-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1843-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref> Friedrich Christoph F&#xF6;rster, <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein</hi> &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">Eine Biographie</hi> (Potsdam, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>).</note> which, if you please, you may slit off, and forward to Col. Mitchell by the first Packet you chance to be sending.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mitchell, on half pay since <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, was an unattached lt. col. He spent part of each year on the Continent and part in Edinburgh.</note> One real Soldier and Writer may, with satisfaction, hear any word that another of the like character will say of him or of his work.</p>

<p>But it were cruel to keep you puzzling your bits of brains!&#x2014; Well then&#x2014;know that on Saturday I sat from twelve till four to&#x2014;Gambardella&#x2014;for my picture!&#x2014;to be given to <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>&#x2014;and again yesterday from eleven till four!&#x2014;and you all the while expecting him in Maryland Street on his way to London!!</p>
<p>On Friday morning he scampered up to this door on a grey horse&#x2014; and took the house as it were by storm&#x2014; I found him fatter&#x2014;more hairy&#x2014;and more in love with himself than ever&#x2014;but the same good hearted fellow as ever&#x2014; He spoke of you all in greatful and approving terms!&#x2014;but it is my Uncle who is his <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> in the family&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> man&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> man&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">especially when excited</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh there was nothing in Liverpool he liked so well as to see <hi rend="italic">Welsh</hi> excited&#x201D;&#x2014; He talked a vast quantity of nonsense, not without flashes of good sense&#x2014;and ended by telling me that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come to him <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> to sit&#x2014;&#x201C;without any words about it&#x201D;&#x2014;he had &#x201C;promised the picture to <hi rend="italic">Jeanie</hi>, and if he did not do it before he began to other <hi rend="italic">wo-k</hi> he would never probably find leisure to do it at all&#x201D;&#x2014; Of course I was quite ready to sacrifice my <hi rend="italic">humility</hi> or as you consider it my <hi rend="italic">vanity</hi>&#x2014;when <pb id="pg-16-100" n="16:100"/>&#x201C;Jeanie&#x201D; was to be the gainer&#x2014;so I appointed to go to him the following day&#x2014;I was very unwell however the morning he came&#x2014;but as he complimented me on my looks, I thought it needless to call myself ill&#x2014;and besides I hoped to be better by the time I should need to go to him&#x2014; Thack<supplied>[era]</supplied>y and Fitzgerald were to dine with us that day (Friday)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS reads &#x201C;Thacky.&#x201D; In a letter dated from London, &#x201C;Friday,&#x201D; probably <date when="1843-03-24">24 March</date>, FitzGerald said in a postscript to a friend: &#x201C;Just off to dine with Carlyle&#x2014; on sheep&#x2019;s head&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:387).</note>&#x2014; I baked a mutton pie and a raspberry tart in a state of great suffering got thro the dinner&#x2014;hoped to get thro the tea&#x2014;and then promised myself to go to bed&#x2014;but just before the men came up stairs, my affairs reached a consummation&#x2014;I fainted&#x2014;and had to be carried to bed&#x2014;and lay for three hours alternating between fainting and retching&#x2014;Helen blubbering over me, and the men, increased by the arrival of Spedding and Robertson,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Spedding and John Robertson.</note> raging and laughing in the adjoining room&#x2014; Oh I assure you I have not passed such an evening for a good while.

<salute>My darling</salute>
<p>I do not wonder that my uncle is suffering from this weather&#x2014;it is very cruel on all ailing people&#x2014; To the east wind I impute my own increase of discomfort of late days&#x2014;the pain in my side as bad as ever&#x2014;continual nausea from morning till night&#x2014;and a &#x201C;confusion of ideas&#x201D; that &#x201C;heats the womb&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014; &#x2014;all yesterday I lay on the sofa fairly given up to despair&#x2014;for the time being&#x2014;and today it is only by a strong effort of <hi rend="italic">will</hi> that I can hinder myself from doing the same feat&#x2014;</p>
<p>Here is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> letter&#x2014;come back to me&#x2014;having like the Dove of the ark<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 8:8&#x2013;9</note> found no rest for the sole of its foot!&#x2014;to think of the botheration I have caused to so many poor post-men thro this <foreign><hi rend="italic">betise</hi></foreign> [stupidity] of an address! Our own postman had been tried with it, he told me, from its bearing the Chelsea post mark<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter to Jeannie Welsh of [<date when="1843-03-20">20 March</date>], on which JWC had forgotten to write &#x201C;Liverpool.&#x201D; At least six postmen signed with various comments, such as &#x201C;No such Street in Chelsea,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Not known in Marylebond St. Golden Sq.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; But for James Baillie&#x2019;s letter inside they would not even have known where to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> it&#x2014;for it has no signature&#x2014;nor date!&#x2014; What I feared was they might perhaps have sent it to James whose letter <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a date!! &#x2014;I have read it over with some curiosity&#x2014;and should rather like to know if <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;The Officers appointed by Her Majesty&#x2019;s Postmaster General for opening letters&#x201D; read</hi> this one as well as <hi rend="italic">opened</hi> it! and if he be a man that one is likely ever to meet in society!</p>
<p>And now Babbie I have something on my mind to tell three&#x2014;a sort of confession&#x2014;at the thought of which I feel a certain delicate carnation steal over what Geraldine calls my &#x201C;horribly pale face&#x201D;!&#x2014;in what words to put it?&#x2014;best out with it at once!&#x2014; I have again been got the better of by Helen!!!&#x2014; Plainly it is now a hopeless thing that I shall <pb id="pg-16-103" n="16:103"/>ever have the force to emancipate myself! I seem to have got into the relation with her of the gentleman and his old Butler of seventy who on being told by his Master that his temper was become absolutely insupportable and that they two <hi rend="italic">must</hi> part&#x2014;asked his Master in ironical astonishment&#x2014;&#x201C;Where the deevil wud ye gang to&#x201D;? <hi rend="italic">Helen</hi> asks <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; &#x201C;if I cant let alone <hi rend="italic">greeting</hi> [weeping] to see you ill when I am here to take care of you, I should like to know what would become of me&#x2014; away from you, fancying you ill, and not knowing whether you were taken right care of or not?&#x2014;&#x201D; by this puzzling question, and a declaration that she had made up her mind <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to seek a place&#x2014;but if &#x201C;a new woman&#x201D; came to go into a lodging! and &#x201C;let anything come of her that liked&#x201D;&#x2014;and by the usual promises of perfect infallability for the future, and lyrical recognitions of herself being &#x201C;just the stupidest <hi rend="italic">unluckiest</hi> cretur that ever lived&#x201D;&#x2014;by all this, and plentiful tears&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">kisses</hi> even&#x2014;for I was lying on the floor entirely at her mercy&#x2014;she moved me at last to say &#x201C;well&#x2014;be quiet and stay there&#x201D;&#x2014; So now we are going on beautifully again&#x2014;as always after a <foreign>Stramash</foreign> [up-roar]&#x2014;her faculties have been awakened up into new activity&#x2014;she does her work as well as any one could desire&#x2014;and is ready to lay the hair of her head under my feet&#x2014;if it could but last!</p>
<p>Anyhow&#x2014;it would really seem that I do the poor blockhead injustice in ever suspecting that she is not very heartily attached to me&#x2014; she <hi rend="italic">exploites</hi> her attachment somewhat&#x2014;but to make much ado about everything is her way&#x2014; I believe the fact that touched me most on this last occasion&#x2014;was her having gone out one evening <hi rend="italic">all dressed</hi>&#x2014; as if to offer for a place&#x2014;(to save her poor little dignity) and as I afterwards came to know having passed all the while of her absence with one of the <hi rend="italic">numbers</hi>&#x2014;No 4<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The maid at 4 Cheyne Row.</note>&#x2014;in the city!&#x2014;there was something really affecting in that poor little struggle between angry pride and unsubduable affection! dont you think so?&#x2014; Geraldine would laugh at all this spoonyism on my part&#x2014;but you dear Babbie will not laugh&#x2014;will you?</p>
<p>On the very morning before my fainting fit,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fri., <date when="1843-03-24">24 March</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430327-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-03-27">27 March</date>]</ref>.</note> in course of which our reconciliation took place, Geraldine had written me of a paragon which her Miss Darby had found for me in Essex<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaretta Darby, who since <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> had been living at High Laver Rectory, nr.

<p>I think I will send you Geraldine&#x2019;s last letter just to show you her <hi rend="italic">admirable toleration</hi>&#x2014;I only regret that I have not the letter to which it is an answer&#x2014;to send also to show you&#x2014;how her fire can burn as bright as ever not only without new fuel but under plentiful application of cold water&#x2014;the last page gives you <hi rend="italic">her</hi> interpretation of my reserve&#x2014;it is my <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014; Does she really in her heart so interpret it?&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">chi sa</hi></foreign> [who knows]?</p>
<p>&#x2014;Your gladness over the picture is very pleasing to me&#x2014;an ample remuneration for any <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;trouble&#x201D;</hi> I had with it&#x2014;I must go and see it again finished, for there was still a good deal to do to it&#x2014; &#x2014; But I must tell you it has cost me more than <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi>&#x2014;it has cost me&#x2014;the adoration of&#x2014;old Sterling! &#x2014;Yes Babbie&#x2014;that picture has made a breach between us which can never surely be healed in this world!&#x2014; &#x201C;Devil may care&#x201D;!&#x2014; Sterling called here during my last sitting, and was stupidly enough told by Carlyle where I was gone and how occupied&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">of course</hi> he came puffing off to Michael Place and demanded admission<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gambardella&#x2019;s studio at 8 Michael Pl., Brompton Sq.</note>&#x2014; G. had given orders to his maid that &#x201C;nobody whatsoever&#x201D; was to be let in to him that day&#x2014;that he was &#x201C;not at home&#x201D;&#x2014;and that point settled he had turned the key of his door on me&#x2014; &#x2014;Well Sterling insisted&#x2014;persuaded the woman to take up his name&#x2014; G. indignant at having his <foreign><hi rend="italic">fiat</hi></foreign> protested against&#x2014;roared out &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">No!</hi>&#x2014; I repeat to you stupid woman as you are&#x2014;I am not at home&#x201D;&#x2014; Sterling thereupon ought certainly to have gone away&#x2014;but the thing which he <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to do is seldom that which he does&#x2014;very curious to see the picture doubtless&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has long been wanting a picture of me the old fool&#x2014;he again sent up the poor maid to say it was M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle whom he wished to see for a few minutes&#x2014; &#x201C;Are you mad&#x201D;? cried Gambardella now perfectly furious&#x2014;&#x201C;go back you vile woman, and repeat that I am not at home&#x201D;&#x2014;this order was given with an authoritative wave of his hand to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;on my compliance with which, I felt that the fate of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> picture depended&#x2014;so I kept my seat and left the thing to take its course&#x2014; &#x2014;Tho&#x2019; every word he said must have been heard at the street door and far beyond it&#x2014; Sterling nevertheless, as willful as himself, persevered&#x2014;actually proceeded to ascend the stairs&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">without a search-warrant</hi>&#x2014;to look for a woman whose pleasure it was, clearly enough, not to be found!&#x2014; This was too bad&#x2014;for it was a liberty he would not have dared to take in the house of a private <pb id="pg-16-105" n="16:105"/>Gentleman&#x2014;it was showing Gambardella that he regarded his study merely as a <hi rend="italic">shop</hi>&#x2014; I cannot then be angry with G. for what followed&#x2014;his behaviour was savage&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">brutal</hi> if you will&#x2014;but he was in a state of justifiable <hi rend="italic">excitement</hi>&#x2014; He stood with the door in his hand looking like a concentration of a hundred lions&#x2014;facing Sterling, whom I <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> but did not <hi rend="italic">see</hi> on the stair&#x2014; &#x201C;I wish to see M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x201D; said S. in a tone of forced politeness&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am engaged Sir said G. fiercely&#x2014; I am painting&#x2014; I desired my servant to tell you I was not at home&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Along with this Letter there will go from Liverpool, on the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, in<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, the promised Parcel, complete Copy of the Book called <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, of which you already had two simultaneous announcements. The name of the Steam Packet, I understand, is <hi rend="italic">the Britannia</hi>. I have addressed the Parcel to the care of &#x201C;Messrs Little and Brown, Book-sellers, Boston,&#x201D; with your name atop: I calculate, it will arrive safe enough.</p>
<p>About 100 pages of the <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. Copy have proved superfluous, the text <pb id="pg-16-107" n="16:107"/>being there also in a printed shape; I had misestimated the Printer&#x2019;s velocity; I was anxious too that there should be no failure as to time. The <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. is very indifferent in that section of it; the damage therefore is smaller: your press-correcter can acquaint himself with the <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> &#x26;c, by means of it. A poor young governess, confined to a horizontal posture, and many sad thoughts, by a disease of the spine, was our artist in that part of the business: her writing is none of the distinctest; but it was a work of charity to give it her. I hope the thing is all as correct as I could make it. I do not bethink me of anything farther I have to add in the way of explanation.</p>
<p>In fact my prophecy rather is at present that Appleton the gibbetless thief at New York will beat us after all!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >D. Appleton &#x26; Co.</note> Never mind if he do. To say truth, I myself shall almost be glad: there has been a botheration in this anxious arrangement of parts, correcting of scrawly manuscript copies of what you never wished to read more, and insane terror withal of having your own <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. burnt or lost,&#x2014;that has exceeded my computation. Not to speak of this trouble in which I involve you, my Friend; which, I truly declare, makes me ashamed! True, one <hi rend="italic">is</hi> bound to resist the Devil in all shapes; if a man come to steal from you, you will put on what locks and padlocks are at hand, and not on the whole say, &#x201C;Steal, then!&#x201D; But if the locks prove insufficient, and the thief do break thro&#x2019;,&#x2014;that side of the alternative also will suit you very well; and, with perhaps a faint prayer for gibbets where they are necessary, you will say to Appleton, next time, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Macte virtue</hi></foreign>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Go on and increase in valor&#x201D;; <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 9:641.</note> my man!&#x201D;</p>
<p>All is in a whirl with me here today; no other topic but this very poor one can be entered upon.&#x2014; I hope for a Letter from your own hand soon, and some news about still more interesting matters.</p>

The other day there comes a new enthusiastic Letter from the same party, and a <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> Paper this time, of very greatly improved quality,&#x2014;and in flagrant imitation, this time, of Waldo Emerson! <pb id="pg-16-108" n="16:108"/>I wrote to the young man; <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;</hi><foreign><hi rend="italic">Benissime</hi></foreign> [very well], Do as thou hast <hi rend="italic">said!&#x201D;</hi> for it is all about the greatness of the soul &#x26;c &#x26;c.

Carlyle made the grave discovery some three weeks ago that the cat&#x2014;our &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> cat&#x201D; was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all full of kittens</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and accordingly yesterday <hi rend="italic">he</hi>&#x2014;or as we must now I suppose call him&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> brought forth&#x2014;modestly&#x2014;in the coal-hole four little angels of kittens&#x2014;black and white&#x2014;the tender images of their parental<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, probably intending &#x201C;paternal.&#x201D;</note> parent, whom I observed this morning, sauntering with a melancholy, reflective, <pb id="pg-16-109" n="16:109"/>air thro the back-premises&#x2014;as if foreboding the untimely end of his innocent offspring!&#x2014; To be sure they must be drowned in the course of the day; and that is piteous to think of!&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest; your picture is finished&#x2014;I sat again on Friday<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1843-03-31">31 March</date>.</note> from ten till two! and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> worked at it by himself all the rest of that day! so in point of <hi rend="italic">finishing</hi> you may fancy it has had all manner of justice done to it&#x2014;indeed I think M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Millner Gibson looks coarse beside me!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s opinion of Gambardella&#x2019;s portrait of Susanna Milner-Gibson (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420904-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:67</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-09-04">4 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>), see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421111-TC-JAC-01"><sic>15:174</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1842-11-11">11 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> As for the <hi rend="italic">likeness</hi>; you are to know, for your comfort that he has now worked the <foreign><hi rend="italic">estasi</hi></foreign> [ecstasy] pretty well out of it&#x2014;and it looks <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> enough&#x2014;Carlyle thinks too simple <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;for anything&#x201D;!</hi> (as you say in Lancashire)&#x2014; The eyes he says &#x201C;want expression&#x201D; the mouth &#x201C;wants character&#x201D;&#x2014;but for one person that finds it less <hi rend="italic">inspired-looking</hi> than the original there will be twenty finding it excessively flattered. Gambardella&#x2019;s own criticism on it when finished was, (with a look of ineffable self-complacency) &#x201C;It looks too young! I must put in some wrinkless!&#x201D;&#x2014; The frames are not yet ready&#x2014;and besides he seems to wish that I should keep it here for a few days that the visitors may see it&#x2014;a harmless vanity in which it were but fair to indulge him. So be patient&#x2014;it is not even dry yet&#x2014;</p>
<p>My last days sitting was enlivened by the most extraordinary of all <hi rend="italic">excitements</hi> he has yet found out for himself&#x2014; I do not speak of the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;wittels&#x201D;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., victuals.</note> he produced for me&#x2014;About a hundredweight of rusks in a great paper-bag&#x2014;A whole hoop of figs&#x2014;Guiness&#x2019;s Porter, Scotch Ale&#x2014; Indian Ale&#x2014;Cyder and something else with an incomprehensible Italian name!&#x2014; This gigantic lunch was laughable enough but not to be recorded as in the sphere of the absolutely extraordinary&#x2014;however that you may have a clear understanding of what I am about to tell you, we must begin further back&#x2014;!</p>
<p>At my second sitting,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sun., <date when="1843-03-26">26 March</date>.</note> he was telling me of sundry new household arrangements which he contemplated&#x2014; He had engaged the two upper rooms in addition to those he had&#x2014;partly that he might <supplied>[have]</supplied><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a place to show visitors into besides his studio, and partly because the gentleman and his wife who at present occupied them are so&#x2014;dreadfully <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi> that he cannot endure to meet them in the stairs! Then he was going &#x201C;to have a gu-l all to himself; the lodging-house gu-ls being vile creatures who left finger-marks on every thing&#x201D;&#x2014;and this gu-l should wash his brushes, mend his linen, make fancy-dresses for his <pb id="pg-16-110" n="16:110"/>pictures, according to his own directions, out of &#x201C;very rich <hi rend="italic">stoffs</hi>&#x201D; which he intended to buy&#x2014;and most important of all should &#x201C;have beautiful fo-ms&#x201D; and sit to him for model whenever he needed one&#x2014; In fact he had already sent an advertisement for such a person to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper!</p>
<p>Poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling&#x2019;s two hundred and eighty nursery-governesses<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who, presumably, answered an advert. placed by Susannah Sterling, b. Barton (d. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), John&#x2019;s wife (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>8:140</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>).</note> rushed thro my mind&#x2014;and I thought; God help you! you know not what you are bringing on yourself&#x2014; But as the thing was <hi rend="italic">done</hi> I saw no use in frightening him about the consequences beforehand&#x2014;they would disclose themselves only too soon&#x2014; I asked merely how his advertisement was worded&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Wanted a very genteel girl to do <hi rend="italic">very genteel work</hi>&#x2014; not under fifteen nor exceeding eighteen years of age&#x2014;wages from twenty to thirty pounds per annum&#x201D;!!!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The advert. in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1843-03-30">30 March</date>, read: &#x201C;WANTED, a respectable genteel GIRL, from 15 to 18 years of age, to do genteel house work and sewing. Wages from &#xa3;20 to &#xa3;30 a year. Inquire at 8, Michael&#x2019;s place, Brompton-square.&#x201D;</note> Could there be two ideas as to what sort of functionary this advertisement had in view?&#x2014; I groaned in spirit for the poor blockhead who, without having the smallest ill meaning (I am very sure) was thus exposing himself to the most atrocious imputations!</p>
<p>I called on Thursday forenoon to ask when I was to be needed again&#x2014;the door was opened by himself&#x2014;as mad looking as a march-hare&#x2014;his eyes were gleaming like live coals&#x2014;his &#x201C;hairs&#x201D; in a state of wildness&#x2014;his whole figure expressing the most comical excitement blended with perspiring perplexity.</p>
<p>Tho heretofore so respectful of my <hi rend="italic">years</hi>; he on this day flung his arm round my person&#x2014;as if I had been the reed of a drowning man, and almost <hi rend="italic">carried</hi> me up stairs! I sat down and asked &#x201C;Well? what on earth is it?&#x201D;&#x2014;but he <hi rend="italic">turned</hi> his head to a side as if listening, then darted down stairs again to the door&#x2014;then back&#x2014;then down again&#x2014; and so on for half a dozen times before he could find two spare minutes to tell me his story&#x2014; At length I got it out of him, but with innumerable parenthesis of opening the street door That morning at eight gu-ls began to troop into the streets from all points of the compass&#x2014;congregated in groups of threes and fives&#x2014;till the clock struck nine&#x2014;and then there was a general rush of <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> to demand admission!&#x2014; and fresh ones were continuing to pour in, &#x2014;as I saw&#x2014; &#x201C;The people of the house were furious&#x201D;&#x2014;no wonder!&#x2014; &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Blore<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the landlord.</note> had sent him up <pb id="pg-16-111" n="16:111"/>a most impertinent note&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;neither mistress nor maids would go to the door any more and so he had to open himself&#x201D;&#x2014;and then if I could only have seen &#x201C;the detestable ugliness&#x201D; of all that had come!&#x2014;&#x201C;vile wretches calling themselves <hi rend="italic">eighteen</hi> who were <hi rend="italic">thirty</hi>, if they were a day&#x201D;!&#x2014; To make a long tale short he had from three to four hundred applicants that day and not <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of &#x201C;beautiful forms&#x201D;&#x2014;or even passable forms among them!&#x2014;he had also six and thirty letters from the Country! not containing a single inquiry as to the nature of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> genteel work&#x201D;&#x2014;but all passionately eager to have the place, whatever it was, for some daughter, or sister, or friend!&#x2014; Does not this give one a horrible glance into life&#x2014;as it is at present&#x2014;even worse it seems to me than the <hi rend="italic">boiling of the dead dog!</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring to a newspaper story about the eating of a dead dog,</note> <hi rend="italic">that</hi> at least involved no immorality!&#x2014; On the following day which was that of my last sitting, they were still coming&#x2014;but not in such numbers&#x2014;and the people of the house having been heaven knows how restored to good humore M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Blore was opening the door to them herself&#x2014;and by his desire showing them all in succession up to the painting room&#x2014;&#x201C;that I might just see what ugly wretches they were&#x201D;!&#x2014; But Fortune favoured me&#x2014; for among the <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi> who were thus shown up, I found <hi rend="italic">three</hi> very pretty&#x2014;they<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> rest certainly were hideous!&#x2014; One of the three himself even was pleased with&#x2014;but tho she looked to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as improper as improper could be; she expressed some hesitation about <hi rend="italic">sitting as a model</hi>&#x2014;she would consider it and let him know in a couple of days&#x2014; the fact was she prefered transacting with him without witnesses, I believe&#x2014;for she came back the same afternoon and declared herself ready to come&#x2014; But when he (much to her astonishment doubtless) proposed to <hi rend="italic">see her parents</hi> on the subject before coming to a final engagement she answered that they were <hi rend="italic">both ill in bed</hi> and could not be spoken with&#x2014;which he thought &#x201C;sounded ill for her <hi rend="italic">respectability</hi>&#x201D; and so he would have no more to do with her! The last of the three pretty ones was a very sad spectacle indeed she was a gentle innocent looking girl&#x2014;not more than sixteen&#x2014;brought in like a sheep to the slaughter by a wicked-faced devil&#x2014;as to whose business in life there could not be two opinions&#x2014; Gambardella hardly looked at the girl&#x2014;but told the woman in a grave imperative manner that he was already suited&#x2014;and the pair went off to seek a less scrupulous customer&#x2014; leaving me very much shocked upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour!&#x2014; I was at his house again yesterday&#x2014;went with Carlyle to see the picture in its finished state&#x2014;and stayed awhile behind him, helping the <hi rend="italic">Unfortunate</hi> to concoct a new advertisement! more <hi rend="italic">precise</hi>, and not so liable to misinterpr<supplied>[et]</supplied>ation<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> <pb id="pg-16-112" n="16:112"/>as the first&#x2014; In addition to the female help he is minded now to have a&#x2014;tiger!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I will send you a little Bulletin today, tho&#x2019; there has nothing new fallen out, that you do not know of; I ought to tell you expressly so, when there is nothing else to tell.</p>
<p>Our bad easterly weather has given place to rain, and that again is about issuing in sunshine: Jane, always when the easterly wind is blowing, gets back the old &#x2018;pain in the right side&#x2019; (it is something in the liver, we understand); and always when the westerly wind and warm weather takes up its tale, she recovers again. In general she is much better than in some or most former years. She is very quiet; and tho&#x2019; her Mother&#x2019;s death dwells constantly with her, I think, yet it is now in a quieter form, and does not tear her in pieces as it did. I hope the sorrow indeed has done her good: we ought all to know, and be taught even by severe suffering and stripes, that our possession is not in this world; that very truly it is all a poor shadow that we did or do or can possess in this world.&#x2014; John Welsh at Liverpool had a kind of palsy-stroke, not unlike what poor Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s was, and in the month of <date when="0000-02-00">February</date> just as hers was: it frightened them all very much; but he is now for the present getting well again.</p>
<p>As to me I do not feel that this Book has hurt me so much as Books are wont to do: I fancy I shall be able for another in shorter interval than the last was. I was terribly cut up with the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>; I should not like to get such a shaking again, if I could help it!&#x2014; There has been a great deal of ugly trouble getting the American Copy made <pb id="pg-16-113" n="16:113"/>fairly out; I had it all to examine minutely, to correct &#x26;c, and was heartily sick of it: but happily, last saturday, I got it all fairly tied up, and despatched once for all to Alick Welsh at Liverpool; and now it is tumbling about, on the waste Ocean waves, in the Boston Steamer;&#x2014;and the people may make of it what they can, when it arrives. If the New-York man manage again to steal it from us,&#x2014;he shall have the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> on still readier terms: he will save me a world of <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] at any rate!&#x2014; In some two weeks now, I think, the Book will be about ready; and your Copies, we may hope, will get along to you by the beginning of <date when="1843-05-00">May</date>. It is a fiery enough Book; and speaks home into the heart of many a big-wigged looking thing,&#x2014;the big-wigged thing can take it as it likes! I wish now, we were upon something <hi rend="italic">else</hi>, and had that fairly all lying behind us.</p>
<p>Jack wrote to you, I understand, that his present engagement<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As William Ogilby&#x2019;s physician.</note> was going to terminate; suddenly the end of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> has come in sight. We cannot profess here that we are sorry for it: plenty of money did come in, but the rest was all an unmitigated stupidity; the ugliest work I have seen any man of abilities set to spend his days in doing. Jack has already plenty of money to live upon where and how he likes; he need not be anybody&#x2019;s slave, at any price whatever. I rather think too he has improved himself somewhat in this long dealing with these foolish things and persons, where his own wisdom, courage and decision such as it might be, had to form the basis of whatever good result would realise itself: I think I notice him more silent, more <hi rend="italic">angry</hi>,&#x2014;more like <hi rend="italic">working</hi>, and conquering difficulties, than he used to be! He will fall on some useful thing by and by. A great deal of talent lies wasted in poor Doil,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle&#x2019;s nickname.</note>&#x2014;all trampled out of sight, in the scattery way of life he has had. My notion, too, is that, at bottom, he feels glad enough to be off from this Ogilby concern; but that as a <hi rend="italic">volunteering</hi> to cast away such a salary, he durst hardly have ventured upon freeing <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> from it: and now behold, by indifferent Destiny, without fault or without merit of his, he is freed! By a Note from yesterday, I find they have paid him up all his salary, and a quarter over and above, which is a very handsome way of winding up the business. Jack talks as if he would have a &#x201C;run,&#x201D; or bit of travelling, in some direction or other, by way of shaking the thing out of his head.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s &#x201C;poor woman,&#x201D; of whom I wrote to you last time, turns out to be a poor creature that brought on her woes by drink! At least so the Clergyman&#x2019;s Wife, who is a most charitable lady, but somewhat <hi rend="italic">swift</hi> of judgement, assured Jane. Jane determines to continue her <pb id="pg-16-114" n="16:114"/>gifts,&#x2014;in the shape of <hi rend="italic">soup</hi> &#x26;c; the poor woman, drunken or not, is dying, as John says on examining her; a great part of her lungs already wasted away. The miseries of poor mortals are many, in this world!</p>
<p>Jenny sent me a small Letter from Gill; which I neglected to answer at the time; being terribly busy. She was expecting to be instantly summoned to Dumfries; but perhaps is not gone yet. Will you thank her for her little missive till I get time for more.</p>
<p>Alick may, for aught I know, bring over this Letter too himself; and help you to read it. In any case, you can remind him again, of my brotherly heart-sympathy with him; my prayer that he may be led to decide for <hi rend="italic">what is wisest</hi>, and my readiness to farther him in whatever <hi rend="italic">he</hi> may deliberately judge to be such. Jack is not making money as he was; but there is money among us yet; and surely in such a case it ought to be ready!&#x2014;&#x2014; Jamie gets a Newspaper today: a Letter <hi rend="italic">by and by</hi>. We send our kind wishes and regards to Isabella. It is long, dear Mother, since I read your hand, is it not? All good be with you, dear good Mother; take care of yourself, and we will all love you! <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p>I ought have explained more distinctly what I did state in the way of conversation on Sunday week,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1843-03-26">26 March</date>. Robertson had been calling frequently at Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430503-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-05-03">3 May</date>]</ref>.</note> that in my present great bustle of business and total dimness as to this matter in hand, I cannot attend your committee<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second meeting of the Society of Authors, <date when="1843-04-08">8 April</date>, when Charles Dickens (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7599"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) was chairman, and Robertson, was named hon. sec. A proposed prospectus was approved to be sent to the chief writers of the country for their suggestions, neither TC nor Dickens enlisted as members; see Besant 281&#x2013;88 and <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:470. For TC&#x2019;s impression of the first meeting, <date when="1843-03-25">25 March</date>, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430604-TC-JJ-01">TC to <sic>JJ</sic><corr>JJO</corr>, <date when="1843-06-04">4 June</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;that, in fact, I do not see what any committee or person can do in the present stage of the business except inquire, in a distinct manner, of the literary notabilities of the country whether they consider such a project to have any feasibility in it; whether they will take the trouble to meet or consult at all on the subject, or will not take any such trouble. If they all answer no, then clearly the project is unexecutable. If yes, if many, or even several of them answer yes, then <pb id="pg-16-115" n="16:115"/>is the time come for a meeting. As it at present stands, I really and truly cannot help you at all, and therefore beg to be off and excused.</p>
<p>The prospectus<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430314-TC-MRI-01">TC to <sic>MR</sic><corr>MRI</corr>, [<date when="1843-03-14">14 March</date>]</ref>. A proof of the prospectus in the Free Lib. of Philadelphia includes an open letter from John Robertson, <date when="1843-05-03">3 May</date>, asking for comments, and a list of the provisional committee chosen, <date when="1843-04-29">29 April</date>, as well as a list of members.</note> which arrived this morning is unexceptionable in character, but seems to me to offer little practical basis for any operation beyond what I have above indicated. I have written a sentence at the bottom of the page which embraces my own opinion of the matter and nearly all the opinion I yet have of it.</p>

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>I am right glad of your little Note of yesterday; and return you many thanks for it. We have long been waiting for the like of it! I hope all goes well still; and that Jean will soon be on her feet again, and have the whole business safely by.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken had given birth to a son, John.</note> I will write to her in her own person, you may say, before long.</p>
<p>Another little Note came from you a while ago from Gill: I meant to send you some answer; but was too busy at the moment; and then afterwards I did not know for certain whether you were still there or gone to Dumfries. I had no news to send at any rate; nothing except that we were all well, which I think signified by a Newspaper.&#x2014; Jamie and Mary send us no word whatever from Gill. We suppose it must be a very bad time for Farmers this, while all things are at so poor a price and so difficult to sell.</p>
<p>The Doctor, as I think you have learned, is now out of his situation: he often talked of leaving <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, and probably if it had not been that there needed some kind of quarrel and discussion for that, and he never could be at the <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> to make a quarrel, he might have done so long ago; but now, without any quarrel, altogether in a quiet manner, the situation leaves <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and he is free of it. A great deal of money annually he foregoes;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#xa3;1,000.</note> but also a very great deal of entirely ugly obstruction and confusion,&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">work</hi> so much as <hi rend="italic">forced idleness</hi>, which is far worse. On the whole I am not sorry; nor, I believe, is he.&#x2014; What he is to do next? Yes, that will be a question; and need a <foreign>screed</foreign> of talk by and by!</p>
<p>For the present he is gone off with the Prussian Ambassador (an old Roman acquiantance of his) for a short visit into Sussex;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Karl Josias Bunsen (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), Prussian ambassador to Britain since <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390213-TC-JCA-01"><sic>11:29</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1839-02-13">13 Feb. 1839</date></corr></ref>.

<p><salute>Dear Sir&#x2014;</salute>Will you be so good as send by the earliest convenience you have two copies of your book, &#x201C;Bamford&#x2019;s Life of a Radical,&#x201D; addressed <pb id="pg-16-121" n="16:121"/>to &#x201C;The Hon. W. B. Baring, 12, Great Stanhope-street, London.&#x201D; Two copies have been wanted there for some time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430218-TC-LHB-01">TC to <sic>LadyHB</sic><corr>LHB</corr>, [<date when="1843-02-18">18? Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note> Probably you have some appointed conveyance by which your books arrive here without additional cost; if so, pray use the earliest of these. Nay, perhaps your books are themselves procurable somewhere in London? That would be the shortest way of all. At any rate the coach or railway remains, and will be of no enormous amount. Be so good as apprise me by post what way you have adopted, and on what day the books may be looked for in Stanhope-street, not forgotting to enclose an <hi rend="italic">account</hi> withal. I read your book with much interest, with a true desire to hear more and more of the authentic news of Middleton and of the honest toiling men there. Many persons have a similar desire. I would recommend you to try whether there is not yet more to be said, perhaps, on some side of that subject, for it belongs to an important class in these days. A man is at all times entitled, or even called upon by occasion, to speak, and write, and in all fit ways <hi rend="italic">utter</hi> what he has himself gone thro&#x2019;, and <hi rend="italic">known</hi>, and got the mastery of; and, in truth, at bottom there is nothing else that any man has a right to write of. For the rest, one principle, I think, in whatever farther you write, may be enough to guide you; that of standing rigorously by the fact, however naked it look. Fact is eternal; all fiction is very transitory in comparison. All men are interested in any man if he will speak the facts of his life for them; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> authentic experience, which corresponds, as face with face, to that of all other sons of Adam.</p>
<p>Another humbler thing I will suggest&#x2014;that it seems to me a pity you had not your book in the hands of some bookseller; such a one could sell it for you much faster than you yourself will. A friend of mine, for example, could not find your book in Liverpool at all; and, unless he have written to Middleton, as I suggested, may still be in fruitless search of it. The commission charges of booksellers are in truth entirely exorbitant, unexampled among any other class of <hi rend="italic">sellers</hi> or salesmen in the world; but, as I said once, &#x201C;If you have a wagon to drive to York, you had better pay the tolls, however unconscionable, than try to steeple-hunt it thither!&#x201D; This, too, is not to be neglected, tho&#x2019; a very secondary side of the business.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Wishing you a right good speed in all manful industry with hand or with head or with heart, I remain, yours very truly,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p><pb id="pg-16-122" n="16:122"/>P.S. What is curious enough: this note was just folded, but not yet sealed, when your letter was handed in to me! Many thanks for your gift. Your remarks on <hi rend="italic">Chartism</hi> are also very welcome to me. I have now only to add that you had better send Mr. Baring&#x2019;s two copies to Mr. Ballantyne<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Ballantyne.</note> along with the other, and request him to forward them all to me without delay. Do not forget to enclose your account, which will be paid thro&#x2019; the post-office.</p>

<salute>My beloved Babbie</salute>
<p>There is a tone of <hi rend="italic">weariness</hi> in your last letter&#x2014;weariness with &#x201C;Things in general&#x201D;&#x2014;which has something more than <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> at the bottom of it. But <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> be at the bottom of it; I long to have you in my arms, to cover the babbie&#x2019;s face of you with kisses!&#x2014; I feel so sympathetic with you <hi rend="italic">thus!</hi>&#x2014;not that you were not loveable for me in your <hi rend="italic">placidity</hi>&#x2014;that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">beautiful equability of temper</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">disposition to be pleased with every thing</hi>&#x201D; which gained you such approbation from Carlyle and the rest was not thrown away upon <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, only&#x2014; For <pb id="pg-16-123" n="16:123"/>your <hi rend="italic">normal state</hi> (as Mazzini would call it), such equability, such disposition to be pleased is good&#x2014;the very best, and in an utilitarian point of view even, it was almost indispensable for living along side of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, whose <hi rend="italic">normal state</hi> is unfortunately very different&#x2014;but if you had never exceptional moments, hours, days, of longing after an unrealizable <hi rend="italic">ideal</hi>, of protesting against the mean, worrying <hi rend="italic">actual</hi>&#x2014;I could never have felt thoroughly sympathetic with you&#x2014;there must always have remained a Bluebeards Chamber<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in &#x201C;Blue Beard,&#x201D; first pbd. in Charles Perrault, <hi rend="italic">Histoires, ou Contes du Temps Pass&#xE9;</hi> (Paris, <date when="1697-00-00">1697</date>), trans. Robert Samber (<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>).</note> in my heart of which I durst not have given you the key&#x2014;you would have remained my <hi rend="italic">Babbie</hi>&#x2014;literally&#x2014; You could not have become what you are, my <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> my <hi rend="italic">sister</hi>&#x2014;the one being alive that I can turn to in <hi rend="italic">every</hi> mood with assurance that neither her kindness nor her sympathy will fail me&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have been thinking this morning that I have written very little from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, this long while back&#x2014;and that with all my writing you are not kept up as you ought to be with the current of my <hi rend="italic">personal concerns</hi>&#x2014; The fact is, ever since my Uncle has been confined to the house&#x2014;my letters have been more for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> than for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;I have written more with a view to making him laugh than to relieving my own mind of what I had a <foreign><hi rend="italic">besoin</hi></foreign> [need] to say&#x2014; Hence long stories of Gambardella &#x26;c&#x2014;while much more important things have remained untold&#x2014; Just to think for instance, that I should not yet have told you of the breaking up of Johns engagement with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ogilvie altho it took place a fortnight ago and will excercise a rather malign influence on my individual comfort for a pretty while to come, I am thinking!&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Oglevie went off to Cheltenham some weeks ago, with his <hi rend="italic">maternal</hi> uncles&#x2014;(There are two sorts of them <hi rend="italic">maternal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paternal</hi>&#x2014;the former considering their nephew an exceedingly wise man&#x2014;the latter those who appointed John to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> him&#x2014;) Well the maternal uncles wrote from Cheltnam that they considered M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Oglivie needed nothing now, &#x201C;except to learn to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> and <hi rend="italic">act</hi> for himself&#x201D; (a pretty considerable of a need one would say) and that the companionship of a man of his own years&#x2014;not a physician&#x2014;would perhaps help him better to that end&#x2014; &#x2014;Of course John at once acceded to the suggestion&#x2014;considering that &#x201C;on the whole perhaps they were in the right&#x201D;&#x2014; Mr Oglive sent him thereupon, his half year&#x2019;s salary with a quarter&#x2019;s over and above as &#x201C;an expression of his sincere gratitude and affection&#x201D;&#x2014;and so the thing smoothly terminated&#x2014; John left their house in Chester Terrace some days ago&#x2014;and went into the country for <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> with Bunsen the <pb id="pg-16-124" n="16:124"/>Prussian Ambassador&#x2014;but finding Bunsen&#x2019;s house &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">too full</hi>&#x201D; he arrived here last evening&#x2014;with bag and baggage&#x2014;when Helen was in the midst of <hi rend="italic">a washing</hi> and myself in the midst of a headach&#x2014;and now the question presses itself on me with some emphasis &#x201C;what will he do or attempt to do next? above all how long will he stay <hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x201D;?&#x2014;running up and down stairs&#x2014;fretting me with distracted queries and remarks&#x2014;making the house&#x2014;what he has on so many former occasions made it&#x2014;a scene of <hi rend="italic">worry</hi> world without end!&#x2014; When one has renounced all the gaities of life one does hold rather grimly by one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>&#x2014;and where John is, you know whether there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be any quiet.</p>
<p>That he will ever muster energy to take up house for himself&#x2014;altho he is now as able in point of money to keep a house as we are&#x2014;I have not the smallest hope&#x2014; He finds it always much easier and less expensive to live as <hi rend="italic">our</hi> visitor&#x2014;and what suits himself he is in the habit of thinking must perfectly suit other people&#x2014;so that this time, as on former occasions, I see no deliverance from him, except in Providence&#x2014;sending unsought the offer of some new tempting <hi rend="italic">situation</hi>&#x2014; Unless indeed Carlyle gets provoked into telling him flatly that he cannot keep him here&#x2014;now that he is well enough off to keep himself elsewhere&#x2014;and it would be long before Carlyle&#x2019;s brotherly nature could get itself provoked to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> point&#x2014;while for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the meanwhile&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Sister-in-law</hi>&#x2014;nothing of course remains but to submit, and even with a good grace&#x2014;</p>
<p>All our summer schemes however are tumbled topsy turvy by this untoward chance&#x2014;there is talk now of a voyage to Iceland even!&#x2014;instead of the cottage at Fornby (I never spoke of <hi rend="italic">Seaforth</hi>)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fornby in MS, meaning Formby.

But to keep a footing in the house she is laying the hair of her head under the feet of his wife and daughter&#x2014;his wife! whom she told me, when here two years ago &#x201C;was absolutely <hi rend="italic">loathsome!</hi> a creature that made your blood run cold to think of any man being bound to her for life&#x201D;&#x2014;an excellent woman all the while&#x2014;as I told her even <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014; She goes back to Manchester on Monday&#x2014;whence <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will never thro&#x2019; all eternity be the means of bringing her again&#x2014;she is &#x201C;a vile creature&#x201D;&#x2014;and that is the short and long of it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I thought I had told you of the letter to Platnauer at the time&#x2014; It was one day soon after she came that after having fussed me in all sorts of ways she said suddenly&#x2014;&#x201C;now what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I do for you? tell me some thing to do for you&#x201D;!&#x2014; I was thinking of Platnauer at the moment she spoke&#x2014;how long it was that his letter from Paris had lain unanswered and I said in <hi rend="italic">perfect jest</hi> of course&#x2014;&#x201C;really I can give you nothing to do unless you will write a letter to Mr Plattnauer&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;Well&#x201D; said she jumping up &#x201C;tell me where to get a sheet of paper&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;goodness Geraldine said I you are not going to do it&#x201D;?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Why not&#x201D;?</p>
<p>&#x201C;Because you do not know the man&#x2014;and how is it possible you can write to him&#x201D;?</p>
<p>&#x2014;&#x201C;My dear there is no such word as <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> where your convenience is concerned&#x201D;&#x2014; Seeing she was in earnest I determined on letting her proceed just to see how she would get thro it&#x2014;and she <pb id="pg-16-126" n="16:126"/>wrote not only a letter but a very <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter&#x2014;most <hi rend="italic">free and easy</hi>&#x2014;and I let it go&#x2014;to amuse the poor youth&#x2014;and had better have thrown it in the fire as it did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> amuse him at all but made him vexed at <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>My darling I am not half done&#x2014;but I must stop for my head is getting bad again&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do wish the weather would grow milder for my uncles sake and yours and mine&#x2014; If <hi rend="italic">I</hi> cannot sympathize in your feelings of cold who can?</p>
<p>According to Geraldine it would seem that &#x201C;fellow-feeling makes us wondrous <hi rend="italic">un</hi>kind&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My darling</salute>
<p>There is a sort of hurry scurry in my moral as well as material atmosphere just now which makes it prudent for me to take advantage of any quiet hour that turns up&#x2014;so I write to night, tho the letter cannot go off till tomorrow&#x2014; I was meaning to write yesterday (Monday) but could not; so being that <hi rend="italic">Walter</hi> was with me all the day!&#x2014;at least all the available part of the day&#x2014; On my return from the poor Sterlings where I went for a few minutes immediately after breakfast, I found a cab at the door, the driver whereof had betaken himself to the gin-shop while the horse was placidly devouring a bundle of hay that had been thrown down to it. &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Macgregor up stairs with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x201D;&#x2014; I brought M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Macgregor down stairs to <hi rend="italic">Mrs</hi> Carlyle&#x2014;the cab was dismissed&#x2014;and behold us <hi rend="small-caps">domesticated</hi> after a sort!&#x2014;as if it had been the most natural thing in the world!&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-127" n="16:127"/>Where the five Quakeresses<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; presumably friends of Walter Macgregor.</note> were all those <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> he staid is a question which curious minds might urgently demand the solution of&#x2014;and perhaps in vain! It might also be asked what he had done with his &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">excitement</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;for a <hi rend="italic">calmer</hi> young gentleman I never sat beside&#x2014;as calm as Mazzini himself! whom by the way he saw and expressed decided approbation of&#x2014; He had also a spell of Forster<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Forster.</note> whom he liked less because he was too <hi rend="italic">tumultuous</hi>. In fact he seemed like myself &#x201C;a lover of all quiet things&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >What Basil Montagu (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19003"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231014-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:451</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-10-14">14 OCt. 1823</date></corr></ref>) wished written on his tombstone; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251026-TC-JJ-01"><sic>3:399</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1825-10-26">26 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and I could have gone to sleep on the sofa, if <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi>, knowing him to be in the room&#x2014;which is my test of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">compatibility of temper</hi>&#x201D; in the choice of my friends!&#x2014; All this will sound to you &#x201C;most <hi rend="italic">mis-tai-rous</hi>&#x201D;<hi rend="italic">!</hi>&#x2014; Well! there is common-place matter enough in the world without <hi rend="italic">my</hi> adding to it&#x2014;better that I should be able to tell you something <hi rend="italic">new</hi> to exercise your <hi rend="italic">speculative</hi> faculty upon. I only wish he could have known how I had been spending the four or five previous days&#x2014;between heart-wearying visits at Knights-bridge,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit the dying Hester Sterling.</note> and lying on the flat of my back with headachs, at home&#x2014;that he might have estimated at its full value my gladness to see him and the immensity of human speech which I bestowed on him! I shall tell you what I think of his palpitations and quakermania after I have seen him again&#x2014; He will dine here on Sunday&#x2014;but I expect him some morning before then&#x2014;hitherto I have not tried my gift of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">divination</hi>&#x201D; on him&#x2014;only my common-place faculty of <hi rend="italic">observation</hi>&#x2014;and by this, I judge him in no very alarming way either physically or morally.</p>
<p>You have seen in the newspaper what has happened at Knights-bridge?&#x2014; Perhaps not&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling died last Sunday morning&#x2014;not unexpectedly&#x2014;her end had been foreseen for many weeks&#x2014; The poor old fool of a man is in such a state as you can figure. &#x2014;Anthony<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling.</note> mercifully arrived on Thursday last&#x2014; John is still detained at Falmouth by the confinement of his wife who is critically situated at these times&#x2014; I had not been seeing her<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hester Sterling.</note> for a good while back&#x2014;no one was allowed to see her except her husband and Alicia Campbell who has been her most unwearying affectionate nurse&#x2014;the last looks I got of her was from the open door of her room&#x2014;where she was asleep in an easy chair&#x2014;with her mouth wide open&#x2014; I wish they had not made me look at her <hi rend="italic">so</hi>&#x2014;it was a sad almost horrible look to have itself fixed for ever in my mind as <hi rend="italic">the last</hi>&#x2014; I came home with a bad headach which <pb id="pg-16-128" n="16:128"/>lasted all thro the night and next day I was too ill for rising out of bed, which is eternally to be regretted&#x2014;for on that day&#x2014;just that one day on which I <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> go she expressed a wish &#x201C;to shake hands with me&#x201D;&#x2014;adding &#x201C;tomorrow I shall not be able&#x201D; &#x2014;but they did not tell me the latter words till after, or I would have gone at night when I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> able to get up&#x2014;but Anthony came down here at night and from the way he spoke I flattered myself that she would be able to see me and know me next morning&#x2014; And when I went next morning&#x2014;she was quite unconscious&#x2014;alternating between stupor and delirium&#x2014; I was in her room but came away again without looking at her&#x2014; She was talking wildly&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> her in such a state had no consolation in it&#x2014; To add to my regrets they told me that she had said that morning during a little interval of consciousness: &#x201C;there now!&#x2014; I said that I would <hi rend="italic">see</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle yesterday and you see she has not come&#x201D;!&#x2014;so like her!&#x2014;the pettish affectionateness of her nature still strong in death! Anthony who seems for his Mother&#x2019;s sake to have suddenly taken to behaving towards me as if I were their sister, promised that if she recovered her consciousness before death he would instantly come himself with a cab for me&#x2014;but she never recovered her consciousness. &#x2014;I went up on the evening of the day she died&#x2014;and saw Anthony and Alicia&#x2014;but not the old man&#x2014; Anthony and William Cunningham<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coningham, Mrs. Sterling&#x2019;s nephew.</note> walked home with me, trying to talk on&#x2014;indifferent subjects!&#x2014;what unnecessary restraints people lay themselves under in this world for sake of something that they account manhood!&#x2014;as if manhood could consist in talking about the favourchange in the weather and the effect of St Luke&#x2019;s<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >St. Luke&#x2019;s, Chelsea, Sydney St.</note> Steeple against the blue sky when their hearts were full of the dead&#x2014; Truly we live all our days in a vain show<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pss. 39:6.</note>&#x2014; I went next morning to see the old man for I was sure he would be better for getting a good cry with me&#x2014;which he had; with his head on my shoulder poor old fellow&#x2014;but at such a moment he was welcome to make any use of me that he pleased&#x2014; Anthony speaks of leaving the army, and bringing his wife to live there&#x2014;and really I do not see what else can be made of his Father<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Sterling (d. <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>); see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390620-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:138</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1839-06-20">20 June 1839</date></corr></ref>.

<p>Today I had Jeffrey again and several others besides&#x2014;and among them my purposed letter to you again fell to the ground&#x2014;so you see between the solemn and the frivolous I have had my hands full&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-129" n="16:129"/>Geraldine made her farewell visit on Sunday, along with her Miss Patten&#x2014; She had written that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">grievance or no grievance;</hi> she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come for two hours <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> on Sunday immediately after breakfast.&#x201D; She came at <hi rend="italic">two</hi> oclock&#x2014; I said &#x201C;I had ceased to expect you,&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh yes&#x201D; said she I meant&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not get sooner&#x201D;&#x2014; With my heart at Knightsbridge I was in no humour to make even an attempt at patience with her&#x2014; &#x201C;Really&#x201D; said I &#x201C;it is a consolation to my self complacency to see you in <hi rend="italic">action</hi>&#x2014;when you tell me there is &#x2018;no such thing as <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi>&#x2014;no such word as distance where <hi rend="italic">I am</hi> concerned.&#x2019; I look at <hi rend="small-caps">myself</hi>, not only recognising <hi rend="italic">impossibilities</hi> at every turn, but even giving way before very slender <hi rend="italic">difficulties</hi>&#x2014;and think what a cold blooded, ineffectual character must <hi rend="italic">I</hi> then be in comparison!&#x2014;but when it comes to the test of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi>&#x2014;I find that the difference between us has been merely in <hi rend="italic">dialect of speech</hi> not in <hi rend="italic">matter of fact!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; For the first time in her life she had not a word to answer&#x2014;but sat looking not unlike a fool&#x2014; What think you Walter made the very same observation that Carlyle John and Mazzini made on her&#x2014;each for himself&#x2014;that &#x201C;it was a <hi rend="italic">mercy</hi> for her she was so ill-looking&#x2014;&#x201D;! Do not however in speaking of her ever <hi rend="italic">quote</hi> me to her disadvantage&#x2014;not to do her any mischief in her own circle, even at the cost of being supposed a bad judge of women, is the last duty that imposes itself on one who committed the imprudence of constituting myself her friend before knowing anything about her&#x2014; Her friend I have ceased to be for ever and a day but from the consequences of having been it in the beginning I cannot wholly emancipate myself&#x2014; Heaven grant that the <hi rend="italic">consequences</hi> may be only <hi rend="italic">boring</hi>&#x2014; not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fatal</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; But our <hi rend="italic">imprudencies</hi> often enough cost us dearer than our <hi rend="italic">crimes</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>John is at the Isle of Wight for a couple of days&#x2014;a precious deliverance!&#x2014;only alas too <hi rend="italic">brief!</hi>&#x2014; His long sojourn with a madman<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Ogilby.</note> has worked no improvement in his own ways&#x2014;he is if possible more restless, more indifferent, more selfish, more destructive of every thing like regularity and quiet in a household than ever he was! My hope lies in the very <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of the nuisance&#x2014;his own Brother is so tormented by him that I am persuaded <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will not be able to hold out many <hi rend="italic">months</hi> without fairly turning him out of doors&#x2014; Jeffrey delivered me from him originally by getting him sent off with Lady Clare.&#x2014; yesterday the same kind friend suggested to me a new situation which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could get him if his magnificent Doctorship would accept it<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the new situation, which John Carlyle did refuse, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430419-TC-JCA-01">next letter</ref>.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You may fancy we were very glad to hear from Jenny what had taken place. I trust all is going on well; that you are getting out again, and the little fellow thriving. I shall expect a Letter now before very long,&#x2014;some day when the cradle is steadily going.</p>
<p>It is above a week since I had entirely done with my Book; but the <pb id="pg-16-131" n="16:131"/>Press-men, the Binders, the &#x26;c, it appears, are all taking holiday and heavy-wet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strong ale.</note> in these Holy times (what they call the Easter week);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Easter Sun. was <date when="1843-04-16">16 April</date></note> so that work is hard to be got from them: besides, I believe, our Book-sellers were in no haste till the American Steam Mail should be fairly off <hi rend="italic">without</hi> one of our copies in it: on the whole therefore we are not to appear till about Saturday first at soonest. You will get a bundle of copies straightway; with the beginning of <date when="1843-05-00">May</date>, I should think, they will be sure for you: and then much good may the thing do you!

<p>Our poor Mrs. Sterling is gone from us; one of the first <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> we have lost here by the all-destroyer. She died on Sunday morning last; her life, as it were, rapidly dissolving away in these latter weeks, into deeper and deeper languor, seemingly without much pain: her illness a disease of the heart.

She was a right kindhearted, honest, loving soul; her loquacities, her whims and all her bits of weaknesses are now grown beautiful to us.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have Doctors&#x2019; devilry in my interior today, and such a total despair of everything, that I conclude we must give up Horton for the present!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horton, approx. 23 mi, W of London, where Milton lived for five years and where his mother is buried.</note> It seems to lie within six miles of the Great Western Railway, some two miles from Colnbrook, perhaps not above five from Honslow; and might be attainable enough: but we should make a right Literary Party of the Expedition thither,&#x2014;should we not? And choose the best of weather for it, and the best of humours. Perhaps Dickens would go, and other chosen men. And then ought not, as in the case of the Todgers people, &#x201C;our rugged natures to be softened&#x201D; (probably) &#x201C;by the presence of lovely woman,&#x201D; on such an occasion?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dickens&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi> ch. 9.

<salute>Dear Lady Harriet,</salute>
<p>Tomorrow I think of pilgriming on foot to a certain Shrine; the name of it is Addiscombe,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Barings&#x2019; country villa nr. Croydon, Surrey.</note> and it is not the Military College there. I shall arrive all dusty, weary, woebegone; but if the light of your looks fall on me,&#x2014;and if I had my hands washed,&#x2014;I shall become quite cheerful again; and stay with you to dinner; and go home, according to the Yellow Ticket,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The railway ticket.</note> at half-past eight,&#x2014;in an improved frame of mind. It is probably the last I shall see of you&#x2014;?&#x2014; For the Book is no longer to be hidden; I have just addressed a copy of it to Stanhope Street,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Barings&#x2019; London residence, 12 Gt. Stanhope St.</note> and there it will arrive this night!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you are to be from home Tomorrow, or in any way engaged, never mind me and my pilgrimages. I shall at least hear the larks sing, see the green face of my old Mother Earth undefaced by soot, once again; discover where you dwell; and return with profit sufficient. The gypsey existence has considerable charms for me; roving in the open air, even with no company but Silence, is not so bad. Indeed I have thoughts of pitching a marquee somewhere on the slope of the Addiscombe Hills, for a week or two, this summer; and there, in perfect savage liberty, &#x201C;communing with Nature&#x201D; and some other things! Verily it would be worth trying, even with a brown loaf and well of water for one&#x2019;s diet,&#x2014;if one had the heart!</p>
<p>Buller<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller.</note> did not seem to be sure even of Wednesday; but I hope he has got out nevertheless.</p>
<p>The Sun is extremely polite to you, is he not?&#x2014; If I do not come tomorrow, consider simply that the Demons have run thro&#x2019; this beautiful project, and that somehow or other I am in the worst luck.&#x2014; With blessings.</p>

<salute>My dearest</salute>
<p>I was hurried off yesterday at the early hour of twelve oclock before I had got well begun&#x2014; In fact I begin to be sick of the extraordinary occupation that has been appointed me for these last ten days, viz: dry-nursing my great, big, obstreperous infant of an old Sterling! <pb id="pg-16-137" n="16:137"/>Actually I have not had five minutes speech with Mazzini for the last week! At first I went to him from the impulse of my own compassion&#x2014;then I ceased to go; really thinking that at least until the funeral was over they would be better without visitors&#x2014; On Tuesday forenoon I was desirous of having a mouthful of quiet talk with Elizabeth<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pepoli.</note> whom I had not got a sight of for many days&#x2014; I had not been seated more than ten minutes when we were startled by the sound of Carlyle&#x2019;s voice in the lobby enquiring for me&#x2014; I thought the house must have taken fire, such an occurrance as C&#x2019;s coming to seek me anywhere was so unprecedented&#x2014;&#x201C;My Dear&#x201D; says he opening the drawing room door &#x201C;here has old Sterling been to seek you <hi rend="italic">roaring and</hi> <foreign><hi rend="italic">greeting</hi></foreign> [weeping]! and I have had to bring him after you! You must go away in the carriage with him somewhere and keep him quiet&#x201D;! I departed with a sigh on my difficult mission&#x2014;and we drove&#x2014;all thro <hi rend="italic">the streets!</hi> crying the whole way (that is to say <hi rend="italic">he</hi> crying.) and I bottled up beside him in his very small carriage&#x2014;looking I am sure the very picture of what Harriet Martineau defined Queen Victory<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Victoria.</note> to be &#x201C;a young woman in prodigiously difficult circumstances&#x201D;!
On Wednesday Mazzini had just come in and we had just placed our two pairs of feet on the fender when the little carriage drove up again and in <hi rend="italic">rushed</hi> the old man exclaiming &#x201C;Oh my friend&#x2014;my dear dear friend comfort me! Sooth me!&#x201D; I was on the point of lifting up the poker to kill him&#x2014;when he disarmed my wrath by adding&#x2014;&#x201C;I have a <hi rend="small-caps">new</hi> disaster! John&#x2019;s wife has been carried off by inflamation&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susannah Sterling died <date when="1843-04-18">18 April</date> of complications following childbirth. The news of Hester Sterling&#x2019;s death arrived just a few hours before she died; see <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:246&#x2013;47.</note>&#x2014; You know <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never felt any affection for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> John but the news of her death under such circumstances was truly shocking&#x2014;and I became quite sick&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh come with me says he come and let us walk a few turns in the pure air of Battersea Bridge&#x201D;!!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400615-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:168</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-06-15">15 June 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; &#x201C;I am <hi rend="italic">unable</hi> to walk at this moment&#x201D; says I&#x2014;&#x201C;Then I wont go&#x2014;I must not separate myself from you! We will drive since you cannot walk&#x2014;only for the love of God let me stay by your side&#x201D;!!&#x2014; Mazzini was <hi rend="italic">standing</hi> all the while&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">staring</hi> as you can fancy&#x2014;the sound of his voice was not heard any more! So off we set again&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">thro the Streets!</hi> Thursday ditto&#x2014;friday ditto-Saturday ditto&#x2014;on Sunday he came with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Anthony<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Sterling.</note> who had arrived&#x2014;but mercifully I was already gone with Walter to the Pepolis&#x2014; And yesterday he came again while I was writing to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014; But I begin to see he is merely prolonging <pb id="pg-16-138" n="16:138"/>his wailing in the view of exploiting my compassion and getting better treatment from me than he has been used to&#x2014; His real sorrow is already pretty well cured!! Already!&#x2014; Yes it will be just as his son Anthony told me &#x2014;&#x201C;You will see that in a few weeks he will be back to his Carlton Club<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tory club; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370829-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:299</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1837-08-29">29 Aug. 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> and all his old haunts and the past will be for him as if it had never been&#x201D;&#x2014; I thought Anthony cruel to say so but he knew his Father better than even I did&#x2014; In the depth of his despair he proposed to me to go away with him to the Isle of Wight or some secluded place for a few weeks&#x2014;and I in my simplicity actually did not positively refuse and Carlyle in his simplicity&#x2014;said &#x201C;yes it would be well done&#x201D;&#x2014; But my last drive with him has given me other thoughts&#x2014; And now I am going to say a horrible thing which I entreat of you not to read aloud&#x2014;&#x201C;Upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour&#x201D; Babbie I do not think I should be&#x2014;&#x201C;what shall I say&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">safe</hi> travelling alone with him old as he is&#x2014;!! Plainly for all so old as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am, I have not yet arrived at a thorough understanding of human nature for it is always revealing itself to me under new and <foreign><hi rend="italic">a priori</hi></foreign> incredible phases&#x2014;</p>
<p>John is still here and to all appearance without the remotest idea of ever taking himself off into an establishment of his own&#x2014; The situation (as physician to Lady Holland) which Jeffrey managed to get offered to him, he at once and peremptorily declined&#x2014; &#x2014;If the Queen should take a fancy to have him, and press him very much, and bribe him very high&#x2014;perhaps he <hi rend="italic">might</hi> condescend to engage with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014;but otherwise I see nothing that is likely to be good enough for him&#x2014;in this lower world&#x2014; Meanwhile he treats both Carlyle and myself as pieces of furniture&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">appendages to the house</hi> which he cannot conveniently rid himself of or he would&#x2014; To respect our privacy to study our habits in any one respect&#x2014;in fact to let alone tormenting us continually forms no part of his programme. How long Carlyles patience will hold out under all this&#x2014;or rather I should say how long his <hi rend="italic">im</hi>patience will rest satisfied in venting itself in tirades against him addressed to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;and in general ill-humour heaven only knows. But the house is made almost uninhabitable for me&#x2014;and I have not even the consolation of thinking that I am victimized in a good cause&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope my Uncle has by this time entered into possession of his book&#x2014; I do not mean Bamford but <hi rend="italic">Past &#x26; Present</hi> which letter<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;latter.&#x201D;</note> was to go in the Booksellers parcel to Liverpool&#x2014; He will find it I should think a piece of tolerably tough reading&#x2014;indeed I should not wonder tho&#x2019; he could not make away with it at all&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>We are delighted to hear that poor Isabella has her work safely over;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle had given birth to a da., Jessie or Jenny (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>).</note> we have been in no small anxiety about her here for a long while back. I am right glad to pay you the Letter I have owed for a great while, in answering such a piece of news. If she now take care of herself, and rally valiantly to her new occupation, she will grow greatly better, we trust.&#x2014;</p>
<p>At present nothing of importance is stirring among us here. I got my Book fairly shoved out to take its fate with the Public on Monday last; three days before that (on friday, this day gone a week) I had already despatched Copies, one for every one of you, towards Dumfries by Edinburgh, to James Aitken&#x2019;s care: I conjecture that if you did not get them on Wednesday (which indeed is hardly possible), you may partly expect to have them on Wednesday next, or at all events Wednesday <hi rend="italic">second</hi>;&#x2014;and that you will read them with eagerness! If any undue delay occur, and you are sure it is not <hi rend="italic">at Dumfries</hi>, you can let me know, and I will twitch up the Edinburgh man. People seem to get themselves considerably <hi rend="italic">struck</hi> by the Book,&#x2014;and &#x201C;look two ways for <pb id="pg-16-140" n="16:140"/>sunday&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;He was born in the middle of the week, and looked both ways for Sunday&#x201D;; Scots for someone who squints.</note> which is a very proper result for them! But indeed I for one care but little what becomes of them with it: that is <hi rend="italic">their</hi> outlook now, not mine. I mean to make the Booksellers pay me down their cash, the first day I care to walk so far; and then the whole business can go whistle.</p>
<p>We have been much grieved here by the sad things that have happened among the Sterlings. Poor Mrs Sterling grew rapidly worse, and died about ten days ago. The eldest son had come over from Ireland, as <supplied>[he]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> was there; but the other son, John, who is our more special associate, could not come up from Falmouth, 200 miles off, where he lives; his own health is always precarious, and his wife about that very time was waiting daily to be <hi rend="italic">confined</hi>: alas, the poor man heard of his Mother&#x2019;s death, while his Wife lay almost at the point of departure; in four hours more he had lost his Wife too! It was her sixth child,&#x2014;the child is living. We have not written to Sterling yet. They are of course all in great distress. Poor old Mrs Sterling was one of the kindest motherliest women we knew anywhere, and Jane&#x2019;s chief friend here. She had much trouble in the world, she loved and sorrowed much,&#x2014;and seemed to have her eye always in a good direction in this pilgrimage; and, we hope, is at rest now.</p>
<p>Jack is with us, at least he breakfasts, writes letters and sleeps here; but we seldom see him at dinner here; he is roving about like a blazing torch all day, and only comes home at night. Lady Clare wants him to go with her to Italy again in autumn: he seems to have little mind for that. A certain Lady Holland (illustrious Whig dame and chief of dames in these parts) wanted him, on Jeffrey&#x2019;s recommendation, to take up his abode here in London, on a small salary, as <hi rend="italic">her</hi> physician: but she is a wretched, unreasonable, tyrannous old creature, for whom, as I said on hearing her case, there seemed to be no remedy but getting to <hi rend="italic">drink brandy and water;</hi>&#x2014;so Jack, very wisely I think, <hi rend="italic">declined</hi>. He speaks now of a short expedition to Annandale; in which I encourage him. He has only to steady <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>, and then all will be steadied.</p>
<p>I got my dear Mother&#x2019;s Letter; and will answer it: tell her so,&#x2014;and to keep out of the cold weather, and wrap herself effectually up, till the sun shine out again. We heard from Jean two days ago: all was well there, except that our Uncle John seemed to be ailing, and had gone out to Mary Tait&#x2019;s for country air.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Aitken (d. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), maternal uncle; he died <date when="1843-05-09">9 May</date>. Mary Tait was possibly his married da.</note> Alick, she told us, was sowing <pb id="pg-16-141" n="16:141"/>for you: is the ear better? <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A Book of mine called <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> has just come out here; which I now warn you not to buy, inasmuch as a copy addressed to you is already under way, and indeed may probably arrive in Bristol before this Note. It bears your common address; it will lie, if there do any delay occur, at that Bristol Bookseller&#x2019;s who distributes our Chapman and Hall&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Chuzzlewits</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">Pickickeries</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; Dickens&#x2019;s novels.</note> there,&#x2014;whose name, unknown to me, you will easily discover if need be. Probably at Cowbridge they know it. But I hope no delay will occur, or at least none that you cannot easily abide. When the Book does arrive, will you be so good as despatch me a Newspaper (without writing any letter, which is not worth while), to signify that all is right.</p>
<p>Speech and speculation have again arisen about a visit to the Glamorganshire coasts this summer: I really do not think it is impossible; but you shall hear of it more expressly by and by. I speak of coming by myself, and having some small crib of a lodging with some neat peasant or farmer in a desart part of the coast,&#x2014;if with a horse to ride, so much the better, and within riding distance of you!&#x2014; We shall see, if the sun were once out in his strength.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Almost a month ago your three beautiful volumes of <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> were safely delivered to me here, and in all ways cordially welcomed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first 3 vols. of the second edn. of Varnhagen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), first pbd. 4 vols. (Mannheim, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>) and 2 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>).</note> I reckon it a healthy sign of your German Public, in spite of all its confusions, <pb id="pg-16-143" n="16:143"/>that it demands a new supply of such Writings: there is everywhere a great heart of Truth living silent and latent amid the noise and tumult of world-wide Inanities literary and other; this we shall always know, and quietly trust in this.</p>
<p>Last week there was consigned to your Berlin-London Bookseller here a new volume of mine with your address on it; probably in a fortnight it may be looked for. I now, by the direct conveyance, write to announce it;&#x2014;enclosing a few more Autographs, which have come to me since your last packet.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Varnhagen collected autographs; many that TC sent him are now at the Jagellonian Univ.</note> None of them is like to be of almost any interest; but they are gathered here, without trouble, and I say always, You can at worst burn them. From time to time when such an object turns upon my path, I will not fail to lift it; to send it over sea, to the man of all living men who can extract most meaning out of it, for his own behoof and ours!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since the finishing of that Book, I have been reposing myself with various <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi> kinds of work;&#x2014;among others a daily spell at reading Danish, with a view to get acquainted with the old Norse world. M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Sagabibliothek</hi>, I had hoped, was in German; but, alas, it proves to be in Danish;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Erasmus M&#xfc;ller, <hi rend="italic">Sagabibliothek</hi>, 3 vols. (Copenhagen, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date>). Karl Lachman had trans. vol. 1 into German from M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s MS, <hi rend="italic">Sagaenbibliothek</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>). TC had known of this trans. in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400204-TC-RMM-01"><sic>12:28</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1840-02-04">4 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> and I have to learn that new dialect first,&#x2014;which turns out to be an almost ridiculous mixture of <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi>, and broken <foreign><hi rend="italic">Teutsch</hi></foreign> [German], artfully disguised; the whole broken down, seemingly <hi rend="italic">so as to give the speech-organs a minimum of trouble!</hi> I get into it without difficulty; but find M&#xfc;ller unluckily to be no perfect oracle after all. <hi rend="italic">Nials Saga</hi> in Icelandic is also here;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Nj&#xE1;ls Saga</hi> (ca. <date when="1280-00-00">1280</date>), a long, complex story into which are woven several tales, the chief of them being that of Nj&#xE1;l, the hero who upholds the law.</note> and the Abstract of it in M&#xfc;ller gives me great curiosity to penetrate into a sight of it, and of the strange old world it belongs to. We are without due helps in English for introducing ourselves to old Scandinavia; nor do I find hitherto in Germany any effectual notice of such. Do you know the magazine <hi rend="italic">Bragur;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Bragur. Ein litterarisches magazin der teutschen und nordischen vorzeit</hi>, 8 vols. (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>).</note> and what is the worth of it? Has anybody written, or translated, or in any way made accessible a solid word on that old province of things, in German speech? Geijer&#x2019;s Swedish History in its German dress<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eric Gustaf Geijer, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Schwedens</hi>, trans. S. P. Leffler (Hamburg, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).

C. F. Friesch, <hi rend="italic">Wikingsz&#xfc;ge, Staatsverfassung und Sitten der alten Skandinavien</hi>, 2 vols. (Hamburg, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>). TC mentions it in his Journal.</note>&#x2014;it is something, not much. This; and some nine or ten Books of Travels in Iceland, from not one of which can I gain the smallest distinct insight even as to what specially the outward look of the Island is!&#x2014; If in your circle, you happen to know any real Master in Scandinavian things, you could perhaps question him for me, on some convenient occasion: perhaps even a German Book-catalogue, if I knew which, might instruct me in several things.</p>
<p>There was one other matter, of the smallest possible weight, about which I have often forgotten to ask you a small question. In the Supplement to Creuzer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Symbolik</hi>, written I think by one Mone<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georg Friedrich Creuzer (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), <hi rend="italic">Symbolik und Mythologie der alten V&#xF6;lker besonders der Griechen</hi>, 6 vols. (Leipzig and Darmstadt, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1823-00-00">23</date>), vols. 5&#x2013;6 being the Supplement by Franz Joseph Mone (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>). For Mone, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410719-TC-RMM-01"><sic>13:194</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1841-07-19">19 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> (which I found to be but a stupid book), there is account given of an ancient German Body having been dug up from some morass, I think in the neighbourhood of Paderborn;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prussian town, Westphalia prov.</note> in which, or some such Museum, says Mone, the Body yet lies; due account of the business having been given in printed &#x2018;Transactions,&#x2019; or the like, to which he refers. If I remember rightly the date is <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>. But I have not Mone&#x2019;s Book at hand; and, as you see, the matter has got somewhat dim for me. The purport of my request is, that if there was any Pamphlet published about it, any Paper in some Society&#x2019;s Transactions, or other attainable Article descriptive of this singular affair, you would indicate it to me. This poor old Cheruscan brother man,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Cherusci were an ancient German tribe, whose country was bounded by the river Elbe on the E and the Weser on the W.</note> apparently some horrible miscreant, plunged down to be <hi rend="italic">tanned</hi> in peat-bogs, and then to be dug up into daylight again after 2,000 years; this is a thing I shall never forget; this is almost all that I now remember of Mone and his grey dreary Book.&#x2014; In Dublin Museum, I believe, there is the analogous figure of an antique nearly naked Celt, dug out of bogs, in like manner; but this, from my account of it, seems much less notable than the Cheruscan.</p>
<p>I ought earnestly to caution you against taking much or any <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> about all this; but I am afraid, that will be almost of no avail! In verity, these matters are so unimportant to me, you can hardly take <hi rend="italic">too little</hi> trouble with them; and if I find, as is still to be dreaded, that you have taken too much,&#x2014;why then, in that case, I will not employ you again! Actually that shall be your punishment.&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-16-145" n="16:145"/>Today however, in my haste, I must bid you <foreign>adieu</foreign>,&#x2014;in hope of meeting again, on paper at least, before long.&#x2014; Poor Schelling!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), German philosopher; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350923-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:213</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-09-23">23 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> I really fear you are <hi rend="italic">right</hi> regarding him!

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russel</salute>
<p>I am wearying to have some news of you&#x2014; Absolutely; willing or unwilling, busy or lazy, you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> sit down and write me a letter! How are you? and what are you all doing there in Thornhill? Where is Margaret;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone, servant at Templand when Grace Welsh died.</note> and what sort of industry is she following? And old Mary?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills, also Grace Welsh&#x2019;s servant.</note> Is she still able to creep about? And have you any money for her remaining? My husband says you were to give her two shillings a week which you considered would suffice for her with what she had&#x2014; Maybe so&#x2014;but two shillings a-week would not keep a London poor woman in <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;beer&#x201D;!</hi> A woman whom I found lately lying on a little mouldy straw with not a single blanket over her&#x2014;only an old cloak&#x2014;and sharing <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and the straw with three children&#x2014;owned to having <hi rend="italic">ten shillings</hi> a-week allowed her,&#x2014;besides some bread and cheese from the Parish,&#x2014;while her eldest child received both food and clothing at a charity school&#x2014;and&#x2014;the youngest being only five years old could not consume very much&#x2014; Tho&#x2019; I never <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> living and keeping <hi rend="italic">two</hi> children on ten shillings a-week, I could not but think I would have made a better job of it than she seemed to be making, and took pains to ascertain how the money went&#x2014;four and sixpence went to the grocer for tea and sugar! &#x201C;And then&#x201D; said she &#x201C;As long as I live I must have my pint of <hi rend="italic">beer</hi> (Brown stout) in the day&#x2014; I cannot wa<supplied>[nt]</supplied> my pint of beer for anything.&#x201D; And so she lay all thro&#x2019; the winter in the state I have mentioned&#x2014;with a bad cold too&#x2014;which turned to consumption <pb id="pg-16-146" n="16:146"/>and the other day she died!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s first meeting with the woman, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430324-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1843-03-24">24 March</date></ref>.</note> And I am afraid this is no exceptional case of unthrift&#x2014; A woman to whom I gave some money to get her children flannel petticoats out of pawn went home and within a quarter of an hour&#x2019;s time had fried herself a panful of mutton-chops off it!&#x2014;mutton being at that time ninepence a pound&#x2014;and ever so many instances of the same improvident spirit have come under my own observation&#x2014; But tho&#x2019; old Mary may get more good of two shillings than a London woman of ten&#x2014;still even in Scotland, and under your good care, it is a very slender amount of capital to front the world with! And if she fall sick or become quite helpless I trust to your getting her whatever is necessary, and applying to me for money whenever she wants it&#x2014;not that I doubt but you would be ready to help her yourself&#x2014; My Mother often told me how good and charitable you and your husband were&#x2014; But this old woman is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> concern&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>&#x2014; I cannot supply to her the place of the friend she has lost<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s mother.</note>&#x2014;but it is both my duty and my pleasure to do it as far as lies in my power&#x2014;</p>
<p>Did you hear of the sad fright which we had with my uncle in Liverpool? He was taken ill one night, just as She was last year, and in the same week of the same month&#x2014; Tho the daily accounts I received of him were always that he was a <hi rend="italic">little better</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">little better</hi>, for a long while I could not open their letter without terror&#x2014; I remembered always how all <hi rend="italic">her betterness</hi> had terminated, and made little doubt but <hi rend="italic">his</hi> would prove alike fallacious&#x2014;now however, months having passed without any new attack I begin to trust that he may be spared a few years longer to his poor children, who are too young to find themselves orphans in the world. His D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> tell him that he must live very sparingly&#x2014;must guard himself from all sorts of excitement&#x2014;leave off card-<hi rend="italic">playing</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;and he does their bidding&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for the present</hi>&#x2014;while the danger he has run is still fresh in his mind&#x2014; But God knows whether his patience and docility may not wear out! and then!&#x2014;Poor children! They have quite got up their hearts again&#x2014;are dancing away at balls, and all the rest of it, as if there were no drawn sword suspended by a hair over their heads!&#x2014; For me who see both <hi rend="italic">the dancing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the sword</hi> it is an anxious spectacle!</p>
<p>I shall probably go to Liverpool for a week or two in the course of the summer. There was a talk at one time of summer-quarters to be taken somewhere in Cheshire&#x2014;but my Brother-in-law John&#x2014;who has a particular knack&#x2014;like the <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi>&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;running thro&#x201D;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., creating havoc; coterie speech.</note> things came to <pb id="pg-16-147" n="16:147"/>live in the house till some new employment turned up for him; proposing to my husband this and that excursion on the continent&#x2014;till we are all at sea again with our plans &#x2014; Wherever John <hi rend="italic">is</hi>&#x2014;there is <hi rend="italic">uncertainty</hi> also!</p>
<p>Only think! I have still the same little maid! Indeed I need never speak of her <hi rend="italic">going</hi> again till she be actually <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>. Nothing could be more determined than I was to part with her that time when I wrote for Margaret.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1842-12-00">Dec. 1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421215-JWC-MR-01"><sic>15:231</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1842-12-15">15 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421228-JWC-JW-01"><sic>255</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-12-28">28 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> But she absolutely <hi rend="italic">would not go! would not seek herself a place!</hi> She seems really to have much the same notion of the indissolubility of our relation&#x2014;that the old scotch Butler had of his and his masters&#x2014;in whose service he had been forty years&#x2014;when his Master told him, his temper was become absolutely insufferable, and they two must positively part&#x2014;he answered with a look of disdainful astonishment; &#x201C;and where the deevil wud ye gang to?&#x201D; Helen did not exactly ask <hi rend="italic">me</hi> where <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wud gang to? but she asked me in a tone of the most authoritative remonstrance &#x201C;What would become of me, I should just like to know&#x2014;fancying <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ill&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">me</hi> not there to take proper care of you?&#x2014; I think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">would</hi> be a <hi rend="italic">farce!!</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014; To tell her what would become of her under such astonishing circumstances, quite exceeding my gift of prophecy; what could I do but just to bid her &#x201C;stay where she was then; only trying whether she could not behave herself more like a reasonable creature.&#x201D; And to do her justice, she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> more reasonable latterly&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have kept quite free of <hi rend="italic">Influenza</hi> this Spring&#x2014;for a wonder&#x2014;and since I gave over swallowing my Brother in laws blue pills which had no effect but that of making me <hi rend="italic">uncomfortable all over</hi>&#x2014;I have been pretty much in my average state&#x2014; The pain in my side still sticks there&#x2014;better and worse&#x2014;and I have not much strength to speak of&#x2014; But I am able to keep on foot&#x2014;and my mind is quieter&#x2014;and on the whole I have reason to be thankful&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope you have got my husband&#x2019;s new book by this time&#x2014;he sent it to you by a bookseller&#x2019;s parcel two weeks ago&#x2014; To think that he should have finished a book and no copy sent to Templand!&#x2014; When I saw him writing <hi rend="italic">your</hi> name instead I could do nothing but cry. He asked &#x201C;is that all the congratulation you have to give me on having got to the end of it&#x201D;?&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">I</hi> also had <hi rend="italic">got to the end</hi> of so much!

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>You have not drawn Cromwell&#x2019;s House at all! It seems to be Stewart&#x2019;s House at Stuntney, Cromwell&#x2019;s Uncle&#x2019;s, but not Cromwell&#x2019;s own! This is a great mistake. The real House that Cromwell occupied (according to Noble, and to all likelihood) is in Ely City itself, about a gunshot west of the Cathedral; abuts on St Mary&#x2019;s Churchyard with its one gable, and on the big Cathedral Barns with its other: an old, much humbler House, which &#x201C;Mr Page&#x201D; used to live in;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter of late <date when="1843-04-00">April</date> to a friend FitzGerald tells of visiting Ely and Cromwell&#x2019;s house, &#x201C;two miles from Ely,&#x201D; and making &#x201C;a drawing of it for Carlyle&#x201D; (Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:387). In <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> TC writes: &#x201C;As Sir Thomas Steward, Oliver&#x2019;s Uncle, farmed the tithes of Ely, it is reasonable to believe that he, and Oliver after him, occupied the house set apart for the Tithe-Farmer there; as Mark Noble, out of dim Tradition, confidently testifies. This is &#x2018;the house occupied by Mr. Page&#x2019; [Noble 1:106]; under which name &#x2026; the inhabitants &#x2026; now know it. The House &#x2026; is still standing; close to St. Mary&#x2019;s Churchyard; at the corner of the great Tithe-barn of Ely. &#x2026; Of his House, for Oliver&#x2019;s sake, some Painter will yet perhaps take a correct likeness:&#x2014;it is needless to go to Stuntney out on the Soham road, as Oliver&#x2019;s Painters usually do; Oliver never lived there, but only his Mother&#x2019;s cousins!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:94&#x2013;95).

<salute>My darling</salute>
<p>I was hindered from writing to you yesterday by headach, the day before by Robertson&#x2014;who has been hanging about us of late like a physical malady&#x2014;time after time he has come here&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">always out of season</hi> (which is his peculiar faculty) to bore Carlyle into taking active part in something which he calls&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Association of British Authors</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Society of Authors.</note>&#x2014; If C be either out or &#x201C;engaged&#x201D; when he comes he doggedly sits down to wait for him&#x2014;three or four hours it may be&#x2014;an hour or two makes no difference to him!&#x2014; And so on Monday he came in at twelve and sat till three&#x2014;in spite of all that I could prudently suggest about the risk he ran of wearing out Carlyle&#x2019;s patience by urging him too pertinaciously&#x2014; I knew in fact that C&#x2019;s patience had already reached its <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ultima Thule</hi></foreign> and that at one word more on the hated subject he would certainly explode on the unfortunate Blockhead&#x2014; Accordingly when C came down at three, and was passing out <hi rend="italic">determined</hi> not to see him, Robertson intercepted him in the Lobby and thrust a paper on him like a bailiff serving a writ&#x2014; Had you seen C&#x2019;s look!! <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Oh Heavens&#x201D;!</hi> and then how he fell to brushing his hat saying the while&#x2014; &#x201C;Sir!

<salute>Dear Jenny,</salute>
<p>I had your Letter the other day, and was glad to hear you had got back to Gill, where Mary as we understand has need of you at present. These are terribly hard times for Farmers; but they must not be down-hearted: it is not likely the times will continue so bad; and if they do, some new arrangement will have to be fallen upon,&#x2014;not by them alone but by the whole farming world. Tell Mary to take care and not overwork herself in her present state. Do you for her whatsoever you can in the way of help and support; I know you will without my telling you.&#x2014; I like well to hear of your teaching the two little <foreign>Bairns</foreign><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Mary Austin&#x2019;s son William (b. <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> or &#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>) and her fourth da. (b. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> or &#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">39</date>), or Janet&#x2019;s das.

<p>But the grand object of this fraction of a Note was to let you know that you are likely to see the Doctor again very soon. He is off this morning to Liverpool; and may perhaps be over in Annandale on Monday or Tuesday if there be Steam<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Steamship to Annan.</note> on either of those days. He will of course look in upon the Gill not long after that. He it is who will tell you all our news much better than I can write them He talks of staying &#x201C;for a week or two&#x201D;; that is to say, as long as he finds it pleasant and useful for him and for all of you: he is in very good health and spirits; but full of uncertainty as to fixing himself,&#x2014;which I wish much, but hardly hope, he could now do.</p>
<p>We had a Box from Scotsbrig last night; all safe, and the contents excellent. I add no other word today; but a hearty salutation to one <pb id="pg-16-153" n="16:153"/>and all at Gill, Jamie, Mary, Jenny, and all the <foreign>Bairns</foreign> down to the youngest.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The other children were Margaret (b. <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), Grace (b. <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), and Jessie (b. <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>) Austin.</note> <closer><salute>Your aff<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>Yesternight the Parcel which your Letter had announced came safe to hand: all right, and the charge only 5/6. We found the fowls still uninjured; we were at the ham this morning, and you are to tell our dear kind Mother, till she be better thanked, that it is of first-rate quality, as good a ham as we ever ate,&#x2014;and sent, we are sure, with a blessing too. The second, of course, will be like it. Jane has been among the Peppers too and <hi rend="italic">sweeties;</hi> and the Tobacco is excellent. All is right therefore. Many kind thanks to you all.</p>

<salute>My dear Sterling,</salute>
<p>It is but some four weeks since I one day bade your Father say that, having now a little leisure, I meant to write to you straightway;&#x2014;and alas, since then, there has fallen out so much about which there was no writing. We have had to think of you in silence. &#x201C;Man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eccles. 12:5.</note> It is the old story; as old as the first existence of mankind in this Earth; and yet to every one of us it arrives with a strange originality, sharp and astonishing as if it had never happened before. Ah me!&#x2014; You must take care of your health more than ever: all kinds of grief weigh on one with double pressure when the body is weak. Grieve not, all grief is useless;&#x2014;we are but a little way behind. As the old Psalmist said, &#x201C;We shall go to them, they will not return to us&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Sam. 12:23.</note> there is in this an everlasting source of composure: death would be intolerable otherwise.</p>
<p>Probably you will be better within reach of London; and if so, Southampton surely is an eligible region. You are but four hours from us there, and yet almost a hundred miles. I have often thought of a cottage for myself on the beach of some cove in the Isle of Wight: but I believe I shall never get it, or anything resembling it; my notion begins to be that I am doomed to this spot, unlovely as it is to me: alas, few places are very lovely in late times; the Earth all growing into a kind of Golgotha for me;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 164. For Golgotha, see Matt. 27:33.</note>&#x2014;a golgotha which is a flaming Sinai<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments; see Exod. 19:20&#x2013;24.</note> <pb id="pg-16-157" n="16:157"/>too, however: let us complain of nothing! We must not complain, we must march on like men:</p>
<lg><l>&#x2014;<foreign>stille</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Ruhn oben die Sterne</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Und unten die Gr&#xE4;ber</foreign>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Stars silent rest o&#x2019;er us, / Graves under us silent.&#x201D; Goethe&#x2019;s &#x201C;Symbolum&#x201D;; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421228-TC-AC-01"><sic>15:252&#x2013;53</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1842-12-28">28 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note></l></lg>
<p>All Gospels and religions, as it were, lie included for me in those words. Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My health is not so much bad, as painful, depressing; to which, I suppose, the solitary life I have been long leading, and still insist on leading, must somewhat contribute. The speech of men does nothing for me in general; it grieves and distresses me, on the contrary, for most part. I am positively almost frightened now and then at quack speech! The remedy of course is: Avoid it. Yes; and yet there is much to be said on the other side withal. I think of doing two things: first, slinking off into the country so soon as the Sun comes fairly out; and then secondly endeavouring to get forward with some fresh work or other. There is always work enough for a man,&#x2014;thank God! And plenty of comfort for a man accordingly. I do not feel unable for new work, were I once rested a while.</p>
<p>For the present I get along mainly by help of <hi rend="italic">Danish</hi>, in which I have got a master (or rather got one lesson, for that was all that proved necessary) of M&#xfc;llers <hi rend="italic">Sagabibliothek</hi> in that language, and all manner of perplexed shadows out of Scandinavia. It is as good as &#x201C;worsted work&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Knitting.</note> for a weak man! I really delight greatly in the essence of that old Norse World, where I can get a glimpse of its essence. Agamemnon and Achilles seem to me lucky in their Homer; I have fallen in with as good fellows, if not better, that remain entirely <hi rend="italic">un</hi>sung! Besides, compared with Exeter Hall, are not <hi rend="italic">Gimle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Valhalla</hi> really respectable places?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exeter Hall, 372 the Strand, used for large religious meetings; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420411-TC-JSM-01"><sic>14:144</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1842-04-11">11 April 1842</date></corr></ref>. In Scandinavian mythology Gimle was the home of the blessed after the final destruction of the world by the war between the gods and the giants; Valhalla was the home of Odin where he received dead heroes.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>We saw your Brother often, and liked him better than ever. I do not think he knows completely what regard is entertained for him here. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my Friend: be careful of your health; the rest you will do without advising.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling visited London in mid-<date when="1843-05-00">May</date>, presumably on his way to and from the Isle of Wight, where he was to settle at Ventnor (see <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:249). He returned to Falmouth, <date when="1843-05-23">23 May</date>. Caroline Fox recorded in her diary, <date when="1843-05-25">25 May</date>, that his &#x201C;London time was an extremely bustling one. Carlyle does not seem quite happy; though he has blown so loud a blast, and though it has awakened so many deep echoes in the hearts of thoughtful men, there are other trumpets yet to sound before Truth can get itself fully recognized, even by those who have gone far&#x201D; (Fox 181).</note> <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It was only the day before yesterday that I wrote a Letter or rather fraction of a Letter to Alick, in which there was an account of all that we could call new here: but it seems so long since you and I had a special word together, I will now before going out send a small bit of writing to yourself, particularly for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> behoof. I got your good little Letter; 
and found it still in my breast-pocket this morning: my dear Mother, it would take <hi rend="italic">you</hi> much more trouble to write me that than it will me to write you this!&#x2014;</p>
<p>John, as you have heard, left us on Wednesday: I think by the Newspaper account of the Steamers, he will not get across to you till Monday, so that probably it will be Tuesday when you meet. Or indeed perhaps he may go over into Galloway, with a certain Dr Arbuckle, a comrade 
of his; so arrive by way of Dumfries on some other day: but this I do not consider likely. He will himself write you warning of his arrival. He is in capital case every way; but very much in want of some steady place to live at, some fixed thing to do. Both these wants, I hope, will be supplied to him by and by, poor fellow. He will have a glad meeting with his good Mother at any rate.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-16-159" n="16:159"/>He and I were often speaking about the want you must have of somebody to do the work of the house for you, to take care of you every way. We think it a great pity that Jenny and you could not get <foreign><hi rend="italic">fettled</hi></foreign> together in some house of your own: her children will be growing bigger, and no longer troublesome: she has at present nothing special to do, and surely could not be 
better employed than in taking care of her mother! If you had a nice house fit for you, not too far off the rest, I think you might be a comfort to one another. You might be near Jean at Dumfries, if you liked that. You might be wherever you liked. The <hi rend="italic">expense</hi> &#x26;c I would most cheerfully pay myself; and indeed, dear good Mother, I wish very much you would give me some opportunity of serving you: if ever a son deserved to be grateful to his Father and 
Mother, it is I. In whatever use I am of in this world I trace <hi rend="italic">their</hi> honest handiwork, and often thank them in silence. My brave Father is no longer here to be helped or cherished; but by the great mercy of the Supreme Power, my Mother still is.&#x2014; Jack will speak to you about all that; and I hope some kind of result will come of it. Jenny is not well 
where she is, I believe; and one may fear, she will never more get good of her absurd fool of a husband:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hanning. In fact, Janet and their two das. joined him in Canada in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>. They stayed together after this, and Hanning was employed by the Great Western Railway of Canada from <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> until his death in <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>.</note> it were far better I think, that she 
attached herself to her mother again, and gradually forgot him. I pray you think of this; and when you take a house anywhere, see that it be a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> house: five pounds a year will be terribly <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> saved off the comforts of the House where my Mother has to live!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You have got your Book now, I suppose, and are reading it. The people are considerably astonished with it here, I imagine, and were not altogether expecting such a thing! They will need to get another thing or two, perhaps, by and by.</p>
<p>In your Letter you ask me whether I am not thinking of a look at Scotland this year again. I do think of getting out into the country somewhere, and considering in solitude about <hi rend="italic">the next Book</hi>. I have yet settled about nothing; but I shall certainly be rather <hi rend="italic">disappointed</hi> if I do not get a glimpse of my good Mother this year again. So we will leave it in hope.</p>
<p>Alick would tell you what excellent ham it was: it will do me good, I think,&#x2014;many good thanks to my Brother for that! I am getting stronger in these days, tho&#x2019; the weather has become very wet: indeed there never was much the matter with me; this Book has done me almost no mischief at all.&#x2014; They tell me you have had a fit of cold, dear <pb id="pg-16-160" n="16:160"/>Mother; I wish I could be as sure that it has left you fairly! I hope the good weather will come for your sake among others. It is still rather ungentle here. How is Isabella? How are all? <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, my dear Mother; blessings be ever with you!</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Alas, the weather, instead of raining itself out, seems only to be raining itself in! Here is such a day as would do honor to Kendal or the Isle of Skye;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A town in the Lake District and an island off the NW coast of Scotland, both renowned for wet weather.</note> and tho&#x2019; tomorrow there is no likelihood of &#x201C;Snow,&#x201D; yet I conclude all fields that rest on clay subsoil must be in a state of puddle, and the country in a pleasant state for no class of creatures but ducks and fishes. Accordingly, is it not best that we give up this enterprise altogether &#x201C;for Tuesday,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently the date for visiting Naseby had been changed from Wed. or Thurs., <date when="1843-05-10">10</date> or <date when="1843-05-11">11 May</date> (<ref target="volume-16/lt-18430504-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1843-05-04">4 May</date></ref>), to Tues., <date when="1843-05-09">9 May</date>.</note> and postpone it again into the Indefinite? After much deliberation, not without sufficient regret, I have decided so&#x2014;for you, who are not here, as well as for myself who am. Is it not right? As we have no particular cause of haste, there ought to be moderate assurance of good weather to see the place in. I am at your bidding whenever that may arrive and you like it otherwise.</p>
<p>I only hope this letter may arrive in time tomorrow morning; at lowest that the carriage may not wait for me inconveniently either at Crick or Rugby.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both nr. Naseby.</note></p>
<p>If you are coming back to Town, come straightway and let me see you. If you are still rusticating at Naseby for a week or so, and the weather should <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> in the interim, we will make a new appointment,&#x2014; and keep it in spite of all but Fate!</p>
<closer><salute>Yours very damp and sorrowful</salute></closer>

<ps><p>Have you any Tory Squire of your neighbours, who has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> lowered his rents, to whom, by way of solacement in wet weather, you could lend this somewhat interesting Pamphlet?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hunger and Revolution.

Forster gave me the thing on Saturday; and now I give it to you. &#x201C;The Chartists,&#x201D; I suppose, have done it&#x2014;poor fellows! We are like to get <pb id="pg-16-161" n="16:161"/><hi rend="italic">serious</hi> enough by and by, I think. God give us sense to look even a little way ahead!</p></ps>

<p>The Book upon Dr Francia which is indispensable for me, that of

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I duly received your Letter, and then your Newspaper with the announcement of the Cardiff Steamboats; and thank you heartily for your kind promptitude in regard to that matter. I have still several things to do in London; and indeed the Sun is hitherto so drowned in vapours and rains, there is but little invitation towards the country. I was to have gone last week to explore the region of Naseby Battle in <pb id="pg-16-165" n="16:165"/>Northamptonshire; and all was adjusted, and my hospitable conductor on the spot, would the weather but have grown dry. The weather did not grow dry, and still does not.</p>
<p>I by no means give up Glamorganshire yet;&#x2014;altogether the contrary. But there will be several adjustments to make here first. For the rest, I have a Friend in Clifton, whom I must try to see as I pass;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julia Strachey, who had written to TC, <date when="1843-05-07">7 May</date>: &#x201C;I shall hope to be favored with a visit whenever you do come, &#x26; you may depend upon <hi rend="italic">a cordial</hi> reception, although I regret to say the <hi rend="italic">enthusiasm</hi>, of which up to present I have always been conscious of possessing a large share, seems just now either extinct, or in a quite dormant state&#x2014; Whether it is that there are in fact <hi rend="italic">no Heroes left</hi> upon this poor Earth, whom one can by any possibility think worthy of enthusiastic reverence, or whether it was that my former all but adoration of such supposed personages, was an illusion, which now shares the fate of all other illusions, I know not, but so it is. &#x2026; I left London somewhat prematurely &#x2026; but I found the noise &#x26; confusion of Mount S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all but intollerable &#x2026; &#x26; so I took my flight in a sort of melancholy despairing state. &#x2026; You said nothing about M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle accompanying you here but should she propose doing so, my pleasure will be greatly enhanced. &#x2026; Pray remember me most kindly to your brother &#x2026; always a great favorite of mine.&#x201D;</note> it is likeliest I may stay a day there, and so have ample time to choose my Steamer, and give you warning about it.</p>
<p>Does Glamorganshire produce good horses? If you should hear of any modest stout eligible riding-horse on sale in that quarter, I could half wish you would give me notice about it. I have a feeling again as if I ought to have a horse; and to purchase one in Tattershall&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horse auctioneer&#x2019;s, Hyde Park Corner, founded <date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>, by Richard Tattersall.</note> is very far beyond my commission at present! Nay the whole matter is still so much in the state of a mere imagination, that I will expressly forbid your taking any <hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> about it, or treating it as other than an altogether loose affair. My price for a horse has hitherto been somewhere between &#xa3;20 and &#xa3;30; and their qualities are quite dark to me till I have tried them!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter which came on Saturday was very welcome. Your ideas and proceedings as to our Mother and Jenny have my most hearty concurrence; and I cannot but desire very much that Jean may <pb id="pg-16-166" n="16:166"/>succeed in finding some suitable sort of house at Dumfries: the rest I think might all be managed; in fact, might go on better and better if it were once fairly <hi rend="italic">set</hi> agoing.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote from Scotsbrig, <date when="1843-05-11">11 May</date>, to say that their mother needed someone in the house with her at all times, for which &#x201C;we must try to make arrangement &#x2026; as soon as possible. &#x2026; I have written to Jean &#x26; asked her to look for some cottages about Dumfries that would be large enough for our mother &#x26; Jenny &#x26; have a spare room. Of course there will be reluctance to move, but Isabella&#x2019;s continued illness &#x26; the restraint it imposes renders moving more &#x26; more desirable. Our mother says that she is like a &#x2018;<foreign>cloker</foreign> [broody hen] <hi rend="italic">in her old nest</hi>&#x2019; &#x26; unable to make up mind to leave it.&#x201D;</note> It would be a very easy thing to settle all the rest. To me, and no doubt to you also, it would be a real solacement to pay 10 or 15 pounds apiece at stated times in the year, if by so doing we could make our good Mother even a little comfortable! Twenty or thirty pounds a year added to what she already has, would keep her and Jenny very well. The money I think ought be paid to my Mother, and to be hers, that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> might continue in form as in fact mistress of the establishment: Jenny I believe might feel that to be the comfortablest way for her; she would then consider herself as <hi rend="italic">working</hi> and doing good service for her keep. But I am far too remote from the scene to take any right hold of the minute circumstances, or give any advice that is worth much. Only it does seem, and has always seemed, very desirable to me that Jenny and our Mother should be with one another; and I cannot believe but it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible to get some rational arrangement contrived for their being so. You will be right well employed in arranging that if you can manage it.</p>
<p>I also very much participate your notion about Alick:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had written that Alexander Carlyle had let his house and would soon sell the contents of his shop at auction. &#x201C;He speaks of going to Canada but with no strong heart or healthy purpose &#x26; our mother, though she will not interfere &#x26; prevent him hears of it with dismay. &#x2026; The only rational plan for him is to go &#x26; look at Canada alone. &#x2026; Though there has been much to blame in his management of all the farms he has hitherto had one must confess that he never had a fair chance of succeeding on any he has tried, the times having turned so much against him. &#x2026; He seems to me at present in a better mood of mind too than I have seen for years &#x26; all things considered, if he were to give up Canada, I should not regard another trial in a farm as at all desperate.&#x201D;</note> I am truly glad moreover to hear what you say about his improved mood of mind. Pray Heaven there may be something good arranged on that side also! Our poor Alick; a brave man too,&#x2014;but drifted far awry by the currents of Life. I never can do other than pray with my whole heart that better days be yet coming for him. It is evident at least that he is right in leaving Ecclefechan.&#x2014; I have to write a word to him one of these days, for indeed I have some money to pay him.</p>
<p>I did not design writing to you today; but that Letter came by the Post, and I would not send it without a word.&#x2014; There is a brief Note <pb id="pg-16-167" n="16:167"/>from Dickens, in very good humour:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dickens had invited Bulwer, <date when="1843-05-14">14 May</date>, to attend a meeting of authors and publishers, <date when="1843-05-17">17 May</date> (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:489), and may have invited TC to the same meeting; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430518-TC-CHDI-01">TC to <sic>[CD]</sic><corr>[CHDI]</corr>, <date when="1843-05-18">18 May</date></ref>.</note> is not that right?

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept many thanks for the kind gift of your Book on Canada, which I received last night with much pleasure. I have already perused with due attention the Chapter and the Supplements on Colonization;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ch. 29 was on &#x201C;Capacity to relieve the mother-country of her surplus population. &#x2026; Decline of great empires from neglect of Colonization, Commerce, and Education,&#x201D; and other ideas which TC sympathized with. A supplementary ch. was added on national colonization, written after Charles Buller&#x2019;s speech to the House of Commons on the subject (see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430404-TC-JBO-01">TC to <sic>[JB]</sic><corr>[JBO]</corr>, <date when="1843-04-04">4 April</date></ref>), critizing the govt.&#x2019;s inadequate response to his proposals, and a postscript quoting the <hi rend="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</hi>&#x2019;s criticism of the ignorance of colonial matters of Lord Stanley, sec. of state for the colonies.</note> and am happy to express not my assent only but my zealous <pb id="pg-16-168" n="16:168"/>consent to all that I find there; it seems to me as if I would have spoken every sentiment of it myself,&#x2014;as if all rational men ought on all fit occasions to be speaking and inculcating them! My notion is that there is an immense <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> assent to all that, lying latent in the country, only waiting to be spoken to, that it may answer. In my own case the business is fifteen years old or older; and on all hands I have had the like reflected on me from persons of insight and sincerity, when the matter came in course.</p>
<p>If we had a Government that could and would give the word in such an enterprise, it were very happy for us at present. But in the absence of that, are there not others that can <hi rend="italic">give the word</hi>, tho&#x2019; in a less direct way? I think I know one man whose excellent popular talent might do real service in this matter!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Buckingham. JWC had heard him lecture on the Corn Laws; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430118-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, <sic>[<date when="1843-01-19">19? Jan.</date>]</sic><corr>[<date when="1843-01-18">18</date> or <date when="1843-01-19">19 Jan.</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> There ought to be a Course of Lectures on Emigration and Colonization delivered in these years in all quarters of Britain and Ireland. It seems to me of the last importance that the Corn-Law be <hi rend="italic">swiftly</hi> abrogated, and that this of Emigration follow swiftly in the rear of it. This, and much else&#x2014;alas!</p>

Many thanks to you;&#x2014;and may the Supreme Power turn many a thing, both in England and in Deutschland, to better use than we have cause to dread at present! &#x201C;The Devil invented <hi rend="italic">Must&#x201D;:</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bunsen had written: &#x201C;&#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Muss hat der Teufel erdacht</hi>&#x2019; ist ein tiefes deutsches Spr&#xfc;chwort</foreign> [<hi rend="italic">The Devil invented necessity</hi> is a profound German saying].&#x201D;</note> that is a fact I shall try not to forget.</p>
<p>My Brother is in Scotland, safe beside our good old Mother there; <pb id="pg-16-169" n="16:169"/>and seems to be nearly stationary; imprisoned, I suppose, by the ever-active rains and mud.

<salute>Dear Lawrence,</salute>
<p>I know not if I have a right to say that anybody in America specially &#x201C;wants my Picture.&#x201D; Gambardella meant to give his work to Emerson, I believe, had he succeeded: &#x201C;R. Waldo Emerson, Concord, near Boston.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Gambardella&#x2019;s praise of Laurence&#x2019;s <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> portrait and his intention to paint TC, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411119-TC-RWE-01"><sic>13:300&#x2013;1</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1841-11-19">19 Nov. 1841</date></corr></ref>; for the attempt, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421106-JWC-JW-01"><sic>15:166</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-11-06">6 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421116-JWC-JW-01"><sic>188&#x2013;89</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-11-16">16 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> But Emerson is not a rich man; not a picture-buying man, I should think. On the other hand, there was once an American,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> whose name I have forgotten, that did send, by a Scotch friend <hi rend="italic">whose</hi> name also has now escaped me, some request that I should sit for a Likeness: but the whole matter, as you see, has gone into the vague; and I can recall nothing more than the impression that my American was a Bostonean. On the whole, your friend&#x2019;s best way will be to inquire of the Boston Booksellers (Little &#x26; Brown is the title of one House, Munroe and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of another), who will probably be able to set him on the track of discovering who is the suitable man, if suitable man there be. I cannot in the least estimate the probabilities: but perhaps the adventure of inquiring into them by this opportunity will not be very heavy. Your Portrait of me, sublimely ugly as it may be, is the only decent attempt at a likeness I have yet fallen in with; and indeed seems to me to contain in it, very visibly, the elements of an excellent Picture.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the oil portrait shown at the Royal Acad., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, which is also probably the portrait of 10:frontispiece (though there dated <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>) since it is the only known portrait in oils, and for which TC sat, <date when="1841-03-00">March 1841</date> (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410321-TC-AC-01"><sic>13:60&#x2013;61</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-03-21">21 March 1841</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410804-TC-JOST-01"><sic>13:208</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1841-08-04">4 Aug. 1841</date></corr></ref>). Laurence also made several crayon portraits in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. There is still some uncertainty about identifying which are which and when they were painted [the portrait is viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the vol. 10 table of contents page].</note> Sterling, I think I have told you, prizes the chalk Sketch at an enormous rate.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Made <date when="1838-07-00">July 1838</date>, now in Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea; see 8:frontispiece [viewable in the <hi rend="italic">CLO</hi> on the vol. 8 table of contents page].

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I think your Project looks, especially in your hands, much more feasible than the other did;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is probably commenting on the printed account and favorably contrasting it with Robertson&#x2019;s Society of Authors, whose second meeting, <date when="1843-04-08">8 April</date>, Dickens had chaired before refusing further involvement (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 3:477&#x2013;78).</note> one may hope too that, if realized, it may <pb id="pg-16-172" n="16:172"/>lead to some third thing better still. It is urgently desirable that &#x201C;Authors,&#x201D; or Persons who lead the Public Mind whatever title they may bear, should gradually form some kind of Brotherhood with one another, and become an organised Corporation, as far less important bodies of man have done: and in the present state of Authorship, perhaps the bringing of Authors together into a room, that they may occasionally look on one another and grow accustomed to one another, is almost all that can be done for that unfortunate class. I shall wish you heartily success in this adventure.</p>
<p>As for myself, I am so circumstanced in various respects I have found it unadvisable hitherto to become a member of any Club, reunion or general Assemblage of men whatsoever; my necessity is rather to live in the utmost quiet and solitude that is possible for me here. On other men, meanwhile, other duties are laid. For me too, better health, and other changes, may by and by make new habits eligible. I will wish you again all manner of success; and remain, as a spectator for the present,</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have waited this good while for some leisure moment, wherein I could write to you deliberately; but there seems none such to lie near me yet: so I must write in haste, rather than not at all. I must at least pay you the Tobacco Merchant&#x2019;s account; that is a plain matter! Here is an order for two sovereigns which I procured yesterday: what residue there is over, after satisfying the Tobacconist, you are to divide equally between Tom and Jane,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two oldest children, Jane Welsh (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>) and Thomas (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1921-00-00">1921</date>).</note> as a gift from their &#x201C;Uncle in London.&#x201D; And so, many thanks for your care in this matter, dear Brother. The tobacco is excellent; and came in good stead to me here, the old supplies being out or nearly so. I have begun heartily smoking it now.</p>
<p>I forget your Leith Wine &#x26; Spirit Merchant&#x2019;s name.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hutchison &#x26; Bowe; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420205-TC-AC-01"><sic>14:37</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1842-02-05">5 Feb. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> We are nearly thro&#x2019; our Brandy here; and can take a little more Wine from him too. We will say <hi rend="italic">two dozen and a half</hi> of Port, two dozen of Sherry, and three gallons of Brandy; that will make six dozen bottles in all, and will perhaps be sufficient for one Box. Let the Account come along <pb id="pg-16-173" n="16:173"/>with the Articles, and it shall be paid when they arrive. There is no special <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> haste, if the people have not a set of articles they can recommend at the moment: the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> were found to be satisfactory, and if they stand at the old price and quality we may deal satisfactorily again. I daresay you will give the necessary orders for all this, and set it in motion for me, with great readiness. And so no more of it at present.</p>
<p>Many a time, in these days, do I think of Whitsunday, and the important resolutions and inquiries my Brother must have in his mind at present! You are certainly wise to have done with Ecclefechan at any rate. What is to follow next may be obscure and doubtful enough; but it cannot easily be worse than the certainty was there. Alas, dear Brother, I can do nothing for you at this stage of the business; but be very sorry, very anxious for you,&#x2014;yet still with good hope. If it please God, a better day <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> yet come! Let us press on, nothing daunted: if we can grow <hi rend="italic">wiser</hi> by our past errors, they too will not have been in vain! Of the son of Adam there cannot in this world be more required, on the whole, than that he do grow wiser by past mistakes; and be always learning while in this School of Life. It is not in one of us to direct his steps; but in all things we fail and err continually.</p>
<p>You will have a <foreign><hi rend="italic">roup</hi></foreign> [auction] I fancy in about a week; all will be bustle round you already. The Dr, I suppose, has given you all his ideas: do not adopt them, if they seem unwise to you; the great thing is that your own inner heart went along with the undertaking whatever that were. His reports about you are more cheering than I expected. May God turn it all to good, my dear Brother; may God direct you towards what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> wisest, best, and strengthen you to do that however difficult it be! I will not continue farther,&#x2014;even if I had more paper and time. I send my heart&#x2019;s blessing to all of you; and wait with anxiety to hear the result. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Mr Montague,</salute>
<p>My knowledge of this embryo &#x201C;Authors&#x2019; Society&#x201D; is all but altogether exactly on a par with your own. Several weeks ago, after much solicitation, I attended once, for ten minutes, in a room of the British Hôtel, a meeting of some twenty or thirty extremely ugly men, <pb id="pg-16-174" n="16:174"/>only some three of whom were even by face known to me; I admitted in a whisper, in answer to the Secretary&#x2019;s whisper, that <supplied>[several words cut away]</supplied> Sir Lytton Bulwer had been saying was of a reasonable nature; and thereupon took my hat and walked away.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The meeting had been held <date when="1843-03-25">25 March</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430314-TC-MRI-01">TC to <sic>MR</sic><corr>[MRI]</corr>, [<date when="1843-03-14">14 March</date>]</ref>.

This was the &#x201C;motioning&#x201D; and &#x201C;seconding of the motion&#x201D;; this, and on my part nothing more than this. I have since directed with all due distinctness that my name, if it were on their List, should be entirely obliterated.</p>
<p>Authors ought to unite, and will, I have no doubt; but not till they <hi rend="italic">cease</hi> to be &#x201C;animals of prey&#x201D;: this, curiously enough, was precisely my remark to Secretary Robertson in regard to the Authors&#x2019; Society.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for your two Poems,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> which I received last night. I have read them over; which fact, if you knew my habits with respect to that class of compositions in these times, might itself, mean something for you.</p>
<p>I can with great sincerity bear testimony to the existence of a vigorous, genial and truly valuable endowment in the writer of these verses; for which endowment, I should say, the right concern or species of utterance had by no means yet been discovered;&#x2014;but was likely such seemed his honesty and energy, to discover itself better and better to him, as he unconsciously struggled along his way. And so what can I do but commit you to your own good genius, to whatsoever<pb id="pg-16-175" n="16:175"/>of good and striving is in yourself; and to all good influences from without which fail not at any time to wait upon that.</p>

<p><salute>My Dear Sir</salute>,&#x2014;Several weeks ago I duly received your letter, and read it, as I always do your letters, when they bring such news of you, with welcome and pleasure. It has been in my mind ever since to write to you with a certain expansion in some hour of leisure, but as that hour does not arrive, and, alas! gives no promise yet of arriving, I must content myself with this swift and brief acknowledgement, rather than with none at all, which is the other branch of the alternative.</p>
<p>You are an enthusiastic man, and look at all things through magnifying lenses, productive, too, of beautiful prismatic tints brighter than nature; nevertheless, I find your image of the object sharply distinct, and just, too, though exaggerated on a larger scale than usual. <pb id="pg-16-176" n="16:176"/>The <hi rend="italic">scale</hi> is not mathematically important; the distinctness and the justness are alone important. On the whole, I like that mood of mind very well; a true portrait and a gigantic one, done with haloes and tints of the rainbow; there are worse kinds than that.</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to find you persevere so manfully, &#x201C;following your star,&#x201D; where, except the star itself occasionally beaming in the distance, there can be little to cheer you by the way. Persevere, persevere; that is the strength of a man. I will promise you all manner of good if you persevere. You shall have victory, more conquest perhaps than perhaps you yet believe; you shall have heroic battle, which is the noblest conquest of all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s advice to Dodds, see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410300-TC-JADO-01"><sic>13:58&#x2013;59</sic><corr>TC to JADO, <date when="1841-03-25">25 March 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>It is far from my advice that you should relax in your law studies, in any of your studies, which I honor you for prosecuting in a strenuous silence. Nevertheless, it strikes me that you might be gradually attempting something in the way of writing too. You have, doubtless, hours now and then which, by thrifty assiduity, you might devote with advantage to trials in that kind. I speak with reluctance about writing, whither, I know, all your ambition tends, opposed by all your virtue and philosophy. But I fancy you are getting stronger on that latter side, and can afford a little excursion there by a time. Writing as well as law requires to be <hi rend="italic">learned;</hi> and to writing, as I can predict, you, amid all your law, or after all your law, will pretty certainly come at last. A solid man knows how to combine the ideal with the practical; to do the <foreign><hi rend="italic">obligato</hi></foreign> [that which one is obliged to do] better than another, and combine with it the <foreign><hi rend="italic">voluntario</hi></foreign> [that which one wishes to do], which others think not of. May a good Genius guide you always.</p>

<salute>My dear Babbie</salute>
<p>I am sure with all his scribbling he will make no sensible story of it&#x2014; I sat up till after midnight the night before last to write to you&#x2014;and yesterday such was my hurry and stupefaction that I quite forgot to send off the letter&#x2014;your note this morning was the first thing to remind me of it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very hurried to day, writing letters about my German governess&#x2014;whom I hope at last to have found a situation for<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie Charlotte Elise Mariana B&#xF6;lte (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>), German writer and governess. Da. of a cultivated Mecklenburg family, she became a governess, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>; came to England, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, and met the Carlyles, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>.

Behrens (D&#xfc;sseldorf, <date when="1955-00-00">1955</date>). Espinasse says that she was &#x201C;a clever German lady (Jewess, I think)&#x201D; who in Berlin &#x201C;had been a friend of Rahel, and remained a friend of Rahel&#x2019;s husband, Varnhagen von Ense &#x2026; , letters from whom &#x2026; she used to bring with her and read aloud at Chelsea. Governessing was her main occupation, but she wrote among other things novels, chiefly sentimental, which appear to have had some vogue in Germany. Carlyle tolerated her as a correspondent of Varnhagen, and Mrs. Carlyle befriended her as a clever lone woman in a foreign land, and was successful in getting her situations&#x201D; (Espinasse 233). In this instance JWC was to find her a position in the home of Charles and Isabella Buller.</note>&#x2014;and my <pb id="pg-16-178" n="16:178"/>headaches&#x2014;and Oh I do so wish that Robertson the writer of your letter would go away<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Robertson wrote: &#x201C;Know all people that on earth do dwell and Miss Jane Welsh that Mrs Carlyle of No 5 Great Cheyne Row Chelsea has opened a bureau for young women destitute of situations to the suspension of her ordinary business of supplying the wants of young ladies destitute only of Epistles. The abovementioned Mrs Carlyle also carries on a considerable business in the upholstery line in sofa covers chair covers &#x26;c which she carries on so intently sometimes that she forgets to post even the few epistles not professional which she does write. Otherwise be it known to all whom it may concern that the said Mrs. Carlyle is as well as can be expected for the Sole Manager of the New Gratis Bureau for providing situations for Destitute Young Ladies. In absolute despair of being able to accomplish the correspondence of her office this day Mrs Carlyle has employed the pen of a ready writer to indite this placard and supplied him with a thousand and one penny stamps that the facts it contains may be duly transmitted to a portion of the young ladies suffering great distress from a mournful destitution of Epistles&#x201D; (MS: NLS 1891.289).</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday I had a Letter from the Doctor, who had seen you as he passed thro&#x2019; Ecclefechan; you need not doubt but the news he gave me was interesting! You have now finished the Sale of your effects in Ecclefechan, this very day you must have been removing from your house, into some other temporary abode; and in a short time, it appears, you are to make a much farther removal, and try the new Country over the Sea. My dear Brother, it is a great and painful enterprise; but, I trust in Heaven, it may be a blessed one. My thoughts have been with you constantly in these days; ever and anon the image of poor Ecclefechan, and my good Brother closing his sorrowful battle there, has risen on me strangely thro&#x2019; whatever I might be looking at here. Courage, my Brother! You will get thro&#x2019; all these pains and confusions; you will cut your way, like a brave man, into new battleground, and rise into victory yet, if it please God! Few sights I have looked on have been painfuller to me than that of a man with your energies and qualities struggling in such a scene, under such galling impediments, as yours have long been. I have a clear hope that better times, and a more generous fight, are appointed for you in that new home. You will have no miserable Laird or other Fellow-mortal whatever, to ask leave of there; you will, at least, appeal direct to the Great Powers, and ask <pb id="pg-16-179" n="16:179"/><hi rend="italic">them</hi> where<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a slip for &#x201C;whether.&#x201D;</note> you deserve to prosper or not. It seems to me a most blessed change; worthy of being purchased at a very great cost of pain.</p>
<p>The report John gives us of your present mood of mind is very satisfactory. He rather complains that you have not yielded to his scheme of going out to Canada first, and looking at it: this surely was kindly intended on his part; but on the whole both Jane and I are of opinion that your own resolution, for your own behoof, is the wise one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote from Dumfries, <date when="1843-05-19">19 May</date>, that &#x201C;Alick&#x2018;sees no use in looking at Canada beforehand&#x2019; &#x201D; and from Scotsbrig, <date when="1843-05-23">23 May</date>: &#x201C;He seems now really determined to go with his family at once to Canada, &#x26; has an air of being relieved from painful uncertainty. &#x2026; Last week I repeated to him more strongly than before all the reasons that had weighed on my mind in favour of his firs<hi rend="italic">t</hi> going to see the country; but they appear to have produced no impression.&#x201D;</note> It will be a confused forbidding aspect that the new country offers you; but under that first look, which you will not let dishearten you, there will lie a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> look, there will lie all manner of possibilities, which to the brave man will become more and more productive. On the whole, is it not better that you buckle to it, as you mean to do, resolutely, with your whole heart, <hi rend="italic">at once?</hi> &#x201C;There is a puddle at every town-end,&#x201D; says the Proverb:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scots proverb; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340408-TC-MCA-01"><sic>7:129</sic><corr>TC to MCA, <date when="1834-04-08">8 April 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> it is better to get <hi rend="italic">thro</hi>&#x2019; that, perhaps, without looking at it farther. I anticipate great things for you in that new way of life;&#x2014;first of all far better health than you have had lately; healthy honest <hi rend="italic">field</hi>-work, far better for the body; and then still more, the awakening of a generous manful hope in your heart and mind, such as has long been absent in these late sorrowful times.</p>
<p>Your parting with us all will be painful; yes, dear Brother, it will be a cruel sorrow; but on the whole this too must be borne. Nay you are not to think it a <hi rend="italic">final</hi> leave you are taking of any of us: Canada, by Steam and other means, is coming daily closer to Britain; for my share, I see not but it is likelier the whole of them may have to go out to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> if times do not mend. There is positively no existence for an industrious tiller of the soil in this country in our day; and the view I have of the days that are coming often makes me shudder! To struggle out one&#x2019;s own life in such a Country is dreary; but to leave a quantity of children in such a scene, which grows yearly more unmanageable, is frightful. No; rather consider yourself as the harbinger and pioneer of the others, than as one cut off from them: the blessing of God <hi rend="italic">does</hi> rest upon the brave man, who with a sincere wise heart goes forth in the name of God.</p>
<p>I remember well, at this moment, the last look I got of Jamie and <pb id="pg-16-180" n="16:180"/>you, as I went off in the Steamer towards this place some eight years ago.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nine years: TC left for London on <date when="1834-05-08">8 May 1834</date>; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-JWC-01"><sic>7:146</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May 1834</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01"><sic>161</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> I felt that I was gone from you; but that I had been bound and compelled to go;&#x2014;that, in the name of Heaven, I must now do and struggle! In the midst of pain, a better feeling rises: it is good for a man that he be cast, from time to time, forth from his old refuges, and made to try what his relation with the great seen and unseen Realities is!&#x2014; I hope yet to see you in Canada some day; and sit by your hearth on ground that belongs to yourself and the Maker alone!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack talks of &#xa3;300 as a sum that you would have a fair chance with, were it lying ready for you on your landing on the other side. I can only say that I will right heartily go halves with him in any such sum that may be considered fittest; and it will be a true tho&#x2019; small relief to my mind to do so. I know <supplied>[not]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> whether I should have spoken to you about this at all; for perhaps he has not yet mentioned it to you, and the consultation may be still incomplete: but I could not help signifying my readiness even before the time.</p>
<p>Our poor dear Mother will suffer sore; but you, of course, will do all that is in you to spare her true heart any sorrow that is not inevitable. The good old heart of a Mother! She is the saddest and the tenderest sight we have in this world; one could weep floods of tears, were there not something in it of a sacredness that led one beyond tears. It was the Most High God that made Mothers and the sacred affection of children&#x2019;s hearts: yes, it was He;&#x2014;and shall it not, in the end, be <hi rend="italic">all well</hi>, under His management? It shall be <hi rend="italic">all well</hi>; on this side of death, or beyond death. We will pray once more, from our inmost heart if we can, &#x201C;Our Father which art in Heaven, <hi rend="italic">thy</hi> will be done!&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>My dear Brother, I am scribbling here to give some utterance to myself on this occasion; and yet I feel that I have no utterance; that all I can say is but dumb half-utterance;&#x2014;that in fact I ought to end and hold my peace, and leave you to conceive what it is that I am meaning. You know well enough what I mean! I pray with my whole soul all blessings to be upon you. I bid you be of courage, and quit yourself like a man; I prophesy all good, spiritual and temporal, to you if you do. And so let me not speak another word.</p>
<p>You need not answer this at present; you will have enough to do otherwise in these days.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Last week you would receive a Post-office order (or was it the beginning of this week) for two pounds.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430519-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1843-05-19">19 May</date></ref>.</note> I think it was not specifically <pb id="pg-16-181" n="16:181"/>mentioned that one of the pounds was a gift to the poor little Lassie who has just arrived, and is lying asleep on its Mothers&#x2019; knee, little conscious of all this bustle!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC thought the new baby was a girl.

<salute>My darling</salute>
<p>I have been dissipated all this week&#x2014;extremely dissipated <hi rend="italic">on programme;</hi> not settling myself to anything&#x2014;writing to Babbie included!</p>
<p>The fact is, a <hi rend="italic">sublime absurdity</hi> occurred to me the other day, and threw me into a sort of nervous flurry which I saw more likelihood to get rid of in everybody&#x2019;s or anybody&#x2019;s company rather than <foreign>tete a tete</foreign> with myself. My goodness! surely the mantle of <hi rend="italic">Ninon de l&#x2019;Enclos</hi> has fallen upon me!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ninon de Lenclos (<date when="1620-00-00">1620</date>&#x2013;<date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>), beautiful and witty Frenchwoman who had many celebrities as lovers and whose salon was frequented by famous men of letters.</note> One might have thought that in this year of grace I was pretty safe from having my tranquillity assailed by the <foreign><hi rend="italic">grandes passions</hi></foreign> of <hi rend="italic">young</hi> gentlemen! But as the old Countess of Essex said when asked <hi rend="italic">at eighty</hi> by a young jackanapes; &#x201C;when does a woman have done with love&#x201D;&#x2014;?&#x2014; &#x201C;Ask some one older than me&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced, possibly Harriet, countess of Essex, 2d wife of 4th earl of Essex, widowed <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>, d. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, aged 86.</note></p>
<p>Be all that as it may I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> a deal of company this week&#x2014;and talked&#x2014; Oh good heavens&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">such</hi> a quantity! <hi rend="italic">You</hi> would have been perfectly <hi rend="italic">terrified</hi> at my <hi rend="italic">liveliness</hi> had you been by&#x2014;but those, who have had the benefit of it, have seen in it, the simple souls, only a most sudden return to good health and good spirits&#x2014;on which they cannot sufficiently compliment and congratulate me!

An immense comfort to be sure! especially when one has the additional comfort of having just made a person one likes and wishes well to, extremely miserable (for <hi rend="italic">the time</hi> being) in the abstract cause of <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi></p>
<p>Well!

After Sterling&#x2019;s return to Falmouth, Caroline Fox noted, <date when="1843-05-29">29 May</date>, that &#x201C;he dwelt with delight on Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s character&#x2014;such hearty sympathy in the background, and such brilliant talent in front; if it were merely &#x2018;eternal smart&#x2019; with her, it would be very tiresome, but she is a woman as well as a clever person.

JWC was not clear about the relationship and perhaps thought that she was Mrs. Mann&#x2019;s sister, Elizabeth Peabody, mentioned by Emerson in his letter of 29 April, in which he also spoke of Mann as &#x201C;little known to me, but greatly valued as a philanthropist in this state.&#x201D; Emerson gave Mann a letter of intro. to TC, <date when="1843-04-30">30 April</date>, and asked him to deliver a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Dial</hi> (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 343&#x2013;44).</note>&#x2014; What to do?&#x2014;I posted off to Chester Place to explain the necessity of my giving up the Lady Harriet for that time.

In her absence I was requested to pour tea. &#x2026; As I filled and refilled his cup, I thought that his chronic dyspepsia was not to be wondered at. &#x2026; The conversation was mostly a monologue. Mr. Carlyle spoke with a strong Scottish accent, and his talk sounded to me like pages of his writings. He had recently been annoyed by some movement tending to the disestablishment of the Scottish Church. &#x2026; That auld Kirk of Scotland!

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter from Dumfries,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He had written from Dumfries, <date when="1843-05-19">19 May</date>, and then from Scotsbrig, <date when="1843-05-23">23 May</date>, when he said he would probably write next &#x201C;from Dumfries.&#x201D;</note> as you will have inferred, came safe to hand; but there has no second arrived hitherto, so that I am partly in the dark as to your address in these hours. I write to Dumfries as the likeliest.</p>
<p>On Saturday, hard upon five o&#x2019;clock, in a very hasty, half-wet and wearied, muddy condition, I wrote, on the Counter of a Stationer in Pimlico,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Between Chelsea and Westminster.</note> a word of announcement to you that the Cigar-box (the smaller, a very light one) and the Canadian Book<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By J.

John Carlyle had asked TC, <date when="1843-05-23">23 May</date>, to send it and the cigars.</note> were under way: I had just been depositing them with the Strand Booksellers,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall.</note> and <pb id="pg-16-186" n="16:186"/>then attending a Yearly Meeting of the London Library,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After a committee meeting TC had attended the annual gen. meeting, at which were reported an addition of 4,000 vols. to the library, an increasing membership, and a balance of &#xa3;230 after spending &#xa3;1,538.</note> and doing manifold <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the Packet, I suppose, will be in Edinburgh, at least in Leith Roads, tonight; and as &#x201C;speed&#x201D; also was written on it, probably it may arrive at James Aitken&#x2019;s by Coach on Wednesday. The Book is of no moment to me, if you can turn it to any account whatever.</p>
<p>What you say of Alick is naturally very interesting to me. On the whole, it may be admitted that, if he is resolved to go to Canada, he is wise in his circumstances to get thro&#x2019; it at once, and not to spend another season in reconnoitring: it will all be a confusion, when once practically begun, after never so much reconnoitring. I have good hopes of Alick yet; and am heartily sad of heart about him,&#x2014;if sadness availed anything. It is the best chance I see anywhere open for him, this of Canada; a new free field, where many of his talents will come into wholesome play, and a fresh purpose and hope will arise in him again, after so long and sad an abeyance. You speak of &#xa3;300 to lie ready for him when he reaches the new Country:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle said, <date when="1843-05-23">23 May</date>, that Alexander &#x201C;will have money enough &#x2026; left to pay all his debts at Ecclefechan &#x26; his passage out. Some three Hundred Pounds more remitted to Canada will give him a fair trial.&#x201D; His stock was sold, <date when="1843-05-24">24 May</date>, for between &#xa3;80 and &#xa3;100, leaving &#x201C;only some very trifling debts to pay&#x201D; (JAC to TC, [<date when="1843-05-31">31 May</date>]).</note> is that enough, the <hi rend="italic">fittest</hi> sum one could afford him? Whatever sum you find, on investigation, to be best, I will cheerfully go halves with you in it. On Friday or Saturday I wrote to Alick himself to that effect. I shall be anxious now to learn what he is doing since Wednesday last, and how the matter shapes itself for him and those interested. Does he mean to bend towards Brantford and our Brother John? Or will he not go by Canandaigua, and Clow and Greig?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle went first to Canandaigua, then to Brantford, where their half-brother, John Carlyle, lived.

Canandaigua, they all say, is a beautiful place; but I think there is said to be some <foreign><hi rend="italic">aguish</hi></foreign> ground about it: this is one of the <pb id="pg-16-187" n="16:187"/>prime things to be <hi rend="italic">avoided</hi> at all rates.&#x2014; My poor Mother, she will need all your support at present; for her imagination too will greatly aggravate the matter: it is now no such business going to America; America is in very fact <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> to us at present than London was fifty years ago. O be kind to our good old Mother,&#x2014;and say all that is kind to her good ever-loving heart: no Mother has deserved better of children than she of us. Are you sure this driving up and down, in such weather (if your weather be like ours) is not too much for her?<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had been driving his mother back and forth between the Gill and Dumfries (staying overnight), and Ecclefechan and Scotsbrig. He wrote, <date when="1843-05-19">19 May</date>: &#x201C;Our mother is better for the movement.&#x201D; Mary Austin, at the Gill, had just had another da., and Jean Aitken, at Dumfries, had just moved house.</note>&#x2014; I reconcile myself to her arrangement about Scotsbrig for another year. She might have a Cottage made out of that old wrecked House, if she liked to live at Ecclefechan. It could all be made neat and trim; built fronting into the garden; divided from the others by a wall. If Jenny were with her, she might do very well. I do not think Jenny will ever get more good of Hanning;&#x2014;but she too must be convinced of that by better evidence first.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote, <date when="1843-05-19">19 May</date>: &#x201C;There are two good rooms at the Gill which Mary is anxious they should occupy, &#x26; Jamie wishes our mother to remain at Scotsbrig getting one of Mary&#x2019;s girls when Jenny was away to remain with her. I suppose Jenny has hardly given up hopes of her absurd husband &#x26; that introduces an element of unrest which is difficult to manage.&#x201D; On <date when="1843-05-23">23 May</date> he confirmed that their mother was &#x201C;averse to Dumfries, &#x26; inclined to pass the winter here,&#x201D; at Scotsbrig, and &#x201C;the summer at the Gill,&#x201D; as &#x201C;the old house in Ecclefechan&#x201D; was &#x201C;a total wreck&#x201D; and &#x201C;irreparable.&#x201D;</note> I long to hear from you what turn all things take in poor Annandale, with the good souls that are still there for us.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter which arrived yesterday (Tuesday) is very sorrowful; yet at the same time resolute, sincere, and on the whole ought to be of good omen to us. A new Note from me can do nothing more than express anew my deep fellow-feeling with you; my exhortation and encouragement to go on bravely, and in this your difficult position to quit you like a man! We have often sore afflictions laid on us, which turn out to be the highest blessings when the results of them are summed <pb id="pg-16-189" n="16:189"/>up. You have had a dreary time of it for many years;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A. Carlyle wrote in his &#x201C;Jottings&#x201D;: &#x201C;There was no prospect of his ever making with his utmost energy more than a bare living out of his business, in such a small village. Some years before this he had lost most of his small patrimony in farming Craigenputtock, which was in those days rented far too dear and had to be lowered to a considerable extent for the succeeding tenant. It was in those days, and is now, mainly a sheep farm, only a few small patches of it being cultivatable. &#x2026; After leaving Craigenputtock my Father tried various other things, among them one or two of the best of the farms then offered; but nothing could be made of them; so as a last resort he went to Ecclefechan&#x201D; (MS: NLS 739).</note> and things without and things within have gone for awry: you are now called as it were to make a revolution, a radical reform; and that is no easy business! But by Heaven&#x2019;s favour it may be a most blessed one. I say often I have known no man so wasted, fettered, and sunk in deep imprisonments as my poor Brother Alick; one of the bravest of men too;&#x2014;but deficient in <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>, in candor of self-examination; too <hi rend="italic">violent</hi>, on the whole, for making his way thro&#x2019; quagmires, and rough boggy ground! My dear Brother, it will be the joyfullest thing that can befal me to hear that you have gained new life and virtue, in these sore trials; that you have risen into victory at last, after all this fighting. It is a change not to be effected without pain, without agony of heart; but it is cheap at any price of pain; it is great and blessed, if it happened in the lowest cottage in Earth; it is a thing well-pleasing in the sight of God and man, and is <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> of its exceeding great reward! I forbear to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> farther; for I have often felt that my silence was more eloquent than anything I could say.</p>
<p>Canada is very vague to you; and unluckily I can throw no practical light on it. If John do not write, did it never strike you to look in by Clow, who I think is in New-York State,&#x2014;perhaps not far from the road to Hamilton?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Clow, Janet Carlyle&#x2019;s cousin, had emigrated, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, and rented a farm belonging to John Greig at Alton, N.Y., 30 mi. E of Rochester and ca. 15 mi. N of the road to Hamilton. Alexander and his family stayed there from <date when="1844-07-30">30 July</date> to <date when="1844-03-00">March 1844</date>, when they moved to nr. Brantford, Ontario, where John Carlyle had settled.</note> I could give you a good Letter to Greig, tho&#x2019; I think the last failed of an answer. It is represented as a pleasant region (one ought to see also, whether wholesome or not), and more cultivated and settled than upper Canada. But a man that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> till the Earth, what has he to dread when there is free Earth offered him to cultivate, and God&#x2019;s sky and blessing spread over his head? There is something manful and heroic in taking one&#x2019;s stand on that Ground; saying. &#x201C;I will appeal to nobody, but to the Maker over me; <hi rend="italic">He</hi> will prosper me, if I do follow His appointments!&#x201D; I flatter myself with thinking that all your qualities and talents will come out in this new <pb id="pg-16-190" n="16:190"/>employment far better than they have ever hitherto done. Your children, your little Jane, will be a great treasure to you, yearly growing more <hi rend="italic">valuable</hi> in every sense of the word;&#x2014;how different from the case of children here, in this country which seems <hi rend="italic">doomed</hi>. Courage, my dear Brother; stand up to the task, and you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> find it <hi rend="italic">doable:</hi> &#x201C;all tasks are like swimming&#x201D;; the water threatens to drown one; yet dash fearlessly abroad in it, it does not drown you!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels, Works</hi> 24:321.</note> I augur much good, as the fruit of all these sufferings. Men are not <hi rend="italic">made anew</hi>, and reformed into health and life of soul again, without terrible sufferings! Your Brother&#x2019;s affection, his remembrance of your affection to him, remains to you (know this always) while he continues on this Earth.&#x2014; And so I will say no more,&#x2014;if I have not even already said too much.</p>
<p>The Tobacco, I begin to imagine, was <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a stone, not a <hi rend="italic">quarter?</hi> In that case, I owe the little Baby a sovereign still for a frock to her. God&#x2019;s blessing be on you all. <closer><salute>Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>&#x201C;The British Authors Society,&#x201D; I much fear, is little other than a devout imagination. My own knowledge of it, tho&#x2019; I find my name circulating as seconder of motions &#x26;c, is about as good as none at all: I attended once for ten minutes, in a Tavern at Charing Cross,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Hotel, Cockspur St., <date when="1843-03-25">25 March</date>.</note> a company of some thirty very ugly men, not above three of whom were known to me; I did admit in a whisper, in answer to the &#x201C;Hon. Secretary&#x2019;s&#x201D; whisper, That thing Sir L. Bulwer<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer.</note> said appeared to have reason in it;&#x2014;and thereupon, little edified by the physiognomy of the business, I took my hat and glided away, without intention to return. Since that, about a month ago, I formally declined putting my name among the members,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430501-TC-JRO-01">TC to <sic>[JR]</sic><corr>[JRO]</corr>, <date when="1843-05-01">1 May</date></ref>.</note> and have heard nothing of it farther.</p>
<p>My decided idea is that &#x201C;Authors&#x201D; will associate, and become a most stupendous Body Corporate, one day, and the Chief of all Bodies Corporate: but it will be, I think, as indeed I have written somewhere, &#x201C;when they <hi rend="italic">cease</hi> to be a <hi rend="italic">Canaille</hi>&#x201D;; not while they continue one, does it seem very possible! Hunt merely for pudding or praise, we have, like all animals of <hi rend="italic">prey</hi>, to do it in a solitary manner. Solitude and hunting are two things that go together.&#x2014; &#x201C;Authors,&#x201D; it seems to me, are somewhat difficult to lay hold of, and define, in these days: not all who talk with Printer&#x2019;s Types are <hi rend="italic">Authors</hi> now! On the whole, I will not recommend my brave Mrs Johnstone to disturb herself with this affair, unless it assume some other aspect than the present one.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Isobel Johnstone (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14957"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), novelist and ed. of <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> was reviewed in the <date when="1843-06-00">June</date> number, pp. 339&#x2013;48, signed &#x201C;B&#x201D; (J. S. Blackie).</note></p>
<p>We are very glad to exchange a salutation once more with you and her, tho&#x2019; only on this &#x201C;imagination.&#x201D; I remember you both, with the liveliest distinctness, with the utmost good will; and always shall, I believe. My Wife joins heartily with me in all kind regards and wishes. &#x201C;Success!&#x2014; Courage, with or without success!&#x201D;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have written to you at the &#x201C;Post-Office, Liverpool,&#x201D; today; but I find, on computing, that the Money Order must go off tonight also, or you will not get it in time for Friday,&#x2014;perhaps. I will take it up into the region of the General Post tonight.&#x2014; As &#xa3;500 is the sum agreed on, I here send you my full half of it (&#xa3;250) according to original intention. May it be a blessing where it is going!</p>
<p>Unless there be some great haste, you had better let me speak to Colman before you dispose of it thro&#x2019; any Bank. Colman is the American from Canadaigua.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS. TC regularly but not invariably misspells Canandaigua.</note></p>

Probably on Friday Evening. You will in that case hear the result by Saturdays Post.</p>
<p>I ought also to take care of not missing the Post for America! I will buy that &#x201C;shilling book&#x201D; you talked of,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably an emigrants&#x2019; handbook.</note> this very night at the Post-Office, if they have it.</p>

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>Thank you <hi rend="italic">passionately</hi> for giving me <hi rend="italic">Vittoria Accorombona</hi>&#x2014;and thank you even more for knowing before hand that I should like her. Your presentiment that this was &#x201C;a woman exactly after my own heart&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">so</hi> pleases <hi rend="italic">my own heart!</hi>&#x2014;proves that I am not <hi rend="italic">universally &#x201C;a woman misunderstood&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014; But you said nothing of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">man after</hi> <hi rend="italic">my own heart</hi> so that Bracciano took me by surprise, and has nearly turned my head!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paulo Giordano Orsini, duke of Bracciano, with whom the married Vittoria is in love, kills his wife and Vittoria&#x2019;s husband and later marries Vittoria.</note> My very <foreign><hi rend="italic">beau ideal</hi></foreign> of manhood is that Paul Giordano; could I hear of the like of him existing anywhere in these degenerate days; I would&#x2014;even at this late stage of the business&#x2014;send him&#x2014; &#x2014;my picture! and an offer of my heart and hand, for the next world&#x2014;since they are already disposed of in this&#x2014; Ah what a man that must be who can strangle his young beautiful wife with his own hands, and&#x2014;bating one moment of conventional horror&#x2014;inspire not the slightest feeling of aversion or distrust! When a man strangles his wife nowa-days he does it brutally&#x2014;in drink, or in passion, or in revenge: to transact such a work coolly, nobly, on the loftiest principles&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">strangle with dignity</hi>, because the woman &#x201C;was unworthy of him&#x201D;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> indeed is a triumph of <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, which places this Bracciano above all the Heros of ancient or modern times! which makes me almost weep that I was not born two centuries earlier that I might have been&#x2014;his mistress&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> his <hi rend="italic">wife</hi>!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ninth edn. of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi> (New York, <date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>) notes that Tieck&#x2019;s novel &#x201C;is probably best known to English readers by Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s half-earnest half-mocking admiration of the hero &#x2026; and her wish that she could have lived two hundred years before, to have been&#x2014;his mistress, not his wife&#x2019; &#x201D; (23:382).</note></p>
<p>But what think you befell? In the simplicity of my heart I lent the book to a friend&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> of course&#x2014;whose hitherto-version of me has born a considerable resemblance to the <hi rend="italic">Santa Maria</hi>&#x2014;lent it too with all my marginal marks&#x2014;(as Carlyle would say) &#x201C;significative of much&#x201D;!&#x2014;and when the man brought it back he could neither look at me nor speak to me; but <hi rend="italic">blushed</hi> and stammered as if he were in the presence of a new Godess of Reason!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Terrot. JWC first wrote &#x201C;Passion,&#x201D; then overwrote &#x201C;Reason.&#x201D;</note> Disliking all that sort of 
thing I asked him plain out what ailed him? &#x201C;The truth is,&#x201D; said he, &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> <pb id="pg-16-201" n="16:201"/>Carlyle&#x2014;that book (looking at it askance) has&#x2014;confused me!

<p>I am over head and ears at present in what Carlyle anathematises as &#x201C;an unfathomable puddlement of <hi rend="italic">Mudieism</hi>,&#x201D; into which I have flung myself with <hi rend="italic">my usual impetuosity</hi>, and am <hi rend="italic">perfectly certain</hi> to be swallowed up&#x201D;&#x2014; Not so the Prophet of evil!

<p>I write at present to request a very special favour. A Brother of mine, Alexander by name, whom I love much, and am very sad indeed to part with, is about emigrating to America. He is a farmer, of the race of farmers; a man in no wise destitute of due specialties for farming; who nevertheless, like so many others, finds it a too unprosperous enterprise in this heavy-laden country; and so, after many years of hesitation, decides at length that he must go and try the business under new conditions, on your side of the sea. He has a wife and family of young children; he is still in the vigour of life (two years younger than myself); a man of short stature, but of robust force of muscle, impetuous energy of character, exceedingly expert, shifty and adroit in all kinds of rural and miscellanious labour; he will have I understand, <pb id="pg-16-203" n="16:203"/>some &#xa3;500 clear money when he reaches your coasts: with these capabilities and the impartial sky over him, and the impartial earth under him, he must do the best he can! I believe I may venture to add that he is a man of real integrity and veracity; of deep affections, true-hearted honourable spirit;&#x2014;intrinsically a bit of good Annandale stuff, with perhaps far more of faculty in him than has ever been developed, or in this world is ever likely to be developed now. But your neighbour M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Clow<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Clow.</note> knows him well, and can give a more impartial account, tho&#x2019; he also is related to him, being cousin of his wife.</p>
<p>My Brothers first aim was towards Upper Canada, but I have advised him to take Canadagua by the way, and pause till he have examined there. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Colman, whom I have consulted on the subject, votes emphatically to the same effect: my Brother determines to do so. He hopes to sail by the <hi rend="italic">Ashburton</hi> line ship in a few days, and may reach New York probably within a month after this letter. In three days more I suppose he may be in Canadagua. He is writing by this Steamer to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Clow; will hope to find a letter from him lying in the Post office at New York. I will give him a Note of your address with my signature to it, in his pocket. If there be any furtherance, guidance, or honest help you can yield this Brother of mine in the present trying state of his affairs,&#x2014;I only say it will be about as true a service done to me as one man can do another. There are few wishes more ardent in me than for a blessing on this Pilgrim and his wayfaring!&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Colman fancies he might find some temporary occupation, lease of a farm, charge of a farm, or other convenient means of duly investigating Canadagua for a year or so till he saw where to settle. This also seems to be my Brothers own notion. But I have already said enough. If there be any opportunity of helping, you on the spot will know best what opportunity,&#x2014;and on various grounds I persuade myself, you will not be slow to use it. And so &#x26;c</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>My dear Alick I pray heaven that the above letter will make your difficult way somewhat smoother for you&#x2014;I am sure that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Greig is a most kind-hearted man, and for old affections sake will feel strongly disposed to serve you. Nevertheless, in this world one&#x2019;s best help must lie always in oneself&#x2014;as you and I and every one of our standing, with any grain of sense in his head, cannot have missed to perceive&#x2014; &#x2014; God go with you, and bless you wheresoever you go&#x2014; I might say many things&#x2014;sad, and encouraging both&#x2014;but all that I might say is best <pb id="pg-16-204" n="16:204"/>summed up in those three words God bless you. <closer><salute>I will always think of you with affection and hope that you will do the same by me.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We saw Mr Colman, the Canadaigua American, last night, and had a great deal of talk with him. He is a highly sensible, good-natured, well-bred man; and likely to understand this business specially well, being direct from the spot, and sent hither I believe to inquire about farm matters as a Secretary of some Agricultural society; that being his business when at home.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Colman had been agricultural commissioner of the state of Massachusetts; TC refers to this or some other post.</note></p>
<p>He is clear that the Canadaigua region greatly excels the Hamilton or Upper Canada one: it is a pleasant, fertile and settled country in a higher degree than the other; it is peopled generally with farmers of a much better character (the Hamilton men being given to drink &#x26;c); it has plenty of schools, of mills, markets, is crossed both by a canal and a railway,&#x2014;has plenty of cross roads too, which are hard and firm with ice in winter, with drought in summer, and &#x201C;only in a slushy state for about a fortnight in autumn and some four weeks in the thaw of spring.&#x201D; Many of the settlers are Scotch. Farms that touch on the railway or canal have a free market for their butter, poultry &#x26;c; and all farms are within reach of a mill and miller, who buys the grain (not without competition) at a fair price. The main white-crop grown is wheat. The land generally is fertile; some of it very fertile. It seems to be in the hands partly of small farmer-proprietors; and then there are, besides Mr Greig and a &#x201C;Mr Wadsworth&#x201D; whom he spoke of,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Wadsworth (<date when="1768-00-00">1768</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>) or his brother William, owners of and agents for large tracts of land in western N.Y. state since <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>.</note> some who have large spaces of land, which they subdivide into farms, and let in various ways, or cultivate by agents of their own. Farms, he says, are let usually from year to year; and they are to be had at all times of the year,&#x2014;some of these large proprietors having always farms on hand, which they are very willing to dispose of to a tenant, rather than keep cultivating by themselves or servants. A common way (I think he said, the general way) of letting, is that the landlord furnishes his tenant with all manner of stock &#x26;c (which is valued <pb id="pg-16-205" n="16:205"/>in money, by judges appointed, at the entrance on the business); the tenant binds himself to give his landlord a certain <hi rend="italic">proportion of the produce; half</hi> of the produce, he seemed to say, was very common; but on worse soils, it is as low as a <hi rend="italic">third:</hi> the tenant cultivates in this way for one or more years; and then at the end has to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> an equal value of stock, or make it up according to the finding of judges. The farms have, almost all, a portion left in wood; that being the only fuel,&#x2014;I suppose, the only building material too, that lies convenient: the rest of the ground is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> arable, and takes its due rotation: wheat, potatoes &#x26;c. You can <hi rend="italic">hire</hi> the ploughing of your land, if you have not horses of your own; Farmers&#x2019; sons and such like are willing to make a little money by doing it for you. It is very common also that a man skilled in farming and with a good character gets a place as manager (what I called &#x201C;agent&#x201D; above): the proprietor, living at a distance, gives him a house and provision for himself and family: I think he said, a man and wife with perhaps only one young child would get 300 dollars (&#xa3;60) a-year beside their keep,&#x2014;or perhaps it was &#x201C;with five young children&#x201D;? I am not clear; but think it is as stated. On the whole, he represented it as decidedly easy for a skilful farming man to find some one or other of these positions for himself; and so to wait for a while, and look about him before purchasing land. My brother and his family, he said, might at any rate, failing all else, board very comfortably for about a guinea a week the whole of them,&#x2014;I suppose, in some public boarding&#x2014;house, as the Americans often do: that was the way be himself with his wife had lived while there. The climate he persisted in describing as good and wholesome,&#x2014;no ague known, except perhaps in some &#x201C;indiscreet reckless person&#x201D;: a wholesome good climate he again and again called it,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; children take something of a <hi rend="italic">rush fevever</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> (no, that was not exactly the name!), and other kinds of fever for grown people were by no means unknown.
But it is a pleasant airy green country, he says; with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">swift</hi> streams&#x201D; (whether they are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> swift or not?); and broken into knolls and moderate hills. Fifty years ago, it was all a wood; and belonged to the State of Connecticut.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Western N.Y. had belonged to the Mass. Colony. After commissioners from both states met in <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date> to settle their rival claims, Mass. retained its title W of Seneca Lake, though N.Y. had political sovereignty. They sold much, in its undeveloped state, to land speculators, including Phelps and Gorham Purchase, who bought the rights to six million acres and opened one of the first land offices at Canandaigua. The confusion may have arisen from the fact that Jeremiah Wadsworth (who had holdings in Phelps and Gorham and was responsible for his nephews, James and William, going to the area) and Oliver Phelps both came from Connecticut.</note> There was never much, or perhaps any, <hi rend="italic">pine</hi> on it; hickory <pb id="pg-16-206" n="16:206"/>and hard wood.&#x2014; This is nearly all I can recollect, dear Alick; and I tried to state it faithfully,&#x2014;but it rather seemed to me, as if my informant, tho&#x2019; evidently a most truthful man, was a little sanguine of temper; so you must make abatement and allowance! The price of land to purchase is not a thing I can state now, tho&#x2019; he did try to make a guess: my impression rather is that it seemed unexpectedly high for America.</p>
<p>The way to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> to Canadaigua was altogether simple: directly on landing at New York, either at morning or at evening, you would find a Steamer up the Hudson River to Albany, some 10 hours,&#x2014;the fare, I think, a dollar and a half (6 shillings) per head, children half price: from Albany there was a railway; in 18 hours more (including very frequent stoppages of 15 minutes) you were at Canadaigua, and the fare not very high. Or you might go by canal,&#x2014;or by a few stages of railway (which carry you over a hilly country where there are many <foreign><hi rend="italic">lochs</hi></foreign>) and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> by canal in three days,&#x2014;still cheaper. The railway he tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> would be best; for it also was not dear.</p>
<p>I write you down all this, my dear Brother, because naturally you will like to know even the vague figure of it: but our good Colman undertook to write it all down on paper himself very shortly, and in that shape so soon as I have read it, you shall have it to keep and study. Colman undertakes farther to answer pointedly any question you may put; he will write you Letters of Introduction to this person and to that (over many parts of the Union), if they were necessary: but he kept repeating that &#x201C;Mr Greig could do it all&#x201D;; that you should certainly stop at Canadaigua, and examine <hi rend="italic">it</hi> well. As to remitting of money; he supposed it would naturally be by Draft on some Bank at New York,&#x2014;and you need not take the real <hi rend="italic">money</hi> with you even from New York (if you got your Draft <hi rend="italic">accepted</hi> and indorsed there, it might save time), but Greig, who did bank-business too, could manage it all at Canadaigua. We were to take care that the Draft <hi rend="italic">were on a good Bank</hi> at New York: but that, I suppose, the Scotch Bankers take care of, and are themselves responsible for.&#x2014; You were by no means, on your passage to Canadaigua or the like, to bargain with any private party &#x201C;to take you all the way for a certain sum&#x201D;; they would weary you out with waiting.&#x2014; This is all I will say of Colman.</p>
<p>This morning also I have written to Greig; and Jane has added a Post-script. She is making a Copy of the thing for you.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See previous letter.</note>&#x2014;Tell me, or bid Jack tell me whether you have a right map of New York State, and especially of that part of it; that if not, I may send you one.&#x2014;&#x2014; <salute>Dear <pb id="pg-16-207" n="16:207"/>Brother,</salute> I did not sleep at all last night (what has not happened with me for years), and now it is about ten o&#x2019;clock, and I am going to try it again. The Letters are all ready now, let me be asleep or not. You may judge that I have a million of things to say, which <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is not the good time for saying! In fact I am very stupid; and in hopes that I shall get some sleep. <closer><salute>May God&#x2019;s blessing go with you, my dear Brother!</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Monday Morning <date when="1843-06-19">19 June [1843]</date></dateline>
<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>At going to sleep, as specified in the foregoing paper,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-16/lt-18430617-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1843-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> I left the Letters for America (Mr Greig&#x2019;s Letter, and another of small consequence) in charge to Jane to put into the Post-Office; all sealed and ready: the Letter for yourself was left also all ready only not sealed. Jane omitted to take you Letter; so here it still lies,&#x2014;and I now today add this little Postscript before sealing.</p>
<p>I went to bed, as stated, about 11 o&#x2019;clock; by degrees fell sound asleep, and awoke in great astonishment about seven in the evening! Your Letter still lay here unsealed; but the American Letters had been most punctually put into the Post-Office in good time. Well, I thought it was all right; I went out and walked in the twilight &#x26;c: but just at going to bed I incidentally learned that poor Jane had <hi rend="italic">put in</hi> the American Letters indeed, but never dreamed of paying the shilling apiece for them! There they were therefore, lying hard and fast in the Dead Letter Office, the Post-Office sealed till Monday morning, and the Mail Steamer sure to sail from Liverpool <hi rend="italic">without</hi> them! I hardly remember a more provoking circumstance; poor Jane was in despair: we knew not what to do. I got a reasonable sleep in the night, however; and next morning early sallied forth, in one direction after another, to see whether something could not still be done. After several fruitless attempts, I went at last to one Mr Baring one of Peel&#x2019;s Ministry (whom John knows about);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. B. Baring was sec. to the board of control in Peel&#x2019;s second ministry, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>.</note> he undertook, if I would write <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Letter, to get it still sent off that night by the Government Bag, which was to depart in the evening and still be in time for the Steamer. I directly wrote another Letter to Mr Greig, explaining the mischance, <pb id="pg-16-208" n="16:208"/>referring him to Clow for the particulars of your situation, promising <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Letter itself by the next Steamer (<date when="1843-07-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of july</date>), and in the meanwhile recommending you to his furtherance with all emphasis. This I have good reason to hope is already in the Steamer at Liverpool, and travelling on by the side of a Letter of your own to Clow. The other I will today recover from the Dead Letter Office and get forwarded by the swiftest route,&#x2014;at latest by the <date when="1843-07-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> july</date> Steamer; whereby even it, I suppose, may arrive before the <hi rend="italic">Ashburton:</hi> and so again, we hope, it is all right; at least much better than we once expected!</p>
<p>I have slept <hi rend="italic">both</hi> nights since that bad adventure; and am now for a heavy day&#x2019;s work at my <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> (a most beggarly piece of work, which I repent a thousand times having engaged in!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dr. Francia.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; I will write very shortly to some of you again; probably I shall hear from some of you today; and so, with my blessings and heart-affectionate regards, I conclude. <closer><salute>Ever your Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The instant John&#x2019;s Letter came to hand, I set about fulfilling what it ordered. I have written the Letter he spoke of to our half-brother&#x2019;s old address in Canada (Brantford, Hamilton, Upper Canada), and put it into the Post-Office; I have <hi rend="italic">recovered</hi> the Letter to Greig from the Dead L<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Office, paid it and sent it off&#x2014; Still in time they tell me! All which is well.</p>
<p>As to remitting of money, I find I shall be at any rate too late,&#x2014; yet I come hither to Hamilton&#x2019;s to ask about it: Hamilton is not in London; nothing but Laurie here (the Doctor knows all these people)&#x2014;and from Laurie is no light at all to be got.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hamilton&#x2019;s partner Laurie not further identified.</note>&#x2014; The Dr will indeed have already decided: so it is no matter, at bottom. Colman did not seem to know much of it. I should have considered a Letter or Bill or something of that sort on John Greig himself the safest of all ways. But I suppose the Bank people know several ways safe enough.&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are going far sooner than I expected! My head is in a whirl, <pb id="pg-16-209" n="16:209"/>and I am writing with the noise as of Babel rolling by me.&#x2014; I will write again certainly,&#x2014;and have it left for you at &#x201C;Mr Welsh&#x2019;s 20. Maryland street,&#x201D;&#x2014;unless you write from Ecclefechan (or Jack do), and appoint me another address. I have several things to send you, I have so many thousand things to say, dear Brother! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. Courage, Courage! God&#x2019;s blessing on you forevermore.</salute></closer></p>

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (<date when="1843-06-19">19 June [1843</date>])</dateline>
<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here, by the last Post of the day, has come a packet of letters from Mr Colman: if despatched directly they will still reach you in Ecclefechan on Monday morning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably TC meant to write &#x201C;Wednesday morning,&#x201D; when they did arrive.</note></p>
<p>Colman&#x2019;s directions about your journey seem very precise, and may be of use as you go along. His Letters of Introduction were not expressly solicited by me, and are the kinder on his part; they may do you some good,&#x2014;at lowest they can do you no harm. When you are to deliver any of them, you enclose it in a sealed cover, address it, and go with it. I believe they are honest well-disposed people in those parts, many of them; and of course they have fashions of their own,&#x2014;which you will gradually learn.</p>
<p>If the Dr have not yet <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the Bill of Exchange, I should think it would be very safe to have it drawn upon that New-York House, for which Colman gives you a Letter, and which is the owner of the Ashburton. But if the Bankers have already given you a Bill on some House which <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can vouch for,&#x2014;probably that too is perfectly good. I suppose Liverpool would be the place to get a choice of Bills;&#x2014;but I have as you may perceive next to no experience in that sort of affairs.</p>
<p>The Dr does not say whether he means to go with you to Liverpool; but I hope he does. He will have it in his power to help you there, I should think, in many little ways. As to me I have been thinking daily whether I should not run up to Liverpool, and see you all before you went: Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wish it, my dear Brother? I have got into the ugliest evil of hurry here, about a piece of insignificant writing, which I <hi rend="italic">needed</hi> not have bound myself to; and I am yet but quite in the middle of it;&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-210" n="16:210"/>but I will fling it away, if you express any wish to see me: on the whole, I will be guided by that, and by the time you have to stay in Liverpool.</p>
<p>My dear Brother, it does seem to me, looking at the state and prospects of this country, that the whole farming kindred of us, our good Mother at our head, might all yet have to follow you, if you did well in that new Country! Consider yourself as a pioneer sent out before the rest; to make the way smoother for the rest. It is clearly the voice of Providence, one would say, that bids you go. In the midst of my sorrow, something whispers to me that my brave Brother will become a new man, and find a new and worthier career open for him there. It is the sweetest consolation that could come into my heart.&#x2014; I will talk of these things no more. God is near us all, if we with faithfulness draw near to Him, follow His eternal Laws.&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wrote to John<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their half-brother.</note> in Canada today, as I told you. There are now probably <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Letters on the way to Canadaigua. Write to me whether you find a good map of New York State in Liverpool; that I may send you one, if not. Buy that Book, mentioned by Colman, when you get to New York.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There were works such as S. Buller, <hi rend="italic">The Emigrant&#x2019;s Handbook of Facts</hi>, reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1843-07-08">8 July</date>, as containing &#x201C;much useful information&#x201D; about Canada and not raising &#x201C;expectations too high.&#x201D;</note> Probably I shall hear from John<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their brother.</note> tomorrow or next day. The daylight is gone for the present. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> for this night.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours ever,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It will be impossible for anybody to be totally a bore, if you escort him. Pray bring us your white-oak Professor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; probably a fellow agronomist.</note> and let us see whether there is no promise of red wood in him! Till Monday Evening, I am incessantly occupied; but <hi rend="italic">then</hi>&#x2014;at the old hour, if you can.</p>
<p>A Mr and Mrs Orville Dewey, from New York, send me down a Note from Emerson, with a request to know when they are to call,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-211" n="16:211"/>but have omitted to add any address of their own!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Orville Dewey (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>), unitarian minister of N.Y. City, m., <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>, Emerson&#x2019;s cousin Louisa Farnham. They were in Europe, <date when="1841-10-00">Oct. 1841</date> to <date when="1843-08-00">Aug.</date> In his letter to TC, <date when="1843-02-26">26 Feb.</date>, from Staten Island, N.Y., Emerson had said of Dewey: &#x201C;You will find him well acquainted with the most noted of our people, as I believe he already is with many of the most eminent of yours.&#x201D;</note> I wish you could find them, and bring them down with you on Monday evening,&#x2014;or at least make known to them my embarrassment.</p>
<p>Your letters were a most kind gift; and may be very useful to my Brother. Nay they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> already useful to him; casting a ray of friendly hope and help over what otherwise, no doubt, looks dark and hostile enough in his notions of it. My good old Mother, to whose affectionate imagination &#x201C;America&#x201D; seems a great devouring gulph, would see (this morning, I think), that it is not so; that there are kind brother souls and various good men in America! I owe you many thanks. I know not yet what day my Brother goes, but fancy it must be very soon.</p>
<p>&#x2014;On Monday Evening; with or without the Deweys!</p>

<salute>Darling</salute>
<p>I am afraid you will get no good of me until the Mudie concern is off my hands either as a success or a failure&#x2014;I have just been writing a long letter to Jeffrey about them till my head is all in a mash&#x2014;yesterday <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi>&#x2014;to Geraldine!&#x2014;that unwearied girl has fairly <hi rend="italic">conquered</hi> me into a hot correspondence with her again after all&#x2014;by taking up this matter I have so much at heart with an enthusiasm&#x2014;even surpassing my own!&#x2014; I cannot but feel grateful to her at least for what she has done and is in the way of doing&#x2014;nay <hi rend="italic">at times</hi> I am almost overpersuaded back into my old illusion that she <hi rend="italic">has</hi> some sort of strange, passionate&#x2014;incomprehensible <hi rend="italic">attraction</hi> towards me that leads her thro what is even more repugnant to natural feeling than &#x201C;fire and water&#x201D;&#x2014;thro <hi rend="italic">the miry puddle</hi>&#x2014;of tearying and <hi rend="italic">begging</hi>&#x2014;to do me <pb id="pg-16-212" n="16:212"/>pleasure&#x2014;Whatever be her <hi rend="italic">motive</hi> her <hi rend="italic">results</hi> are worthy of admiration&#x2014;and lay me under a considerable debt of toleration towards her&#x2014;</p>
<p>Then here has been Carlyle fretting himself&#x2014;and family&#x2014; &#x2014;that is, me and Helen&#x2014;to fiddlestrings&#x2014;having two incompatible worries acting on him at once&#x2014;the thought of his Brothers departure to America with all the <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> work <hi rend="italic">that</hi> brings with it&#x2014;such as writing of recommendatory letters&#x2014;gathering of all sorts of information for his guidance &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; And on the other hand an <hi rend="italic">article</hi> for Forster&#x2019;s review which <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be finished by Saturday night;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dr. Francia&#x201D; for the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, which was to go to the printer, Sat., <date when="1843-06-24">24 June</date>.</note> if he would not run the risk of Forster&#x2019;s hanging himself. And so&#x2014;we have sleepless nights&#x2014;terrific explosions at breakfast&#x2014;and all the <foreign>et ceteras</foreign> you can figure!</p>
<p>You speak of fine weather it has only reached <hi rend="italic">us</hi> this morning&#x2014;so all our dreams of the Country have been kept in abeyance&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> it looks as if it <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be summer at last&#x2014;So when the article is finished there will be some movement surely&#x2014;or at least emphatic enough <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> about movement&#x2014;but it will be time enough to speak of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> plans when they have assumed the slightest appearance of certainty&#x2014; One thing seems pretty clear&#x2014;that my uncle will be gone before I can come&#x2014;and so&#x2014;I must keep Liverpool <hi rend="italic">in prospect</hi>&#x2014;for I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> find <hi rend="italic">the people</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">the house</hi> when I come&#x2014;having none of John Carlyles preference for the mere <hi rend="italic">shelter</hi> which is got by visiting&#x2014; Blame me and not Gambardella <hi rend="italic">now</hi> about the pictures until you get them<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gambardella&#x2019;s portraits of JWC and Jeannie Welsh; there had been a delay in framing JWC&#x2019;s (see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430418-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1843-04-18">18 April</date>]</ref>).

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There can be no possible objection to your dedicating your Book to me,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His dedication made clear that it did not come from ever having met TC, but from his admiring TC &#x201C;as a gifted literary man,&#x201D; whose books Baxter had read with &#x201C;much pleasure and profit.&#x201D; He was &#x201C;one of the &#x2018;self-taught,&#x2019; &#x201D; and writing the poem had been &#x201C;a pleasant employment after the business of the day.&#x201D; He speaks of the dedication as &#x201C;a slight but sincere token of my esteem for you as an author; of my admiration of the doctrines you teach; of your excellent talents; of the noble use to which you apply them.&#x201D;</note> if you determine to do me that honour. I regret that it can be <pb id="pg-16-213" n="16:213"/>of no benefit to the Book; but my side of the business is not to look thitherward, but to thank you for all your goodwill towards me.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>John&#x2019;s Letter came to me this morning;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Scotsbrig, dated <date when="1843-06-21">21 June</date>.</note> I had been looking every night and morning for it: the news of it fell on my heart like a heavy stone. My dear Brother,&#x2014;it is very touching what John says, that you went thro&#x2019; the business &#x201C;like a right brave man&#x201D;; that &#x201C;all your old energy, alacrity and clearness of mind shewed itself again in you in these hours!&#x201D; Yes, my dear Alick,&#x2014;when I think and hope that perhaps it is God&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">merciful</hi> ordering, this very sore trial, to bring you back again out of fatal declivities, into a true path; and make you yet even yet the victorious <hi rend="italic">man</hi> you were meant to be&#x2014;that is the only thing that sweetens this bitter sorrow to me.&#x2014;</p>
<p>But why do I talk in that dialect? The truth is, I am worn down with writing day and night, and in a very weak sorrowful humour; I never in all my life was so busy. But it will end on Sunday;&#x2014;it <hi rend="italic">must</hi> end, for the thing has then to be printed.&#x2014; It is most absurd that this too should have intervened to aggravate us.</p>
<p>Tell me truly if you would <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to see me; if it would not be rather a sorrow for you? I promise and assure myself that I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come yet, and see you in that new Home,&#x2014;to which may God Himself give <pb id="pg-16-214" n="16:214"/>a blessing! There has no solicitation yet from all America that had any strength at all upon me like this.&#x2014; In God&#x2019;s name, let us look up then; and take Hope and Courage for a loadstar. I will engage not to write another weak word to you,&#x2014;not even in such a whirl of haste as I write in at present.</p>
<p>Tell me exactly on what day you expect to sail. I will not bid you call at Maryland Street; but call again at the Post-Office, if there be again any chance.</p>
<p>Your Letter to the Owners of the Ashburton will perhaps do you good with the Captain. You carry a Letter to one Mr M&#x2019;Connel,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson&#x2019;s relation and John Greig&#x2019;s friend, according to John Carlyle, <date when="1843-06-21">21 June</date>.</note> John says, at Canadaigua. We knew his Wife; an excellent kind creature, Jane thinks her. My American Colman in describing the population of Canadiagua spoke of one &#x201C;M&#x2019;Connel&#x201D; or &#x201C;O&#x2019;Connel,&#x201D; as a kind of questionable man,&#x2014;you will keep this in your mind, but of course <hi rend="italic">entirely</hi> secret; and look at your man with your own eyes, when there. Greig will be able to do you your Money-bill; he if there were even no other.&#x2014; Jamie is coming over,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle went to Liverpool, Sat., <date when="1843-06-24">24 June</date>, to see Alexander and his family off &#x201C;on sunday morning &#x2026; quite safely &#x26; in good spirits,&#x201D; returning to Annan, Tues. morning, <date when="1843-06-27">27 June</date> (John Carlyle to TC, <date when="1843-06-27">27 June</date>).</note> they tell me; which is a great comfort <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>John&#x2019;s second Letter of today has just come.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1843-06-21">21 June</date>, that Alick was to sail from Annan that evening and as he left Ecclefechan, &#x201C;Our mother &#x2026; stood through the parting like a true christian though she had cried bitterly when I first saw her early in the morning. Alick too behaved like a brave man, &#x26; seemed both last night &#x26; this morning to have all the energy &#x26; dispatch of his best days again. At least a third of the inhabitants of the village were collected at his door many of them crying as if he had been their own brother &#x2026; Alick has about eighty pounds to take with him &#x26; I suppose the whole journey will not cost more than forty pounds or so. He got your American&#x2019;s letters of introduction &#x26; information about the journey this morning but hardly had time to read them properly.&#x201D; John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1843-06-22">22 June</date>: &#x201C;Alick &#x26; all his family got off quite safely by the Victoria last night between seven &#x26; eight. Jamie returned with the gig about eleven. Our mother has slept well.&#x201D;</note> The first arrived at 11 o&#x2019;clock; tho&#x2019; I had been expecting the tidings, and had nothing else <pb id="pg-16-215" n="16:215"/>to expect, it fell upon my heart like a heavy stone!&#x2014; He says you bore your great sorrow with the firmness we have known in you, &#x201C;like a Christian and a brave woman.&#x201D; It is what I had to expect also,&#x2014;thank Heaven for it! You have had much to suffer, dear Mother, and are grown old in this valley of Tears; but you say always as all of us should say, &#x201C;Have we not many mercies too?&#x201D; Is there not above all, and in all, a <hi rend="italic">Father</hi> watching over us; thro&#x2019; whom all sorrows <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> yet work together for good?&#x2014; Yes, it is even so. Let us try to hold by that as an anchor both sure and steadfast.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 6:19.</note></p>
<p>What John says of Alick was highly affecting and consolatory to me. &#x201C;He had recovered all his old energy and manful activity&#x201D;:&#x2014;yes, poor fellow, by God&#x2019;s blessing he will yet recover all, and be himself again, in that new Home. I reflect always that it seems to be by far the best chance this world held out to him of that: where he <hi rend="italic">was</hi>, and as he was, there could no good be. He will rally himself for a new onslaught; the very solitude of his sea-voyage will do good to him: he will step into a new scene of activity, with added years and wisdom, and see that it says everywhere to him. &#x201C;As thou art wise in me, so shalt thou prosper!&#x201D; Even I, who am not much given to hope, have a real expectation that this will be the saving of our poor Alick. May God grant it. A brave man, and a true; but borne down, and torn away by this thing and by that, as I have hardly seen any man.</p>
<p>You may depend on it, dear Mother, it is, as compared with ours, a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Country he has gone to. There are friends there in very fact who will be ready to welcome him. Nay, as I say often, What good hope is there for a working industrious man anywhere if it be not in America, as times go with us? If the course of things here do not alter beyond my expectation, I think the whole kindred of us had better go and quit such a country as it will ere long be! You at the head of us,&#x2014;for you are a good sailor, and a brave Mother! Courage, my dear Mother; courage, the saddest-looking is sometimes the joyfullest when we see the real end of it! If Alick prosper in that new Country, he may be a real blessing to his whole kindred,&#x2014;and a double blessing to himself that will be.</p>
<p>I wrote to him today before dinner &#x201C;Post-Office Liverpool.&#x201D; It is a comfort to me that Jamie is going over. I hope to write him another word before the ship sail.</p>
<p>In a short time, dear Mother, I think I shall see you too. I long always <pb id="pg-16-216" n="16:216"/>to go and see you; and soon I shall probably be able,&#x2014;and if able, surely I should. More about this in a day or two.</p>
<p>At present and till tomorrow night late, I am the busiest mortal I ever before in my days was. I write all day and all night (till near mid-night),&#x2014;running against time, at a a<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> very useless &#x201C;Article&#x201D; which I had undertaken; which must be finished, being undertaken. I could have liked it better at another time! On saturday night, however, it has to go to press,&#x2014;the whole Review Number has to be <hi rend="italic">out</hi> on the first of <date when="1843-07-00">July</date>. I shall soon now have room to consider myself,&#x2014;with a sharp fight still in the interim, however!</p>
<p>It is now near tea; I have my scrawls of Manuscript to look over; and make ready for the &#x201C;three pages more&#x201D; before bed time. My sleep is good enough again. We are all well. A terrible quantity of Americans &#x26;c here! I have three or four Notes daily to answer beside my other writing.&#x2014; That Note for John<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably enclosed.</note> came this morning.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your kind invitation to Craven<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A district of striking landscape in the western dales, W Riding, Yorks. Forster lived in Bradford, also in W Riding.</note> is far too good to be rejected at once; nor do I so reject it; far from that. But I am in such an unutterable whirlpool of haste, confusion, and hard work at present, I can think of nothing extraneous whatever; and must beg to <hi rend="italic">postpone</hi> my answer till a freer time, which I hope will soon arrive<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster replied, <date when="1843-07-07">7 July</date>: &#x201C;Relying on your note of the 23<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, from which I gather that the pleasure of a visit from you is not altogether hopeless, I write to tell you that Mr &#x26; Mrs Charles Fox their daughter &#x26; myself purpose setting forth on a few days tour in Craven about the middle of next week. &#x2026; I do really hope you will be able to join us.&#x201D; Sarah (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>) and Charles Fox (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10023"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), scientific writer; Caroline Fox&#x2019;s uncle and currently partner in and manager of the family firm, the Perran Foundry Co., at Perranarworthal, Cornwall.</note>&#x2014; That is the meaning of my writing to you tonight,&#x2014;past the hour of midnight when all <hi rend="italic">canny</hi> things are in bed!&#x2014; Good sleep to both of us!</p>

<salute>My good darling</salute>
<p>You must not lose heart. Easy to say! but when it comes to <hi rend="italic">doing!</hi>&#x2014; Well&#x2014;no one knows better than I do the immense difference betwixt saying and doing; Still I am not ashamed to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> to you must not lose heart, because I really see good cause why you should not;&#x2014;setting aside all <hi rend="italic">moral obligation</hi> in the matter.</p>
<p>Amid all your present troubles, whatsoever they be, you have a ground of comfort which <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have not, which so many have not!&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">You are young</hi>&#x2014;very young&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">youth</hi> on one&#x2019;s side depend on it one has <hi rend="italic">the odds</hi> on one&#x2019;s side against the sorest trials. One may not <pb id="pg-16-218" n="16:218"/>feel this at the time&#x2014;nay, one may find the prospect of a long life to come only aggravation of one&#x2019;s suffering&#x2014; But in the long life to come lie so many glorious possibilities! And some fine morning, without knowing precisely how, one awakes to a recognition of these, and can smile over the despairing past as over a bad dream! I can only <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> at what ails you&#x2014; I may or may not be near the truth&#x2014;but of this I am, <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> as I live&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">whatever you</hi> are suffering&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> have suffered, and under more terrible conditions than can in your case be possible&#x2014; And see&#x2014;after all, I am here <hi rend="italic">alive</hi>, speaking <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to my Babbie! Not very <hi rend="italic">gay</hi> certainly&#x2014;not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">happy</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;who in a world like this, that has any more reflection than the Brutes can be what they call <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> at my age?&#x2014;but I am better than happy in having learned to <hi rend="italic">do without happiness</hi>&#x2014;and I have this knowledge to communicate to you, drawn from my own life-experience; that the heart even of <hi rend="italic">a woman</hi> can stand an infinite deal more breaking without being broken than one can form the smallest conception of at five and twenty. There is a beautiful proverb and it is as true as beautiful that &#x201C;the darkest hour of the night is nearest the dawn.&#x201D; So have I found it, and so will you too find it&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Wait</hi>, and hope for the dawn in patient faith&#x2014; There is no use in tormenting oneself into <hi rend="italic">got-up</hi> good spirits. That is, as it were, to light a parcel of farthing candles and call <hi rend="italic">that</hi> &#x201C;the dawn&#x201D;! a sort of beggarly brightness that serves only to make the darkness visible<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:63.</note> to show one how <hi rend="italic">very</hi> miserable one is!&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">wait</hi>&#x2014;Mazzini you remember did not like that word&#x2014;nevertheless it is a good word&#x2014;and one which if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had better appreciated he would not have lain under the reproach of having been turned back from revolutionizing Italy &#x201C;by a toll-bar&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s phrase (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440127-JWC-JW-01">JWC to JW, [<date when="1844-01-27">27 Jan. 1844</date>]</ref>), probably referring to the chaotic and unsuccessful invasion of Savoy, in Piedmont, <date when="1834-02-01">1</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-02-02">2 Feb. 1834</date>, which Mazzini helped to plan and during which he collapsed.</note> and under many other consequences sad to think of!

Oh <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is joy! such as one knew not of <hi rend="small-caps">before</hi> having suffered!&#x2014;when one feels oneself <hi rend="italic">awake&#x2014;alive</hi>&#x2014;no longer a gohst among the living and the loving&#x2014;but living and loving like a newborn creature, in a newborn world!&#x2014; My darling! if I had you here I could <hi rend="italic">make</hi> you believe that all will be well with you in good time I could <hi rend="italic">kiss</hi> the belief into you&#x2014;I am sure that I could!&#x2014; But the things that are in ones heart to say grow so cold on the <pb id="pg-16-219" n="16:219"/>paper!&#x2014; Well the practical inference from all that is, that we must speedily meet&#x2014; A lingering cold&#x2014;and castor oil are things to be put down by some vigorous measure without loss of time&#x2014; The continued coldness of the weather is keeping back the fruits of Carlyles numerous projects as well as &#x201C;the fruits of the season&#x201D;&#x2014;but if he do not decide on what is to be done thro the summer in the course of a week or two we (you &#x26; I) must get up a small seperate decision for ourselves.

<p>&#x2014;Tell my uncle that I know nothing whatever of Grace Welsh<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of JWC&#x2019;s three paternal aunts in Edinburgh.

Mr. Carlyle had a great regard for them &#x2026; . Grace, by much the youngest, a pretty and attractive woman, died soon after Mrs. Carlyle &#x2026; . The other two, Elizabeth and Ann, died within a few days of each other, and were buried together&#x201D; (David Davidson, <hi rend="italic">Memories of a Long Life</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>] 326).</note>&#x2014; God forgive me I had utterly forgotten her existence!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have been waiting all this while for some summer; but none comes. I determine therefore to come without much summer! My aim at present is for the beginning of next week; I have to pause at Clifton,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Julia Strachey. Her youngest son, George, quotes from JWC&#x2019;s letters to Julia (whereabouts now unknown) before the visit about &#x201C;the subject of his wants and habits. To the question,&#x2018;How was he to be made comfortable?&#x2019; Mrs. Carlyle replied that&#x2018;she had never been able to find out that, and could only say, as his own mother did, &#x201C;he&#x2019;s gey hard to deal with:&#x201D; &#x2019; he must smoke a long clay pipe after breakfast, and that not in the garden but in the house. And then a question&#x2014;poultry were to him <foreign><hi rend="italic">anathema maranatha</hi></foreign>&#x2014;had we any cocks or hens? No &#x2018;demon-fowls&#x2019; existed, and the tobacco problem received a similar solution&#x201D; (G. Strachey, <hi rend="italic">CRG</hi> 478&#x2013;79).</note> but it cannot be for long; neither can I linger as long as I once hoped in Glamorganshire: but I will come and see you and it, that is now fixed! Pray let me know by return of Post whether you are at home. If you say, Yes, my next Letter will probably bear the date of Clifton, and appoint our time of meeting at Cardiff.</p>

<p><salute>First of all, Dearest, what of Walter Macgregor?</salute> He has not dawned on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> horizon&#x2014;so I cannot believe him here&#x2014;but I should like to know whether he be coming at present&#x2014; Those pictures begin to torment my conscience&#x2014;they were finally consigned to me when I was driven from post to pillar betwixt <hi rend="italic">Mudieism</hi> and rheumatism&#x2014; You may think it required no great effort of kindness to get them packed and carry them to the rail-way station (for I absolutely durst not trust them to our monster of a carrier who flings boxes out of his cart on the street as if they were blocks of granite) but I assure you the effort required was under all the circumstances <hi rend="italic">so</hi> great as to be well nigh impossible&#x2014;then when I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have gone, a speculation had arisen of a box to be sent to Alick (my Brother in law at Liverpool) nay Carlyle spoke at one time of <hi rend="italic">making a run</hi> to Liverpool himself to bid Alick farewell&#x2014; And with my usual stupid turn for economy I thought your parcel might as well be sent by <hi rend="italic">that opportunity</hi>&#x2014; But Carlyle was so hunted here with printer&#x2019;s devils that not only the <hi rend="italic">run</hi> to Liverpool but the box to Liverpool remained a devout imagination&#x2014;and just when I had again made up my mind for a journey to Euston Square<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Euston railway station.</note> came your intimation that Walter might probably be here within two weeks&#x2014; If he be still coming, I may as well keep them for him&#x2014;having kept them so long&#x2014;but if not I will send them immediately under the care of Providence&#x2014; I wish Gambardella had <hi rend="italic">packed</hi> them himself&#x2014;I should then have cared less as to their manner of going&#x2014;</p>
<p>I do wish you were <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> one way or other&#x2014;I know no state which it is so difficult to lead a rational&#x2014;never to say a <hi rend="italic">contented</hi> life under as that state of hanging in the wind&#x2014; &#x2014;God knows <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have had enough of it in my time but even custom never reconciled me to it the least in <pb id="pg-16-223" n="16:223"/>the world&#x2014; Carlyle has finally determined on starting for Wales on Monday or Tuesday&#x2014; We have just been emptying the portmanteauful of books which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> packed<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During her visit in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>.</note>&#x2014;to replace them with the necessary clothes&#x2014;so I suppose he is <hi rend="italic">really</hi> in earnest this time&#x2014; He had no idea how long he will stay or whether he will come straight back or go round by&#x2014;Scotland! or the Moon!&#x2014; He &#x201C;hopes that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> will go <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi> during his absence&#x201D;&#x2014;and then the next minute agrees to the necessity of my staying to take charge of the house until at least I can find some safe person to put into it besides Helen&#x2014; Then half a minute after asks if I am not going down next week to the Isle of Wight?&#x2014; &#x2014;I have an invitation to go to John Sterling there&#x2014;and of course a most pressing invitation to Troston&#x2014; But the confounded house&#x2014;and the scattering in Liverpool confuse my mind beyond all power of scheming even.&#x2014; When <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is fairly out of the way&#x2014;and the ceilings whitened and the carpets beaten and <hi rend="italic">some</hi> painting done&#x2014;even if I should do it out of my own pin-money&#x2014;then I will <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to &#x201C;go somewhere&#x201D;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I shall not be lonely&#x2014;never fear for that&#x2014;I have always visitors enough and to spare&#x2014;when I am <hi rend="italic">single</hi>&#x2014;and when a domestic earthquake is going on there is no leisure for <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> lonely suppose no one came near me&#x2014; I hope to get the Mudies put into some sort of small line of business in a week or two&#x2014;thanks chiefly to the active exertions of Geraldine!&#x2014;and then I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> positively wash my hands of them&#x2014;for they take up far more of my time and thought than is at all reasonable&#x2014; I believe if I had sat down at once and written a <hi rend="italic">novel</hi> in three volumes&#x2014;and given them the procedes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> it would have been easier work for me than the writing of all the <hi rend="italic">letters</hi> I have had to write on their account. and all the talking and walking besides.</p>
<p>My head is aching very badly today&#x2014;so you must put up with a mere apology for a letter&#x2014; I have been rather ailing for some days from <hi rend="italic">natural causes</hi>, and made worse by the dreadful quantity of human speech I have had to transact with a scotch lady that has been on a two-days visit to me&#x2014;a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling <foreign>ci devant</foreign> Susan Hunter<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Susan Stirling, b.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I yesternight arrived here safe, and am bent now towards Llandough with all my industry. My intelligence about the Welsh Posts and conveyances is none of the best; but I find there is a Steamer for Cardiff daily, which seems to sail on Thursday at a convenient hour, and also that there will probably be time for this Letter to arrive at a due distance before it. For tomorrow (Wednesday) there would not, or there might not; else perhaps I should have preferred Wednesday.&#x2014; I decide accordingly to sail on Thursday morning, about 11 o&#x2019;clock (if that, as I dimly gather from the Newspaper Advertisement, do prove to be the hour): the time of our arrival at Cardiff, which is left to the Fates, you can yourself guess at. The Boat&#x2019;s name, I find by the <hi rend="italic">Bristol Mercury</hi>, is &#x201C;Prince of Wales.&#x201D; You were once hospitable enough to speak of meeting me at Cardiff: this of course would be a great pleasure; nevertheless I will not take you away from any engagement or business you may have; with or without your escort I shall get along; and hope to find myself under your roof at Llandough that same evening.</p>
<p>Today is wet; but in old trowsers and a water-proof blanket coat (<hi rend="italic">Tweed</hi> I think they call it) and other <hi rend="italic">un</hi>injurable apparatus, I mean to perambulate Bristol nevertheless: tomorrow, if there be nothing better, I think of sailing up to Chepstow to look at Harry Martin&#x2019;s Dungeon and the other notabilities in that quarter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Marten (<date when="1602-00-00">1602</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">80</date>), regicide; after the Restoration imprisoned for life, much of the time in Chepstow Castle, Monmouthshire; &#x201C;a tight little fellow, though of somewhat loose life&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 8:4).</note></p>
<p>The breath of new hay and green fields for so many hours has, in spite of much injury otherwise, done me good. I beg to be recommended very kindly to your good Mother, whose acquaintance I may hope to make before long.</p>

<salute>Dear Sister Jean,</salute>
<p>Accept from me the shortest Note you ever got in the world. I arrived here yesterday, on my way to Wales, to my Welsh Attorney, to rest for a week or two, and see what farther! Your Letter has followed me. I left Jane well: I am myself well, <hi rend="italic">except</hi> biliary fret and misery produced by the London whirlpool and too hard work there. I am staying at Mrs Stracheys. I go across a kind of frith into Wales, like crossing to Maryport,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >22 mi. across Solway Firth from Port Annan.</note> in a Steamer on Thursday morning: my address after that will be, &#x201C;Care of Charles Redwood Esq Llandough, <hi rend="italic">Cowbridge</hi>, S. Wales&#x201D;: but I will write to you from that. I design to see Scotland before I return to London.</p>
<p>This is a huge smoky City this Bristol,&#x2014;yet not above half the size of Liverpool, nor half the ugliness. The Country all round it, in a gentle <hi rend="italic">lukewarm Scotch Mist</hi> is of the greenest and beautifullest.</p>
<p>Thanks to my fair Panegyrist at Dumfries!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> She is very highflown, but I suppose not without a sincere heart in her way.&#x2014; I have been almost put to death with <hi rend="italic">Yankees</hi> buzzing round me in London, and feel a kind of blessedness in the fact that they <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get at me here.</p>
<p>Poor Alick, he will be bounding away over the far seas in these hours. God go with him. Jack has a new <hi rend="italic">article</hi> of mine,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dr. Francia.&#x201D;</note> or my Mother has, which I will bid them shew you.</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your Packet of Letters was handed in duly at breakfast; I send you back certain of them, to try if the contents will amuse you even a little. The young lady at Dumfries with her verses is very grand;&#x2014; evidently one of those who &#x201C;flatter me too much&#x201D;: I must carry my head under it if I can.</p>
<p>You will go, I think, with Sterling? If it promise to yield you a few <pb id="pg-16-228" n="16:228"/>days of recreation, go surely. The old Stimabile will be best out of the way as the young one suggests.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sterling had written JWC from Ventnor, <date when="1843-07-02">2 July</date>: &#x201C;On Tuesday I leave this for Falmouth whence I hope to return within a week. Then I shall go to London for a few days I hope to bring you back with me hither While Carlyle visits Wales &#x26; I hope meets rather with Shakspere&#x2019;s Fluellen than Gray&#x2019;s Bard. &#x2026; I think my Father will project to come here with you Prevent this.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Yesterday I got along successfully enough. I was landed at the Paddington Station half an hour before my time; got with some difficulty (from defect of Porters and excess of Passengers) my arrangements completed; set to reading in my first-class and indeed <hi rend="italic">first-rate</hi> vehicle, and whirled off so soon and so swiftly as the apparatus pleased. I had a side of the thing to myself; an insignificant well-mannered Cockney-tourist Mother and her little girl sitting opposite; the other <hi rend="italic">compartment</hi> of the vehicle (for it is of breadth to carry <hi rend="italic">four</hi> on each side, and is divided by a door with sliding window which can be shut or opened at pleasure) was occupied by a comfortable very stupid-looking man and wife with two units of offspring,&#x2014;the father bought the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> for his studies, and I noticed the Mother at one time pour herself out into a glass without foot a considerable dram of cognac: peace be with them,&#x2014;our side had shut the door before that. Our Weather was hot for more than half the way. Accoromboni (poor Holcroft being exhausted)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Tieck&#x2019;s novel <hi rend="italic">Vittoria Accorombona</hi> and a pamphlet presumably by Thomas Holcroft (d. <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:50</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>); see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430708-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1843-07-08">8 July</date></ref>.</note> was ready whenever we got into the bottom of <hi rend="italic">cuts;</hi> atop again I preferred looking out into the blessed ocean of green, with human figures making hay: &#x201C;I feel the gales that from you blow&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> At Reading I scanned the wrecks of the old Abbey, nearly hidden now by a gorgeous Poor-Law Bastille;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The ruins of a magnificent Benedictine abbey, founded <date when="1121-00-00">1121</date> by Henry I, nr. which was a workhouse.</note> I looked out for the duel island of Henry of Essex;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry de Essex, hereditary standard-bearer of England, was accused of treason by Robert de Montfort, who offered to prove his accusation by combat.

But on the other hand the country grew ever rockier without losing of its greenness;&#x2014;really beautiful to look at. Bath built of white stone, in trim streets, enclosed amid gnarled beautifully green and feathered hills, looked altogether princely, after these poor brick towns,&#x2014;like an <pb id="pg-16-229" n="16:229"/>ancient <hi rend="italic">decayed</hi> Prince, for it was smoke-soiled, dingy and lonely-looking; yet in the chimney-tops and gables, of a certain polite fantasticality, and all ranked in straight short streets, which ran in every direction on every variety of level, as if they had all been <hi rend="italic">marching</hi> and drilling in that rough hollow place, each in the road that suited him best,&#x2014;there was something in all this that reminded one of Beau Nash and Smollett&#x2019;s Lady of Quality.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richard (Beau) Nash (<date when="1674-00-00">1674</date>&#x2013;<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>) established the Assembly Rooms and a code of etiquette and dress at Bath.

<p>It was not till after five that I got dragged thro&#x2019; the muddy narrow streets of Bristol, and landed (by the aid of a Porter ultimately) at No 2 here. My welcome was of the kindest; but how much simpler would Accoromboni by itself have been for the evening!

The air in spite of all things has done me real good.</p>
<p>I have written to my Welshman that I will meet him at Cardiff on Thursday. The Boat sails at 11,&#x2014;so there will still be time for Letters from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>The first night is over and we are neither robbed nor murdered. I must confess, however, that I observed last night, for the first time, with what tremendous facility a thief&#x2014;with the average thief-agility&#x2014; might swing himself, by laying hold of the spout, off the garden wall right into my dressing closet!&#x2014;leaving me no time to spring my rattle or even unsheath my dagger&#x2014; I must have Pearson to put some screw in the window when he comes tomorrow&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute>
<p>I have been at Chepstow; in all kinds of weather, in rain, in glowing heat, and then home thro&#x2019; the heart of thunderstorms: I am totally waried; and have just got up to my sleeping place, which seems tolerably quiet: I must not spend above a minute or two in <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>. But tomorrow at 11 o&#x2019;clock, I have to be on board the Cardiff steamer; there will not then be any Letter for perhaps two days,&#x2014;as, I believe, a day is <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> somewhere between Wales and this by all Letters: take my kind goodnight therefore dear Goody, and thanks for the punctual most welcome despatch which I found lying on my table on returning today. You are very good. Write always. Write to the new address: &#x201C;Cha<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Redwood Esq, Llandough Cowbridge S. Wales&#x201D;; except thro&#x2019; your Letters I am at present disunited with all the Earth.</p>
<p>Chepstow is beautiful; the rocks of the Avon at Clifton on the road thither by steam excel all things I have seen,&#x2014;even I the most determined <pb id="pg-16-234" n="16:234"/><hi rend="italic">Anti</hi>-viewhunter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Characteristics,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:24, and Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 151&#x2013;52.</note> find them worthy of a word. I have passed the day perhaps not ill,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; in laborious idleness: who knows? Yesternight we had a <foreign>soiree</foreign> at Mrs Hare&#x2019;s: one or two intelligent persons; the Doctor Symons, a hectic clergyman, a Mr Frippe (I think) very deep in business, all decided Carlyleans&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott</foreign>. There was also a tremendous artist-fiddler and piano-player, and certain pretty young women sat speechless.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Strachey has described TC&#x2019;s talk with the clergyman (probably one of the many Fripps in the Bristol area): &#x201C;Although Carlyle was devoid of the aesthetic sensibilities, he was taken to a party at the house of my married sister, where despite his recorded contempt for the portion of mankind that listened to Paganini, he attended with propriety to some solos executed by that great violinist H. C. Cooper. During the pause for supper, the hero of the evening was button-holed by a local clerical magnate, whose attitude towards the new philosophy, if not that of a proselyte of righteousness, was that of a proselyte of the gate. They got into a warm controversy on matters of faith, and when Carlyle said,&#x2018;If a man&#x2019;s maker bid him go to the bottomless pit, he should go,&#x2019; the clergyman asked,&#x2018;What do you mean by the bottomless pit?&#x2019; The answer was:&#x2018;Sir, I mean the pit of love and despair; and now, sir, we will go back to the fiddlers.&#x2019; Saying which Carlyle triumphantly returned to the drawing-room&#x201D; (G. Strachey, <hi rend="italic">CRG</hi> 400). The violinist was Henry Christopher Cooper (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>).</note></p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>The Post goes tomorrow at nine o&#x2019;clock; wherefore tho&#x2019; very tired I will write thee a word: it will have to lie at Bristol all day, and you will not get it till Saturday morning, as I find, at any rate. A brief word must suffice.</p>
<p>Your precious little billet came to me at breakfast,&#x2014;for breakfast did at last come, tho&#x2019; my patience was well nigh worn out waiting for it in vain. A pencil stroke on the cover would indicate the fact, according to agreement.</p>
<p>I got down in good time to my Cardiff Steamer; a brisk breezy morning promising well: and again after endless ringing of bells and loading of hampers, and bullying and jumbling, in which I took part only as a distant onlooker, we got off down the muddy Avon once more. I passed a most silent day, remembrances of all kinds and these only my occupation. On the Somersetshire shore we passed a bathing-establishment; hapless Mothers of families sitting on folding-stools by the beach of muddy tide-streams,&#x2014;<foreign>ach Gott!</foreign> It is a solitary Sea the Severn one;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bristol is approx. 8 mi. inland from the Bristol Channel, and is linked to it by the Avon, a tributary of the Severn.</note> we passed near only one ship, and in that there lay a cabin boy sound asleep amid ropes, and a black-visaged sailor had raised his shock-head only half a-wake, thro&#x2019; the hatches, to see what we were: they lay there waiting for a wind. I smoked 2 cigars and a half; I hummed all manner of tunes, sang even portions of Psalms in a humming tone for my own behoof, reclining on my elbow; and so the day wore on, and at three o&#x2019;clock we got into Cardiff Dock; and I, sharp on the outlook, descried the good Redwood waiting there. He had a <hi rend="italic">tub-gig</hi>, a most indescribable thin-bodied semi-articulate but altogether helpful kind of factotum man-servant, who stept on board for my luggage, and so in few minutes, after giving a glance at Cardiff Castle,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dating from <date when="1080-00-00">1080</date>.</note> and buying a few cigars, we got eagerly to the road, and not long after five, had done our twelve miles and were safe here. It was the beautifullest day; a green pleasant country full of shrubby knolls and white thatched cottages: altogether a very reasonable drive. Unexpectedly in a totally solitary spot I was bidden dismount, and looking to the right, saw close by the Redwood Mansion. A house about the <pb id="pg-16-236" n="16:236"/>capacity of Craigenputtoch tho&#x2019; in Welsh Style, all trim-shaven, covered with roses, hedged off from the Parish-road by invisible fences and a pa<supplied>[t]</supplied>ch<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of very pretty lawn. The old Lady an innocent native old Quakeress<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Redwood.</note> received me with much kind simplicity, asked for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> &#x26;c: our dinner which she had carefully cooked, and kept hot for an hour and a half consisted&#x2014;of <hi rend="small-caps">veal</hi>!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Which TC found indigestible.</note> Nay I heard of a veal-pie for future use; I suppose they have killed a fatted calf for me, knowing my tastes! There was good <hi rend="italic">ham</hi> and a dish of good boiled peas and a pudding: I did very well. And then we have been to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> since; and the place on the whole is the loveliest and most <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> in all the Earth, and I think I shall learn to do very well. But here in the meanwhile are tidings of a <hi rend="italic">dish of hot milk:</hi> I must off, dearest, with brief salutations. Perhaps I shall again find time tomorrow for a word. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, adieu!</foreign>&#x2014; Sleep well, and dream of me. /</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>

<p>I am come away out of the region of the Crawfords; and my Bishop is still some sixty miles inland: I know not whether I shall get to either, nor indeed what my capabilities yet are.

<p>Has that accursed Chimera of a Cockney not sent the umbrella yet?

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There is or lately was a Thomas Carlyle, once an Advocate in Edinburgh, but who quitted that profession for some form of religious Fanaticism (&#x201C;Irvingism&#x201D; is the name of it); who preaches accordingly, as an &#x201C;Angel&#x201D; so-called, at Albury in Surrey, under the wing of Henry Drummond the rich Banker, a Patron of that sect, and perhaps an &#x201C;Archangel&#x201D; in it. This Thomas Carlyle, besides his Angel-work at Albury, goes now and then to Germany, as I have understood, and specially to Berlin, for the purpose of converting your benighted people to his Doctrine; with what success I cannot conjecture. He is the man, I imagine, who must have written this Book on the German Nobility; and thought it so profound as to deserve the King of Prussia&#x2019;s perusal!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bunsen wrote to TC, <date when="1843-07-04">4 July</date>: &#x201C;I am asked: who is Mr Thomas Carlyle, who lately being in Berlin sent to His Majesty a Memoir intitled:/On the position &#x26; prospects of the German nobility,/ and then returned to England &#x26; Scotland by Hamburg? Now I never knew there existed a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> of yourself, and I know that you have not been at Berlin. &#x2026; Perhaps you can say something to explain this mysterious circumstance.&#x201D; As an apostle of the Catholic Apostolic Church, Carlyle (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:160</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1833-08-30">30 Aug. 1833</date></corr></ref>) became known as &#x201C;The Apostle for North Germany,&#x201D; with Prussia and N Germany as his special province. He often resided in Germany, where he superintended congregations of converts. Within the next few years he came to know Bunsen, who introduced him to King Frederick William IV.</note> <pb id="pg-16-238" n="16:238"/>Another friend<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430705-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-05">5 July</date>]</ref>.</note> was already inquiring of me on the same subject; to whom I made answer that I never wrote, or designed to write, or had heard even in dreams of the writing of such a Book;&#x2014;and this, all except the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> clause of it, may stand for a response in the present case too.</p>
<p>T. Carlyle the Angel has more than once got me into scrapes of a similar kind. He is, I believe, a zealous, very well-intentioned man; but narrow, headlong, dim, and probably not without a dash of the [word illegible]&#x2014;he is an &#x201C;Angel&#x201D; at Albury, in short; and I am no Angel anywhere! There is in fact nothing common to us but the Name, and general descent from Adam. Me, I have heard, he considers to be a man of some ability, but &#x201C;possessed with <hi rend="italic">a Devil</hi>&#x201D;: I shall very specially request of you to assure all persons high and low who may inquire of you, that we have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no</hi> concern with the other house&#x201D;.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trade statement, disclaiming connection with another firm.</note></p>
<p>It was yesterday that I arrived here: a most solitary green region, very rainy too at present;&#x2014;in which I feel hitherto very much like a man fallen out of the Moon. The people speak inarticulate Welsh or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kauderw&#xE4;lsch</hi></foreign> [gibberish], and they, and the whole world, except the rain-clouds, seems to be asleep or nearly so. I have Tieck&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Vittoria Accorombona</hi>, and care for no weather today!</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many kind regards and wishes / Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You would find by the hurried word I wrote in the cover of Holcroft&#x2019;s Pamphlet whither I was bound on Thursday morning. We set off at the due hour towards Cardiff by a tract of sea which, I think, is partly known to you: the day was windy, but dry and moderately pleasant; so after an insignificant voyage of four hours we got safe into Cardiff harbour; and there I found my good Attorney in waiting, with a rough &#x201C;tub-gig,&#x201D; and one of the strangest old grey Welsh servants I ever saw,&#x2014;a melancholy semi-articulate man, not entirely unlike &#x201C;Cutty Wright&#x201D; the Tailor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably of Annandale.</note> changed into a mixture of ploughman and servant in grey livery: this artist whirled us along in our tub at a moderate rate over the twelve miles to Cowbridge, a village seemingly comparable to Lockerby,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About 13 mi. NE of Dumfries.</note> but of which I saw only the end, for we there turned off by a narrow preciptious country road, or track between two hedges, and did the other mile and half to Llandough without passing thro&#x2019; the Cowbridge concern. A modest trim house, of about the capacity of a Minister&#x2019;s Manse, stood suddenly disclosed with roses and a little shaven lawn in front, in a pot amid little bushy hills of which the whole country seems to consist: this was Redwoods house; there did his old Mother in black Quaker bonnet and grey gown, an innocent simple old woman who seems to spend her whole day in reading the New Testament, receive us,&#x2014;and instantly produce dinner, &#x201C;which had been waiting for near two hours.&#x201D; As it consisted solely of <hi rend="italic">roast veal</hi>, it might as well have <hi rend="italic">continued</hi> waiting, for my share of it!&#x2014; The village <pb id="pg-16-247" n="16:247"/>of Llandough, if village it may be called which is hardly half the size of Middlebie,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Small village ca. 15 mi. E of Dumfries.</note> and the stillest place I ever saw in my life inhabited by man, lies on the other side of the hillock behind Redwood&#x2019;s house, and was hardly visible, except some chimney-tops if they happened to be pointed out.</p>
<p>I have now been here two nights; but have not yet recovered my clearness of discrimination, so strange is all to me, so still and dream-like;&#x2014;add to which that I have slept but indifferently, and only today for the first time have begun to look about me with some composure, in a silent state. Besides it has rained almost incessantly, or at least in successions of lengthy showers. This morning I have sat, till it is now one o&#x2019;clock, reading a Novel of Tieck&#x2019;s in the porch of the house, the rain falling round me, but all silent otherwise without and within;&#x2014;a truly <foreign><hi rend="italic">M&#xE4;hrchenhaft</hi></foreign> [fairy story] kind of outlook and position. The people of the house seem to have intercourse with absolutely nobody: they are as <hi rend="italic">good</hi> as possible; considerably inclined to the <hi rend="italic">wearisome</hi>, but have decided to leave me much in silence, which is all I want. The rain has ceased for the present, but will begin again soon. I have a horse standing ready, if I like to venture out; but I hardly shall, preferring Tieck and Nothingness in these circumstances. Redwood is over at his office in Cowbridge till 4 o&#x2019;clock, which is the dinner-hour; I gave him to know yesterday that I had pressing need of silence: he, the hospitablest of men, requires only to know what it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that I want. He took me yesterday to the shore at St Donat&#x2019;s, some four or five miles off, thro&#x2019; indescribably rough country road-tracks: there we found a drab-coloured sea, moaning hoarsely towards high limestone cliffs over endless expanses of smooth lime-stone boulders, no sand discoverable, a place <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> adapted for bathing, unless you either plunged out into the deep water and swam, or sat down (as I did) at knee-depth, and <hi rend="italic">let</hi> the waves break over you and bathe you. St Donat&#x2019;s is a small sleepy village like the others, with a strange old Castle, now patched into a farm establishment; the village lies sprinkled about in a kind of <hi rend="italic">gill</hi> or hollow green chasm; very poor, very lazy, all over with odd pebbles, broken cart-shafts and unswept litter; dead-<hi rend="italic">asleep</hi>, you would say, as I think all the hamlets here are. Over the water we looked thro&#x2019; the scudding showers to your old region of Linton and Ilfracombe<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lynton and Ilfracombe are small towns on the N coast of Devon (across the Bristol Channel from St. Donat&#x2019;s) which John Carlyle had visited with William Ogilby; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401029-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:307</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-10-29">29 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> a pleasant outlook: something like the Lothians from Fife: the distinct localities, specific names of hills &#x26;c, no mortal on this coast <pb id="pg-16-248" n="16:248"/>seems to know. We are all a limestone country, all a <hi rend="italic">somnolent</hi> country:&#x2014;and I begin to ask myself, without yet answering distinctly, How I am to get out of it best! Unless I could learn to sleep in it too?</p>
<p>Bishop Thirlwall asks me towards Carmarthen to see him there: this my present host will not hear of till we have been &#x201C;up three days among the hills,&#x201D; about Merthyr Tidvill<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carmarthen, a river port, SW Wales. Merthyr Tydifil, the center of iron manufacture, 22 mi. N of Cardiff.</note> I suppose. Thirlwall, however, I have a notion to go and see. He is some sixty miles off this; in the direct course towards Aberystwith:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aberystwyth, coastal town, W Wales.</note> if I could calculate on getting a Coach to Aberystwith and then a steamer from that to Liverpool, I should at once fix on that as the route. But nobody can tell me precisely here: I think however, that is my likeliest way. Failing that, I do discover that there is a steamer from Swansea to Liverpool: I can turn back from Carmarthen and embark at Swansea as a <foreign><hi rend="italic">pis aller</hi></foreign> [last resort],&#x2014;or <foreign><hi rend="italic">mieux aller</hi></foreign> [better way]: land-route to Liverpool I think there is not any without going back to Bristol and beginning there.&#x2014; Well, dear Brother, this is all I can say at present till I have learned farther. Thirlwall cannot receive me till after the eleventh, and with him I may stop perhaps a couple of days: then for Aberystwith or for Swansea,&#x2014;for Liverpool by some route or other! I could like right well to meet you somewhere, at Aberystwith, in Anglesey,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Island off N Wales where John had also stayed with Ogilby; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18401016-TC-JCA-01"><sic>12:289</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1840-10-16">16 Oct. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> in Liverpool at farthest. But how can I <hi rend="italic">bid</hi> you travel?

I shall be here till your Letter come; in any case, it would be forwarded. If Redwood can learn nothing about Aberystwith for me, I think of writing to Alick Welsh at Liverpool. I have brought <hi rend="italic">your</hi> portmanteau with me, shifting the Books into a trunk as I have no drawers allowed me here (so oblivious the good old Quakeress!) I find it a great convenience. The Coat you gave me (&#x201C;Tweed&#x201D; so-called) is a kind of factotum to me, beyond price in these climates! I brought a quite <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> new one, made to measure, for wearing in hot bright weather: but there is no need of that yet.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>It is Saturday night, getting late; and tho&#x2019; there is nothing very new to be said, I cannot rightly rest till I have written down that nothing and told there how it goes with me.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today have been showery, unfavourable for excursions or making acquaintance with a new country; neither have I slept well, or till today got anything but <hi rend="italic">veal to dine on:</hi> nevertheless I get along tolerably well, and shall make out my visit, I think, in a reasonable manner. There is a horse to ride, there is Accorombona to read; I have tobacco, and the people do let me pretty well alone. The simple <hi rend="italic">inanity</hi> of my kind friends and environment does not diminish, increases rather; but they are very kind to me, very quiet with me: the whole country is of a totally <hi rend="italic">somnolent</hi> nature, not ill fitted for a man that has come out to see if he can find any sleep!</p>
<p>Yesterday, the breezy morning soon settled down into dim showers of rain: Redwood, at his fixed hour (for he goes like an eightday clock) returned duly from his office at Cowbridge, and took me off to the St Donat&#x2019;s shores for a bathe, and dinner in his lodging at that village. He had a most lively cantering pony for me: he seems to keep a kind of farm, and has several horses and non-descript serving men not a few. Our road was an inextricable series of lanes, with which the whole country seems to be covered; some two yards wide, of precipitous steepness and the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> macadamization I ever experienced in this Planet. My brave pony however did not stumble at all; nay seem<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> entirely indifferent to road, and gallops much at its ease over mere stone-heaps mud-gullies or wherever the direction may be. We passed thro&#x2019; several hamlets, all littery, unswept, bestrewn with chance stones <pb id="pg-16-250" n="16:250"/>and pieces of old carts; yet whitened, slated on the <hi rend="italic">ends</hi>, or well thatched&#x2014;an air of picturesqueness and sluttish beauty about them; <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> and sleep their chief feature. Old castles were not wanting; all grown with ivy, patched sometimes into a kind of farm houses; the people, tho&#x2019; there were many houses, did not appear anywhere: perhaps they were asleep. Devonshire hills lay across the sea, somewhat as Lothian does from Fife. The sea itself when we arrived at it was moaning hoarse, loud and far, over an endless <hi rend="italic">cairn</hi> of big boulder stones, without a bit of sand or flat ground visible anywhere: a baddish outlook for bathing, unless you meant to play the Leander there!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leander swam the Hellespont to meet Hero, his beloved.</note> I did step cautiously in, however; then knelt and the big wave, of a respectable drab-colour swashed satisfactorily over me, and again over me (filling my very mouth that second time), whereupon I withdrew. My clothes were in a cavern screened from the rain; there, after dressing, I sat perfectly dry, and smoked a cigar not without comfort. One ship was visible in the distance, making out for Ilfracombe or God knows whither; living creature or trace of living creature was none: one of the loneliest wast<supplied>[e]</supplied>s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> in all her Majesty&#x2019;s dominions. Thro&#x2019; rain we picked our way up again over the cliffs; got into R&#x2019;s lodgings and found spread out for dinner&#x2014;the prophecied <hi rend="italic">veal-pie</hi> and nothing more! I ate some of it, under spoken protest, and drank three glasses of excellent wine. This and the gallop home again jumbled me considerably; and today I have had to go upon diet, pill-box and teetotalism. No more veal will be presented me here.</p>
<p>Today, being well let alone, I sat down in the Porch with Accorombona, read most pleasantly at two feet distance from the rain, till near two o&#x2019;clock, when I became terribly impatient for the Postman and Letters from Goody. The Postman came; but the Letters from Goody&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ay de mi!</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01"><sic>6:241</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> Well, I said, it might have been worse: <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> news might have come! I took a walk over the height in front of us, in the interval of showers: beautiful green country, rising up northward into insignificant hills, all a cluster of limestone knolls near us, many of them feathered with trees on the top, and a rim of rich meadow always at the base. <hi rend="italic">Llans</hi> (that is <hi rend="italic">churches</hi>)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Llan</hi> could also mean an enclosure or village.</note> without number rise all round: I have been in the inside of this at Llandough; Troston is a Cathedral to it. But the outlook from the door itself there as I sit in the Porch and read; nothing can suit me better: A steep hill covered with wood rises within few yards, and at a gunshot to the left another ditto ditto: these <pb id="pg-16-251" n="16:251"/>two hills and the bit of meadow between them and the bit of sky over them are all of Nature or of Art that you have anything to do with there. Nay a <hi rend="italic">road</hi> goes between you and the near hill, but it is so deep that you merely see the <hi rend="italic">hats</hi> of the people (when any pass) over R&#x2019;s small lawn, and then the people themselves appear farther up on the hill as if they had mounted like exhalations out of invisibility: very queer looking bodies many of them, especially the bits of women. Today and yesterday I heard a low sound, unlike any other in the whole world; a kind of murmur as of a Psalm-tune sung placidly thro&#x2019;&#x2014; Good Heavens!&#x2014;thro&#x2019; a part of the body never elsewhere employed in that service! My amazement was great: but today I discovered the perpetrator: a poor ideot, it seems, son of the late Parson here. He looked very happy; and his fundamental base<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A pun, on &#x201C;fundament&#x201D; (lower part of the body) and &#x201C;bass&#x201D; (deep singing voice); that is, the person was singing the psalm employing an unusual part of the body.</note> is a not inharmonious feature of our scenery here!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But enough, O Heavens enough! I ought to tell you what my plans and outlooks are, if any. Thirlwall I do design to visit, if I can; but R. will not hear of it till I try this place a week or so. I must write to his R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Reverence, at least; tomorrow, I suppose. To Bunsen I write by this post.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430707-TC-CKJB-01">TC to CKJB, <date when="1843-07-07">7 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; There will be no way for Liverpool, except by Steam from Swansea near this: or better from Aberystwith (if there <hi rend="italic">be</hi> any steam there), which would take in Carmarthen and the Bishop very neatly by the way.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>A few days ago I escaped hither, and am got into sea-bathing and rambling in this solitary region; tending, more or less slowly, towards Liverpool the while. Of course Craven for this time is out of the question.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430623-TC-WEF-01">TC to WEF, <date when="1843-06-23">23 June</date></ref>.

If any likelihood of meeting you in any point of your orbit do present itself, I will not fail to write and investigate.</p>

<salute>Dear Bishop Thirlwall,</salute>
<p>You are very kind to invite me to your house: your house, Bishop&#x2019;s-palace or whatever the name and nature of it be, is a place I think I might contrive to feel at home in: accordingly I do mean to try, if the Destinies and Possibilities will be so kind to me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thirlwall had written to Milnes, <date when="1843-07-03">3 July</date>, anticipating TC&#x2019;s acceptance: &#x201C;I have very little doubt that the people here &#x2026; will believe Carlyle to be the celebrated atheist [Richard Carlile (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-02-10">10 Feb. 1843</date>); see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191111-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:206</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1819-11-11">11 Nov. 1819</date></corr></ref>], an opinion which he will probably confirm by his demeanour. Could you contrive to get Spedding to join him?&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:302).</note></p>
<p>Till some days after the 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi> I am as good as fixed here, or on the neighbouring coast of St Donat&#x2019;s, the total solitude of which is greatly to my mind at present. My aim, after that, is towards Liverpool. If there be a mail coach from Carmarthen to Aberystwith, and then a Steamer to the Mersey,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liverpool is on the river Mersey.</note> that would be my route, and you lie precisely on it. Perhaps you can enlighten me as to some of these points? For the Aberystwith Steamer I have written to inquire at Liverpool itself; <pb id="pg-16-253" n="16:253"/>the question of the Mail is probably soluble at Carmarthen. Nobody here has ever turned his thoughts in that direction.&#x2014; Failing everything I know there is a Liverpool Steamer at Swansea; and it were but turning back from the Bishop&#x2019;s House a score of miles to get securely into that:&#x2014;an audacity I feel almost equal to, if the times and other circumstances will agree.</p>
<p>Pray inform me a little how you are as to engagements about the end of this week and beginning of next;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sun.</note> and when I could best intercalate two days of myself into your leisure. I will do it if I can.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I sat today on a board stool among trees at the end of the house on an elevated level, reading <hi rend="italic">Accorombond</hi> vol 2 (a dreadful piece of work on Tieck&#x2019;s part!)&#x2014;smoking at due intervals, and looking out into my silent bits of wood and meadow, under the grey lukewarm sky: one of the stillest Sunday mornings I ever spent or figured. The public road, within few yards of distance, was altogether hidden, cut into the side of the the rising ground, so that I merely <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> Welsh voices, at times, and then all again grew still as Hades. Redwood was at his office: <foreign>ach Himmel</foreign> [O Heaven], he returned at 2 o&#x2019;clock; set me on horseback, galloped me over precipitous roads, bathed me in stony seas, made me drink two glasses of champagne (it being Sunday), in short, bored me, the good man, till I had enough of it and more! No tea is procurable till near <hi rend="italic">five</hi> hours after dinner here. Tea done, I have fled up stairs to a kind of closet nearly insupportable with <hi rend="italic">back-smoke</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smoke in the room caused by a badly drawing chimney.</note> and have there written Letters to all people ever since! To Thirlwall (half accepting),&#x2014;to Richardson, to Nickisson with the sonnet, to Bradford Forster,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably David Lester Richardson (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23550"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371219-TC-DLR-01"><sic>9:372</sic><corr>TC to DLR, <date when="1837-12-19">19 Dec. 1837</date></corr></ref>), who was in London on a visit from India and had written a note, <date when="1843-06-24">24 June</date>, to say that he would call on the Carlyles, Mon., <date when="1843-06-26">26 June</date>. George William Nickisson, publisher and ed. of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine;</hi> see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18411016-TC-JAC-01"><sic>13:282</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-10-16">16 Oct. 1841</date></corr></ref>. W. E. Forster, of Bradford.</note>&#x2014;and now to my own Goody. Blessings on her: the big Letter <pb id="pg-16-254" n="16:254"/>which Redwood brought me today was a cheap price for all his dulness afterwards: it is the blithest thing I have seen since I came hither. A thousand thanks to thee! The sealed Letter inclosed (why did not you open it?) was an invitation<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1843-07-07">7 July</date>.</note> to dine with the Chevalier and Madame Bunsen for Saturday, including John if he were present!</p>
<p>The infatuated R. kindest and most wearisome of men, insists on making me quite happy tomorrow; and so will have me down to St. Donat&#x2019;s and spend the whole day upon the coast: what an outlook! He has three days more of riding among the mountains; he is a curious man. A kind of Henry Taylor without the genius! Solemn mouthing and emphasis in speech; regularity as of machinery in meal-times, shower-bathings &#x26;c, diligent land-practice with plenty of cash, and seemingly total isolation from all men; a curious character;&#x2014;most worthy, most courteous, kind and good, were he not such a <hi rend="italic">terrible</hi> bore! I will stand him as long as I can; till towards the end of this week at least. The lodging at St. Donat&#x2019;s will not do: clay floors, desolation, savagery, neither market nor post,&#x2014;and not even independent after all; for I do not see how R. could be quitted in that way without cutting him to the heart. Let us be quiet, then; let us learn to stand boring too: a man cannot have blessed green fields, kind welcome and board and lodging for nothing!&#x2014; Enough of all that.</p>

<p>Worse, far worse, what is this I hear about your sleeping! Are you going to get into your old watchful state again? I pray you despatch those pumice stones about their business if they tend that way. We cannot have houses painted, at the expense of Goodies!&#x2014; I do entreat thee, endeavour to sleep. And do not say endeavouring will do nothing. Endeavouring will do much, <hi rend="italic">if you begin it far enough off</hi>.

<p>John talks of coming on to London, as you see. We could put him into the house. But I suppose he and I will meet at Liverpool first.</p>
<p>Poor Mazzini! He ought really to go to Switzerland, or into Wales, or somewhere altogether <hi rend="italic">lose</hi> himself for a space of twelve months.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You had a small Note from me at Bristol, announcing my journey hitherward, and promising you a fuller detail so soon as I should arrive here. On Thursday morning, as appointed, I left Bristol in a Cardiff Steamer; nearly half full of cabbages, carrot-hampers and other vegetable stores superintended by little busy angry-looking Welshwomen in men&#x2019;s hats: what could be the meaning of exporting cabbages <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Bristol, the Liverpool of the South? I ascertained that they were all for Merthyr Tydvill, a huge iron work in this side of the world, and that it was a regular trade these Welshes had established for themselves. Poor little bodies&#x2014; After four hours sailing, first down the Avon river, a most muddy stream enclosed in high precipitous banks of limestone mountain for a part of the way; and then across the Severn Sea, Bristol Channel or whatever they call it (as from Arbigland over to Workington,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., across Solway Firth.</note> only muddier a little, and with far <hi rend="italic">blunter</hi> hills on each side),&#x2014; we got into Cardiff harbour, as I was finishing my last cigar, all safe, about three in the afternoon. My Welshman was in waiting, the hospitable man. An ancient lean very queer-looking Welsh servant jumped <pb id="pg-16-256" n="16:256"/>on board for my luggage, a venerable <hi rend="italic">tub-gig</hi> and able horse were standing near; we all jumped in, and rolled off thro&#x2019; Cardiff, a flat stupid-looking town half the size of Dumfries,&#x2014;forward twelve miles westward to Cowbridge, a place not unlike Lockerby, only cleaner and airier-looking among the green knolls; and then, turning off abruptly to the South for about a mile thro&#x2019; green woody knolls with spaces of fat meadow intervening, we finally arrived here at this clean-trimmed, lonely establishment,&#x2014;standing on the slope of just such a meadow as the others are, with two woody knolls rising near in front, and the one in the rear looking into our very chimney-pots, the feeblest <foreign><hi rend="italic">clachan</hi></foreign> in the world (<hi rend="italic">Llandough</hi> by name) just showing its poor gable-ends over another part of the same height, two fields farther to the left. An ancient <foreign>douce</foreign>-looking Quakeress, the Mother Redwood received us, with great kindness,&#x2014;and a gentle statement that the dinner was somewhat injured by waiting. As the dinner consisted of <hi rend="italic">veal</hi>, which I never eat of, this was a small matter! Here in this loneliest of all civilized establishments, I have been ever since; not ill off at all; enjoying the profound silence and <foreign><hi rend="italic">soughing</hi></foreign> of the winds considerably; contented even with the wet weather when we have it, for I sit there in the porch and read, not without due tobacco-pipes, and look out into the rain, and green bit of meadow and rustling woods. The people, Redwood and his good Mother, are not witches for wit;&#x2014;but they let me pretty well alone, and are heartily kind to me.
The good man has horses; on which we have ridden twice to the sea, five or six miles off,&#x2014;thro&#x2019; truly awful roads, for they are steep as <foreign><hi rend="italic">scaurs</hi></foreign> [precipices], about a yard and a half broad, all made of rough limestone <hi rend="italic">cobbles</hi> as slippery as polished iron, and rough of level, as if no spade or pick had ever been used upon them: down and up these the little fiery quadrupeds take the greatest delight to <hi rend="italic">gallop</hi> as if that were the only conceivable pace for a horse of <hi rend="italic">speeret!</hi> The shore itself is greatly lonelier than Priestside,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Priestside Bank, a shoal N of Solway Firth, 3 mi. S of Annan.</note> but far beautifuller too: high limestone cliffs broken sheer down, then a wilderness of sleek big boulder-stones (all lime too), from a hundred weight to half-a-ton each, tumbled together like a pavement of disorderly giants; and farther out, the great hoarse Sea moaning, and singing &#x201C;Alone, alone!&#x201D; on this hand and on that. The first day, showers were ruffling it, and one ship was visible: I sat smoking a cigar in a cave where I had dressed after bathing; dry amid heavy rain: living sight or sound was none other. Across the Channel you see Devonshire piled up, heavy and blunt-looking, but of considerable height: it is &#x201C;the English hills&#x201D;; nobody knows or cares about it <pb id="pg-16-257" n="16:257"/>farther.&#x2014; Old ruined castles all grown with ivy are abundant; and straggling most disorderly little villages, whitewashed but sluttish, all hanging by the bank of some small rivulet, or by the skirts of some old Church on the knoll-top,&#x2014;the houses all sprinkled about as if you had shaken them out of a pepper-box. They are a lazy people, good and kindly I suppose, but in a &#x201C;very backward state of figures.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> Great part of their ground is in grass, which they are getting up into hay just now,&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">natural</hi>-grass hay, which horses are very fond of: the farming seems very bad; but the rents are cheap and the soil good.</p>
<p>Well, dear Jean, you did not expect to read a description of Wales, did you? I will say no more of it at least! Our Household itself is sufficiently strange. My &#x201C;honest Lawyer,&#x201D; for I think he deserves that name, is a man about as tall as myself and perhaps twice as <hi rend="italic">lean</hi>, somewhat younger, tho&#x2019; he looks older; a person truly worth giving a glance at. He appears to associate with no Son of Adam; tho&#x2019; he has great work as an Attorney at Cowbridge and I believe three men in his office, and indeed seems to have already become rich: he <hi rend="italic">screws</hi> his voice into dreadful emphasis when he says anything, which is but rarely: he rises, goes to bed, eats, drinks, bathes, writes, and does all things with a rigour of <hi rend="italic">method</hi> which no eight-day clock can surpass;&#x2014;looks out with long innocent nose, with thin sunk cheeks and <hi rend="italic">clasped</hi> lips, into life, with a kind of mournful affectionate smile! Good Redwood, he is dreadfully <hi rend="italic">un</hi>entertaining for a <hi rend="italic">crack;</hi> but he goes away, the instant you hint such a thing, and leaves you alone: what could man do more! I believe I shall grow to like him yet.

Our house for most part, as at present, is silent as if inhabited by ghosts. I lounge about all day, with books, under trees, lying on the grass: I have not at all grown tired of it yet. As the weather is delightful, perhaps I may still make out almost a week. I have then two days (if I can manage it) to spend with the Bishop of St David&#x2019;s (a brave man tho&#x2019; a Bishop!) at Carmarthen some sixty miles off: after that I think of making towards the Coast and getting into a Steamer for Liverpool. Brother Jack will perhaps come and meet me, then or sooner: we are in communication already.&#x2014; Jane is in a tumult like the sack of Cities, at Chelsea, with Painters &#x26;c thoroughly revising the house there, in my absence: I think I must bring her up to Liverpool, were all that over; she might stay there for a while.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>Did you get the little slip of paper insinuated, yesterday morning, after the Letter had been sealed? It struck me at breakfast that I had forgotten to explain the mystery of that horrid Basil-Montague &#x201C;disappointment&#x201D; in the Shower-bath,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430707-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-07">7</date> and <date when="1843-07-08">8 July</date>]</ref>. The showerbath had been installed in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420518-TC-MAC-01"><sic>14:191</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1842-05-18">18 May 1842</date></corr></ref>. Montagu&#x2019;s disappointment is unexplained.</note> analagous to the muskets all refusing to go off in case of a battle! To meet every accident I will repeat it. Helen pulls the showerbath <hi rend="italic">too high up;</hi> an inch too high will do it; the ropes, running a little oblique, catch as you will see, in that case, the <hi rend="italic">ends</hi> of the cylinder which holds the water; wherefore it declines to turn: let it down an inch, it swashes off. By terrible experiments oft repeated, and by reflexion grounded on these, I made out the mystery. The little red carpenter was to blame. Shew it to Pearson, he will at once understand it:&#x2014;he ought to, if not mend it, at least nail a bit of wood on the ceiling to <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> the machine from getting up too high: Helen will never learn to hold her hand, except by accident, till it is held for her. And now, you yourself, if you attend to me, can always secure a good splashing to your white shoulders, and the proper general submission under the shower-cataract,&#x2014;you little <foreign>cutty</foreign> [mischievous girl]!&#x2014; It was also a real distress and surprise to met that my legacy of Paper turned out so inconsiderable! Did you look in the red painted box? Certainly there was more there than you describe! If not,&#x2014;alas, I was a fool, and had taken no heed.</p>
<p>From this Temple of Inanity you can expect no news; nevertheless I keep writing. Today no Letter has gone; but I have taken Time not by the pigtail, and there is to be a full sheet tomorrow ready for me. It is now past one o&#x2019;clock: who knows but at half past two there may be another little missive from yourself after the Sunday vacancy. I <pb id="pg-16-259" n="16:259"/>shall at least know, and say, before I seal. Nobody less deserves a letter; for my replies, as I often confess, are by the nature of them <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> in more words or fewer.</p>
<p>Yesterday, with a rational exertion of ill-nature, I briefly declined going for an Arcadian ramble to the coast all day, or indeed going anywhither; indicating that I preferred the green grass, sunshine and solitude among the trees and winds. The good R. in an instant cheerfully surrendered, cheerfully went off to his Attorney-office, and left me totally alone till dinner. I have not for long had a peaceabler day. The old black cobweb coat was warm enough for the temperature; I lay upon the grass on the <foreign>brae</foreign>-side, under shadow if I liked; read the critique on Accorombona<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No pbd. critique has been traced prior to &#x201C;Tieck&#x2019;s Vittoria Accorombona,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 36 (<date when="1847-11-00">Nov. 1847</date>):567&#x2013;75.</note> (alas, Accorombona itself was done); read the Examiner; smoked my pipe, and looked out upon the waving woods, and felt their great deep melancholy <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> a real blessing to me. At dinner and after it was different! However, I got away by myself upon the Pony and galloped thro&#x2019; multifarious lanes, not without jumbling myself. The worst of all however is that you can get no tea here till towards nine at night, <hi rend="italic">five</hi> hours after dinner; and then it is dreadful stewed tea, with blue milk,&#x2014;and these three nights I have kept myself awake with it till I came in sight almost of three o&#x2019;clock and the <hi rend="italic">Un</hi>delectable! I decide now that I will take no tea more, if I cannot get some about three hours earlier,&#x2014;which perhaps indeed I shall not try, so solemnly methodic is the arrangement of all things here. Stoicism and a draught of hot water will be supportable for a day or two. I have not yet got Thirlwall&#x2019;s answer, nor indeed do I expect it till tomorrow: but very probably, I think, about the end of this week or beginning of next, I shall make off thitherward. The &#x201C;expedition into the Hills&#x201D; with my good dull R. looks very questionable at present.</p>
<p>In fact this kind Host of mine is an extremely good man: can he help it if he is a wearisome one? He would so gladly be the most entertaining of men, did it lie with <hi rend="italic">him!</hi> A most modest, timid, truly courteous man; with a certain <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to be king over all movements of men and things round him,&#x2014;but who instantly desists, and withdraws into invisibility if you indicate never so faintly that the is like to bore you! I have nowhere seen a more perfect Piece of Mechanism, not even old Mr Bradfute;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bradfute (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), Edinburgh bookseller; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191000-JBW-EA-01"><sic>1:204</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1819-01-01">1 Jan. 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note> the history of his Day here might be written down in Almanacks the year before. From the hour when he issues, lean and gaunt but full of hope, thro&#x2019; this <hi rend="italic">window</hi> of the little <foreign>reeky</foreign> &#x201C;study&#x201D; <pb id="pg-16-260" n="16:260"/>so-called, and stalks along in flannel dressing-gown into the Shower-bath,&#x2014;till as the clock strikes eleven, he snatches his little candlestick and vanishes,&#x2014;it is all marked out in rigorous stages and courses of method, not to be varied from without pain. After showerbath, he walks &#x201C;seven minutes,&#x201D; on a scant path which he has hewn out for himself on the hill-side amid the trees and bushes: to go and to come takes &#x201C;seven minutes.&#x201D; He strips and dresses from the very skin and outwards four times every day. The arrangements of our household <hi rend="italic">Hydrastisy</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A neologism; literally, &#x201C;water standing-place,&#x201D; i.e., a showerbath.</note> (in which he loves to linger) would fill you with amazement. And then that mournful serenity of cheerfulness, like Arctic sunshine on the edge of eternal Winter, that long innocent nose, those lips <hi rend="italic">smacked</hi> together, hiding as in a smith&#x2019;s-vice&#x2014;almost nothing! And the screwed-up emphasis of what small unimportant speech there is:&#x2014;a Henry Taylor without the genius! I could often almost laugh in the worthy man&#x2019;s face,&#x2014;and yet on the whole how can I but esteem him; almost begin to like him, so good is he, so unweariedly polite and kind to me. At bottom, I believe the solution is that I ought to go about my business, as soon as convenient. It is unfair to stay as a man&#x2019;s guest whom you are like to laugh at: I feel it hourly a kind of treachery. I think I shall be off in the end of the week.</p>
<p>Accorombona is far the pleasantest thing I have yet fallen in with since I left you. A very gorgeous composition,&#x2014;but somewhat too shewy, in diamonds, Bristol-diamonds,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rock crystals found in the limestone nr. Bristol and used in ornaments.</note> tinsel and the precious metals, for my taste! One finds it to be untrue, almost as an Opera: yet much is true, genial-warm and very grand. Vittoria herself is about the best of all Opera-heroines, a right divine stage goddess. Bracciano too is clearly her mate, as you said;&#x2014;yet I could not but <hi rend="italic">abhor</hi> that murder he did of the poor frivolous trembling creature: it is detestable. The sublime Song-of-Solomon passages did also somewhat transcend me. In fact, it is a grand thing, but <hi rend="italic">Bristol</hi> diamond not a little of it. A thousand thanks to Tieck and the Coadjutor<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., JWC.</note> for such a gift in these latitudes. Alas, this morning I am reduced to <hi rend="italic">Lyell&#x2019;s Geology</hi>, a twaddling circumfused <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>-writing man; I seem to hear his uninspired voice all along, and see the clear-<hi rend="italic">leaden</hi> twinkle of his small bead-eyes!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Lyell, <hi rend="italic">Principles of Geology</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-00-00">33</date>) or his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geology</hi> (<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>). TC had attended his lectures in <date when="1843-03-00">March</date>.</note> However, I must persist a little.</p>
<p>Yesternight in my gallop I came, about a mile to the west or north west of this, upon a beautiful little hamlet or village, all hanging in a <pb id="pg-16-261" n="16:261"/>straggle on the two sides of a green chasm or ravine, with a white Church-tower atop: the name of it Llanblethian: here, as R. cursorily informed after my return, &#x201C;a Mr St<hi rend="italic">ar</hi>ling once lived, who wrote afterwards, as was said, in the <hi rend="italic">Times!</hi>&#x201D; By Heaven, I believe it is a fact; for John Sterling once described the place of his boyhood to me exactly as this is!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Life of Sterling, Works</hi> 11:15&#x2013;22; see also <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390904-TC-RWE-01"><sic>11:179</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1839-09-04">4 Sept. 1839</date></corr></ref>. Llanbethian is between Cowbridge and Llandough.</note> A new interest is added to Llanblethian; I will go and see <hi rend="italic">it</hi> another time before all is done.&#x2014;&#x2014; But now two o&#x2019;clock being near, I will smoke and wait for Letters. A bathe I suppose comes next. The weather is grey but warm tho&#x2019; windy. <hi rend="italic">Before</hi> dinner I will ride, not after. <foreign>Adieu</foreign> Dearest, with ten kisses.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">11 at night</hi>. No letter from thee: only this from Alick Welsh, which cuts off the hope of Aberystwith. Unless there be some hope, from Carmarthen, of Coaches inland, I must go by Swansea; which will be, as it were, turning back.&#x2014; I rode before dinner, did not bathe, and with great care, by means of a hint, got <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the teas transferred to about 7 o&#x2019;clock. The old Mother, I doubt, would suffer most, for R. seldom takes almost any tea.&#x2014; My Dearest, how art thou going to sleep? Tell me, tell me! Directly after post tomorrow, we are off for the sea-side. Country evening is delicious.

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>I have been at that St Donat&#x2019;s, &#x201C;the day&#x201D; requisite; I have just got home thro&#x2019; rain and precipitous rough roads at a gallop which after tea and dinner has jumbled me all to pieces: Devil take all &#x201C;days&#x201D; of that sort! I had just got your Letter when I went away; I went happy, I return <hi rend="italic">meeser</hi>-able,&#x2014;fly up into my sooty &#x201C;study&#x201D; to be at least alone for a while. How happy I was over Quarterly Reviews, peace, silence and my Goody&#x2019;s Letter,&#x2014;and now!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well one good thing I got was this smallest of small memorials of the 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A ribbon for JWC&#x2019;s birthday.</note> which, as the umbrella all went aback, you must accept with resignation. I have worn it all day in my pocket; this and its <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> nature, as decidedly Welsh, from the main Shop of Cowbridge, must give it some worth.</p>
<p>I enclose Thirlwall&#x2019;s answer to my Letter which also came today. I have not yet decided what day I shall appoint him: but judge it may be some day in the early half of next week. He is sixty or seventy miles off me: how I go next is not in the least plain.&#x2014; Jack has no intention of coming down to Chelsea just now, or perhaps at all. Here is his Letter of today.

<p>Not a line from you today Dear!&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is stupid&#x2014; I, in the midst of my bit earthquake, am excusable for missing plenty of posts&#x2014;but <pb id="pg-16-264" n="16:264"/>you in the midst of a &#x201C;simplicity verging on the inane&#x201D;&#x2014;with &#x201C;conversation which does not promise to be a treat&#x201D;&#x2014;you, for your own sake, ought to write <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>&#x2014;better or worse&#x2014; If you had seen me last night asleep&#x2014;you would have seen a pretty sight! The point was <hi rend="italic">smelling</hi> of course&#x2014;one cannot make a household&#x2019;s revolution any more than a state on with rose-water&#x2014;and so this house did not smell of rose-water I can assure you&#x2014; Old Sterling had said so much about its &#x201C;costing me <hi rend="italic">my life</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;and the &#x201C;absolute necessity&#x201D; of my at least <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> at his house&#x2014;that I did begin to think it might cause me&#x2014;a headach!&#x2014;so I took all wise precautions against it&#x2014;kept my room door carefully shut all the day&#x2014;and slept with <hi rend="italic">both</hi> my windows wide open&#x2014;so that I really suffered very little inconvenience from the smell&#x2014; But just when I was going to bed it occured to me that in this open state of things, with several <hi rend="italic">ladders</hi> laying quite handy underneath the windows&#x2014;&#x201C;heavy bodies&#x201D; might (as Helen phrased it last year) &#x201C;drop in&#x201D; and be at my pillow before I heard them&#x2014;so &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">feeling it my duty</hi>&#x201D; to neglect no proper precaution, I laid my dagger and the great Policeman&#x2019;s-rattle on <hi rend="italic">the spare pillow</hi>, and went to sleep quite peaceably without any more thought about thieves! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lambert told me yesterday that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> sleeps in the back room of the ground floor &#x201C;for protection&#x2019;s sake&#x201D;&#x2014;and has always &#x201C;besides his dog a loaded gun at his side&#x201D;&#x2014; I was on the point of asking him what on earth he had <hi rend="italic">to protect</hi> that was worth so much trouble&#x2014; When he took his leave he hoped that I would &#x201C;apply to him if he could be of any use to me in my husbands absence&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;whatever <hi rend="italic">protection</hi> (in the <hi rend="italic">virtuous</hi> sense of the word of course) <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could afford me &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x201D; I thought to myself that a man who slept on the ground floor with a loaded gun was more in a condition to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> protection than to lend it to a woman who slept with open <hi rend="italic">windows</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ladders.

<salute>Dearest Babbie</salute>
<p>The sympathy between us continues to be perfect in all respects&#x2014;both materially and morally&#x2014;to a degree unprecedented I really believe except in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Siamese twins!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chang and Eng (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), twins joined at the waist; b. in Siam of Chinese parents but became naturalized Americans surnamed Bunker after being taken to Boston, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>; m., <date when="1843-04-00">April 1843</date>, two sisters and had nineteen children; exhibited in U.S. and Europe.</note> Unfortunately it is not oftenest sympathy in bliss! at this moment?&#x2014; Oh Good Heavens, after all!&#x2014; The unspeakable is going on in this house!&#x2014; Every morning at six of the clock a legion of devils rush in under the forms of Carpenters, Painters, whitewashers, and non-descript apprentice-lads who grind grind, grind, with pumice-stones&#x2014;and saunter up and down the stairs <pb id="pg-16-267" n="16:267"/>whistling and singing as if I had hired them to keep me in <hi rend="italic">music!</hi>&#x2014; At the first sound of this <hi rend="italic">Legion</hi> spreading itself over the premises, I spring out of bed&#x2014;dash down stairs, and &#x201C;in <foreign>wera</foreign> desperation&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> take a shower-bath!&#x2014; After which I feel more up to standing the noise&#x2014;and smell, and hideous discomfort! I am oil-painting the staircase and passage and the wood of the Library&#x2014; So you may conceive the smell in this warm weather! Sterling predicts my <hi rend="italic">death</hi> in consequence&#x2014;various persons remonstrate against my staying&#x2014;above all sleeping&#x2014;in it&#x2014;but what can I do if I were not here to look after what is a-doing I can see that there would be fifty blunders made&#x2014;and to leave Helen alone during the night&#x2014;or to bring any stranger in to keep her company while the house is in such disorder would be equally inexpedicent&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">death</hi>&#x201D; indeed were to be avoided on any terms and if I saw <hi rend="italic">that</hi> likely to ensue I would accept a sleeping room in Sterlings house&#x2014;but by keeping my bed-room door always closed and sleeping with the two windows wide open I do not feel the smell very bad thro the night&#x2014; &#x201C;And <hi rend="italic">the thieves</hi> Cousin&#x201D;? two wide-open windows and plenty of ladders lying quite handy in the court underneath them&#x201D;?&#x2014; My dear, when one is painting and papering one&#x2019;s house, one has no time to think of thieves!&#x2014;
It did occur to me last night in lying down, that &#x201C;heavy bodies&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell&#x2019;s phrase.</note> might drop in thro the night&#x2014;and be at my pillows before I heard them&#x2014;but my nerves are pretty strong at present&#x2014;I took the precaution to lay the Policeman&#x2019;s rattle on the spare pillow&#x2014;and went to sleep without thinking more about them&#x2014;a curious contrast to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lambert next door&#x2014;father of the young pianists&#x2014;who sleeps in the back room of the ground floor&#x2014;&#x201C;for protection to his house&#x201D;&#x2014;he told me&#x2014;and besides his quick-eared dog has ever in readiness a loaded gun&#x2014;pistols he says are &#x201C;worth nothing in such cases&#x201D;&#x2014;I told him that rather than pass my life in such a state of armed defence; I would adopt Darwins plan of leaving all the plate &#x26;c every night on the lobby table&#x2014;I told him also of your screams of delight in seeing &#x201C;a small cannon&#x201D; carried into his house last year&#x2014;and thinking what an unexpected reception the next thieving party was likely to encounter&#x2014; He laughed himself till the tears ran down but told me &#x201C;the small cannon&#x201D; was a small steamengine&#x2014; He seems to be some sort of military engineer&#x2014; All this passed between us yesterday morning when in return for an amiable Note of regrets about the noise &#x26;c which I had felt it polite to write to him, he came himself to assure me &#x201C;he had never heard the noise&#x201D;&#x2014;and to <hi rend="italic">offer me &#x201C;his protection</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;(in the virtuous <pb id="pg-16-268" n="16:268"/>sense of the word of course)&#x2014;from all he said, he left me with the idea that <hi rend="small-caps">he</hi> stood much more in need of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> protection than I did of <hi rend="italic">his</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Carlyle writes to me almost daily &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">dullish</hi> letters to say the truth&#x2014; I fancy him very <hi rend="italic">sleepy</hi> in Wales&#x2014;and why not? it was just for that he went so far!&#x2014; &#x201C;the simplicity of his kind hosts verges on the <hi rend="italic">inane</hi>&#x201D; &#x201C;their conversation does not promise to be a treat to him&#x201D;!&#x2014; Well&#x2014;I suppose he will leave that region the end of this week&#x2014;and where will he go then? neither he nor I can tell yet!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Here</hi> sure enough he cannot return so probably he will go on to Annandale John talks of meeting him in Liverpool and &#x201C;coming on to London&#x201D; being dead-weary of the country&#x2014; There justs wants John here to make my actual position perfectly hideous&#x2014;and tho he find the whole house in a state of wreck and nobody with a moments leisure to attend to him he will not for that, dream of taking a lodging&#x2014;if I can get a room ready for him with ever so much inconvenience&#x2014; I cannot tell you how this prospect of his return &#x201C;exactly at the wrong time&#x201D; puts me out of humour&#x2014; Mazzini is better considerable&#x2014;his face almost quite restored to its original beauty&#x2014;he and Plattnauer walked with me to Knightsbridge yesterday&#x2014;for furniture-print!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a printed fabric for slip-covers and the like.</note>&#x2014;
As we returned I took Plattnauer into Gambardella&#x2019;s to see his picture of Brougham&#x2014;Mazzini had had to send him (Gambardella) a note requesting that he would either pay his subscription for the Italian school or withdraw his name from the list&#x2014;he had received <hi rend="italic">no answer</hi>&#x2014;so under these delicate circumstances he could not go in but waited for us outside&#x2014;whether Gambardella had seen him from the window&#x2014;and felt sore at the notion of his having perhaps told <hi rend="italic">me</hi> about the unpaid subscription I do not know&#x2014; certainly <hi rend="italic">something</hi> had jarred the music of his soul for he was quite as rude to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> his &#x201C;perfect woman,&#x201D; as I ever heard tell of his being to other people&#x2014; I am not exactly the person to put up with rudeness from <hi rend="italic">a man</hi> especially&#x2014;and the first rudeness from him would have been the last he would ever have had <hi rend="italic">opportunity</hi> to exhibit&#x2014;had it not been for the thought of you, my Babbie, and your picture! To have quarrelled with him would have laid me under the same necessity which he has imposed on so many other people to return him both your likeness and my own&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not do any thing so cruel to both you and myself&#x2014;so I pretend not to see his impertinence&#x2014;and do you not say a word of this when you see him as you will shortly&#x2014;he is returning to Liverpool next week to &#x201C;live there <hi rend="italic">for ever&#x201D;!</hi>&#x2014;till he tires again!&#x2014; Plainly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things must have been going awry with him here&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-269" n="16:269"/>&#x2014;he quarrells so incessantly with those who wish to serve him&#x2014; He said he would take the picture and the frame himself &#x201C;there was no use in sending them by Walter<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macgregor.</note> now even if he did come&#x201D;</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>There being no Tea to be had this night apparently till towards nine o&#x2019;clock (when by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing I shall hope to decline it), let me write to you in my dry state, with at least daylight round me. You had a most short scrape of a pen last night: I was tired and sick; I could do no more. Today your Letter accuses me for not writing &#x201C;better or worse&#x201D;; better therefore not being altogether roadready, I give you a chance of worse. No great burden to me, if it be none to you!</p>
<p>Your Letter and Newspaper have been almost the only event of the day: thanks for the gardenhouse, and what comes from it! Do not torment yourself with &#x201C;thieves&#x201D;; no thief will meddle with you. Lambert is an ass, and <hi rend="italic">needs</hi> protection as you say. I sleep here with the window gaping as wide as it will go; ten yards from the highway of the parish, nothing but the hill-sides and stars, and general conscience and cowardice of the Welsh population watching over me. Fear nothing of thieves. But get done with the painting too;&#x2014;I fancy you will need no bidding to do that!</p>
<p>This day here has been as close dim and sultry as day need be; thunder rumbling on all sides of the horizon ever since morning; very loud just lately over to the east about Cardiff. I have read several articles in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>, kept aloof from <hi rend="italic">Lyell</hi> hitherto,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lyell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Geology;</hi> see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430711-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-11">11 July</date></ref>. Presumably the most recent issue of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi>, <date when="1843-05-00">May</date> (vol. 72).</note> declined <pb id="pg-16-270" n="16:270"/>to ride, walked out a little way,&#x2014;in short sauntered in the idlest manner. Till dinner arrive I am always very comfortable. But then&#x2014;breaks in the reign of hollow Nothingness, the <hi rend="italic">tealess</hi> reign of the Inane! That is the labour, that is the work.</p>
<p>However, I have written to Thirlwall that I leave this on Monday; and so we see the <hi rend="italic">end</hi>. A coach goes thro&#x2019; Cowbridge about noon: some sixty miles I believe it is to Carmarthen: after that I must pick my way northward as I can. The one possibility still remains to me of faring on to Milford Haven,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pembrokeshire, SW Wales.</note> and getting the Steamer for Liverpool there. How long I may stay with Thirlwall is not perfectly clear: &#x201C;two days&#x201D; was the time I talked of; but if all prospered exceedingly, it might extend to three. I shall get no <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> in any of these places: and it may as well be in a <foreign><hi rend="italic">plenum</hi></foreign> [fullness] as in a <hi rend="italic">vacuum</hi> in that case.&#x2014; R. knows that I must go on Monday; regrets &#x26;c &#x26;c, but reconciles himself like a polite man.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I believe he meditates a new excursion to St Donat&#x2019;s: I think I shall wait for Letters, and then go. The sea-side yields at least a bathe, and one weariness is appointed here equally as there. The high lime-stone cliffs and great solitary sea: there is something that <hi rend="italic">blunts</hi> the poignancy of boring in all that! We are to stay all night too: I will not gallop again after dinner in that fashion&#x2014;for any man&#x2019;s pay.</p>
<p>Today I was out near Lanblethian (Sterling&#x2019;s place). In Llandough close at hand here over the knoll-top, I saw certain of the population in the street as I passed along: little flabby figures, brown as a berry, fat, squat, wide-flowing, their clothes of almost <hi rend="italic">no</hi> colour (such is the prevalence of <hi rend="italic">lime</hi> and poverty) hung round them, as if &#x201C;thrown on with a pitchfork&#x201D;: very noteworthy little fellows (of both sexes) indeed! They saluted kindly as I passed. Llandough consists of some 9 houses, or huts most of them, built in a row, on elevated ground, and looking blank (the greater part of them) into the back wall of Red-wood&#x2019;s garden, which back wall is on the very crown of the height. The common well lies down below in the hollow on our side, and indeed is our well too. An old squire something lives in a Llandough Castle close at hand, a little behind the village: poor fellow the grave of his old Wife is the newest in Llandough Churchyard, and he sits solitary, R. says, and &#x201C;scolds his servants, being a <hi rend="italic">proud</hi> man.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; I will have a pipe now; and not finish this till towards bedtime. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest. There is rest&#x2014;for the just, is there not?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 48:22.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-16-271" n="16:271"/><hi rend="italic">10 p.m.</hi> I drank hot water at my usual time of tea., and then at 9 o&#x2019;clock went out walking, with a notice that I should not be in again to tea.

<p>Reitm&#xfc;ller, I suppose, is the son of a German; some German Music-master, it is like. He is the &#x201C;young man of genius&#x201D; whom Lucas recommended to me. He now costs me four shillings; &#x2014;I promised to pay it; but did not think the demand would be made so soon!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430711-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-11">11 July</date>]</ref>.</note> I am glad his legitimate drammar has any worth at all.</p>
<p>Thanks for answering the Chimera Jervis. He is certainly the most perseverant man in asking and still again asking us. Without result. &#x201C;O for a lodge in some vast wilderness&#x201D; &#x26;c!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cowper, <hi rend="italic">The Task</hi> 2:1.</note></p>
<p>John and I can as yet make no bargain for meeting in the North. I still think he may as well go back with me into Annandale. He does not seem yet to have shaped any plan for himself; and, unless he end by going with Lady Clare, I do not see that he is very likely at present to do it,&#x2014;poor Jack! It is a horribly difficult thing to do; <hi rend="italic">all at once</hi>, especially!</p>
<p>I sometimes have a thought of Forster at Bradford; but doubt it will not at all do. They are a terrible set of fellows those open-mouthed wondering <foreign><hi rend="italic">gawpies</hi></foreign> [silly fellows], who lodge you for the sake of looking at you! It is horrible.</p>
<p>Our thunder is all away; and the stillest serene night come instead: the great old Elm-trees looking in at this poor Study-window with the sky thro&#x2019; them, in a truly sublime manner; every Elm-tree lost <hi rend="italic">beyond the window-lintel</hi>, of infinite height therefore, and motionless as if every leaf of it were enchanted,&#x2014;as if the whole were a cerulean petrifaction; and I some poor Devil jailed in the middle of it; which perhaps is the fact! O my dear, this universe is great, most great; enough to strike one dumb.</p>
<p>And now suppose thou were to take a little drop of something hot (porridge I fear there is none), and then go quietly to bed? For the protection of Lambert and other purposes! My poor little <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, a sound sleep to thee, and right pleasant dreams if any. Will not some Great God gather all the widely-separated together again! It is a hope that will never die, that one. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, adieu</foreign></salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter arrived yesterday, fully as soon as I had expected; the other came the day after mine had gone away. I wish I were able at once to point out what my plan of travel is; but I can only give it you so far as it is yet matured, which indeed is as far as there yet exists knowledge for maturing it. A Steamer, it would appear, sails weekly from Swansea for Liverpool on Wednesday at some hour or other, and touches at Milford Haven, and nowhere else. This you do not commend as a conveyance. On the other hand, Alick Welsh apprises me that there is now no Liverpool Steamer from Abe<supplied>[r]</supplied>ystwith,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> and the Bishop gives evidence that there is no coach <hi rend="italic">to</hi> that place. I can prefigure nothing till I have got to Carmarthen, and consulted men of knowledge!</p>
<p>The Bishop again invites me very kindly; and I have written today, to him, agreeing to come thither on Monday. The Coach goes thro&#x2019; Cowbridge about noon; and I fancy it must be some sixty miles. I talked once of staying &#x201C;two days&#x201D; with the Bishop; it is not likely that my stay in such an establishment can be long: but it may be a day or so more than the &#x201C;two,&#x201D; if things prove inviting there, if I sleep well &#x26;c. You had better address your next Letter, &#x201C;Care of The Lord Bishop of St David&#x2019;s, Carmarthen&#x201D;: it will find me on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or be sent after me at worst. I will write to you from Carmarthen (or Abergwili, a country place near Carmarthen, which seems to be the precise spot), so soon as I have decided what way to go. Going back to Swansea or Milford is of course always a do-no-better possibility. But I should like well to take a glance at the Mountains; a sight of Snowdon, Plynlimmon &#x26;c would do me good, even from the distance;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Snowdon is the highest mountain (3,493 ft.) in Wales and England, 7 mi. SW of Caernarvon. Plynlimmon (2,468 ft.) is in mid-Wales.</note> and you seem to say there is all requisite convenience for travelling in the North region of Wales. Whatever accurate knowledge of that business you may have will be instructive to me at Carmarthen.</p>
<p>I should like very well to meet you somewhere on the road, anywhere, and carry you about, or be carried about, and if possible bring you back to Annandale with me! At Liverpool, Alick Welsh writes to me his Father is off with two of the girls Helen and another to Glasgow <pb id="pg-16-273" n="16:273"/>or Helensburgh;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town on N shore of Firth of Clyde, ca. 24 mi. NW of Glasgow.</note> Cousin Jeannie is there, and the House almost empty. You will see by one of the inclosed Notes that a certain W. E. Forster would be very glad of us at Bradford in Yorkshire: he is a very good young man, a manufacturer come up thither from the Quaker circles of Falmouth: I have of course declined his &#x201C;Craven&#x201D; expedition, but promised to think if there were any farther possibility. You now see all my engagements, chances and outlooks, just as they lie before myself. Your Annan Steamer sails on the <date when="1843-07-19">19<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, <date when="1843-07-22">22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi></date> and <date when="1843-07-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>: the <date when="1843-07-22">22<hi rend="italic">nd</hi></date> seems your likeliest day; but it is at 6 in the morning. If I could find somewhere in Wales, at the Menai Bridge,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Connecting Anglesey and the mainland.</note> or farther down, it would be a merry enough thing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the whole I do very well here, tho&#x2019; my worthy host&#x2019;s conversation is by no means the most exhilarating part of the phenomenon! He has a smart galloping pony, however; thro&#x2019; all the forenoon from ten till four he leaves me totally alone; and I have got two or three good dips in nice sea-water: nothing can exceed the kindliness or real innocent worth of the good man. We shall be well content till Monday.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1843-07-17">17 July</date>.</note>&#x2014; Jane writes to me from the middle of painters, joiners and loud confusion. Here are two other Letters from Bunsen;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1843-07-04">4</date> and <date when="1843-07-07">7 July</date>, the latter inviting TC and John Carlyle to dinner to meet Wilhelm von Willisen, &#x201C;a distinguished Prussian officer who has brought a letter to Mr. Carlyle,&#x201D; which was from Varnhagen von Ense. For Willisen, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430728-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC [<date when="1843-07-28">28 July</date>]</ref>.</note> which, as I had already answered the former, did not now require any answer.</p>
<p>Poor Alick did not get my Letter then! Poor fellow, I think of him daily and hourly, with sadness yet with hope. My Mother&#x2019;s articulate remembrance was precious to me. Give her my love, my hope of soon being there. Blessings on all of you.</p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>About the time when you read this on Monday (that is, towards noon), I shall, it may be hoped, be getting myself planted on the outside of the mail for Carmarthen, about to bid <foreign>adieu</foreign> to these <foreign><hi rend="italic">inania regna</hi></foreign> [inane realms]. The distance before me is some sixty miles: the direction as you may see by turning up the Maps of Wales in that Atlas of mine, is north by West; we are to get thither it seems about nine o&#x2019;clock at night; the Bishop&#x2019;s place, Abergwili, seems to be some mile or two farther. You will bid me good speed! You will have a Letter swiftly under way for me &#x201C;Care of the Lord Bishop of St David&#x2019;s, Carmarthen&#x201D;: will you not? Swift, swift! I will write you next day from that place; that is to say, on Tuesday, and you will get it on Thursday. Most probably you will again have of me, yet once, from this locality. I write today, early, little past noon yet, tho&#x2019; it cannot go till tomorrow morning;&#x2014;being uncertain of my possibilities at a later hour; for we are going off to St. Donat&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day, having avoided it yesterday to no purpose: <foreign><hi rend="italic">niemand entgeht seinern Schicksal</hi></foreign> [no one escapes his fate]! We go to St Donat&#x2019;s; and may or may not return tonight: so I make this ready in case of extremity: if I do return tonight, I will burst up the cover again, and add a word. R. is at Cowbridge waiting for me, &#x201C;at one o&#x2019;clock.&#x201D; I hope to find a Letter there from you, my day promises few other &#x201C;good joys.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380909-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:167</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-09-09">9 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But it is impossible to refuse this worthy man: one cannot say to him &#x201C;Let thy house be mine, and do thou in <pb id="pg-16-277" n="16:277"/>the interim&#x2014;disappear!&#x201D; He really does so to a respectable extent. A good man;&#x2014;and his good old Mother intent on cooking excellent puddings, on darning tablecloths, and reading <hi rend="italic">Yearly Monitors</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Annual Monitor</hi>, pbd. in York, contained obituaries of the members of the Society of Friends.</note> or <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> of Quaker Saints, I like her too very much, and shall long remember her still existence in this hollow of the green hills.</p>
<p>Nothing can be better than my mornings, perfectly alone under the shade of big trees, looking out over the Earth, seeing &#x201C;Nature budding, Percy!&#x201D;,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note>&#x2014;and a few Welsh bodies of both sexes, in brown discoloured and indeed quite ruinous hats and costumes, stradding about assiduous at haymaking. I read even <hi rend="italic">Lyell</hi> with the &#x201C;same relish!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:331</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-15">15 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> But then indeed comes the afternoon and dinner, or some St Donat&#x2019;s or the like;&#x2014;such a life is too good to last forever.</p>
<p>Yesterday passed as the brightest beautifullest day in the whole year might do in these circumstances. I had an excellent four hours till two o&#x2019;clock; then an excellent solitary gallop to the solitary sea-shore, a dip in the eternal element there, and gallop back again. The world was all bright as a jewel set in polished silver and sunshine; the sky so purified by the past day&#x2019;s thunder. The little hamlet of Aberddaw, a poor grey <foreign><hi rend="italic">clachan</hi></foreign> [village] crouched under the shelter of a kind of knoll the half of which was eaten sheer off by the sea,&#x2014;&#x201C;poor Aberdaw!&#x201D; I said to myself, &#x201C;thou sittest there ill enough bested; God help thee!&#x201D;&#x2014; The bits of Welsh women with their <foreign>cuddies</foreign> [donkeys], lugging small merchandise about, a very scrubby kind of figures, seemed highly praiseworthy, humanely pitiable to me. The wor<supplied>[l]</supplied>d<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> is so beautiful, when you see it from the knoll-tops, soft, green, yet shaggy and bushy, and sunshine kisses all things: and the upper moors themselves (dull blunt hilly regions) look sapphire in the distance,&#x2014;and I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to go thither with R.!</p>
<p>Poor R. At my return to dinner, he produced instead of port, a bottle of excellent claret, and said we must &#x201C;drink Mrs Carlyle&#x2019;s health, as it was her birthday!&#x201D; This fact he had gathered from seeing me purchase the bit of a ribband for a band to the said Mrs C.! Well, the feat accordingly was done; and even the ancient Quaker Mother had her glass filled, and wished &#x201C;many happy years to Jane Carlyle,&#x201D; for which I duly returned thanks. The day had no other <hi rend="italic">public</hi> event in it. R. made me sit with him till we <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> the bottle and, as we had copious tea realized about <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> o&#x2019;clock, the affair did me no harm at <pb id="pg-16-278" n="16:278"/>all, rather good.&#x2014; How strange is it that one should come upon the traces of James Spedding here! The Romillys, it seems, have an estate not far from this: Spedding was on a visit to them; then he winded up with a visit to an old Bury Schoolmaster of his, settled here at Cowbridge his native place in his old age; and Redwood lent them a horse for the riding purposes of Spedding.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Romilly (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>); a commissioner since <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date> for auditing public accounts and later chairman of the board; of Porthkerry, on the coast SE of Cowbridge; educ. at the grammar school, Bury St. Edmunds (which Spedding also attended) and Cambridge, <date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">27</date>, overlapping with Spedding at Trinity, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>. Schoolmaster unidentified.</note> We are strangely shuffled together in this world.</p>
<p>My malison on this glazed paper, on this detestable <hi rend="italic">leather</hi> pen! The world gets ever madder, with its choppings and changings, and never-ending innovations <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for the better! My collars too are all on a new principle: O for one hour of Dr Francia!&#x2014; But here comes our great stalking Maid, an immensely tall woman: &#x201C;The &#x2019;oss is <hi rend="italic">out</hi>, Sir!&#x201D; I must instantly be off. Will there be any letter from thee?</p>

The good R. gives me half a glass of sherry, in spite of all protestings, to &#x201C;settle me.&#x201D; The misty dim vacant sea, with nothing but a Cork Steamer visible in it; the hoarse moan far and wide against the stones and cliffs; the poor distracted-looking hamlet of St Donat&#x2019;s with nothing but asses, geese, and Welshmen tattered and torn: all this I have witnessed once more.

<p>Yet a few last words before quitting this place! I have had, as usual, a divine forenoon, lying under shady trees in the most exquisite summer atmosphere; and then a most <hi rend="italic">laborious</hi> afternoon, bathing, galloping, dining, talking; till now when I ought to proceed to pack and arrange&#x2014;if I did not prefer scribbling to Goody, still a word or two.</p>
<p>Your Letter of Today ought, as I find, to have been a Letter of Yesterday: &#x201C;missent to Kingston&#x201D; is on the back of it, and the date &#x201C;<date when="1843-07-14">14 july</date>.&#x201D; All the welcomer when it does come! It is the last I shall get here; for there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be none tomorrow.</p>
<p>Did you write a word of response to Miss Wilson?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had forwarded Jane Wilson&#x2019;s letter of ca. <date when="1843-07-12">12 July</date> asking TC to visit.

The Liverpool anticipation of me was somewhat of the suddenest: but tell Jeannie I shall gradually approach, and if all go right, arrive; and should it be in a household earthquake, they are never to mind. I am bent on not staying long in any <hi rend="italic">Town</hi> till I return to Cockneydom again. You should really get these Mudies done: the placing of the two girls if it be possible is palpably the right course; if impossible, the project I think should be with all despatch renounced and finished off. Mudiedom, one has reason to apprehend, is a bottomless quagmire of gin confusion and falsity, on the brink of which it is not pleasant to linger&#x2014; &#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Did</hi> Fuz<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nickname for John Forster.</note> come on Saturday?

<p>But I must not scribble and babble in this manner; at such an hour. Tomorrow at noon I have to be on the roof of the Mail at Cowbridge. A day of hot travel. I shall certainly not again be lodged so quietly anywhere. There will be rapid spiritual conversation in the Bishop&#x2019;s; and no green tree with Book and Tobacco to lodge under. One must <pb id="pg-16-281" n="16:281"/>take the good and the evil. I find this Redwood a really excellent man; honest, true to the heart, I should think, and with a proud and pure character hidden under his simplicity and timidity. He has been entirely hospitable to me; is sorry that I should go; speculates on my coming back &#x26;c as a proximate event: ah me! The old Mother too is very venerable to me. Poor old woman, with her <hi rend="italic">yearly Monitors</hi>, with her suet dumplings, and all her innocent household good!&#x2014;</p>
<p>My packing will not be difficult: I have never had any <hi rend="italic">drawer</hi> here, not one, and my few <hi rend="italic">Coats</hi> &#x26;c have had to lie folded on a chair: the servant is a rustic <foreign><hi rend="italic">gearpole</hi></foreign>, and my bedroom is without bell. After a day or two I reconciled myself to the arrangements, but never approved of them!&#x2014; Tomorrow I shall probably carry this Letter to the Post-Office myself; and its com<supplied>[ing]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> safe without accompaniment must be considered a sign that I have got off safe. On Wednesday you get nothing. On Thursday? Yes, if possible. <closer><salute>Bless thee.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dearest,</salute>
<p>I have been in many &#x201C;new positions&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350601-TC-JSM-01"><sic>8:127</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1835-06-01">1 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> but this of finding myself in a Bishop&#x2019;s Palace so-called, and close by the Chapel founded by old Scarecrow <hi rend="small-caps">Laud</hi> of famous memory, is one of the newest! Expect no connected account of the thing, nor of anything whatever today: I have not yet learned the <foreign><hi rend="italic">airts</hi></foreign> [directions] of the place in the least; and it is a morning of pouring rain; and in one hour (at noon) the brave Bishop, be the weather what it may, decides on riding with me &#x201C;four hours and a half&#x201D; thro&#x2019; the wildest scenery of the country, that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> may not suffer by the tempestuous nature of the elements. The Post will be gone before I return. Take one word therefore, to assure thee that I am alive, comparatively speaking <hi rend="italic">well;</hi> and that I think of thee here,&#x2014;here very especially where all is so foreign to me. Heavens, do but think, I was awoke before seven o&#x2019;clock, after short sleep, by a lackey coming in haste, to indicate that I must come and say my prayers in Laud&#x2019;s Chapel&#x2019;s of St John! I did go accordingly, and looked at it and at myself with wonder and amazement.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:217</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-01-21">21 Jan. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Besides my table <hi rend="italic">shakes</hi>;&#x2014;and I have a word to write to John.</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon I had got handsomely away from Llandough,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-16-285" n="16:285"/>the good old Dame,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Redwood.</note> desired me &#x201C;Thou please to give my regards to Mrs Carlyle&#x201D;: I was taken in the &#x201C;tub&#x201D; to Cowbridge, and there the Mail came up: full all but one inside seat! I had to take that seat such as it was; the rather as it turned out that there was to be a vacancy on the roof in some 17 miles farther. It was very hot and disagreable inside; a huge grazier fast asleep; a destestable-looking parson with yellow skin and jet black tattery wig; and old burgher of the Town of Neath, very talkative, very innocent: to this latter I chiefly attached myself. Neath at last came, the end of the 17 miles, and I got out and had a cigar, and saw undeniably clear around me the face of Heaven and Earth. An Earth very tolerable; sandstone coal-country now, green sharp hills with wood enough, green fields ill-ploughed and cultivated, with ditto; houses plastered with whitewash; ridiculous Welsh bodies, all the women of them now with men&#x2019;s hats,&#x2014;a great proportion of them looking very hungry and ragged. Swansea, enveloped in thick poisonous copper-fumes, and stretching out in winged desolation (for the copper-forges are of the last degree of squalor, low huts with forests of chimneys, and great mountains of red dross which <hi rend="italic">never</hi> changes into soil), is a very strange and very ugly place: we dined there (on next to nothing except ham,&#x2014;for I would not eat lamb); and then bowled along into the hills of the interior: no great shakes of <hi rend="italic">hills</hi>, but as the road goes over the <hi rend="italic">top</hi> of them all it makes them somewhat impressive. About 7 in the evening we plunged down by a steep winding way into the &#x201C;valley of the Towy,&#x201D; a dim enough looking valley&#x2014;for there was a windy Scotch mist by that time,&#x2014;with a river of some breadth and of muddy colour running thro it; and a little farther up, a strange <foreign><hi rend="italic">bleared</hi></foreign> mountain city hanging in a disconsolate manner on the farther bank and steep declivity: Carmarthen at last! No <hi rend="italic">Bishop&#x2019;s carriage</hi> was waiting for me: ah no, I hired a gig and flunkey, for which to this distance of <hi rend="italic">two miles</hi> I paid 5/ and 1/6, 6/6 in all: there is a way of doing business!</p>
<p>Abergwili is a village of pitiful dimension, all daubed as usual with whitewash and yellow-ochre; it is built however like a common village, on both sides of the public road: at the farther end of it, you come to solemn large closed gates of wood; on your shout they open, and you enter upon a considerable <foreign>glebe</foreign>-land <hi rend="italic">pleasance</hi>, with the usual trees, turf, walks, peacocks &#x26;c, and see at fifty yards distance, a long irregular (perhaps <hi rend="italic">cross</hi> shaped) edifice, the porch of it surmounted by a stone <hi rend="italic">mitre</hi>: <foreign>ach Gott</foreign>&#x2014; I was warmly welcomed; tho&#x2019; my Bishop did seem a little uneasy too, but how could he help it! I got with much pomp an extremely bad and late dish of tea; then <pb id="pg-16-286" n="16:286"/>plenty of good talk till midnight, and a room at the farther wing of the house, still as the heart of wildernesses, where after some smoking &#x26;c, I did at last sink into sleep till awakened as aforesaid. We have had an excellent cup of tea to breakfast; and I feel ready for a bit of the world&#x2019;s fortune once more.&#x2014; My Bishop, I can discern, is a right solid honest-hearted man, full of knowledge and sense; excessively <hi rend="italic">delicate</hi> withal, and in spite of his positive temper almost <hi rend="italic">timid</hi>; no wonder he is a little embarrassed with me, till he feel gradually that I have not come here to eat him, or make scenes in his still house! But We are getting, or as good as got, out of that; and shall for our brief time do admirably well. Here is medicine for the soul, if the body fare worse in such sumptuosities; precisely the converse of Llandough! It is wholly an element of rigid decently elegant <hi rend="italic">Forms</hi> that we live in; very wholesome for the like of me to dip for a day or two into that: is it not? For the rest, I have got two other Novels of Tieck, of which the admiring Bishop possesses a whole stock.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thirlwall was an admirer of Tieck and had trans, some of his works; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400426-TC-GEJ-01"><sic>12:120</sic><corr>TC to GEJ, <date when="1840-04-26">26 April 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>O Duckie, I do hope thou will write to me this day! I feel as if a little friendly speech even &#x201C;about time and space&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430831-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-08-31">31 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> with my poor Goody would be highly consolatory to me. Tonight I shall sleep better; tomorrow I shall be more at home; and the next day&#x2014;? There is nothing yet settled about the next day. This morning however I have given out all my shirts to be washed (five of them now accumulated).</p>
<p>Coaches it seems and some kind of straggling chances and possibilities of conveyance, do exist till one get within wind of Liverpool: I think of persisting by this route; the mountains lie all upon it, which one is bound to &#x201C;see.&#x201D;&#x2014; O my dear, how much richer am I than many a man with &#xa3;3000 a-year if I but knew it!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got along yesterday to the &#x201C;Bishop&#x2019;s Palace&#x201D; here; but am yet so confused in my new locality that nothing but the desire to give you my promptest news could excuse me for writing today. Add to all things <pb id="pg-16-287" n="16:287"/>that it is raining, and I am to go out in <hi rend="italic">fifteen</hi> minutes for a <hi rend="italic">four hours ride</hi> with the magnanimous Bishop! He fears no weather.&#x2014; This is the house old Laud inhabited; I was summoned this morning to say my prayers in the very chapel of the old Chimera. I went but did not try to pray much,&#x2014;at least not in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> dialect.</p>
<p>My route hither you probably know: By Neath, Swansea &#x26;c. I have seen no such place as Swansea for horrid deformity produced by labour of man. The copper dross is ugly as Golgotha; the Welsh bodies too, men and women, are <foreign><hi rend="italic">duddy</hi></foreign> [ragged], dirty, all in hats the womankind, and look extremely queer. We passed successively thro&#x2019; four tollbars demolished by Rebecca. The gates were sawed off close by the ground,&#x2014;great thick posts; and had then been burnt or carried away. The tollhouse was totally demolished; the roof rolled up within the ruined walls of it, seemingly by long levers, and left there in a mass. No toll was asked, no person was there. The nocturnal riots, we are told, have not ended; but one sees nothing of it by day, and nobody seems to mind it at all.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the time TC placed little importance on it, but he wrote in his Journal, <date when="1843-10-02">2 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Rebecca&#x2019; (the Gatebreaker) was in the very quarter of Wales where I passed (Carmarthen &#x26;c), but except the sight of her broken gates she amounted to little; nobody seemed to regard her much: she is grown more impressive since. Wales seemed to me not worth going to see.&#x201D; Milnes on his visit to Thirlwall in <date when="1843-09-00">Sept.</date> reported: &#x201C;This Country is on the brink of becoming as bad as Ireland. The serious fun of breaking the turnpike gates has ended in fire and bloodshed&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:304).</note>&#x2014; There is a bell thinking for something or other! I must be brief.</p>
<p>Perhaps this afternoon there will be a Letter from you at five o&#x2019;clock? I will write in deliberate answer to that; nay probably tomorrow at any rate.&#x2014; I still persist in making my way thro&#x2019; by Aberystwith, and onwards to Menai perhaps or Bangor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coastal town, NW Wales.</note> or wherever the conveniences are. As no regular coaches are to be heard of, I cannot prophecy my <hi rend="italic">times</hi>: two or three days here, that is the last <hi rend="italic">appointed</hi> pause I make. Cannot you if you like to meet me, and stroll about a little, get over straightway to Liverpool, and there appoint <hi rend="italic">me</hi> place and time, at Bangor or elsewhere? Or perhaps you do not care to tourify in Wales any more at present. I cannot ask you to come, for what have I to give you? Only it would be pleasant enough to meet!

<p>My dear good Mother&#x2014;O I wish I could write a volume to tell all <pb id="pg-16-288" n="16:288"/>I think about her and the rest of you. I shall see you all soon if it please Heaven. I sent a Newspaper to Jean, to Mary, and to my Mother; flung in yesterday as I passed thro&#x2019; Carmarthen, in hopes the Post-office people would <hi rend="italic">stamp</hi> them. Mary, I think, unless you have explained to her would hardly know what to make of it. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. God&#x2019;s blessing on you all. Poor Alick too!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dearest, dear, only Uncle of me!</salute>
<p>I would give a crown that you could see me at this moment, thro a powerful telescope! you would laugh for the next twelve hours&#x2014;I am <hi rend="italic">doing the rural</hi> after a fashion so entirely my own! To escape from the abominable paint-smell and the infernal noise within doors; I have erected <hi rend="italic">with my own hands</hi> a gipsey-tent in the garden, constructed with clothes-lines&#x2014;long poles and an old brown floor-cloth!&#x2014;under which remarkable shade I sit in an arm-chair, at a small round table&#x2014;with a hearth rug for carpet under my feet-writing materials sewing materials&#x2014;and a mind superior to Fate!&#x2014; The only drawback to this retreat, is its being exposed to &#x201C;the envy of surrounding nations&#x201D;&#x2014;so many heads peer out on me from all the windows of <hi rend="italic">the Row</hi>&#x2014;eager to penetrate my meaning!&#x2014; If I had a speaking-trumpet I would address them once for all&#x2014;&#x201C;Ladies &#x26; gentlemen, I am not here to enter my individual protest against the progress of civilization!&#x2014;nor yet to mock you with an Arcadian felicity which you have neither the taste nor the ingenuity to make your own!&#x2014;but simply to <hi rend="italic">enjoy nature</hi> according to ability, and to get out of the smell of new paint! So pray you, leave me to pursue my innocent avocations, in the modest seclusion which I covet&#x201D;!</p>
<p>&#x2014;Not to represent my contrivance as too perfect, I must also tell you that a strong puff of wind is apt to blow down the poles and then the whole tent falls down on my head!&#x2014;this has happened once already since I began to write&#x2014;but an instant puts it all to rights again&#x2014; Indeed without counteracting the indoors-influences by all lawful means I could not stay here at present without injury to my health which is at no time of the strongest&#x2014;our house has for a fortnight back been a house possessed with seven devils!&#x2014; A painter, two carpenters a paper-hanger, two non-descript apprentice-lads and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a spy</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;all playing the devil to the utmost of their powers&#x2014;hurrying and scurrying &#x201C;up stairs down stairs and in my Lady&#x2019;s chamber&#x201D;! affording the liveliest image of a sacked City! When they rush in at six of the morning and spread themselves over the premises, I instantly jump out of bed and &#x201C;in <foreign>wera</foreign> desperation&#x201D; take a shower-bath. Then such a long day to be virtuous in! I make a chair and sofa covers&#x2014;write letters to my friends&#x2014;scold the work people, and suggest improved methods of doing things&#x2014;and <pb id="pg-16-291" n="16:291"/>when I go to bed at night I have to leave both windows of my room wide open&#x2014;(and plenty of ladders lying quite handy underneath) that I may not as old Sterling predicted &#x201C;awake dead&#x201D; of the paint&#x2014; The first night that I lay down in this open state of things, I recollected Jeannies house-breaker-adventure last year, and not wishing that all the thieves who <hi rend="italic">might</hi> walk in at my open windows should take me quite unprepared, I laid my policeman&#x2019;s-rattle and my dagger on the spare pillow&#x2014;and then I went to sleep quite secure&#x2014; But it is to be confidently expected that in a week more things will begin to subside into their normal state&#x2014;and meanwhile it were absurd to expect that any sort of <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> can be accomplished with <hi rend="italic">rose-water</hi></p>
<p>There!&#x2014;the tent has been down on the top of me again but it has only upset the ink&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jeannie appears to be earthquaking with like energy in Maryland Street&#x2014;but finds time to write me nice long letters nevertheless, and even to make me the loveliest pincushion for my birthday&#x2014;and my birthday was celebrated also with the arrival of a hamper into which I have not yet penetrated. Accept kisses <foreign><hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi></foreign> for your kind thought of me dearest Uncle. I hope to drink your health many times in the Maidera when I have Carlyle with me again to give an air of <hi rend="italic">respectability</hi> to the act&#x2014; Nay on that evening when it came to hand, I was feeling so sad and dreary over the contrast between this <date when="1843-07-14">14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of July</date>&#x2014;alone&#x2014;in a house like a sacked city&#x2014;and other 14<hi rend="italic">ths</hi> that I can never forget&#x2014;that I hesitated whether or no to get myself out a bottle of the Maidera there and then&#x2014;and try for once in my life the hitherto unknown comfort of being dead-drunk But my sense of the respectable overcame the temptation&#x2014; I am so thankful to hear such comfortable accounts of you from Helen&#x2014;whom you are to kiss one dozen of times and thank in my name for her welcome letter&#x2014;I will write to herself very speedily&#x2014;</p>
<p>My husband has now left his Welchman and is gone for a little while to visit the Bishop of St Davids Then he purposes crossing over somehow to Liverpool&#x2014;and after a brief benediction to Jeannie passing into Annandale&#x2014; He has suffered unutterable things in Wales from the want of any adequate supply&#x2014;of tea! the <hi rend="italic">Spooney!</hi> For the rest his visit appears to have been pretty successful-plenty of seabathing&#x2014;plenty of riding on horseback&#x2014;and of <hi rend="italic">lying under trees!</hi>&#x2014; I wonder it never enters his head to lie under the walnut tree here at home&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">it is a tree!</hi>&#x2014;leaves as green as any leaves can be even in South Wales!&#x2014;but it were too <hi rend="italic">easy</hi> to repose under that&#x2014; &#x2014;if one had to travel a long journey by railway to it&#x2014;then indeed it might be worth while!</p>
<p>But I have no more time for scribbling just now&#x2014;besides my pen is <pb id="pg-16-292" n="16:292"/>positively declining to act&#x2014; So God bless you Dear and all of them&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dearest,</salute>
<p>I am very consciencious in writing to you! Here, for example, I have missed viewing the City of Carmarthen for your sake, having by candid computation when I got hither to my own room, found that I could not write to you if I went. What a favour! you will say. Yes, you gipsey; and a favour to myself too!&#x2014; Your Letter of last night was a real consolation to me. I have lost my <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>, I have lost my sleep; I am in a baddish way here: but it will soon be done. From <foreign><hi rend="italic">vacuum</hi></foreign> I have got into <foreign><hi rend="italic">plenum</hi></foreign> with a vengeance: what with chapel-duty, riding to see views, talking with the brave Bishop, late dining, limited tobacco and flunkies awakening you at seven in the morning (the very terror of whom awakens you at six), it is a business one needs to be trained to; and that is not worth while at present.</p>
<p>We sallied out yesterday in the midst of thick rain, on two horses,&#x2014;mine was the highest I ever rode; bigger fully than Darwin&#x2019;s Cabhorse. We rode for four mortal hours; no trotting permitted, except when I contrary to all politeness, burst off into a <foreign><hi rend="italic">voluntario</hi></foreign> [willfully fast pace], and then had soon to lie-to for my Host, who rides somewhat ecclesiastically. What was worse too, my high horse was in the temper fiercest humour for riding, and I longed immensely to take the temper out of him; but no; we plodded along, and saw a circle of views. Views very good; vallies, scrubby or woody hills, old churches, and ragged Welsh characters in torn hats: all very good; but tho&#x2019; the rain abated, and finally subsided into mud, and soapy dimness, I was glad enough to get home! And today again, while the weather is bright we are to renew the operation at 3 o&#x2019;clock. Well,&#x2014;and yet I am very glad I came in by this establishment, even at the expense of sleep. Nothing similar had ever before fallen in my way; and it was worth seeing once. Do but think of a wretched scarecrow face of Laud looking down on us, from Laud&#x2019;s own house that once was, as we sit at meat! And there is much good in all that I see; a <hi rend="italic">perfection</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Form</hi>, which is not without its value. With the Bishop himself I, keeping a strict guard on my mode of utterance, not mode of thinking, get on extremely well; find him a right solid, simplehearted, robust man, very strangely <hi rend="italic">swathed</hi>; <pb id="pg-16-293" n="16:293"/>on the whole right good company; and so we fare along, in all manner of discourse, and even laugh a good deal together. Could I but sleep;&#x2014; but then I never can! I had according to the original program decided to be off tomorrow morning: but the worthy host insists with such an earnestness, that I by way of handsome finish shall be obliged to put off till Friday morning, and see two other <hi rend="italic">sleeps</hi> still before me. Then however it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> up; I see my route, and am off!</p>
<p>By the maturest calculation, it seems my far best route will be Northeastward thro&#x2019; Brecknockshire and Monmouthshire to Glo&#x2019;ster, Wor&#x2019;ster, Birmingham and Liverpool. A coach passes us here to Glo&#x2019;ster in one day; the rest of it is railway. I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have gone to the Crawfords; and now, alas, I cannot! You did send me their address; but tho&#x2019; I rigorously kept every scrap of your writing, that individual Note seems to have gone to ruin somehow or somewhere in my chaotic <hi rend="italic">drawer</hi>less state; and tho&#x2019; I have read and re-read all your Letters three times, I cannot now find it at all. &#x201C;Ross&#x201D; is all I remember; and we go thro&#x2019; Ross: there I might have staid all night. But perhaps it is just as well! I am about done with my capacity of visiting for this heat; I shall like about as well to take my ease at my inn. Spending the night at Glo&#x2019;ster, I shall view the City in the morning: a Cromwellian place that I wanted this long while to see.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the siege of Gloucester, <date when="1643-08-00">Aug. 1643</date>, see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:165. Cromwell had addressed his troops in Gloucester, <date when="1648-05-08">8 May 1648</date>, on his way to subdue Wales; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:320.</note> Then Wor&#x2019;ster in like manner;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Worcester, about 25 mi. N of Gloucester and 25 mi. SSW of Birmingham, was the site of the battle, <date when="1651-09-03">3 Sept. 1651</date>, in which Cromwell routed Charles II and his Scottish army; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:325&#x2013;34.</note> till the new railway train come that will take me on to Birmingham and Liverpool: that will be the best. On Saturday night, I think I shall be there.&#x2014; John it seems is arriving there from Annandale tomorrow morning. He is to see Arbuckle &#x26;c: then perhaps we may take another little stroll in Wales; in the Northern or Hill part of it. That will all do, as we like it to do: and so <foreign><hi rend="italic">dabei bleib&#x2019; es</hi></foreign> [it is settled].</p>
<p>Forster has paid very handsomely.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Dr. Francia.&#x201D;</note> Give Darwin his checque to change into cash for you; and you may send five pounds of it on to me by the Post Office to Maryland Street Liverpool. There is no haste about that; for one of my five-pound Notes is still unchanged: but the <hi rend="italic">expense</hi> of these visitings is very great; dearer I think than moderate board at an inn would be. Never mind!&#x2014; If a Letter come today, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> another tomorrow even, I shall rejoice. But I must not bid you write hither any more. Write to Liverpool; that will be the best; and I shall get it on Saturday night. Write at large, my Duckie; I too have a kind <pb id="pg-16-294" n="16:294"/>of admiration of thy letters, especially of those to myself!&#x2014; I will write a word, if I anywhere can, by the road: once more at any rate you shall hear from me before Sunday.</p>
<p>That of Harriet Martineau is flat distraction: I am more and more content that we had nothing whatever to do with it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The testimonial for Harriet Martineau.</note> Alas, it is a very sad business that of setting up to be &#x201C;one and somewhat.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> Let us pity the poor white woman,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251019-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:390</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-10-19">19 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and take care of ourselves!</p>
<p>I find here a Letter from Mrs Mudie which has had written on the outside of it &#x201C;send this back.&#x201D; Here it comes accordingly,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have just the one stamp left for it! I am writing far too much. I will end now.</p>
<p>What a blessed rustle among these green trees, on that sunny lawn, with woods and fields and hills in the distance!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I wrote to you yesterday; but it was to Scotsbrig, and you will not now receive it, I find. In these hours you are driving (or rather you have driven for it is now three o&#x2019;clock) from Dumfries towards Annan; and have left our good Mother at Gill: a scene very lively to me, and very curious as I paint it out here!&#x2014; Yesterday I could decide on nothing as to roads, and was still thinking of struggling thro&#x2019; by Aberystwith, and some uncertain intermittent conveyances there are: but seeing you now at Liverpool I decide another way. We have a Coach to Glos&#x2019;ter; and that, with railways, will be it. It is a mail, goes well thro&#x2019; pleasant country; reaches Glo&#x2019;ster about 8 at night. Tomorrow morning I meant to be off; but the Bishop will not let me, I perceive: he is very good, this brave Bishop, and we do extremely well together. But on Friday morning I set out. At Glos&#x2019;ter I survey the town, pass the night; take an early train for Wor&#x2019;ster, see that town; and then get on for Birmingham and Liverpool that same night. Pray tell Cousin Jeannie that this is the way. And so on Saturday evening, by the late or latest train very probably, I shall hope to see you.</p>
<p>If after we have looked about us in Liverpool, you will embark on a small foot excursion into Welshland, by Bangor or otherwise, I shall be very willing to entertain the project. We shall see,&#x2014;we shall see, about that, and all things!</p>
<p>You did well to write to Alick; poor fellow, he sticks nearly constant in my head at present: but I have never got him written to at all. If it please Heaven, there is a time coming. That little <hi rend="italic">frustrated</hi> farewell<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The failure of TC&#x2019;s letter to reach Alexander before his sailing.</note> was very sad to me at Llandough.</p>
<p>Today I will write half a line also to my Mother. I think I have told <hi rend="italic">you</hi> all that was essential; and as my time is in the strictest sense limited, I will cease. My kind regards to all at Maryland Street, and to the good Arbuckle withal. Hoping for Saturday night,</p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Yesterday came John&#x2019;s Letter; and by it I learn that today about this time (3 o&#x2019;clock), you are probably set down at Gill, and the Doctor gone off towards Liverpool. I <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it all <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in this strange City and Bishop&#x2019;s House; and cannot but send you dear Mother a half word of salutation, tho&#x2019; I have hardly half a minute of time! I already sent you a Newspaper the day before yesterday (and another to Gill), and a Letter to John yesterday; but both these would go to Scotsbrig, and you will have yet no news of me.</p>
<p>I got here safe on Monday evening; was and still am safe lodged with the Bishop,&#x2014;in a grand mansion, which it is not easy to get at home in all at once! A much smaller one would serve <hi rend="italic">me</hi>. Abergwili is a poor village little bigger than Middlebie, some two miles from Carmarthen, which is a straggling <foreign><hi rend="italic">blae</hi></foreign>[bluish-grey]-looking old Welsh City about the size of Dumfries or smaller. Our Bishop&#x2019;s House and Park is the foundation of Abergwili; a sovereign palace for that little hamlet. The Bishop himself is a man I like well;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; were he <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a Bishop I could like him far better! There is but one thing more I will add: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was Archbishop Laud&#x2019;s House! the portrait of that miserable chimera still hangs here; and we go every morning soon after seven o&#x2019;clock to do our devotions in a Chapel established by him. The present Bishop knows how I hate <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and does not disapprove much. I attend at the &#x201C;morning service&#x201D; out of politeness and to avoid scandal,&#x2014;but cannot boast that I pray much there. It will &#x201C;do thee neither ill <foreign>ne&#x2019; guid</foreign>!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280420-TC-MAC-01"><sic>4:369</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1828-04-20">20 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>However, I will <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> you about all that, dear Mother; for I hope we are soon to meet. I have just written to the Doctor to say that I expect to meet him in Liverpool on <hi rend="italic">Saturday evening</hi> first. I leave this on Friday morning; stay all night at a place called Glo&#x2019;ster (Gloucester), a town I wanted to see, then get into railways, to Birmingham, and finally to Liverpool, by a very easy route. I had some more visits; but give them up since John is come. The most part of Mr Welsh&#x2019;s people, as he himself is, are absent about Glasgow or west of that at sea-bathing: <pb id="pg-16-297" n="16:297"/>&#x201C;there will be the more room for you,&#x201D; says our little cousin.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie.</note> After a little pause at Liverpool I propose to Jack that we go over, and have a few days walking among the hills in North Wales. I will write to you how we get on,&#x2014;if I know correctly where you are! Jenny or some of them may write a word. Stay where you are, dear Mother, and bathe quietly; you are quite safe of me for some time yet,&#x2014;say two weeks almost; not till after the tides are done!</p>
<p>But I have to go out and ride with my Bishop; I must cease. Jane is well and cheery, still engaged among painters. I send my affectionate regards to all at Gill, Jamie, Mary, Jenny, and all the small ones: Good be with them all. Hoping soon to meet once again by God&#x2019;s great goodness, <closer><salute>I bid my dear Mother farewell for this day. Dear good Mother!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My own Babbie</salute>
<p>Is it credible, possible conceivable that Gambardella can be gone off to Liverpool without coming to bid me goodby and to take the pictures? I passed his house this evening and saw all the blinds removed&#x2014;and Wednesday being the day he spoke of when I saw him. I actually incline to believe the strange mortal has taken this french leave of me! I said that day; &#x201C;if I passed in a carriage I would <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> the pictures&#x201D; &#x201C;Why that?&#x201D; said he, as of course I will come to see you <hi rend="italic">just before</hi> I go, and will take them then&#x201D;?&#x2014; His conduct is very prepostrous&#x2014;but whom does he <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tire of and behave ill to&#x2014; You, be sure of it, will have your turn of his displeasure&#x2014; What sort of reason he can give to his own mind for quarrelling with <hi rend="italic">me</hi> I have not the faintest idea, unless it be that he mixes me up with Mazzini&#x2014;who must have made him furious by writing him a second letter about his subscription to the school, when the first remained unanswered&#x2014;the second had no better fate&#x2014; But why try to account for the behaviour of a man who with all his talent and kind impulses is <hi rend="italic">really</hi> hardly within the pale of rationality? The kind fates that are merciful &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">women, drunk people</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">fools</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An anon. epigram with many variations.</note> watch over him, go where he likes!</p>
<p>The same Fates watch over you and me (under the first of these categories)&#x2014;at this trying epoch of our household history <hi rend="italic">My</hi> trial may be said to have reached its crisis yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning the man proceeded to put on the paper on the <pb id="pg-16-301" n="16:301"/>Library having spent many days in preparing the canvass &#x26;c&#x2014;the paper realized my <foreign>beau-ideal</foreign> of paper&#x2014;a bright crimson flock&#x2014;much dearer than beseemed my modest means. Well I went into the room to see how he was getting on and conceive my dismay in finding this man who had hitherto seemed to thoroughly understand his work smearing and <hi rend="italic">tearing</hi> the paper as if he had suddenly been possessed with a Devil!&#x2014; I remonstrated&#x2014;and he cut off little bits and stuck them on the tears!! The paper moreover exhibited numberless dark stains of the batter and every piece that he put on made the matter worse&#x2014; The room was in the fair way of being completely spoiled after all my trouble and outlay&#x2014; I sent off for Pearson in an agony&#x2014; (Pearson was doing the whole thing for me by estimate) and it was two oclock before he arrived&#x2014;you may judge of my situation in the meanwhile seeing the destruction going on unable to put a stop to it&#x2014; When Pearson at last came he said at once that all that <supplied>[had]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> been put up (two whole pieces) must be torn off again&#x2014;and the man was sent home to his master with this news&#x2014;and there seemed every chance that my library would have to lie in that horrible unfinished state, till a law suit was settled between the paper-maker and Pearson!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This morning however the paper-hanger returned in a calm state&#x2014;declared that he perfectly understood his trade but that the whole lot of paper (9 pieces) which had been made on purpose for me&#x2014;was bad&#x2014;had been made too thin&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">could</hi> not be put up&#x2014;that he was now there by his masters orders to tear it all down again!&#x2014;if I still insisted on the same pattern I must wait eight days (!) till a new lot was made&#x2014; There was something magnamon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS for &#x201C;magnanimous.&#x201D;</note> in the man having taken all my scolding without laying the fault on the paper until he had his master&#x2019;s leave!&#x2014; To wait eight days was impossible besides I was pretty well disgusted with my crimson flock after walking up to the ancles in the tatters of it&#x2014;so I went up to the Papermakers and chose another which I think I shall like better after all&#x2014;and that the man is putting up rapidly a<supplied>[n]</supplied>d perfectly well&#x2014;his distracting manner of working yesterday having been caused apparently by the consciousness that he had got an impossible task&#x2014;</p>
<p>I had the discretion moreover to go to the paper shop in a fine yellow chariot with bright blue liveries&#x2014;not hired for the occasion but taken the advantage of&#x2014;and it is wonderful, I have observed, how business is smoothed for people when they go about it in <hi rend="italic">style</hi>&#x2014;this convenient equipage belonged to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Prior old Sterlings sister who is at present on a visit to him, and who came to take me to Knightsbridge <pb id="pg-16-302" n="16:302"/>to an early dinner&#x2014; She is a good kind woman as <hi rend="italic">still</hi> and simple as her brother is tumultuous and <hi rend="italic">complicated</hi>&#x2014;the strangest contrast! She besought me <hi rend="italic">with tears</hi>&#x2014; (for she looks on me as a sort of relict of her sister in law of whom she was very fond) to come to visit her at Brighton and I think I will go sometime&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">sometime</hi></p>
<p>I had a visit from my old Doctor the other day<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Morrah.</note>&#x2014; Sterling had told him that I was living in a smell of new paint&#x2014;would not take a room at <hi rend="italic">his</hi> house, and the kind old man drove down to remonstrate with me&#x2014; But he found me sitting in the garden in <hi rend="italic">a tent</hi> which I put up with my own hands&#x2014;of the gipsey sort&#x2014;and which has only one disadvantage that if a strong puff of wind comes the poles on which it rests blow over and the whole thing flaps down on the top of me&#x2014; This happened <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the other day while I was writing to my uncle!&#x2014;it played its part well however during Morrah&#x2019;s visit, and I seemed to be enjoying such rural felicity <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of the smell of new paint; that he fell away from his intended remonstrance&#x2014; He said I looked better but he &#x201C;wished I would grow a little fatter&#x2014;only I fear you are not one of the fat kind&#x201D;&#x2014; Alas no! if I were I should be much better natured&#x2014; Sterling says that he (Morrah) has since told him that he &#x201C;believed me to be seriously ill but it was of no use telling me so as I would never do anything for myself.&#x201D; Curious if I am &#x201C;seriously ill&#x201D; without knowing it!!</p>
<p>I heard from Carlyle today out of a Bishops palace!&#x2014;certainly no suitable place for such a hater of every thing connected with the Shovel hat!&#x2014; He seemed to be liking his new quarters however.&#x2014; Thirwall is a different sort of talker from poor Redwood! I suppose you will have a <hi rend="italic">glimpse</hi> of him shortly&#x2014;do not tell him of my paper trouble&#x2014;or any of my <hi rend="italic">troubles</hi> I wish him to get all the result without having it spoiled by mental contemplation of the unlovely means!</p>
<p>I write this at night&#x2014;my mornings are so busy&#x2014;for besides the looking after the peoples work and doing a deal of virtuous needle-work (chair covers &#x26;c&#x2014;) I have to write always to him&#x2014;and so very often to Geraldine about these eternal Mudies&#x2014;and so many incidental letters besides&#x2014;</p>
<p>Would to Heaven I could wish myself onto your sofa or you onto mine to have a right good talk, and plenty of good Babbie-kisses! One would fall to work again with so much better heart&#x2014; Tell me of your new Cook for godsake&#x2014;how you are pestered with these servants&#x2014; Is Walter coming?

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>It is late, 11 o&#x2019;clock or after; I have ridden <hi rend="italic">about forty miles</hi>, to look at nonsense of views &#x26;c; and have to be off tomorrow morning on the coach roof at eight: I therefore will not write a word here; I will carry the sheet on with me, and try to despatch it from Gloucester if I get happily there.</p>
<p>We had our grand dinner <hi rend="italic">last</hi> night: a Judge called Baron Rolfe,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Robert Monsey Rolfe (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24019"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), knighted, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>; a baron of the exchequer and judge since <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; created Baron Cranworth, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; lord chancellor, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, <date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>.</note> and about 20 advocates; a dreadful explosion of dulness, champagne, and <foreign>ennui</foreign>; which however I took little hand in, being empowered by His Reverence<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thirlwall.</note> to &#x201C;go out and smoke whenever I found it dull.&#x201D; Rolfe, first fiddle on this occasion, was a man I had seen at Stanley&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward John Stanley (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>;<ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26267"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), politician, husband of Henrietta Maria (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26271/?back=,26267"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400227-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:59</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-27">27 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (or some such place) playing fourth or fifth fiddle.

<p>The Bishop received your compliments (did I tell you) with much modesty and gratitude; mumbled something about <hi rend="italic">you</hi> being here, how happy &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>He has been most kind to me. Poor fellow, think of a solid Bishop <pb id="pg-16-304" n="16:304"/>riding post as we had to do today! It was literally altogether very good. Our talk has been extensive; rather interesting occasionally; always worth its wind or nearly so.

<p>I write to you in a new position&#x2014;and one of tolerable comfort&#x2014; I have for the present this room&#x2014;and indeed this whole house all to myself<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Liv<hi rend="italic">r</hi>pool&#x2019; indicates that I have met Br<hi rend="italic">r</hi> John there, in view of the Welsh Tour,&#x2013;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> did not prove a very interest<hi rend="italic">g</hi> or successful one.&#x2018;South Place&#x2019; is the Sterlings&#x2019; residence, in Knightsbridge&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note>&#x2014; I have made them put on a good fire, the day being wet&#x2014;have <pb id="pg-16-305" n="16:305"/><hi rend="italic">ordered the dinner</hi>&#x2014;have strengthened my mind with an adequate supply of bread and butter and sherry&#x2014;and now sit down, within a yard of the fire, to send you a blessing on your wayfarings and thanks for your letter which I had before I left home&#x2014; Sterling came with the carriage early to fetch me up here&#x2014;for no special reason&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">&#x201C;just for diversion&#x201D;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430707-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1843-07-07">7</date> and <date when="1843-07-08">8 July</date>]</ref>.</note> (as my Penfillan Grandfather<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh (b. <date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), paternal grandfather; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230606-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:369</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-06-06">6 June 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> said he eat cheese and bread in the forenoons)&#x2014;and I consented, because the day being wet and myself somewhat <hi rend="italic">low</hi>&#x2014;I thought <hi rend="italic">a change</hi> (Helens favourite prescription) might be of service&#x2014;particularly as he held out the prospect of my being left alone while he went to call for Charles Barton and to do some &#x201C;indispensible business&#x201D;&#x2014;one benefit resulting from the &#x201C;change&#x201D; you will gratefully acknowledge viz: the <hi rend="italic">better pens</hi> I have to act with&#x2014;it is not the pen&#x2019;s fault if my writing be illegible today&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Prior and Miss Allan went off this morning to Tunbridge<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tunbridge Wells, spa town in Kent, 29 mi.

He deserves it the shabby gigman that he is! Whatever stupid uses his Father might have put the money to; will he put it to better?&#x2014; One thing I was told that made me absolutely sick&#x2014;of the funeral expenses there was <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> pounds which Anthony as the heir was not <hi rend="italic">liable</hi> to pay&#x2014;it was for the part of the burial ground which the old man had reserved for himself beside his wife&#x2014;and Anthony kept that back&#x2014;his Father was applied to to pay down the twelve pounds&#x2014;in advance as it were for his own funeral!!! Oh my dear let us be thankful to God that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are not money-lovers! how hard of heart that rage for gain does make people!</p>
<p>Poor Pearson has lost his old Mother and is gone to the country to <pb id="pg-16-306" n="16:306"/>bury her&#x2014; You would have been <foreign>wae</foreign> [sad] to see the iron looking man yesterday going about quite flushed and with tears in his eyes. He told me he was sitting writing a letter to her to say he would come and pay her visit, when he received the accounts of her death&#x2014;she was turned of ninety&#x2014; I gave him a glass of wine and shook hands with him when he went away on his sad errand&#x2014;I felt so sisterly towards him&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have nothing to tell you today&#x2014;I have seen nobody since I wrote last except Mazzini who seemed in the fair way of having another tumour in his cheek&#x2014; I have asked Geraldine to translate his article<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dante Allighieri,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> 33 (<date when="1844-04-00">April 1844</date>): 1&#x2013;30.</note> for payment&#x2014;and she agrees&#x2014;Forster begged me to find a translator for it &#x201C;as he really wished to print it for the poor fellow&#x201D;&#x2014;and I could think of no likelier person than Geraldine&#x2014; He is to go to Lady Harriet<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Baring, aft<hi rend="italic">ds</hi> Lady Ashburton&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> on Wednesday&#x2014; John Mill leaving him no rest on that subject<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had been friendly with Lady Harriet for some time, possibly having met her on a visit to her father-in-law&#x2019;s house at Buckenham (see Greville, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> 2:52). Greville wrote in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> that Mill was &#x201C;sentimentally attached to her&#x201D; and later resented &#x201C;her indifference&#x201D; (7:286&#x2013;87). But F. A. Hayek says that, as in the case of his relations with TC, his later dislike arose from his loyalty to Harriet Taylor (<hi rend="italic">John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor</hi> [<date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>] 90).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;And now I will tell you a political secret&#x2014;but for gods sake speak not a syllable of it&#x2014;there is &#x201C;a movement&#x201D; in Italy projected in two months!!&#x2014;contrary to Mazzini advice who thinks two months <hi rend="italic">rather soon</hi>&#x2014;but if the leaders insist he will evidently <hi rend="italic">take part in it!</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mazzini thought the simultaneous uprisings in the Roman states and Naples inopportune and counselled Nicola Fabrizi and his Legion of Italy to postpone any action.

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>Last night, about half past seven, I arrived here safe at Maryland-Street, and my weary pilgrimings have again for a day or two terminated!</p>
<p>The Letter despatched from Glo&#x2019;ster would give you at the end of it a faint shadow of my desperate situation there. It was like a section of Bedlam that Bell Inn. Sound of harps and stringed instruments; <foreign>ruffing</foreign> [foot-stamping] of applausive barristers over table-oratory heard from the distance; waiters running about in a distracted state; hapless bagmen sitting round one, either preparing to go off &#x201C;by mail,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., on the mail coach.</note> or else swallowing punch in the hope to escape from their wretchedness by getting drunk. I had felt thankful and hap-hap-happy in the morning; but then I was mees-erable. I fled out into the streets, where indeed my duty lay, and there I wandered till late in the bright summer twilight; returning to my Inn, found it madder than ever; then called for my glass of brandy and hot-water too, and took it up to my bedroom, where, once I had locked the door, a kind of noble defiance came over me, and I went to sleep in the middle of the tumult, saying to it, What have I to do with thee? No gladder sight since I went on my travels than that of the railway omnibus next morning that was to take me out of the Bell Inn for all time and all eternity! The dirty scrub of a waiter grumbled about his allowance which I reckoned liberal; I added sixpence to it, and produced a bow which I was near rewarding with a kick,&#x2014;accursed be the race of flunkies!&#x2014;the Boots then clambered to the omnibus to say that he also had been hardly dealt with; I thought, As we are never to meet more thro&#x2019; all Eternity, thou too shall have another sixpence;&#x2014;and so at last by God&#x2019;s blessing we did get away, and embarked thro&#x2019; the verdant <hi rend="italic">Carse</hi> or plain of Severn, and could look abroad in peace over God&#x2019;s handiworks, and man&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-16-308" n="16:308"/><hi rend="italic">un</hi>flunkeyish industry, and in particular descry the hills (not entirely without emotion) where the Glo&#x2019;ster Puritans in their strait siege saw Essex&#x2019;s signal fires blaze up, and notice to them in spite of the bad weather that help was nigh.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:165.</note> Thank<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Heaven!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, variant of Mazzini&#x2019;s &#x201C;thanks God.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; We saw only the roofs and steeples of Cheltenham;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gloucestershire, 7 mi. NE of Gloucester and 42 mi. S of Birmingham.</note> quite enough for me. The country was lovely even under the grey blustery sky; I rode in the &#x201C;second class,&#x201D;&#x2014;much the best class in such circumstances as mine. Wor&#x2019;ster was three miles off the Station, westward of the station; I rode thither smoking, by the London road; duly noticed Malvern<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Worcestershire, where Jane and Thomas Wilson often stayed (see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421209-TC-JWI-01"><sic>15:224</sic><corr>TC to JWI, <date when="1842-12-09">9 Dec. 1842</date></corr></ref>).</note> &#x26;c, duly honoured every thing, and then was set down at some Crown Inn, quite vacant of customers, to a most blessed breakfast of coffee and ham and accompaniments about eleven o&#x2019;clock; a considerable Christian comf<hi rend="italic">ort</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251114-JBW-MAC-01"><sic>3:412&#x2013;13</sic><corr>JBW to MAC, <date when="1825-11-14">14 Nov. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> Before breakfast ceased, the Sky began pouring rain; I purchased a cotton umbrella; cleared up the distracting mysteries of my future railway course (for they have no &#x201C;time bills&#x201D; in those countries), and set rapidly out to explore the City.
From Severn Bridge I could see the <hi rend="italic">ground</hi> of Oliver&#x2019;s battle;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 7:326.</note> it was a most brief survey: a poor labourer whom I consulted &#x201C;had <hi rend="italic">hee</hi>rd of sitch a thing,&#x201D; wished to God &#x201C;we had another Oliver, Sir; times is dreadful bad!&#x201D; I spoke with the poor man a while; a shrewd well-conditioned fellow;&#x2014;left a shilling with him, about the only good deed I did all day. In the railway train (second class still) and on the road to the train, I had adventures of a small evil kind: two men to quench, who attempted (partly by mistake) to use me ill; they proved quenchable without difficulty,&#x2014;for indeed I myself was in somewhat sulphurous condition, not handy to quarrel with. One of them, my fellow&#x2014;passenger in the railway, took it into his head to smile visibly when I laid off my white broadbrim and suddenly produced out of my pocket my grey glengarry. He seemed of the mercantile head&#x2014;clerk species, and had been tempted to his impropriety by a foolish&#x2014;looking pampered young lady in tiger&#x2014;skin mantle whom he seemed to have charge of. I looked straight into his smiling face and eyes, a look which I suppose inquired of him, &#x201C;Miserable ninth part of the fraction of a tailor, art thou sure thou hast a right to laugh at me?&#x201D; the smile instantly died into another expression of emotion. When a man is just come out of a section of bedlam, and has still a long confused journey, in bad weather in the second class train, that <pb id="pg-16-309" n="16:309"/>is the time for getting himself treated with the respect due to genius! At Birmingham I had to take the first&#x2014;class, there being no second without waiting; and we whirled along hitherward,&#x2014;poor Goody&#x2019;s Letter within a few yards of me, but unattainable till the morrow; a curious reflexion for me at the moment. Foolish young women nearly sta<supplied>[r]</supplied>ved<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> us with bad air, and windows closed for the rain; but it was beautiful to get along <hi rend="italic">without</hi> either flunkeyism or disorder; and when the ready porter at the Station here seized hold of my luggage, and toiled with it till he was all in a sweat to get me some conveyance, and did at last get me a foot porter, I could not but thank the man with real gratitude real respect.&#x2014; At Maryland&#x2014;Street, where they still sat at wine, with Jack here, and a certain Miss Baird (I think) from Rossshire,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes Baird, a friend of the Welshes.</note> I was welcomed with open arms: I felt and feel comparatively as if I had got <hi rend="italic">home;</hi> and having kept pretty well last night, and received Goody&#x2019;s Letter this morning, it is now all right; in spite of the headache, the showery weather and all the rest of it. I did kiss Babbie for you; showing her my Letter for credential! But you must not give me any more such commissions; they are too delicate to transact before company. Poor little Jeannie, I was right glad to see her blithe bonny face again: she seems to me looking well, and is Mistress of the house here and bound to care for all.</p>
<p>The money order I will get cashed tomorrow; I had but 18/ left. I have spent all this morning talking to John; and now they are home from Church, and wait till I finish my Letter. I have to write to my Mother also.&#x2014; John is of course totally planless, wavers between a journey on foot into Wales, and one by sea into the United States! The weather too is bad and broken. Nothing can be settled, except that we must stay here &#x201C;for a day or two,&#x201D; and see. The two young damsels, John apprises me, are for being off to Helensburgh (the news from that are good); Alick will be left in the house himself. You, I suppose, would not at all like Liverpool in <hi rend="italic">these</hi> circumstances! Jack is lodged at a place called &#x201C;the Feathers&#x201D;; seems to dine here pretty often. We are going to see the Paulets, the Chorleys,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430725-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-25">24 [25] July</date></ref>.</note> the&#x2014;who all and the what all? I will &#x201C;fall in love&#x201D; with nobody. I will also write no more to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi> today for one.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>As, most likely, your hospitable imagination has sometimes followed me northward on my progress from your quiet kindly regions, it seems proper I should send you an authentic specification from this resting place I have now got to.</p>
<p>The outer seat at Bridgend, that morning, turned out to have been bespoken by another, a fellow sufferer in the interior; who accordingly took possession of it there; I remaining in confinement as far as Neath. There however there was deliverance into the sunshine, into the smoke of Morriston and Swansea;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Morriston is an industrial village, 2 mi. NNE of Swansea, SW Wales.</note> into all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, none of them very disagreeable, none of them indeed other than interesting, of a ride to Carmarthen, thro&#x2019;; Rebecca Gates, over steep eminences, thro&#x2019; a country pleasant tho&#x2019; ill-cultivated, thro&#x2019; a population cheerful and innocent of aspect tho&#x2019; somewhat out at elbows here and there. At Abergwili the Bishop in his wide secluded mansion sat waiting for me; all friendly, all quiet and green: nevertheless, as you predicted, I have to record that the last I have yet seen of <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> was at Llandough, blessings on its green trees and solitary knolls;&#x2014;it is the last I am yet like to see of that invaluable quality for some time! The Bishop led me incessantly about in search of the picturesque, on high trotting horses in all weathers, sometimes twenty miles off on one ride; conversation wise but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> restful going on all day, and prayers in Laud&#x2019;s Chapel, and other solemnities in other places going on from 7 in the morning till midnight. We had the Judge<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Robert Rolfe.</note> one evening and a shipload of noisy barristers. On friday morning I was not unwilling to embark into the green world again; on the mail coach towards Monmouth, towards Gloucester, towards Worcester, and Liverpool where I now heard that my Brother had arrived and was waiting for me. On Saturday evening I at length reached this house, for welcome pause of a day or two. On the morrow morning we set off,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact on Wed., <date when="1843-07-26">26 July</date>.</note> if the weather will hold up for a week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> in North Wales. I go to it as to a duty, with little hope of anything but toil from it; with almost a kind of wish that <pb id="pg-16-311" n="16:311"/>the clouds would become electric again, and honourably deliver me from it. But failing this, we shall have to go to the Isle of Man, which will be equally bad. The wicked, it is written, have no rest.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 48:22.</note> In a week, however, I shall be ready here again for the first Steamer into Annandale; and then in my Mother&#x2019;s house I will lie down and sleep again whatever befal!</p>
<p>This, in hurried style (for I am in dreadful hurry), is my travel&#x2019;s history<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 1.3.</note> and prophecy. I add to it a cordial remembrance to your good, kind, quiet Mother, whom I shall long remember; and many grateful thanks to you,&#x2014;and to <hi rend="italic">Madge Wildfire</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Redwood&#x2019;s mare, named after a character in Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Heart of Midlothian</hi>, &#x201C;mettlesome &#x26; fidgetty&#x201D; according to Redwood, who wrote to TC, <date when="1843-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, that he followed TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Itinerary with interest, but also not without some jealousy of that Bishop&#x2019;s &#x2018;High trotting horses&#x2019; and the picturesque rides he had to take you, &#x26; of his &#x2018;wise conversation&#x2019; withal. It was my hope you would be bored and tired there, and not again be tempted off from us just on beginning to nestle into your crib. &#x2026; My own spider&#x2014;like life gives me no other chance of catching any lovers of sphere musick&#x2014; May Yankees or Blue Devils therefore by and bye beset you.&#x201D;</note> and the St. Donat&#x2019;s Sea, which made my stay in your domain so useful and pleasant to me. Right hearty thanks and blessings to all.</p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>Your Letter lay waiting on the table this morning; many thanks to Goody for it, a poor sick Goody! I did not write yesterday, and have hardly a quarter of an hour for that object today: if you add <hi rend="italic">John</hi> to Liverpool, you will not expect Letters from me at present. Tomorrow we quit but for what <hi rend="italic">place</hi> becomes again uncertain; out of this place, with Jack appended to me, I must soon go; whitherward is not of much moment: to the air, to the Sea or the grass, all shall be equal to me. We had after some slight but sufficient deliberation settled for a week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> in North Wales, to commence by a sail over to Bangor or the Menai Bridge: by that I think we are likeliest to hold, tho&#x2019; today all manner of questionabilities, weather and what not have risen; and a sail to the Isle of Man<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Irish Sea, between Liverpool and N Ireland.</note> is proposed instead: this latter, as I at once declared my <hi rend="italic">indifference</hi> as to the whitherward, is likely to be given up again, and Wales to return whatever weather it may be. The whole thing is to last but a week; that I have stipulated for; and then I consider that it will be wise to become a <hi rend="italic">single</hi> man again, or at all events to go across to Annandale soon, if Jack is to continue with me. I think <pb id="pg-16-314" n="16:314"/>he will do better if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> resolutely take the command. His friendliness is great; but he goes about like a &#x201C;torch of confusion&#x201D;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> an intolerable element of chaos tied to your right hand. Poor Jack, I have many things to ask of him too; and gradually get them out of him by patience. His account of poor Alick is sufficiently distressing on some sides: a tragic history; may that prove the <hi rend="italic">crisis</hi> of it! My poor Brother, true companion of my young days, which all rise with a strange sad distinctness in my solitary hours at present, will be about arriving on a new shore in these very days. On a new arena to begin a new life; God grant it might be a wiser and more prosperous one!</p>
<p>Yesterday we went to call for the Chorleys:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Chorley (d. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>) and her da. Mary Ann (Phoebe) (<date when="1805-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">63</date>); see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18371009-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:328</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1837-10-09">9 Oct. 1837</date></corr></ref>. Also the second brother John Rutter Chorley (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5351"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet and previously sec.

They all lived at 2 Sandon Terrace, Upper Duke St., Jane and John Rutter being listed there in the <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date> Liverpool directory. TC mistook the age of the brothers, as the oldest was definitely Dr. William Brownsword Chorley (see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18341211-TC-UC-01"><sic>9:400&#x2013;1</sic><corr>TC to UC, <date when="1834-12-11">11 Dec. 1834</date></corr></ref>), now apparently manager of a slate quarry at Tremadoc, N Wales.

The youngest brother, Henry, lived in London.</note> joy to the ridge-tile at sight of us; and a long ethico-philosophical and miscellaneous discourse with the elder Brother the Mother and Daughter; which latter two are just bound for Wales, to the second Brother&#x2019;s house, who has gone to live in Tremadoc in that country: the invitations to bend thitherward were many and pressing,&#x2014;but waved aside, as was the invitation to a dinner here. The Brother&#x2019;s passionate entreaty to come and bear him company in his silent empty house on our return was much more tempting; nor did I entirely say NO to it. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> direct your Letters hitherward however; I will leave my trunks and all things here, in little Jeannie&#x2019;s care, who already has taken <hi rend="italic">wife-like</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420816-TC-JWC-01"><sic>15:21</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-08-16">16 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420818-JWC-JW-01"><sic>28</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1842-08-18">18 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> charge of me (blessings on her), and sent out my things to be washed without plague to me!</p>
<p>This day we went to call for Mrs Paulet;&#x2014;after a good deal of burbling from Jack, who however paid for the <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>, we got thither, half an hour before our time: there had been a Note sent about it by Jeannie, and as no answer had come I was not for going at all; but had we waited half an hour (which I found afterwards would have brought us to the time she mentioned) all would have been well, for&#x2014; Mrs Paulet was gone to Liverpool, and we drove quietly home again! The chances now are, it would appear, twofold: <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, that she never got Jeannie&#x2019;s Note till her arrival in town this morning; which will do <pb id="pg-16-315" n="16:315"/>very well: <hi rend="italic">second</hi>, that she counted herself safe till the hour we had mentioned (or rather <hi rend="italic">they</hi> had mentioned); which will do rather ill! But Jeannie seems to have no misgiving as to that latter chance; and so, at any rate, it must stand;&#x2014;and so, at any rate, I am well contented that it stand, for I was in no mood today to encounter the Moral Sublime in female headdress, and liked greatly better to return home in a silent condition.&#x2014; Passing along near some Catholic Chapel, and noticing a great crowd in a yard there, with flags, white sticks and brass-bands, we stopt of <supplied>[our?]</supplied> hackneycoachman; stept forth into the thing,&#x2014;and found it to be Father Matthew distributing the Temperance Pledge to the lost sheep of this place;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Theobald Mathew (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18328"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Irish Franciscan priest, known as the &#x201C;Apostle of Temperance&#x201D;; preached against intemperance in Ireland, England, Scotland, and the U.S.; heard by JWC in <date when="1843-08-00">Aug.</date> For his <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> campaign, see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400912-TC-MAC-01"><sic>12:254</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1840-09-12">12 Sept. 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> thousands strong, of both sexes, a very ragged, lost-looking squadron indeed! Father is a broad solid, most excellent-looking man, with grey hair, mild intelligent grey eyes, massive rather aquiline nose and countenance; in a long black frock-coat and white neckcloth, of aspect like any other excellent clergyman (Kingsley for example beaten down four inches shorter<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. Charles Kingsley, Sr.</note>): the very face of him attracts you. His speech, in a strong Cork accent, with the softest mild voice, worn <hi rend="italic">hoarse</hi> at present by much work, is quiet, clear, rational, and listened to with profound assent by the poor ragged people, about half or more of whom seemed to be Irish. We saw him go thro&#x2019; one whole act of the business,&#x2014;&#x201C;do,&#x201D; as Darwin would say, an entire batch of teetotallers: I almost cried to listen to him; and could not but lift my broadbrim at the end, when he called for God&#x2019;s blessing on the vow these poor wretches had taken, and murmur audibly, &#x201C;So be it!&#x201D; He has done about 80,000 in Manchester; already some 60,000 here (as a man told us), and means to continue &#x201C;all <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day, plase<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In imitation of Father Mathew.</note> God, and till tomorrow at sunset,&#x201D;&#x2014;which announcement the audience responded to with a low but heartfelt sound, far better than a shout.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1843-07-29">29 July</date>, reported: &#x201C;The Reverend Theobald Mathew, on account of a dispensation from the Pope to move about according to inclination, unrestricted by episcopal interference or control, arrived in Manchester last week. He has occupied upwards of nine hours a day in administering the pledge of total abstinence. Up to Saturday evening [<date when="1843-07-22">22 July</date>] 18,000 persons took the pledge. On Sunday it was administered to 30,000, and on Monday and Tuesday to 32,000, making in all a total of 80,000 pledged teetotallers in Manchester.&#x201D; In Liverpool he &#x201C;administered the pledge to upwards of 30,000 persons.&#x201D;</note> I have seen nothing <hi rend="italic">so</hi> religious since I set out on my travels, as the squalid scene of this day; nay nothing properly religious <pb id="pg-16-316" n="16:316"/>at all, tho&#x2019; I have been in Laud&#x2019;s Chapel, and heard duly, with damnable iteration, of &#x201C;the means of <hi rend="italic">graice</hi> and the hope of <hi rend="italic">dlary</hi>&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x201C;glory,&#x201D; imitating the curate&#x2019;s accent; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430719-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-19">19 July</date></ref>. &#x201C;We bless thee &#x2026; for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory&#x201D; (the General Thanksgiving of Morning Prayer, Book of Common Prayer).</note> from that portentous human snipe,&#x2014;not a bad fellow either, poor devil! But we are in a dreadful mess as to all that; and even a strong Bishop Thirlwall constitutes himself a Macready of Episcopacy as the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> he can do, and does it uncommonly well;&#x2014;and is &#x201C;a strong-minded man, sir,&#x201D; and a right worthy man in his unfortunate kind. As to Cuittikins&#x2014;O my Goody, what would have become of thee as Mrs Bishop Cuittikins, a &#x201C;<foreign>noughty</foreign>&#x201D; creature?</p>
<p>On the whole, it seems terribly absurd to run away for a week out of earshot from thee, and hide among foolish Welsh Hills which I do not even wish to see! Write for Saturday hitherward; Jeannie will forward it,&#x2014;I will tell her how when I have had time to consider. Perhaps I shall return <hi rend="italic">hither on</hi> Saturday: the one point I have any wish about was to see Snowdon, and that can be done before then. I will write to thee out of Wales: look out, but not with impatience on the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> postday after this; the second, I doubt, is not possible.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Wet</hi> news, but otherwise good from Helensburgh. <closer><salute>God bless thee my darling.

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>You got no Letter from me today; but Babie was appointed to inform you what had become of me; and here I am safe in the heart of Carnarvonshire, and in a condition (were the ink a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> more fluid&#x2014;which by libations from a punch-jug I have just made it!) to scribble you an authentic word, in hope of falling in with a Post-Office somewhere tomorrow. The Herr Zangbein [Mr. Tongleg],<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle&#x2019;s nickname, meaning &#x201C;long legged&#x201D;; derived from either &#x201C;tongs&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201207-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:296</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1820-12-07">7 Dec. 1820</date></corr></ref>), or from &#x201C;teeng,&#x201D; &#x201C;tang,&#x201D; or &#x201C;tong,&#x201D; a projecting spike, i.e., something long and thin.</note> poor fellow, has been of real use to me today; he knows the country and its conveyances, regulations, and peculiarities thoroughly well; he pays all the bills &#x26;c for me; and if Carnarvonshire contained in it one tolerable <pb id="pg-16-317" n="16:317"/>tobacco-pipe accessible to me, I should really have cause to declare myself &#x201C;far better than could be expected.&#x201D; We have had a most quiet grey day,&#x2014;for I insisted on sitting silent amid the pure green inarticulate Lea and blue Winds; to all waiters, <hi rend="italic">crimps</hi> of inns, and other fatal-looking persons I merely responded by a silent beckoning towards <hi rend="italic">Tongleg</hi>, who seemed to take delight in the office of answering. He is now out of doors smoking a cigar in the rain under the porch, and I am very glad to write once more a word to my own poor Goody, the patient recipient of all my twaddle.&#x2014; Alas here he is again, the cigar done! Nevertheless I continue, having handed him a Newspaper.</p>
<p>We got fairly on board a Steamer called the <hi rend="italic">Ayrshire Lassie</hi> about eleven o&#x2019;clock this day; a rainy morning issuing in a grey west-wind day, not unfavourable to the pensive mind that loves withal a moderate temperature. Arbuckle attended us on board: he is going to the equatorial regions again,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To Brazil.</note> poor fellow, in about a month&#x2014;under better auspices this time: a really admirable man in his still way; to whom I wish heartily well. Babie at parting was constituted mistress of all my goods, the keys were left with her; your Letters only being sealed. She is to darn socks for me, to sew on buttons &#x26;c &#x26;c: I kissed her pretty lips at parting, poor Babie; for she has been the cheerfullest thing I have seen since leaving thee: a really bonny phenomenon; one of the nicest bits of <foreign>lassies</foreign> you will find in a summer days riding. It is really sad that she should be left yonder in the <foreign>reek</foreign> of cookery and wine-drinking, and stolid dulness;&#x2014;I wonder what the young men are about that they do not marry her forthwith, and almost steal her away the good little child! Nothing could be kinder or wiser than she has all along shewn herself.</p>
<p>But as for our journey,&#x2014;it was sea and lime-stone Mountain, bay and promontory; Great Orme&#x2019;s Head, Little Orme&#x2019;s Head, <hi rend="italic">Pen Maen Maur</hi> (a Mountain not unlike Criffel, washed by the Sea),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Great and Little Orme&#x2019;s Heads are promontories on the N coast of Caernarvonshire, ca. 3&#xBD; mi. N and NE of Conway. Penmaenmawr is a mountain (1,550 ft.) ca. 4&#xBD; mi. SW of Conway, the last of the Snowdon range. Criffel is a mountain range in SE Kirkcudbrightshire (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410718-TC-JAC-01"><sic>13:187</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-07-18">18 July 1841</date></corr></ref>).</note> and then towns, Beaumaris, Bangor, the Strait of Anglesea, and the Menai Bridge, clearly a wonder of the world: altogether a very reasonable day, since you were allowed to sit silent and look at it. In the Mersey River, coming out along with us, were from 3 to 2 hundred ships, the morning&#x2019;s message of that great smoky Monster; and at night we are <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, in the eternal slate wilderness; one of the dullest Inns I ever sat in, truly almost an enchanted palace, for it is a huge place like a <pb id="pg-16-318" n="16:318"/>Castle, and of the best equipment; all kept by a solid Scotch Farmer named Johnstone;&#x2014;and owing to the badness of trade, there seems to be not a soul in it but our two selves; or the rest at least are all in apartments, and sit remote from the &#x201C;Coffee-room,&#x201D; thro&#x2019; which only the Mountains and the Night have the privilege of looking in at the windows. We came in a kind of tub-gig from Bangor, 14 miles; well defended from the rain; already supplied with tea, and possessed of a pipe tho&#x2019; a scandalously bad one. We have had one temperate glass of brandy, and a walk out to look at &#x201C;the old tower&#x201D;; it is now past ten, all quiet, and if I had done scribbling here, I am off to bed.&#x2014; Tomorrow we propose climbing Snowdon; but the weather alas promises ill. Small matter to me <hi rend="italic">which</hi> way! I have already seen somewhat; and shall know always where to conceive <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi> as resident in future. This place is some four miles from the end of a narrow Lake among wild barren gnarly slate hills; or rather it stands at the junction of two Lakes (once one), which gradually contract a little farther eastward (Snowdon crushing himself there very close upon his neighbour <hi rend="italic">Glyddir</hi>) into a certain Pass of Llanberws, very frightful to see (it would appear); at the old Tower tonight about nine in a drizzly evening, it was the strangest scene I ever looked on: A world all of slate, huge Mountains, stumpy blunt blocks, small fragments and fractions sticking thro&#x2019; the patches of grass,&#x2014;slate, slate everywhere.

<salute>My dear,</salute>
<p>Two days and not a line from any of you! Your accustomed punctuality taken into account I find this very myst<hi rend="italic">er</hi>ous.</p>
<p>When the postman brought me today only a <hi rend="italic">n</hi>ote from the never failing Geraldine, and a&#x2014;Newspaper for you, I really turned quite sick with apprehension of I know not what. It is not right to have inflicted such a feeling on me, unless there be some very imperative reason. Meanwhile I cannot write to you&#x2014; You do not deserve that I should&#x2014; And I am too uncomfortable for writing, until I know the meaning of your silence.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Jack will not write; therefore I must write to you, one word: I have Jane to write to also, and really not five minutes to do it; so I must be <hi rend="italic">brief</hi>.</p>
<p>We are well, and are <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the thing we proposed to do,&#x2014;which I hope will be a good thing! We came away from Liverpool yesterday morning by a Steamboat to Bangor. We have been a pretty way into <pb id="pg-16-320" n="16:320"/>the interior of Wales; we have climbed over their highest Mountain (today, in the middle of mist); we have had various adventures, not unpleasant; and are now lodged in the house of a Mr Chorley a friend and admirer of mine, with whom we shall likely stay over tomorrow. A pleasant enough journey then will bring us in contact with the Liverpool Steamers again, and then we shall come across to our old place;&#x2014;and the only farther tourifying or travelling that will then remain for us will be a voyage over to Annandale in some steamer that is convenient. Probably if all go well, in something like a week hence. But you shall <hi rend="italic">hear</hi>, dear Mother, when we get to Liverpool, more minutely than now. At present I can add no other word, except a hearty wish that I, for one, were at Scotsbrig beside you at this hour: perhaps it would be better for me!</p>
<p>Good night, dear good Mother; a blessing to you and to all and every of you.</p>
<p>Whether Jack is coming back with me I know not: but should rather apprehend not&#x2014;as the <foreign><hi rend="italic">sough</hi></foreign> [general feeling] of him goes at present. However, one cannot say.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Once more good night, and blessings on you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest,</salute>
<p>We did not perish on the summit of Snowdon today, but only gazed over precipices into whirlpools of mist; got down safe;&#x2014;and are at present well lodged in the hospitable C<supplied>[ott]</supplied>age of the younger Chorley (the squinting one), who lives here &#x201C;managing a Slate Quarry&#x201D; for his own behoof; and who received me as he would an <hi rend="italic">Avatar</hi> of Vishnu!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Incarnation of the second god of the Hindu triad.</note> A really hospitable excellent little man. He has made me brandy and hot-water ready with toast, pipes &#x26;c &#x26;c, and inquires most pointedly &#x201C;how Mrs Carlyle is&#x201D;; and will drive us to-morrow in tub-car or even pony phaeton to see the sublimities of his Slate Quarry; and otherwise do wonders: in short we are extremely well here;&#x2014;and shall get back to Liverpool, I hope, about Monday, and <hi rend="italic">end</hi> this Expedition more handsomely than at one time could have been hoped. I snatch a moment from amid the jingle of glasses, and <pb id="pg-16-321" n="16:321"/>leave John to talk (<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign>)&#x2014;and write one word to my poor Goody to this effect. God bless her, poor little <foreign>bairn</foreign>; she is too far away from me tonight.</p>
<p>Our expedition over Snowdon was a most laborious walk of 14 miles; Snowdon consists, I think, of some six or seven circular winding ridges of slate precipices, soaring beyond the eagles flight; scraggy sloping on one side, sheer down on the other: the mist met us today about 1000 feet from the top, and one might as well have been in the Thames Tunnel for any sight!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tunnel under the Thames in London, connecting Wapping on the N bank to Rotherhithe on the S; constructed, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1843-00-00">43</date>, originally for foot passengers but later a railway tunnel.</note> We had a guide (for the sake of Tean-gleg&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Variant of John Carlyle&#x2019;s nickname, Tongleg.</note> carpetbag;&#x2014;I carry no luggage but a razor, shavingbrush, shirt and pocket comb): we met at the top of the mountain two other large parties from opposite sides; like <hi rend="italic">ghosts</hi> of parties escorted by their Charons:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ferryman of the dead over the Styx.</note> it was very strange, almost ghastly; I shall always remember that bitter windy mist on the pinnacle of Britain,&#x2014;and will <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> Goody all about it, at some better time.</p>
<p>The Day after tomorrow, however, I mean to get upon the Coach roof; go along the North Coast <hi rend="italic">till I come in contact with a Liverpool Steamer</hi>; and there embark, and in Heaven&#x2019;s name end these tumblings and tourifyings: I find I do not at bottom care two pence for all the picturesqueness in the world; and really have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> my picturesque affairs to a very tolerable extent now, I think. Heaven help us!</p>
<p>What Goody is to do; where <hi rend="italic">she</hi> to go for a little country air? Dearest, there is nothing here I can invite thee to: canst thou contrive aught for thyself? Sussex coast with Macreadys, Suffolk with Bullers; anywhere, anyhow in honesty:&#x2014;alas, in this endless whirl I cannot get a moment to consider of anything whatever. It does become <hi rend="italic">too much</hi>. I send thee my love and my prayers. Good be ever with thee Dearest.</p>
<p>I hope to find a Letter in Liverpool: shall I not? No such <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> as these of mine were ever written before by any rational man&#x2014;<closer><salute><foreign>eheu</foreign> [alas]!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>I write to you <hi rend="italic">in the vague</hi> as you desired that I would&#x2014;tho it would have suited my practical spirit better to have waited until you &#x201C;found a fixed point&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well! the most remarkable thing I have to tell you is that I&#x2014;little I&#x2014;have been to Tunbridge Wells!! Went and came in the same day!&#x2014; you may guess then with what <hi rend="italic">Spirit</hi> of locomotion&#x2014; &#x2014;John Sterling came in the beginning of the week&#x2014;and since then has been I am sure in one thousand on<supplied>[e]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> hundred cabs and other vehicles to say the least&#x2014; He was going to Tunbridge to visit M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Prior, and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Prior&#x2014; having as I told you conceived a wonderful liking for me he proposed to take me with him&#x2014;so we left this at seven oclock yesterday morning and were at Tunbridge by half after nine! and at the Wells an hour after that<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently JWC and Sterling went by rail to Tonbridge, 30 mi.

S to Tunbridge Wells.</note>&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Prior gave us the most animated welcome&#x2014;an early dinner served on plate&#x2014;at the most magnificent Hotel imagination ever painted to itself, and drove us back to Tunbridge in her carriage. I should detest <hi rend="italic">living</hi> at Tunbridge Wells&#x2014;even in that most magnificent Hotel! but it was charming to look at with all its &#x201C;curiosities and niceties&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. &#x201C;&#x2018;Curiosities and niceties of a civilised house.&#x2019;&#x2014;Old phrase of my father&#x2019;s&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:221).</note> for a few hours. and the drive from the Wells to Tunbridge was really as picturesque as the lover of nature (not I) could possibly desire. John is back again today to Ventnor&#x2014;whither I could not accompany him for plenty of good reasons&#x2014;first because my chaos is not settled yet&#x2014;and still more final&#x2014;&#x201C;the Maurices&#x201D; are going to ruralize with him for a month on their own suggestion!&#x2014; He poor fellow candidly acknowledge<supplied>[d]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted. Anna and F. D. Maurice. Frederick Maurice writes: &#x201C;Sterling had now settled &#x2026; in the Isle of Wight. &#x2026; [A] change &#x2026; had been taking place in the relations between Sterling and my father. On this subject my father bitterly reproached himself throughout life. Sterling had more and more passed under Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s influence, and as more and more his opinions and my father&#x2019;s diverged, my father&#x2019;s anxiety and distress at the change in his friend&#x2019;s views of life, drove him again and again into indignant protest, and, as he thought afterwards, into fierceness of expression that he could not excuse. &#x2026; Always his conscience seems to have smitten him for not having been sufficiently gentle, sufficiently sympathetic, with not having helped instead of having disputed with his friend&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life of Frederick Dennison Maurice</hi> 1:345). Nevertheless, the rift was there; Maurice was to regret TC&#x2019;s biography of Sterling; and, in a letter to Charles Kingsley, he later described his distress at a dinner-party dispute about Emerson among himself, TC, and Sterling, <foreign>viz.</foreign>, about &#x201C;the creation of all things and all substances by man&#x2019;s thought&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Life</hi> 1:346).

He defended TC for attacking the clergy, which he thought good &#x201C;for us&#x201D;: &#x201C;I cannot find that Carlyle leads us directly to a centre; but I do find that he makes us despair for want of one, and that he expresses the indirect wailings of men in search of it better than all the other writers of the day.&#x201D; At this time, in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, after the death of Susannah Sterling (who was Anna Maurice&#x2019;s sister), the Maurices were &#x201C;more than ever anxious &#x2026; to comfort Sterling &#x2026; and to be of help to the little ones.

<salute>My dear <foreign>Bairn</foreign>,</salute>
<p>Here we are at last, out of the Hills and the rain-torrents and confusions; quietly waiting for the Welsh Tour&#x2019;s terminating&#x2014;by a Steamer to Liverpool tomorrow morning. Thank Heaven! Not that all has not <pb id="pg-16-326" n="16:326"/>been what they call &#x201C;well&#x201D;; but &#x201C;well&#x201D; in the travelling way is not near good enough for a poor wretch like me. I have been awake at all hours from 3 to 6; I have &#x26;c &#x26;c: in fine, thank God here I am!</p>
<p>We left Chorley&#x2019;s this morning at seven; the good Chorley accompanying us with smiles and benedictions to the side of the Coach; a Mackintosh Cape too was not the least of his favours. He is the cheeriest, kindliest, <supplied>[beste?]</supplied>-humoured little man I have for many a day fallen in with; he quite gained my heart by these qualities,&#x2014;he had well nigh induced me to take up my autumnal <hi rend="italic">residence</hi> in a Lodging in his Village, just over the way from him: it was very cheap, room in it for Goody and Ellen;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> decent people;&#x2014;cheap, clean, but very <hi rend="italic">damp</hi>, very distant (for some of the parties): I do not think it is likely <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will say yea; tho&#x2019; I did promise to consult you! The region is rocky, picturesque, but barren, weedy; the natives have almost no English, and I doubt extremely little sense;&#x2014;moreover, it seems and is said to be the dread-fullest place for <hi rend="italic">wet</hi> that could anywhere be met with; Dumfriesshire a mere Sahara to it. Tremadoc will not do, will it? I was for trying it a week on my own basis; but Jack would not (having the perpetual motion in him), so it is left behind us over the slate hills. The women Chorleys are going thither early next week: does that make you shriek at the idea!&#x2014; Well, there is something right good in that worthy little Chorley; I shall long remember him as the pleasantest thing I have seen in Wales. Blessed be Heaven however there is a Liverpool Steamer tomorrow morning: perhaps I shall get some sleep in my old bed there;&#x2014;at all events I shall get to Annandale in the course of the week, and there&#x2014;! Ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There will be a Letter from thee tomorrow in Baby&#x2019;s hands;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s.</note> perhaps more than one. I do want much to hear about all thy <hi rend="italic">outs</hi> and thy <hi rend="italic">ins</hi>. My poor Goody!&#x2014; As for myself I will not try to write any farther in these present circumstances, where pen, place, head, hand, paper and ink are all against me. I should like well to hear that the Painting of the House was done, and Goody free for some country or sea-side expedition, where I might be in waiting for her, or join her, or in some way see the face of her again!</p>
<p>I wrote to Jeannie yesterday; heralding our advent: she will get the Letter tomorrow morning.&#x2014; Here is dinner! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu, adieu</foreign>.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dearest</salute>
<p>The Postman presented me your letter tonight in Cheyne Walk with a bow extraordinary&#x2014; He is a jewel of a Postman&#x2014;whenever he has put a letter from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> into the box he both <hi rend="italic">knocks</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rings</hi> that not a moment may be lost in taking possession of it&#x2014;in acknowledgement whereof I crossed the street one day, when Cuttikins<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;B<hi rend="italic">p</hi> Terrot&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> who staid a week and returned twice was with me, and at that moment doing the impossible to be entertaining&#x2014;for the purpose of saluting his (the postmans) Baby the which he was carrying out for an airing&#x2014;the rage of Cuttikins at this interruption was considerable&#x2014;he looked at me as if he could have eaten me raw and remarked with a concentrated spleen&#x2014;&#x201C;Well I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> say never did I see any human being so improved in <hi rend="italic">amiability</hi> as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are!&#x2014; Every <hi rend="italic">body</hi>&#x2014;and every <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> seems to be honoured with a particular affection from you!&#x201D; every <hi rend="small-caps">thing</hi> thought I except <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;but I contented myself with saying &#x201C;isnt it a darling baby?&#x201D; Poor Cuttikins his Aunt did not die&#x2014;so he is gone with the <pb id="pg-16-328" n="16:328"/>prospect of alas&#x2014;of having to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> ere long&#x2014; The last day he came John Sterling exploded him in a way that would have done your heart good to see&#x2014; John looked at me as much as to say &#x201C;does he bore you?&#x201D;&#x2014;and I gave my shoulders a little shrug in the affirmative&#x2014;whereupon John jumped to his feet and said in a politely under tone as audible however for the Bishop as for me &#x201C;Well my good friend if you cannot keep your engagement with me, I must go by myself&#x2014;I am too late already!&#x201D;&#x2014;the cool assurance of this speech was inimitable, for I had no engagement in the world with him!&#x2014;but Terrot suspecting nothing sprang to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> feet and was off in a minute with apologies for having <hi rend="italic">detained</hi> me!</p>

I &#x2026; am far from sharing my dear partner&#x2019;s disgust with mankind, odious as many sides of them are. &#x2026; I shall certainly not leave Lucie, and she will probably stay here till the end of <date when="1843-07-00">July</date>&#x201D; (Janet Ross, <hi rend="italic">Three Generations of Englishwomen</hi> 1:187). She had apparently returned to England with her da., Lucie Duff Gordon, and her grandda., Janet: &#x201C;I am the most foolish of grandmothers&#x201D; (1:185). On <date when="1843-10-25">25 Oct.</date> she wrote that she had been engaged by Longmans to trans. L. von Ranke, <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter der Reformation</hi>, 5 vols.

But you know may dislike to encounter the public in my own person, my distrust of myself, and my liking for steady <hi rend="italic">respectable</hi> work. &#x2026; I welcome the forced absorption in drudgery as a potent reason against painful meditations.

The meeting finally took place, <date when="1843-07-26">26 July</date>, in a mutual acquaintance&#x2019;s house (not named), both Lady Harriet and her husband being very friendly.

I heard Milnes saying at the Shuttleworths that &#x201C;Lord <pb id="pg-16-330" n="16:330"/>Ashley was the greatest man alive;&#x2014;he was the only man that Carlyle <hi rend="italic">praised</hi> in his book&#x2014;&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Ashley Cooper (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; <ref target="volume-16/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6210"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Lord Ashley; 7th earl of Shaftesbury, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; philanthropist and reformer who brought about many improvements in the conditions of coal miners and working children. There is no direct reference to Lord Ashley in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi>, although there may be veiled allusions to him as one of the protectors of the people against the exploitation of manufacturers. Milnes&#x2019;s own evaluation of <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> was that TC had written a book &#x201C;which is, as Mademoiselle D&#xE9;jazet says of a certain passion,&#x2018;<foreign>toujours la m&#xEA;me et toujours na&#xEF;ve</foreign> [always the same and always naive].&#x2019; It would be very dangerous if turned into the vernacular and generally read. It is most unjust and insulting to all but the utterly ignorant and helpless, calling Peel &#x2018;Sir Jabez Windbag,&#x2019; and every attempt at legislation or good of any kind a &#x2018;Morrison&#x2019;s pill.&#x2019; It has sold very well; and the author looks a little fatter and better for it&#x201D; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:293). Harriet Martineau expressed similar views to Fanny Wedgwood: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">very</hi> bad, insolent, bitter, one-sided, full of weary repetitions. &#x2026; His injustice to the aristocracy is shameful,&#x2014;and his conceit &#x2026; .
