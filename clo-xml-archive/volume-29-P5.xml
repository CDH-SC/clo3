<p>The editors again express their particular gratitude to the British Academy, which has made the Carlyle Letters a British Academy Research Project, and to the members of its Committee on Academy Research Projects and its assistant secretary, Kenneth Emond. We likewise are grateful to the National Endowment for the Humanities, which generously awarded the project a three-year collaborative research grant. Our particular thanks go to Margot Wells Backas for her advice and assistance in preparing the NEH application.</p>
<p>We also recognize a continued indebtedness and gratitude for help and permissions to the Beinecke Library, Yale University; the librarians, staff, and those responsible for the Bodleian Library, particularly Clare Brown; the British Library and staff of its Special Collections; the Ewart Library, Dumfries; Edinburgh Central Library; Duke University&#x2019;s Perkins Library; Leslie Morris and Jeannie Rathbun of the Houghton Library, Harvard University; the Jagiellonian Library, Cracow; the Manchester Central Library; the William Brown Central Library of Liverpool; the Edinburgh University Library, its librarian, Ian Mowat, and its head of Special Collections, Richard Ovenden, and his staff; the National Library of Scotland, its librarian, Ian McGowan, and Murray Simpson and the Department of Manuscripts, and the Issue Desk; Jenni Calder of the National Museums of Scotland; the Local History Centre, Haddington Public Library, and its librarians, Chris Roberts and Veronica Wallace; Trinity College Library, Dublin; and the Howard family and Castle Howard Archives, York. We further wish to thank Consignia for its support, particularly Martin Cummins and John Ward; the Dean and Faculty of Arts and the Department of English Literature, Edinburgh University; Peter Scott and Bob O&#x2019;Malley of Edinburgh University Computing Service; Peter Burian and Lawrence Richardson of the Duke University Greek and Latin departments; Paul Mangiafico of the Duke Scriptorium; Tony McKinley; Uta Thompson, formerly curator of Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea, and the National Trust; Fiona Auchterlonie, curator of Carlyle&#x2019;s Birthplace, Ecclefechan, Martin Gostwick of Hugh Miller&#x2019;s Cottage, Cromarty, both of the National Trust for Scotland; the Scottish National Portrait Gallery; Rosemary Ashton; David Daiches; Owen Dudley Edwards; Brent Kinser; Anne Mason; Joseph Scott for his work on Carlyle&#x2019;s half-brother John in Canada; Graham Storey; Christopher Strachan; Virginia Surtees; John Sutherland; Liz Sutherland; Rodger Tarr; and Jonathan Usher. A particular tribute <pb id="lastpage-29-viii" n="29:viii"/>must be paid to David Southern for the valuable part he continues to play as Managing Editor of the Duke Carlyle office, where his contribution is well beyond the call of duty.</p>
<p>As from the publication of this volume, Professor K. J. Fielding will give up his senior editorship, while remaining as advisory editor.</p>
<p>With great sadness, we note the death of Robert Mirandon (<date when="1935-00-00">1935</date>&#x2013;<date when="2001-00-00">2001</date>), copy editor through volume 29 of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi>. With the project from the first volumes, he developed with editor Charles Richard Sanders and others the rules for its particular editorial style. His work has been invaluable and will be much missed.</p>

<p>This volume covers all of <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> and <date when="1855-01-00">January</date> through <date when="1855-06-00">June 1855</date>. It contains 269 letters, 242 from Thomas Carlyle and 27 from Jane Welsh Carlyle.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In addition to TC&#x2019;s 242 letters, three are noted from sale catalogues but are not included in the statistics; nonetheless, they are included in the text so that we have an indication of their existence. Some 69 percent of TC&#x2019;s letters have not previously been published, 20 percent have been published, and 11 percent have previously been quoted from briefly; of JWC&#x2019;s 27, 30 percent have not previously been published, 63 percent have been published, and 7 percent quoted from. The reversal in proportion of unpublished to published between TC and JWC comes, of course, partly from TC&#x2019;s collecting and editing of JWC&#x2019;s letters for publication after her death; but the high proportion of TC&#x2019;s unpublished letters also comes from the collections of his letters to his family and the Ashburtons that are now fully available for publication (MS: NLS Acc. 9086 and Acc. 11388).</note> But in celebration of the bicentenary of Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s birth in Haddington (<date when="1801-07-14">14 July 1801</date>), this introduction places her letters at the center, despite Thomas&#x2019;s letters making up 90 percent of this volume. Of course, respective approaches to Welsh Carlyle and Carlyle as <hi rend="italic">writers</hi> have always had to deal with this imbalance: Thomas, a prolific letter writer as well as author of many essays and multivolumed histories, monolith of the Victorian age, seems overwhelming; while Jane&#x2019;s reputation, even before Thomas edited her letters for publication after her death, rested on her narrative skills in the more domestic, &#x201C;smaller&#x201C; field of conversation and private letters. Thomas&#x2019;s contemporary view of her narrative skills depends on exactly that juxtaposition of &#x201C;domestic&#x201C; and &#x201C;small&#x201C;: &#x201C;even with nothing to tell but the flight of the Cat, you can make a very pretty story&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530401-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:97</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-04-01">1 April 1853</date></corr></ref>). But others were more critical; William Bell Scott, offended in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> by Thomas&#x2019;s response to his <hi rend="italic">Poems by a Painter</hi> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541026-TC-WBS-01">TC to WBS, <date when="1854-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref> and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541116-TC-WBS-01">TC to WBS, <date when="1854-11-16">16 Nov. 1854</date></ref>), retrospectively assessed her storytelling skills as being self-consciously constructed. This, for us, is evidence of her skill, but for him a criticism: &#x201C;she was evidently a kindly entertainer, and desirous of the reputation of a <hi rend="italic">raconteuse</hi>, so she told us the story of &#x2018;the cock that crew in the morn,&#x2019; which appeared to me to show symptoms of considerable dressing-up, &#x2018;cooking&#x2019; as Sir Henry Cole used to say.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2. William Bell Scott, <hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Notes</hi> (<date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>) 1:271.</note> Indeed, Jane was the storyteller whose &#x201C;various misadventures&#x201C; were to be formed into a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chelsean Nights Entertainment</hi>,&#x201C; once they became &#x201C;sufficiently remote to be laughed over&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-25/lt-18500918-JWC-TC-01"><sic>25:221</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1850-09-18">18 Sept. 1850</date></corr></ref>); this <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> conceit in a letter to Thomas allows Jane to hint both at difficulties hidden from him and <pb id="pg-29-x" n="29:x"/>the idea that he also has to be placated and distracted like Scheherazade&#x2019;s husband.</p>
<p>More perhaps than Thomas&#x2019;s, her letters reflect back to her correspondents what they both want and expect from her. To one of the surviving Donaldson sisters in Haddington, among the few remaining links with her childhood, she writes of Jess&#x2019;s letters as both a reward and the currency of love: &#x201C;It gets into my <hi rend="italic">pocket</hi>, where no other letters get; and I carry it about on me for days; as one used to one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">love-letters</hi> long ago! And only when it begins to get worn-looking, do I lay it in the little old wainscoat chest I brought with me from <hi rend="italic">Home;</hi> where I keep only relic<supplied>[s]</supplied> of my Mother&#x2014;and the most precious of my paper<supplied>[s]</supplied>&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550119-JWC-JDO-01">JWC to <sic>JD</sic><corr>JDO</corr>, <date when="1855-01-19">19 Jan. 1855</date></ref>). She thus both flatters Jess Donaldson and continues to inscribe her mother as a secular saint, a position Grace Welsh had hardly held in her lifetime. She also uses one of her common interpretations of her self, the spoiled child, to flatter Jess: &#x201C;You are <hi rend="italic">spoiling</hi> me&#x2014;making a downright little spoilt child of me!&#x2014; Oh you needn&#x2019;t laugh, and say I am too old for that! One never is too old for liking to be much <hi rend="italic">made of;</hi> and for feeling a little &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">carried</hi>&#x201C; (as we called it in Scotland) in consequence! I feel myself &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">one and somewhat</hi>,&#x201C; when I think how much they care for me at Sunny Bank!&#x201C; This &#x201C;one and somewhat&#x201C; is another expression for her need to assert her individual worth, like her &#x201C;I-ety,&#x201C; and the &#x201C;I too am here&#x201C; principle (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350604-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>8:138</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1835-06-04">4 June 1835</date></corr></ref>), which led her to question Neuberg&#x2019;s kindness to her: &#x201C;Sometimes I think it is because I am &#x2018;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s wife&#x2019;&#x2014;and then I feel tempted to gather all the things you have <hi rend="italic">given</hi> me and fling them at your head&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540614-JWC-JN-01">JWC to JN, [<date when="1854-06-14">14 June 1854</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>She jokes about their brother to Thomas&#x2019;s family. Sending two photographs of Thomas and herself to James Carlyle, &#x201C;one of your distinguished Brother in his <hi rend="italic">beard</hi>, and one of my less distinguished self, without beard or other unusual ornament,&#x201C; she both pairs and opposes Thomas and herself. But she also customarily satirizes Thomas in relation to the world. In the same letter, she describes a visit from two elderly nieces of a previous minister at Hoddam, &#x201C;as old as the hills and dressed in clothes that might have been part of a stage-wardrobe in the time of Ben Johnson!&#x2014;and minds in such a state of trustful innocence that they actually took for gospel <hi rend="italic">every word that Mr Carlyle said!!</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550424-JWC-JC-01">JWC to JC, <date when="1855-04-24">24 April 1855</date></ref>). This dramatization of events in her world is a familiar technique, making vivid for her readers the life that she and Thomas led in London, undercutting Thomas and centering herself in a way that her &#x201C;position as the wife of a <hi rend="italic">literary man</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540116-JWC-MS-01">JWC to MS, <date when="1854-01-16">16 Jan. 1854</date></ref>) did not make automatic.</p>
<p>One of Jane&#x2019;s best-known set pieces, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="small-caps">Budget</hi> of a Femme incomprise</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550212-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1855-02-12">12 Feb. 1855</date>]</ref>), is cast in the form of a report of an address to the houses of Parliament, that most dramatic of political arenas. It epitomizes her use of satire to attack Thomas:</p>
<q><pb id="pg-29-xi" n="29:xi"/>Mercy! to think there are women, your friend Lady Ashburton for example (&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">rumeur</hi></foreign>&#x201C; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sensation</hi>&#x201C;) I say, <hi rend="italic">for example;</hi> who spend not merely the &#x201C;additimental&#x201C; pounds, I must make such pother about; but <hi rend="italic">four times my whole income</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Ball</hi> of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> night! And none the worse for it; nor anyone the better!&#x2014;It is&#x2014;&#x201C;what shall I say?&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">curious</hi> upon &#x201C;my honour!&#x201C; But just in the same manner M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Freeman might say; &#x201C;to think there are women, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle, for example, who spend <hi rend="italic">three pounds, fourteen shillings</hi> on one dressing-gown! And I with just <hi rend="italic">two loaves</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eighteen pence</hi> (from the Parish) to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> on, by the week!&#x201C;</q>
<p>Thus she explains her financial scrimping (foregrounding Thomas&#x2019;s thoughtlessness and lack of attention to her needs as keeper of the household finances) within her reported speech on &#x201C;My <hi rend="italic">Bill of Ways and Means</hi>&#x201C; and she embeds within it a clever class hierarchy of comparative expenditure where her implicit criticism of Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s aristocratic expenditure is counterbalanced by Mrs. Freeman&#x2019;s view from below of her own &#x201C;extravagance,&#x201C; ensuring Thomas&#x2019;s response will be one of humor, &#x201C;great laughter&#x201C; and acquiescence: &#x201C;thriftiest, wittiest and cleverest of women! I will set thee up to a certainty, and thy &#xa3;30 more shall be granted, thy bits of debt paid, thy will <hi rend="italic">done!</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550212-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <corr><date when="1855-02-12">12 Feb. 1855</date></corr></ref> and his note, <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550212-JWC-TC-01"><date when="1855-02-12">12 Feb. 1855</date></ref>). That Jane as a woman could not speak in the houses of Parliament and that part of their finances rested on money that came from Craigenputtoch, which belonged to her, these are the implicit ironies that give force to what Thomas calls &#x201C;Jane&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Missive on the Budget</hi>,&#x201C; added to by the ambiguity of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Femme</hi> incomprise</foreign>,&#x201C; a woman both misunderstood and unappreciated.</p>
<p>We have always known that Jane wrote fewer letters than Thomas, and fewer were preserved. Her letters to Geraldine Jewsbury are perhaps the most famously missing, destroyed at Jane&#x2019;s request after her death. But even if they had survived, Jewsbury&#x2019;s removal to London in the summer of <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> changed her status from correspondent to neighbor, &#x201C;living under Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s auspices&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:502), providing friendship as well as material for Jane&#x2019;s own letters: &#x201C;Poor Geraldine is worst off with me&#x2014;for having unbounded confidence in her devotion, I don&#x2019;t bother to <hi rend="italic">keep up appearances</hi> with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>, but scold at her whenever we are together which is twice a day <hi rend="italic">at least</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550402-JWC-KS-01">JWC to KS, [<date when="1855-04-02">2 April 1855</date>]</ref>). Jewsbury also began to appear in reports from visitors; Ellen Twisleton, one of Jane&#x2019;s new admirers, wrote often to her sisters in the United States about visits to the Carlyles; in late <date when="1855-05-00">May 1855</date>, she was clearly cautious about Geraldine: &#x201C;The unfailing Miss Jewsbury was there, and some Scotch people. &#x2026; Mrs. Carlyle is so fond of Miss J. that I think there must be some good in her&#x201C; (Twisleton, <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 278).</p>
<p>A category of Jane&#x2019;s correspondence, letters to younger women incorporating advice and tales of her life with Thomas, consistently contains some of her <pb id="pg-29-xii" n="29:xii"/>best writing. In earlier volumes her younger cousins, Helen and Jeannie Welsh, had been the recipients. But Helen had died shortly before Margaret Carlyle in <date when="1853-12-00">December 1853</date> (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531227-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:357</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-12-27">27 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>), and Jeannie had married Andrew Chrystal and moved to Glasgow in <date when="1853-04-00">April 1853</date> (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530419-JWC-JG-01"><sic>28:114</sic><corr>JWC to JG, <date when="1853-12-27">27 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>). In this volume she is the subject of criticism for her failings as a correspondent: &#x201C;I had a long maundering letter from Jeanie &#x2026; . all full of her happiness as Andrews wife&#x2014;her <hi rend="italic">comforts</hi>&#x2014;her beautiful house&#x2014;&#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;even to the comfort and ease of having no prospect of children (!) all is well with Jeanie!&#x201C; leaving Jane in a &#x201C;sort of silent rage&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540418-JWC-JAC-01">JWC to JAC, [ca. <date when="1854-04-18">18 April 1854</date>]</ref>). In <date when="1854-07-00">July 1854</date>, in her customary birthday letter to Mary Russell at Thornhill, Jane is critical in a way that illuminates old resentments about hierarchies of age and family duty:</p>
<q>From my Cousins I hear very little now. Jeanie in Glasgow, never was a good correspondent, I mean always wrote <hi rend="italic">remarkably bad</hi> letters considering her faculty in some other directions, <hi rend="italic">now</hi> there is a little tone of <hi rend="italic">married-woman</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">much-made-of married woman</hi> added to the dullness and longwindedness that irritates me into&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">silence</hi>. As for the others, they all seem to think I have nothing to do <hi rend="small-caps">At My Age</hi> but send <hi rend="italic">them</hi> two or three letters for one!&#x2014; When my dear Uncle was alive&#x2014;my anxiety to hear of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> overcame all other considerations and I humoured this negligence more than was reasonable&#x2014; Besides Helen wrote pretty often poor Dear&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">good</hi> letters, telling one something. <hi rend="italic">Now</hi> as they are all healthy, and &#x201C;at ease in Zion,&#x201C; I mean to bear in mind more than heretofore&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> healthy, and have many demands on my time and thought, and am besides sufficiently their elder to have my letters answered. (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540713-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1854-07-13">13 July 1854</date></ref>)</q>
<p>As her cousins move out of reach, they are replaced by a new generation of younger women. Like Jewsbury, Mary Smith came to Jane through reading Thomas&#x2019;s works; running her school in Carlisle, and seeking a way to literary fulfilment, she had written to ask Jane about the possibility of becoming an &#x201C;Assistant to a Literary Lady.&#x201C; Jane&#x2019;s prompt reply advised her that she knew of none: &#x201C;Either these ladies follow literature for a trade&#x2014;to live by&#x2014;in which case they could not pay an assistant; or following it for their pleasure, they want no assistant.&#x201C; All she could offer was to bear her in mind for any recommendation for governess that she was asked for. She ends with advice positioning herself as the senior and wiser woman: &#x201C;Meanwhile, believe a woman older than yourself, who has seen, and <hi rend="italic">seen thro</hi>&#x2019;, all you are now longing after. There is as little <hi rend="italic">nourishing</hi> for an aspiring soul in literary society as in any civilised society one could name! And for &#x2018;clear ideas&#x2019; and &#x2018;broad knowledge,&#x2019; they are not secreted in any corner of life, but lie in all life, for whoever has faculty to appreciate them&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540116-JWC-MS-01">JWC to MS, <date when="1854-01-16">16 Jan. 1854</date></ref>). <pb id="pg-29-xiii" n="29:xiii"/>This first contact with another radical and single woman making her own way (like Amalie B&#xF6;lte) was reestablished when Smith wrote again for Jane&#x2019;s advice about her poetry in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>. Jane&#x2019;s response is one of admiration for Smith&#x2019;s perseverance: &#x201C;This time you came to me as an old acquaintance whom I am glad to shake hands with again. The mere fact of your being still in the same position after so long an interval, and with such passionate inward protest as that first letter indicated, is a more authentic testimony of your worth, than if you had sent me a certificate of character signed by all the clergy and householders of Carlisle!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18570111-JWC-MS-01">JWC to MS, <date when="1857-01-11">11 Jan. 1857</date></ref>; Bliss, <hi rend="italic">JWC</hi> 256&#x2013;58). This letter continues into the tale of bread-making, Cellini, and Jane&#x2019;s life in Craigenputtoch, which has been much quoted and analyzed.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >3. For example, Norma Clarke, <hi rend="italic">Ambitious Heights</hi> (<date when="1990-00-00">1990</date>) 121&#x2013;23, and Christianson, &#x201C;Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x2019;s Private Writing Career,&#x201C; in D. Gifford and D. McMillan, eds. <hi rend="italic">A History of Scottish Women&#x2019;s Writing</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1997-00-00">1997</date>) 241&#x2013;42.</note> Although she did not become a friend as B&#xF6;lte and Jewsbury had, they continued in intermittent touch, and Jane later called on her when passing through Carlisle.</p>
<p>Other young women came to Jane through friendship circles in London. Kate Sterling, one of the daughters of John Sterling and under the guardianship of Anthony Sterling until <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531119-JWC-KS-01"><sic>28:318</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1853-11-19">19 Nov. 1853</date></corr></ref>), is the recipient of advice, love, and tales of complications caused by Anthony Sterling&#x2019;s previous passion for and current estrangement from Jane:</p>
<q>But in bringing us together in one room it could not undo the past&#x2014;could not bring our hearts together&#x2014; He came and I received him&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">voila tout</hi></foreign>&#x2014;we were as much estranged after the visit as before it&#x2014; Why he wished to come I cannot imagine for his manner was as disagreeable as if he had been brought there by force&#x2014; But I will tell you <hi rend="italic">the particulars</hi> when you come&#x2014; I have got a shocking bad cold and am stupid as an owl and seeing every thing thro a sort of moral <hi rend="italic">London fog</hi>. (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540300-JWC-KS-01"><sic>JWC-KS</sic><corr>JWC to KS</corr>, [<date when="1854-03-00">mid-March 1854</date>]</ref>)</q>
<p>Jane may have had Kate in mind when she wrote her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">simple Story</hi> of my own first Love&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521105-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:349</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov. 1852</date></corr></ref>), shortly after Kate had been forbidden by Sterling to consider Count Dalwig as a possible suitor (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520530-JWC-KS-01"><sic>27:126&#x2013;27</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1852-05-30">30 May 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520725-JWC-KS-01"><sic>27:181&#x2013;82</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1852-07-25">25 July 1852</date></corr></ref>). She certainly mentioned it to Kate (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521229-JWC-KS-01"><sic>27:383</sic><corr>JWC to KS, <date when="1852-12-29">29 Dec. 1852</date></corr></ref>). But Kate can also be taken as an example of one of the great incidental pleasures of editing the Carlyles&#x2019; letters: the letters written <hi rend="italic">to</hi> them. This volume includes quotations from Kate&#x2019;s letter to Jane, <date when="1854-10-20">20 October 1854</date>, when she was staying with the Maurices in Matlock, which gives many details about her family, including Anthony in the Crimea. It also makes clear her own attachment to Jane: &#x201C;I would have given <hi rend="italic">Republics</hi> to be by your side for a moment&#x201C; (the letter is cited in <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540300-JWC-KS-01">JWC to KS, <pb id="pg-29-xiv" n="29:xiv"/><date when="1854-03-00">[mid-March]</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541107-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1854-11-07">7 Nov. 1854</date>]</ref>). Despite Jane&#x2019;s statement to Mary Russell, &#x201C;All my acquaintance lie so far off, that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mechanically impossible to be intimate with them&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18540713-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1854-07-13">13 [July 1854]</date></ref>), both Jane and her correspondents such as Kate practice a passionate intimacy in their correspondence.</p>
<p>The narrative of any volume of <hi rend="italic">The Collected Letters of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle</hi> comes from their own letters and those of their correspondents, the letters of each volume carrying a variety of running themes. In <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> the impending death of Margaret Carlyle was a major preoccupation. In <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>, Thomas&#x2019;s research for the writing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> becomes intertwined with the public drama of the Crimean War. Jane writes a classically gendered response to the war:</p>
<q>Oh arn&#x2019;t you miserable about this war! I am haunted day and night with the thought of all the women over England Scotland and Ireland who must be in agonies of suspense about their nearest and dearest&#x2014; Thank God I have no husband or brother or father or son in that horrible War&#x2014; I have some few acquaintances however, and one intimate friend Colonel Sterling &#x2026; and I read the list of killed and wounded always with a sick dread of finding <hi rend="italic">his</hi> name. (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18541107-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1854-11-07">7 Nov. 1854</date>]</ref>)</q>
<p>Thomas, meanwhile, in both letters and his Journal, expresses criticism of the fact of the war (to which in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date> he adds criticism of the critics of the war):</p>
<q>I reckon it one of the maddest of wars lately heard of: Undertaken with immense enthusiasm of all the noisy, unwise classes and with all the quiet and wise indifferent to it, or dead against it. One wish possesses the latter, I think: that of handsomely terminating said war. &#x2026; it is my private notion, the Czar Nicholas may probably <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a king doing more real king <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, than all the other kings that now are,&#x2014;much outweighing the whole lot of them in intrinsic value;&#x2014;and I have always well understood the Turks to be a set of dark, fanatical and sensual blockheads, <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>, these three hundred years, to be thrown into the Black sea by anybody that was passing that way, and had leisure for the job. (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18541210-TC-JMA-01">TC to <sic>JM</sic><corr>JMA</corr>, <date when="1854-12-10">10 Dec. 1854</date></ref>)</q>
<p>This effortlessly combines a contrary admiration of the enemy king with Anglo-Saxon suspicion of the &#x201C;alien&#x201C; Turks who embody darkness, fanaticism, sensuality, and stupidity in an all-encompassing sweep of prejudice. Thomas is filled with foreboding by his feelings:</p>
<q>the poor Nation altogether were going to <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> over, and fall upon its face, with its nose in the gutter, to drown there in two inches of dirty water! There never was such a scene in my time as the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Britain <pb id="pg-29-xv" n="29:xv"/>now presents Their Turk war, into wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all the world went voluntarily galloping (like a herd of loose <hi rend="italic">nowt</hi>,&#x2014;really with little more sense in their heads) may come to cost us all very dear I resolutely hold my tongue; but my private sorrow and gloom over the prospect that seems to be opening, is considerable. Is the end <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, then, altogether, which I have long been prophesying as inevitable? (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550507-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1855-05-07">7 May 1855</date></ref>)</q>
<p>Thomas&#x2019;s prophetic gloom leads him to take the name of Balaclava (after a winter of apparently useless siege) as a metaphor for a useless enterprise. &#x201C;Balaklava,&#x201C; he tells Emerson, &#x201C;is likely to be a substantive in the English language henceforth&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550513-TC-RWE-01"><date when="1855-05-13">13 May 1855</date></ref>), having already begun to use it as such in relation to his pursuit of a pension for the Lowe sisters, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">All</hi> a Balaklava, my friend; all a Balaklava&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550501-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1855-05-01">1 May 1855</date></ref>). But his feelings about the war intertwine with his feelings of hopelessness in the face of the task ahead of him in writing a history of Frederick the Great. The largest number of Thomas&#x2019;s letters to any one correspondent in volume 29 (in a period when he and Jane were not apart in the summer in their usual fashion) are to Joseph Neuberg.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >4. There were 48 (20 percent) letters to Neuberg, with 44 (18 percent) to John Carlyle. Lady Ashburton and Jean Carlyle Aitken both received 23 (9.5 percent). This volume contains only nine of TC&#x2019;s letters to JWC, and five of hers to TC.</note> Most of these 48 letters contain detailed questions on books relating to Frederick the Great for Neuberg to research for Thomas. Jane (foreshadowing her coming years of illness and depression &#x201C;in the valley of the shadow of Frederick&#x201C; [<date when="1863-02-00">Feb. 1863</date>; Bliss, <hi rend="italic">JWC</hi> 302]) writes to Delia Bacon that &#x201C;Mr. C. is dreadfully busy with his &#x2018;Frederick,&#x2019; who I begin to wish had never been born&#x201C; ([<date when="1854-12-09">9 Dec. 1854</date>]), and to Kate Sterling: &#x201C;we live here up to the eyes in Frederick the Great&#x2014;and he is becoming such a horrid bore to me that I <hi rend="italic">dream</hi> about him in my bad nights!&#x201C; ([<date when="1855-04-02">2 April? 1855</date>]). It is not surprising that Jane feels this way, as Thomas doubtless expressed the same fears in conversation as he does in correspondence about this &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">last</hi> heavy job I mean to undertake at this time of life&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550106-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1855-01-06">6 Jan. 1855</date></ref>). But, while he was always pessimistic in the face of a new writing task, there seems a curious lack of enthusiasm for the project, even for Thomas, when he writes to Emerson:</p>
<q>Frederick himself is a pretty little man to me, veracious, courageous, invincible in his small sphere; but he does not rise into the empyrean regions, or kindle my heart round him at all; and his history, upon which there are waggon loads of dull bad books, is the most dislocated, unmanageably incoherent, altogether dusty, barren and beggarly production of the modern Muses, as given hitherto &#x2026; . <supplied>[I]</supplied> shall be beaten miserably in this unwise enterprise in my old days. (<date when="1855-05-13">13 May 1855</date>)</q>
<p><pb id="lastpage-29-xvi" n="29:xvi"/>And to Ruskin (with whom both Thomas and Jane were sympathetic in the aftermath of the ending of his marriage with Effie), Thomas explicitly connects Balaclava, that useless enterprise, and the Crimean War as a whole with <hi rend="italic">Frederick:</hi> &#x201C;My Prussian affairs are as bad almost as <hi rend="italic">Balaklava;</hi> and indeed resemble that notable Enterprise of the Turk War in several respects,&#x2014;in this especially, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had no business at all to concern myself in such an adventure, with such associates; and that a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> result to it does not seem (for most part) so much as possible!&#x201C; (<date when="1855-05-23">23 May 1855</date>). It is almost as though he is proceeding with the writing of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> on the basis only of a kind of personal indoor relief program of work.</p>
<p>Jane&#x2019;s witty and sarcastic approach to her surroundings exemplified in her letters is an easy one for the 21st-century reader to respond to. Thomas in his letters seems more problematic, less immediately attractive, perhaps much as his literary reputation became in the twentieth century. For contemporaries, however, his public self inevitably meant that, as he noted to his sister Jean, &#x201C;One becomes like a kind of lighted lantern, against which all the dark owlets in Creation are liable to come flapping;&#x2014;can&#x2019;t be helped&#x201C; (<date when="1854-03-14">14 March 1854</date>). Yet Thomas, too, occasionally joked about himself. He concluded one of his several notes to Forster about the Lowe campaign: &#x201C;I have been boring and digging all day thro&#x2019; &#x2018;Brandenburg sand&#x2019; and shot-rubbish,&#x2014;properly for nothing at all, too, or next-door to that; and am fit for treasons, strategems and spoils, in spite of my usual gayety of temper!&#x201C; (<date when="1855-06-01">1 June 1855</date>). Gaiety of temper may not be the prevailing mood that we connect with the Carlyle household, but it is a reminder of the way that both Carlyles can surprise as the minutiae of their lives continue unwinding before us.</p>

After settling his mother&#x2019;s affairs at Scotsbrig, TC returns to London (<date when="1854-01-02">2</date>). &#xc9;mile Mont&#xE9;gut sends TC books and materials, particularly on Voltaire. TC consults Neuberg about the Illinois bonds, once thought worthless, which are sent to Charles Butler to manage (<date when="1854-01-11">11</date>, <date when="1854-01-17">17</date>). Restless and unhappy after his mother&#x2019;s death, TC turns to clearing things up before working on <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, seeing no one but Chorley and Neuberg (<date when="1854-01-13">13</date>). Without the responsibility for his mother, Dr. John Carlyle takes up translating Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi>, encouraged by TC. TC thanks Varnhagen von Ense for his gift of <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;lows Leben</hi> (<date when="1854-01-15">15</date>). JWC writes to discourage Mary Smith from even thinking of being &#x201C;assistant to a literary lady&#x201C; (<date when="1854-01-16">16</date>).</p>
<p><date when="1854-02-00"><hi rend="italic">February</hi></date>. TC tells Neuberg that he is tempted to give up Frederick (<date when="1854-02-03">3</date>).

TC ignores begging letters, feels low in spirits, and says he gets on badly with his work. Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s sister, Martha Park, dies of cancer (<date when="1854-02-28">28</date>).</p>

TC reads Henry Drummond on the fate of Christianity, and, &#x201C;deducting &#x2018;Christ&#x2019; &#x26;c,&#x201C; approves. TC tells John Carlyle that Anthony Sterling has called: he is to be Gen.

TC thanks Hugh Miller for his <hi rend="italic">My Schools and Schoolmasters</hi> (<date when="1854-03-09">9</date>). Decorating of TC&#x2019;s new attic room is finally to be completed by papering (<date when="1854-03-14">14</date>).

<p><date when="1854-04-00"><hi rend="italic">April</hi></date>. John Wilson dies (<date when="1854-04-03">3</date>). TC acknowledges books from Mont&#xE9;gut (<date when="1854-04-04">4</date>). He writes to Alick in Canada after a long silence, which he blames on troubles arising from their mother&#x2019;s death (<date when="1854-04-08">8</date>), and he acknowledges, with pleasure, Emerson&#x2019;s resumption of correspondence after a long silence (<date when="1854-04-08">8</date>).

The Carlyles are invited to Addiscombe for Easter (<date when="1854-04-18">18</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-04-28">28</date>), but Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s cold meant that they stay from just <date when="1854-04-20">20</date> to <date when="1854-04-24">24</date>, including a visit to <pb id="pg-29-xxiv" n="29:xxiv"/>Sydenham (<date when="1854-04-23">23</date>) to see the reerected Crystal Palace.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>You will see by the Newspaper which goes with this that I have got safe home; but I promised to say so much in express words. I had to wait an hour and half at Carlisle,&#x2014;till &#x201C;3 minutes past 2&#x201C;; we did not get to London till midnight; and it was 1, or some minutes more, before I got fairly home. At Carlisle there was warm soup &#x26;c to have been had, but I could not eat there: and afterw<hi rend="italic">ds</hi>, on trying once or twice, I found that there was no chance or possibility. Isabella&#x2019;s four biscuits and two sugar-snaps did me much good,&#x2014;in fact were my only resource, not against hunger, which I did not feel, but ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> cold, which, as the stomach fell idle, became very sensible.

Frozen fog began to prevail in Lancashire; once for about an hour there was powdery snow: the cold is as grim here as with you, and the sky today has its winter livery of gray. &#x201C;Coals &#xa3;2 a ton,&#x201C; Jane tells me.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane is pretty well for her; and the house is now all painted, trimmed and put in order: I have not been on the street yet since I came; only putting things away &#x26;c, amid reflexions <hi rend="italic">not</hi> very joyful as you may fancy; and it is now towards 4.</p>
<p>I will add no me<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;more.&#x201C;</note> but to thank Isabella and you for your unwearied goodness to me in the late sad days, as always heretofore. <closer><salute>God bless you all.</salute></closer><name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

    <p>Jamie and I caught your Note at Middlebie yesterday morning, on the road to the rail. It was as cold a morning as I ever felt. My journey went on without outward accident; but was supremely unpleasant,&mdash;from the hour-and-half to wait at Carlisle, and then from the raging hurry wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> frustrated all attempts at getting either food or drink in the stern cold. From Lancashire onwards I suffered from cold, wrap as I might; and was very glad indeed to see Euston Square at last. Even there my troubles did not end; for I got a cabman, half drunk, whose hourse was not roughened,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Thus in MS; meaning its horse shoes had not been roughened to grip the ice.</note> whom I had to dismiss with noise at the top of Regent street: finally I got home at <hi rend="italic">one;</hi> and found <hi rend="italic">those</hi> troubles ended. The frost is intense <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the way, London very <hi rend="italic">white</hi> and slippery as glass, under a grey iron sky.&mdash; I have looked at my Mother&rsquo;s Picture;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">See 13:frontispiece.</note> tried here and there to realise the sad and stern new fact, which will be of such importance to me: but as yet it is all a kind of dim stupefaction;<figure>

I am wandering about putting by my things &c.&mdash; In the Newspaper <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi> which I send you today, I found, in smoking my pipe, a paragraph (near the end) folded down: which has been written by some stranger to us and our affairs.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">&ldquo;It is our painful duty to record the demise of Mrs. Carlyle, the mother of the distinguished author. &hellip; Her two sons, one of whom is a doctor residing in London, and the author of various translations from the German, were present at the death-bed of their venerable and beloved parent. The doctor had waited upon his mother for a month with the most exemplary and patient love. Thomas Carlyle arrived from his residence at Chelsea, a few days before the last scene, and on the spot where he was born witnessed the departure of a mother who had the satisfaction, many years before her death, of seeing her family rise to a proud and well-merited distinction&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi>, a Glasgow newspaper; quot: <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1854-01-07">7 Jan.</date>). TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-01-08">8 Jan.</date>: &ldquo;I myself am very weak, confused, fatigued, entangled in poor <hi rend="italic">worldlinesses</hi> too (Newspaper paragraphs even, on this sacred and peculiar thing, are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me,&mdash;weak soul).&rdquo;</note>&mdash; &mdash; I am sorry to think how your <hi rend="italic">business</hi> has been all cut away, dear Brother: you will have many a thought about it, and they will be unhappy ones till you get into something else.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC worried about John Carlyle&rsquo;s idleness and often urged him to work on his trans. of the <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio;</hi> he wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-01-08">8 Jan.</date>: &ldquo;Poor Brother Jack, will he do his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> now? For him also I am sad; & surely he has deserved gratitude in these last years from us all.&rdquo;</note>

        <salute>We all pray, I especially, that you may be guided to something good and worthy. Our good and dear Mother is at rest; God grant our lives might be all as <hi rend="italic">brave</hi> as hers was. No more today. Ever yours /</salute>

<salute>Dear Sir James,</salute>
<p>I am sorry to deny your first request, and that so kind a one. But I have been admonished to seclusion and silence, rather sternly, in these current days. My dear and good old Mother, who had been spared to me as a priceless blessing so long, has at length been taken from us: she died on Christmas day; I had hastened from The Grange;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; grand neoclassical mansion in Hants.</note> was so mercifully dealt with as to be there still in time;&#x2014;I am just returned from Scotland, my head and heart, naturally, full of sad and sacred unutterabilities. God give me to live the rest of my life as she lived hers: that is all the prayer I make.</p>
<p>In a week or two I propose calling on you. Were my affairs once set in order, it will be a great comfort to speak to you again.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Meanwhile may all good be with you and your household. I remain always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear of Mrs Glen and you again; that things go well with you both, will always be good news to me.</p>
<p>My dear and excellent old Mother died from among us on Christmas day, in beautiful possession of herself, with intellect and affections still clear, at the age of 84: I am just returned from Scotland, and from witnessing the most unforgetable scenes. One of the pleasant thoughts in her last months, I have no doubt, was this of Mrs Glen having at last succeeded in her modest claim; which fact, you may well believe, is to me also a valuable one.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are very kind and serviceable to me; and I seem culpably ungrateful in late weeks. But it is <hi rend="italic">seeming</hi> only; alas, I have too valid an excuse. I was in the country when your second Note came; then I was called into Scotland, on the saddest errand,&#x2014;to attend the death-bed of a dear and excellent Mother; to scenes from which I am just returned, and the impression of which can never be abolished while I live.&#x2014; I had given orders to have your Parcel called for at Barth&#xE8;s and Lowell&#x2019;s; this was done, and the Books and Letter lay safe;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Foreign booksellers, 14 Gt. Marlborough St. Mont&#xE9;gut wrote, <date when="1853-12-14">14 Dec. 1853</date>, asking if they had arrived (MS: EUL).</note> but it was only yesterday that I could first open them. I will not lose a post in quieting your anxieties; but say at once that everything is come, and came duly; that no money was charged; and in short, that you have acquitted yourself of this charitable function with complete success so far. Many thanks to you, and regrets that a speedier acknowledgement was denied me.</p>
<p>I last night read, in the <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue</hi>, what M. Lom&#xE9;nie has said about Beaumarchais;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis L&#xE9;onard de Lom&#xE9;nie, &#x201C;Beaumarchais et son Temps,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi>, n.s. <date when="1852-10-16">16 (Oct. 1852)</date>: 25&#x2013;70 and 2nd ser. <date when="1853-02-00">1 (Feb. 1853)</date>: 142&#x2013;49; later pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Beaumarchais et son Temps &#xc9;tudes sur la Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; en France au XVIIIe Si&#xE8;cle</hi> (Paris, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note> <pb id="pg-29-6" n="29:6"/>and was interested not only in his magnificent Voltaire operations, but in what I learned of his American performances and sufferings, of his grandiose Commercial enterprises,&#x2014;and generally in the character of the man, more than I had been before.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais (<date when="1732-00-00">1732</date>&#x2013;<date when="1799-00-00">99</date>), dramatist, businessman, and adventurer. He secretly, with covert govt. support, organized supplies for the insurgent American colonies. After Voltaire&#x2019;s death, against strong opposition from the church and magistracy, he undertook the publication (having it printed in Germany) of Voltaire&#x2019;s complete works (many of which had been banned in France). See also <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 4:11, 16&#x2013;18.</note> A shining specimen of the French genius in that kind; a beautiful gallant kind of soul,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mont&#xE9;gut apparently showed Lom&#xE9;nie this letter as this part of TC&#x2019;s sentence was added by Lom&#xE9;nie to a footnote (2:545).</note>&#x2014;but contrasted with others more successful in the race of life, in a noticeable way, too; like the running of the Hare against that of the Tortoise; not the <hi rend="italic">swiftest</hi> that gains! I design to get the back N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">R&#xE9;vue</hi>, and read from the beginning of that Sketch of Beaumarchais.

<p>I wrote him a hurried line the day after I came home; a similar line to the Dr: I have yet heard nothing from any Annandale quarter.

<p><pb id="pg-29-9" n="29:9"/>The weather, that next day when I went out, was still professedly frosty; but nothing like so cold as at Scotsbrig: on the following night, there fell such a quantity of snow as few or none ever saw here,&#x2014;a thick fall even for Scotland;&#x2014;which stopped almost all the wheel-vehicles, and has been the chief business of the people ever since: happily the <hi rend="italic">thaw</hi> is strong today,&#x2014;wet wind from the south,&#x2014;and is now rapidly ridding us of it.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>You would see, by the arrival of the Newspaper last week, that I had got safely home; and I have really yet almost nothing more to tell you, except what your own heart and imagination will equally suggest without speaking. I have been as sad of heart as I expected, not sadder; I have yet seen as good as nobody; prefer still to be alone for some time,&#x2014;alone with my own waste wintry thoughts, that I may get them sorted by and by into something usefuller and better. I began languidly on Tuesday morning to the task of sweeping away rubbish from about us, answering scrubby letters or burning them &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and endeavouring to clear a piece of ground for myself where I might hope to get to work again; or at least see that I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not work any more,&#x2014;which is a thing I shall be very difficult to convince of. I have gone on in that humour; refusing to give up any day, but languid, weak and disheartened on all days. We cannot expect to cure from such a wound all at once. I fall into painful contemplations sometimes, sorrow that is really sharp on me: but in general my thoughts are of a better description, a mournful <hi rend="italic">pity</hi> in <pb id="pg-29-10" n="29:10"/>them, ennobling their sadness; and my dear Mother, now hidden from my eyes in Eternity, as still a blessing to me, a help to me, as she always was since I first knew Time. God make us thankful, my dear Sister; for we have cause withal.</p>
<p>I wrote to John and to Jamie, very briefly that Tuesday; I have yet heard no word from any of the family: I suppose poor Jack is of opinion his loose brief Notes will now want their old vindication with me, which made any Note from him welcome. Poor fellow, I am sad to think so too; and feel a great sympathy with him,&#x2014;greater from this very silence than the most eloquent writing could have raised in me. Tell him, however, by the first good opportunity you have, what is the truth, that I must hear from him as formerly,&#x2014;in a hasty thoughtless style, or a considerate and thoughtful; the old frankness must not change;&#x2014;and that I feel truly indebted to him (and to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> in late months), and with all my impatiences, have not lost my brotherly love, nor shall if I can help it.&#x2014; &#x2014; Here is a Letter (from Mrs Johnston&#x2019;s sister, about those Books sent to Grange):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I. Newbigging (see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470929-TC-JWC-01"><sic>22:98</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1847-09-29">29 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>), sister of Mrs. William Johnstone (d. <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), the Grange, Annandale (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250826-TC-MRSWJ-01"><sic>3:372</sic><corr>TC to MRSWJ, <date when="1825-08-26">26 Aug. 1825</date></corr></ref>), had written, <date when="1854-01-06">6 Jan.</date>, for her ill sister to thank TC for sending one of TC&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s books (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531231-TC-MWJ-01"><sic>28:370</sic><corr>TC to MWJ, <date when="1853-12-31">31 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>): &#x201C;she trusts it will be your aim and hers, to follow in the safe and profitable course of your now sainted Mother&#x2014;who early gave herself to Christ as the only guide and only Saviour, who has now taken her to His blessed Kingdom!&#x201C; At the top of the letter TC later wrote mistakenly: &#x201C;still at at [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Scotsbrig after my dear <hi rend="italic">Mother</hi>&#x2019;s Funeral&#x201C;; also a note in pencil (not by TC), apparently wrongly: &#x201C;Brother of Mrs Johnston.&#x201C;</note> read it; then forward it to John, who can read it at Scotsbrig too, and return it to me. We have had a great deal of snow; but it is all thawed now; and we have mud with little frost. <closer><salute>I am well &#x26; Jane; be you all well. God bless you dear Sister.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>I have been hindered by very sad causes, as perhaps you understand, from examining your Pamphlet,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Marshall, <hi rend="italic">Minorities and Majorities; their Relative Rights. A Letter to the Lord John Russell on Parliamentary Reform</hi> (<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>).</note> or even from getting hold of it, till lately. At length, however, I have read it, which is no hard task;&#x2014;and have to testify that I find it modestly, ingenuously, clearly, and in short <hi rend="italic">well</hi> written; and that there is not, to my perception, any flaw in the argument, nor anything anywhere from which I can expressly dissent. If Lord John, or whoever is <pb id="pg-29-11" n="29:11"/>charged with that sublime function of bringing in a &#x201C;New Reform Bill,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord John Russell had proposed a new bill for electoral reform which would have revised and extended the <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date> Reform Act.

It gave voters the chance to express their opinion as to how much each candidate represented particular interests. According to Marshall, it would prevent the tyranny of the majority and give a fair share of power to large minorities.</note> I will at once admit to him that it is likely to be an improvement, and wish it good speed for him and you.&#x2014; But, to say truth, I take less and less interest in Voting of any kind; the incurable darkness of the great body of mankind, and their born <hi rend="italic">incapacity</hi> to &#x201C;vote&#x201C; for anything, except for what they will have to dinner and the like, growing daily more apparent to me, more hideous, abominable,&#x2014;and even awful, as I look over their sad History past and present. There will never be a tolerable world again till the Servile of Mankind (whom all the nuggets in California<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scene of the gold rush, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>.</note> cannot make other than <hi rend="italic">Slaves</hi>, always the uglier the more nuggets they get) shall be entirely excluded from voting, or have their votes by some good method reduced to <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>, which they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>, and which it is frightful and against all Laws of God to regard them as not being;&#x2014;which consummation, I perceive, is still at a very great distance, quite out of my section of time: so that neither voting nor the prayed-for <hi rend="italic">euthanasia</hi> of voting is now a thing that much concerns me.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I have not, naturally, the least particle of news for you, from without or from within; nothing, but this poor symbol that you are still in my thoughts; like a bright presence walking thro&#x2019; gloomy caverns and sepulchral <pb id="pg-29-12" n="29:12"/>halls, willing to cheer the poor inhabitant. Be thanked at least; thanks are all I have to give, in my extreme impoverishment,&#x2014;or ever shall have, as I often think;&#x2014;and surely these are not worth much from such a quarter. But you will have it so; you are very good, and resolute to be good.</p>
<p>I have kept myself quite alone; not seeing anybody, nor intending it for some time. I do not abandon myself to useless emotions: but there is much to be sorted up, much to be cleared away; and, in a languid sad manner, I concern myself daily with that, as the preliminary thing. By Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, I hope yet to do some work, in the years that may remain: no other consolation is conceivable; no other use or advantage has Life, for a long time past, presented to me:&#x2014;one gets very grim, on those terms; and has need that the sacred fountains be again opened in one&#x2019;s stony heart. A little free speech with you, I often think, speech at which no god or man could take offence if they understood it, might be a great solacement to me: but that is not to be had, owing to confused impediments, nor perhaps ever will. Well, well; we must take the other way of it, then; the other way too has worth which we will not part with if we can help it,&#x2014;no.</p>
<p>Unluckily this <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k is so totally alien to my humour at present! I foresee I shall have a furious wrestle with that subject, if it ever come to anything; wrestle at which I could tremble in any humour. But there is no help;&#x2014;nor, except in oneself, is there any hindrance possible: that too should be a comfort!</p>
<p>You will write to us when once your gayeties are over; tell us that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have got unharmed thro&#x2019; them, which is the chief interest they can have, but a real one, just now. And about the end of the month you are coming up to Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, are you not? That also is truly all the interest I take in the sublime assembly, with its Turk wars, Palmerston explanations &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Russian destruction of the Turkish fleet at Sinope, <date when="1853-11-30">30 Nov. 1853</date>, greatly increased public demand for the govt. to take a firmer stand against Russian expansionism. Lord Palmerston, who was strongly in favor of more robust support for the Turks, had resigned, <date when="1853-12-16">16 Dec. 1853</date>, because of his opposition to Lord Russell&#x2019;s reform bill. It was widely believed and expressed in the press that the real reason Palmerston had resigned was because of Sinope and Aberdeen&#x2019;s failure to protect the Turks. Public opinion caused Aberdeen to ask Palmerston to withdraw his resignation, assuring him that no decision had been made on the reform bill. Palmerston returned to the Home Office, end <date when="1853-12-00">Dec. 1853</date>.</note> A most wearisome am<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of empty boxes to me otherwise!&#x2014; Come, then;&#x2014;and comfort poor Prince Albert, who is really getting into turbid water at present.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since the outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Turkey, early <date when="1853-10-00">Oct. 1853</date>, the press had wrongly accused Prince Albert of pro-Russian sympathies because of his German connections. After Palmerston&#x2019;s resignation, criticism increased; he was blamed for unduly influencing the queen and the govt. and being instrumental in forcing that resignation.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I came home about a week ago; but have kept myself strictly private ever since, and seen nobody; having naturally much to think of,&#x2014;and in particular, many things to do in the way of sorting and settling. Not till I get into work can this wound be expected to heal: unluckily my <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k and other tasks are far from cognate to my humour just now,&#x2014;indeed what task in writing would or could be quite cognate? Time is on the wing, as ever; and the Night cometh!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 9:4.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p>What I want at present is another kind of service;&#x2014;about an American Bond, repudiated 10 years ago, which it seems has now revived:&#x2014;I am directed to send it to New York for first-rate management; and want to shew you the Paper &#x26;c before it can go.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Butler had agreed to oversee TC&#x2019;s American investments; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531118-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:314</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-11-18">18 Nov. 1853</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter was a real satisfaction to me, the other evening, in the loneliness of my mind. No welcomer news could now come from you than that the Task of <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> has been taken up again. That, and nothing but that, is at present capable of filling up the sad vacancy which has occurred in your life, in yours more than in that of any of us: a worthy piece of labour is beyond all precious in such circumstances. Often since we parted, have I thought sadly of your &#x201C;collapse,&#x201C; of your sudden total impoverishment, that sacred occupation,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As their mother&#x2019;s doctor.</note> which had filled your late years with a generous and pious interest, being withdrawn. I will exhort your Phoebe and the others earnestly, to help you as they are doing with assiduous continuance; to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> you to the business, all they can, till you yourself get fairly fastened to it again: you will then need no keeping to it, but will be obliged to persist and finish!&#x2014; I wish I had, myself, as suitable a task; for I too am not without need of it. But mine has the disadvantage, which yours is free from, that the <hi rend="italic">place to begin at</hi> is not plain, is altogether obscure, and hitherto undiscoverable;&#x2014;not to speak of other unsuitabilities &#x26;c &#x26;c. The whole of which I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> try to vanquish, or do worse.</p>
<p>Hitherto I have striven not to be quite idle; every day there ought to be <pb id="pg-29-15" n="29:15"/><hi rend="italic">something done:</hi> but my labour is miserably languid; the heart within me is low and sad: I feel that, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on these terms, can the knots ever be split.&#x2014; I have kept quite alone; seen nobody at all, but once Chorley,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John R. Chorley.</note> and last night Neuberg; neither of whom did me any good, especially not the latter, who stole a night from me withal. My thoughts are not angrily painful, they are sad and sombre, occasionally touched with soft pity and piety. I think of our dear Mother&#x2019;s end with a kind of mournful blessedness withal; her life was true, simple, generous, brave; her end, with the last traces of all these qualities still visible in it, was very beautiful if very sad to us. I would not, for much, want those two stern days at Scotsbrig from my memory. They lie consecrated there; as if baptised in sorrow, and with the great goodness of Eternity in them.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I sent a very beautiful reply I had had from Mrs Johnston of Grange, to Dumfries the other day;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540109-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1854-01-09">9 Jan.</date></ref></note> with direction that you farther were to see it, and Jamie: after that, I wish it back. Jean has not yet written to me; but will soon, I suppose. The Dr Brown<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dr. Samuel Brown.</note> Note may entertain you for a minute or two; pray <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> it when read. Neither do I want the Varnhagen back: his Book,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Leben des Generals Grafen B&#xfc;low von Dennewitz</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540115-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1854-01-15">15 Jan.</date></ref></note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> occupies me at night, is worth little; nor indeed is his whole <hi rend="italic">self</hi> worth much.&#x2014; &#x2014; We have today quite bright <hi rend="italic">westerly</hi> weather; no express frost, but always till today a <hi rend="italic">tacit</hi> one with much mud, since the snow went. Jane is gone out walking, and cannot send regards, or she would. <closer><salute>I commend myself to Phoebe; and bid, Good be with you all. Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;low&#x2019;s Leben</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Wilhelm von B&#xfc;low (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), Baron von B&#xfc;low and Count B&#xfc;low von Dennewitz, Prussian gen. in Napoleonic Wars.</note> with the kind Letter in it, has come safe to hand; many thanks for so welcome and friendly a Gift, which so many others, a long list now, have preceded! It lay waiting for me here, on my return from a short sad visit I had made to Scotland, whither I had been called on the mourn-fullest errand,&#x2014;the death of my aged, dear and excellent Mother, whose departure I witnessed on Christmas day; a scene which, as you can well <pb id="pg-29-16" n="29:16"/>believe, has filled me with emotions and reflexions ever since, and cannot for the rest of my life be forgotten. I have kept myself very silent, and as solitary as possible, ever since my return; looking out more earnestly towards new labour (if that might but be possible for me), as the one consolation in this and in all afflictions that can come. In the evenings of last week, three of them at least, I have read <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;low</hi>, as an agreeable halting-place for my mind; and was very sorry last night when it <hi rend="italic">ended</hi> upon me, as all things have to do.</p>
<p>You have given us a flowing Narrative, in your old clear style; painted out a stormy battling Life-Pilgrimage, with many interesting particulars in it. B&#xfc;low was not much other than a Name to me before; but I possess him now on much closer terms: the man and the scene he worked in are very vividly brought out in this Book. Both in face and in character, I find him an intensely Prussian Physiognomy;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The book has B&#xfc;low&#x2019;s engraved portrait.</note> really very interesting to me,&#x2014;with his strange old Swedenborgian Father, his wild Brothers,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The father was Friedrich Ulrich Arwegh von B&#xfc;low (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>); one brother was Dietrich Heinrich von B&#xfc;low (<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>), Prussian soldier (for 16 years) who also managed a theatrical group, went to the U.S., preached Swedenborgianism, was an unsuccessful glass exporter and wrote several satirical books critical of the army; arrested as mad but proved sane he died in prison in Riga, probably as a result of harsh treatment; other brothers are untraced.</note> and all his peculiar environments and personalities. Almost a <hi rend="italic">type</hi> Prussian, as I said; reminding me of much that I saw, and guessed, among your military people, while among you.&#x2014; Was that Tauentzien a kinsman of Frederic&#x2019;s Governor of Breslau?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Bogislaw Tauentzien (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>), Prussian gen., commanded fortress of Breslau, <date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 18:253&#x2013;54.</note> A most ridiculous figure he makes in that proposed duel with B&#xfc;low!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have gone thro&#x2019; great quantities of the dreariest Prussian reading since I saw you; but cannot boast to myself that Prussia or Vater Fritz becomes in the least clearer to me by the procees. Human stupidity (with the <hi rend="italic">pen</hi>, or with other implements in its hand) is extremely potent in this Universe! How I am to quit this Fritz after so much lost labour, is not clear to me; still less how I am ever to manage any Picture of him on those terms. Mirabeau, so far as I yet see, is the only man of real <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> that has ever spoken of him; and he only in that cursory and offhand way.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Honor&#xE9; Gabriel de Riquetti (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>), comte de Mirabeau, author of <hi rend="italic">De la Monarchie Prussienne sous Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric le Grand</hi>, 8 vols.

TC had been taking stock of how to deal with Frederick and appears to have recently devoted a morning to writing a long unpbd. memo for himself: &#x201C;What I know about Fred<hi rend="italic">c</hi> the Great? Alas, astonishingly little. After such reading, searching and inquiring: cartloads of the dreariest books, and borings and diggings equal to the discovery of several Ninevehs, and more expenditure of time and effort yet strenuous determination than I like to think of,&#x2014;the result is still for me a wide-spread inanity; dreary meaningless dimness; what I call a chaotic continent of barren Brandenburg <hi rend="italic">sand</hi>. The question arises often, <hi rend="italic">Ought</hi> it to be held in memory, anything of all this? Does it not solicit oblivion rather?&#x201C; (MS: NLS <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>). It made the same point about Mirabeau&#x2019;s being the only &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">man of genius</hi>&#x201C; to have reported on Frederick from personal knowledge (repeated in <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540404-TC-EM-01">TC to EM, <date when="1854-04-04">4 April</date></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:11); he repeats the criticism of having to read &#x201C;cartloads of the dreariest books&#x201C; especially &#x201C;these Pruss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ones,&#x201C; and goes on to discuss the nature of history and biography: &#x201C;The great Herodotus himself did not find his History ready <hi rend="italic">written</hi>,&#x201C; but had to melt down chaos &#x201C;to yield this little golden volume from amid its continents of slag!&#x201C;</note> In the end, I suppose I shall be reduced to <pb id="pg-29-17" n="29:17"/>Fritz&#x2019;s own Letters and Utterances, as my main resource, if I persist in this questionable enterprise. If I had been able to get any <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in Germany, my own eyes might still have done a good deal for me; but that also was not possible: the elements were too strong for so thin a skin; I was driven half-distracted after five or six weeks of that sort,&#x2014;and to this hour the street of the <hi rend="italic">Linden</hi>, and with it all Berlin, is incurably <hi rend="italic">reversed</hi> to me; and I cannot bring the North side out of a <hi rend="italic">Southern</hi> posture in my fancy, let me do what I will. I remember Lobositz, however; I remember Kunersdorf too in a very impressive manner;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unter den Linden, Berlin, see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521001-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:316</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-10-01">1 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>; Lobositz, see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520817-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:229</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-08-17">17 Aug. 1852</date></corr></ref>; Kunersdorf, see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521001-TC-LA-01"><sic>27:310</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1852-10-01">1 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> and wish I had gone to Reinsberg, to Prag, to Leuthen, &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reinsberg, N of Berlin and W of Ruppin, where Frederick, as crown prince, built a mansion and lived, <date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740-00-00">40</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:88, 159&#x2013;60.

<p>My Wife had a pleasant Note from Miss Wynne at Rome the other day:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn was a friend of Varnhagen&#x2019;s. She had gone to Rome, late <date when="1853-11-00">Nov. 1853</date>, probably with one of her sisters.</note> Rome seems full of interest to the two fair Tourists, and they are doing well,&#x2014;in the middle of a large colony of English visitants, if other interests should fail. It is a very welcome hope of ours, at all times, to see Miss Wynne settled within easy reach of us again.</p>

<p>We are busy here, babbling about Turk wars, Palmerston resignation-reacceptances, Prince-Albert interferences &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;with very trifling degrees of wisdom, and to me with no interest whatever.

The note has interested me not a little.&#x201C; TC had written (2nd edn., 2:27): &#x201C;Nor is our England without her missionaries. She has her life-saving Needham; to whom was solemnly presented a &#x2018;civic sword,&#x2019;&#x2014;long since rusted into nothingness.&#x201C; In a note of <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>, TC added: &#x201C;A trustworthy gentleman cannot but respect, that his Father, &#x2018;the late Admiral Nesham&#x2019; (not <hi rend="italic">Needham</hi>, as the French journalists give it) is the Englishman meant; and further that the sword is &#x2018;not rusted at all,&#x2019; but still lies, with the due memory attached to it, in his (the son&#x2019;s) possession, at Plymouth, in a clear state&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 3:21).

Mary Smith (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>), schoolmistress, poet, and writer, b. at Cropredy, Oxfordshire; she had a humble, religious, independent upbringing, and was first a servant, then a preparatory governess. She persevered in studying, and, after moving to Carlisle and neighborhood, began reading Carlyle and Emerson, &#x201C;my two great masters of thought for the rest of my life&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 133). She started a school (which she ran till she was 60), continued her studies, took part in local politics and journalism, lectured, gave public readings, took up the woman&#x2019;s cause (including the Women&#x2019;s Suffrage Soc.) and temperance, reported lectures and sermons, helped with a school for factory girls, and campaigned on issues such as soldiers&#x2019; welfare and abolition of slavery. She wrote poetry, pbd. in the local press and in &#x201C;M.S.,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> (Preston, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Progress and Other Poems &#x2026; by M.S., author of an &#x201C;Essay on Shakespeare&#x201C; etc</hi>. (<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>). At this time, the demands of the school seemed to block any hope of literary fulfillment, so she thought of &#x201C;the bold idea of writing&#x201C; to JWC. This quick and sympathetic reply led her to fall &#x201C;in love with this dear woman, who ever after was one of the greatest idols of my heart&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 242&#x2013;43). JWC was to write to her in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>, and later, and call on her when passing through Carlisle. Smith&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> is graphic and well-written; it is also partly an illustration of the nature of Carlyle&#x2019;s wider public in the north of England and among the working class.</sourceNote><head>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>Your &#x201C;faith in things unseen&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Edward Young, <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi>, Night 8.1022.</note>&#x2014;myself among them&#x2014;is very beautiful and affecting to me; and likewise, I confess, rather <hi rend="italic">infectious</hi>. I cannot help believing in the good heart and poetic nature, at least, of one who shows such belief in my own &#x201C;character,&#x201C; on evidence purely &#x201C;internal.&#x201C;</p>
<p>And so, dear young lady, were I as influential as you suppose me to be; no more were needed, than what I gather from your letter, to make me <hi rend="italic">use</hi> my influence in your interest. But indeed it were only deceiving you with false hopes to promise myself at all likely to find you the situation you wish for. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no such situation, to the best of my knowledge, as that of &#x201C;Assistant to a Literary Lady.&#x201C; My position as the wife of a <hi rend="italic">literary man</hi> has thrown me much into the society of <hi rend="italic">literary women</hi>, that is to say of women who write books as well as read them. But not one I know has an assistant. Either these ladies follow literature as a trade&#x2014;to live by&#x2014;in which case they could not pay an assistant; or following it for their pleasure, they want no assistant.</p>
<p>And, between ourselves, were such an assistantship created on purpose for you, you would find yourself&#x2014;or I am greatly mistaken&#x2014;no nearer, if so near, to &#x201C;clear ideas&#x201C; and &#x201C;broad knowledge&#x201C; than you are now&#x2014;teaching a school.</p>
<p>It does sometimes&#x2014;once in two or three years or so&#x2014;happen to me that I can recommend a governess; and in case such opportunity present itself <pb id="pg-29-21" n="29:21"/>again, I will bear you in remembrance, at whatever distance of time. That is all I can promise, and I am sorry it is so little.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, believe a woman older than yourself, who has seen, and <hi rend="italic">seen thro&#x2019;</hi>, all you are now longing after. There is as little <hi rend="italic">nourishing</hi> for an aspiring soul in literary society as in any civilized society one could name! And for &#x201C;clear ideas&#x201C; and &#x201C;broad knowledge,&#x201C; they are not secreted in any corner of life, but lie in all life, for whoever has faculty to appreciate them.</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>:</salute>
<p>Your very obliging letter came in due course of post, but except a silent record of thanks for your goodness, I was not at that time able to do anything with it. I had been called into Scotland; my dear and excellent old mother was passing away from me by the road we have all to go:&#x2014;that unforgettable event took place on Christmas day; and ever since, there as here, I have been occupied as you may fancy. It was not till yesterday that I could get a proper copy of the Illinois bond; and to-day I hasten to send you the original, that you may dispose of it for me, according to your kind purposes, in the way you judge most advantageous.</p>
<p>The copy, so far as I can examine, is exact to the original now sent: Bond for $1,000. State of Illinois, No. 324 with thirty-warrants of interest of $30 each, attached to it, the first dated <date when="1843-07-00">July, 1843</date>, the last, <date when="1860-07-00">July, 1860</date>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in printed text.

<p>As to management of the affair, I have only to say that the money is not at all wanted here at present; and that I will leave the matter wholly to your <hi rend="italic">skill</hi> and friendliness, well aware that there can be no course nearly so good for me and it. Had I once got notice from you that the bond has arrived safe, I shall dismiss it from the list of my anxieties, and wait with very great composure indeed for what issue you will educe from it. So enough on that subject.</p>

<p>Your Paper will do very well.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dealing with labor strikes, see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531220-TC-JN-01"><sic>28:343</sic>,<corr>TC to JN, <date when="1853-12-20">20 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> It is temperately and clearly written; and goes to shew, both that Combination Laws,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Against unions.</note> as they can never be inforced, are useless or hurtful; and that Combinations of an unreasonable nature, especially on the part of bookmen, are certain to fail.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read your little Essay on <hi rend="italic">Cholera;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd. anon., <hi rend="italic">The Common Sense of Cholera. By a Practical Practitioner</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), 68 pp. Stirling had treated cholera victims during the <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> epidemic in S Wales. For extracts, see A. H. Stirling, 97&#x2013;101.</note> and find it a very superior piece indeed. Lucid, ingenious, deep and true; everywhere intelligible, everywhere credible to me: it is by far the best account I ever got of that strange and haggard phenomenon; concerning which, indeed, a great deal of impotent nonsense has been uttered in the world, and &#x201C;common sense,&#x201C; I fear, has been much of a rarity.&#x2014; Your little Pamphlet abounds, moreover, in fine and good ideas that are not strictly of a technical nature at all; and everywhere there come reflexes and irradiations from a general system of thought, philosophical as well as medical, which I much approve of, and which greatly distinguish you on such an occasion. You will do well, as leisure may be offered you, as <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> may be offered, to elaborate those notions; and set them forth, in practical application, to the view of the medical and general public. Too widely circulated, too thoroughly believed, they cannot be, at present. The real Physician, I believe,&#x2014;were there but such an Animal discoverable,&#x2014;is the the real Moralist withal of these epochs. How often have I reflected on that bit of old Teutonic Etymology, that &#x201C;Healthy&#x201C; is, in origin, identical with &#x201C;Holy.&#x201C; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott der Heilige</hi></foreign> (God the Holy) signifies precisely God the <hi rend="italic">Healthy</hi> too;&#x2014;and ought ever so to signify, far as we have deviated, and sadly (into bottomless abominable quagmires and cloacas) since that true epoch! Do not neglect your word in season, if the opportunity is given you.</p>
<p>I have been in many humours, and in many places, ideal and real, since the <pb id="pg-29-24" n="29:24"/>time I saw you here! You also appear to have had your changes: I wish you had spent a word or two in explaining to me what combination of winds and tides had drifted you into the harbour of St Malo, and what you were specially doing there.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stirling was living in St. Servan-sur-Mer, 2 mi.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have no news for you here; but Letters are so cheap, I may send you a line before the week end, merely to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> that we have none. I am rather deeply concerned with <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> at this time; and considerably darkened and overloaded, little <hi rend="italic">way</hi> to be made in any direction whatever. It is astonishing how small a quantity of &#x201C;work&#x201C; has filled the lapse of this week that is now departing from us! My soul is exceeding solitary, all hung with <hi rend="italic">black</hi> in general (thinking of what is gone, and what cannot return to me),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420328-TC-RWE-01"><sic>14:101</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1842-03-28">28 March 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I hold my peace in general, and accept the decrees of Heaven; still <hi rend="italic">hoping</hi> that some useful labour may be again possible for me here, which is the one consolation I can conceive at present. The burden of disordered nerves and liver,&#x2014;sure enough it does fearfully augment one&#x2019;s quantum of allotted sorrow in this world! But we cannot help it; we ought to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the best we can under it,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> spend breath or ink in lamenting over it, as here!</p>
<p>Jane is deep in carpets, stair-d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">etceteras:</hi> she has got the house now nearly rigged out; <hi rend="italic">new</hi> room wants only a day of <hi rend="italic">papering</hi>, were the weather once dry: and truly it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now a very good house, among the very <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of its kind; and will serve us very well by way of shelter in the world, so long as we need that. This upstairs room (drawing room) is practically in use, as sitting room always after dinner; and, both in space, look, and temperature, is a manifest improvement. Let us be thankful withal. No noises now disturb me; our neighbour to the right is <hi rend="italic">bound under penalty</hi> to make none;&#x2014;that settles <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dominic Ronca and family, 6 Cheyne Row; for JWC&#x2019;s dealing with their noise, see <date when="1853-12-00">Dec. 1853</date>, vol. 28.</note></p>
<p>We are still very quiet here; few visitors, and yet <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, according to my present humour. The opening of Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> will bring a more crowded time; yet to me, who care absolutely <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> what it is now to be doing, there will be less accession of disturbance than to most. I am invited for Monday to the <hi rend="italic">Conference</hi> (at the Adelphi) <hi rend="italic">on the Preston Strike;</hi> have some notion to go; but know not for certain.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> there had been wide industrial unrest. Preston weavers demanded a 10 percent increase in wages and an equalization of wages that would amount to a standard minimum wage. They said that in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date> they had taken a 10 percent reduction and had been promised restoration in better times. Though some employers agreed, others did not; and when the workers decided on a strike, the employers responded with a general lockout, early <date when="1853-10-00">Oct. 1853</date>. It attracted wide attention in the press. Palmerston, the home sec., said that he was unable to intervene. Dickens paid a visit to Preston in <date when="1854-02-00">Feb.</date>, wrote &#x201C;On Strike&#x201C; for <hi rend="italic">Household Words</hi>, and kept it in mind for <hi rend="italic">Hard Times</hi>. In <date when="1854-03-00">March</date> the employers brought in new workers, including some Irish. The strike caved in, <date when="1854-05-16">16 May</date>. The meeting to which TC was invited (there is no record of his attending) was proposed by Dr. James Booth, called by the Royal Soc. of Arts on <date when="1854-01-30">30 Jan.</date>, chaired by Lord Grosvenor, and attended by 200 delegates including Lord Goderich and F. D. Maurice. They gave a seven-hour airing to conflicting views. See H. I. Dutton and J. E. King, <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Ten Per Cent and No Surrender,&#x201C; The Preston Strike, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date></hi> (Cambridge, <date when="1981-00-00">1981</date>).</note> Abundance of rumour still ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Prince Albert (poor soul), but no sensible person that I meet takes the least share in it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As well as other rumors (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540111-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1854-01-11">11 Jan.</date></ref>), the prince was also being blamed because it was thought he might want to bring in measures against the combination laws.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I have now seen your Pamphlet both in the loose and in the bound form,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Ashburton Prizes for the Teaching of &#x201C;Common Things.&#x201C; An Account of the Proceedings of a Meeting between Lord Ashburton and the Elementary Schoolmasters, assembled at Winchester, on &#x2026; <date when="1853-12-16">December 16, 1853</date></hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>); see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531207-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:335</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-12-07">7 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>. W. H. Brookfield had invited Lord Ashburton to explain his scheme to students and schoolteachers from Winchester and Salisbury. As schools inspector, Brookfield was consulted and answered all enquiries about the scheme. It was taken up by Angela Burdett Coutts and Dickens, who alludes to it in the early chapters of <hi rend="italic">Hard Times;</hi> see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Hard Times</hi> and Common Things,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Imagined Worlds: Essays on Some English Novels and Novelists in Honour of John Butt</hi>, eds. Maynard Mack and Ian Gregor (<date when="1968-00-00">1968</date>) 183&#x2013;203.</note> in which latter state Brookfield sent it me yesterday morning.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Henry Brookfield. He and his family had spent most of <date when="1853-12-00">Dec.</date> at the Grange while the Carlyles were there; and he, TC, and Lord Ashburton visited local schools. Brookfield wrote in his diary, <date when="1854-02-05">5 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;At home till 2 when Lord Ashburton called. We talked of the Pamphlet, etc., and at 3:30 I walked with him to Bath House. <foreign><hi rend="italic">En route</hi></foreign> we passed Carlyle walking with Heyward &#x2026; . C. joined us. I poked C. and said, &#x2018;Tell me what company a man keeps and I will tell you what he is.&#x2019; He said, &#x2018;Well, I have just left a still worse man, Father Mahoney.&#x2019; I did not think this just. Had afterwards a long talk with Lady Ashburton about confidential things. In the course of which she said with a burst of tears, &#x2018;I would do anything for those children [presumably neighboring the Grange].&#x2019; &#x2026; she had lost her only child when he was an infant&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:403&#x2013;5).

Well, it is all right so far; and we ought to be thankful, and go on better and better. I persuade myself you have here opened, in a really skilful felicitous and compendious way,&#x2014;by these Prizes and by what you have said of them,&#x2014;a subject which will be found large enough, momentous enough, one day;&#x2014;that, in fact, here is the wedge (one of the gentlest and best-ground wedges) fairly got into the wood of as ugly, huge and absurd a block as ever <pb id="pg-29-28" n="29:28"/>stopped the highway in this world; and that henceforth there will be no rest till said wedge, and all manner of others like it, are hammered home, and the ugly enormous block (produce of mere monkery and other extinct conditions and influences) is reduced to manageable pieces, and ultimately to splinters, to fuel and euthenasia! Heaven send it swiftly. There never was, I think, a more monstrous pernicious delusion than this, which we find quietly established as a universal Nightmare over the &#x201C;educated&#x201C; part of the human species, That the end and aim of all learning, is that we may learn to wag our tongue; write books, deliver bursts of parliamentary eloquence<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18360730-JWC-TC-01"><sic>9:29</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March 1833</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18330321-TC-JHLH-01"><sic>393</sic><corr>TC to JHLH, <date when="1833-03-21">21 March 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c! Which may the Devil fly away with, root and branch the sooner the better! Amen, amen.</p>
<p>We have no news here; nothing that is worth mentioning in such a haste as I am in. London streets have grown much more populous for me; and men oftener get me engaged in a few passes of the thing called talk; but that is seldom an advantage to me; for increase either of knowledge on any subject, or of human sympathy, I find it really a deeper kind of <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> for most part.

<p>Yesterday I fancied we had got good weather; but today the fine vernal skies are defaced with sleet and stormy rain; which indeed is according to nature too.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have neither time nor paper today; but before the week end (which yours by the Moffat post-rules is now doing) I must acknowledge the reception of your two Notes; for which I am much obliged: they are almost my only correspondence for 8 days past, and I am always very glad of them or the like of them. Poor old &#x201C;Parliament&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Little, surgeon of Ecclefechan, called &#x201C;Parliament Geordie&#x201C; because his father lived in Parliament Close, Ecclefechan; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210110-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:305</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-10">10 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361120-TC-MAC-01"><sic>9:85</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1836-11-20">20 Nov. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> His death comes on me with a heavy dull impressiveness; like a blow from a <hi rend="italic">sack</hi>. He was one of the most gross and low-sunk of men: but I remember him out of early youth; a boy with me at <pb id="pg-29-29" n="29:29"/>Hoddam school (some 5 or 6 years older only), where they used to upbraid him with being &#x201C;born in a chaise, and carried to Annan in a basket&#x201C;: then at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, how memorable: and now he has fallen off his chair, smoking; and sunk away forever under ground! I feel on such occasions as if another <hi rend="italic">shilling</hi> were taken out of a purse where there are now but few; and soon there will be no companions of one&#x2019;s young years left on the Earth at all. A prospect of huge <hi rend="italic">solitude</hi> rises ahead of the old man. Yet age too has or may have, its advantages, its blessednesses, and valiant victories: let us try for these!</p>
<p>I did not mean that the Cholera Pamphlet<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By J. H. Stirling; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540118-TC-JHS-01">TC to JHS, <date when="1854-01-18">18 Jan.</date></ref></note> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> to you with industry, but that it should come when <hi rend="italic">you</hi> came within arm&#x2019;s length of it. I want nothing more of the letters; I think of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> very much as you seem to do,&#x2014;found it clever, vivid, &#x201C;headlong,&#x201C; and rather explanatory of Cholera to me.&#x2014; I have not written to Jean yet, and ought to have.</p>
<p>I am <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in respect to <hi rend="italic">bile;</hi> two blue pills, in near succession, did me a visible benefit. I am still weak enough; full of <hi rend="italic">weakness;</hi> but hope to gather strength, and clearness withal, by force of being <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>.&#x2014; We have got spring weather, very cold, within a week; skies quite <hi rend="italic">vernal</hi> in complexion, now and then wrinkled into sleety storms; air <hi rend="italic">always</hi> brisk, which is better than the muggy kind with streets of black-soap! I am not absolutely idle; but nobody can succeed worse with work: ah me, ah me!</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>You are very good to write to me twice, since no answer came to your first. The second Note has stirred up my conscience, among various other effects upon me; and as there is a half hour, <hi rend="italic">between</hi> jobs, at present; I may as well answer now as later and with a worse grace.</p>
<p>My poor Mother&#x2019;s good old Missives, turning up again in this manner, caught me keenly by the heart. Alas, alas, she is gone from us; and we must not lament her, cannot complain of the universal inevitable law. She was lent to us, as it were, to the very last day that it could be profitable: many a time in these hard cold mornings I think, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">She</hi> is not suffering by it!&#x201C; We could not protect her farther; the time was come when we had to part. God is over all! I could not destroy these poor old letters; yet some day they must be destroyed, for they belong to ourselves alone, and stupid &#x201C;posterity,&#x201C; if it thought of such a thing, would make mere nonsense of them: I have sealed these two up, in a safe place; I have others also scattered about in certain <pb id="pg-29-31" n="29:31"/>parcels in my drawers: one day before I die, I must sort all that, and call in the aid of <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> in behalf of what is sacred.&#x2014; My good, my kind and dear old Mother! I speak of her to nobody; speak with people about anything that is of the day and place: but the instant I am left alone, her meek image rises on me; her face as she lay in bed that last sunday; her kind smiles on me, flickering thro&#x2019; the gloomy clouds of death in those last two days,&#x2014;and then backwards thro&#x2019; all the scenes and passages since memory began with me:&#x2014;all this is constant enough in its attendance: I often think it is with me as with Ulysses (in old Homer); at the utmost and worst passage of his wanderings he converses with the Shade of his mother!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> 11:141&#x2013;224.</note> My heart does not lament; but it is sad often as heart can be. And yet not a bitter or unblessed sadness: God be forever thanked that He gave us such a mother; and spared her with us so long. I will speak no more of these things.</p>
<p>As you seem to have seen my last letter to Jack, I can have no news to occupy your paper with. We are both of us in the usual ineffectual state of health, not worse, rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> I; nor am I quite useless for work, tho&#x2019; my success is, it must be owned, inconceivably small! I keep mining, and digging and shovelling; something will and must come out of it yet, if I live. If I don&#x2019;t,&#x2014;well, it is perhaps little matter to any one, and to me certainly none, if I have done my best. I feel in my heart every day a greater contempt for what they talk of as &#x201C;fame,&#x201C; &#x201C;success&#x201C; &#x26;c in this poor Anthill of a world; and looking at it <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019; spectacles</hi>, as I now do, the royallest figures in it do not seem too royal. I am getting freer and freer of a great many ugly coils, delusions and encumbrances, by dint of seeing them better and myself better,&#x2014;with old eyes instead of young.</p>
<p>We have dry brisk, but excessively cold and barren weather here; a bitter frost every night, <hi rend="italic">rime</hi> lying white every morning; and all day, with or with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sun, an easterly air which only vigorous walking can subdue the cold of. Everything is very dear in markets, Jane says; everything. A better harvest will be very agreeable next time.&#x2014; People babble greatly about a Turk war;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The British and French fleets sailed to the Black Sea at the end of <date when="1853-12-00">Dec. 1853</date> to clear it of Russian ships.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>If you have, yourself, any preference for either of the Titles, pray put which you please.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> I think the better Title in Scotland, where it is universally understood as indicating the unique man; but in this end of the Island there may perhaps be a shade of reason for the additional <hi rend="italic">Robert;</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; whether enough to rouse us into <hi rend="italic">changing</hi> what already is?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540104-TC-EC-01">TC to EC, <date when="1854-01-04">4 Jan.</date></ref> <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> was chosen. This and <hi rend="italic">Samuel Johnson</hi> (<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>) were essays by TC in Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s &#x201C;Reading for Travellers&#x201C; series. Chapman &#x26; Hall advertised <hi rend="italic">Burns, Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1854-03-04">4 March</date>, as ready &#x201C;This day, price 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>As to the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Samuel</hi>&#x201C; of <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi>, there will be other Titles (indeed almost all the others, I think) where it will not be suitable to give the Christian name: &#x201C;Voltaire,&#x201C; &#x201C;Goethe&#x201C; &#x26;c.&#x2014; On the whole, if you have not more preference for the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Robert</hi>&#x201C; than I, you will be apt to let the thing stand as it is;&#x2014;apt, or indeed certain at this stage of the business. However, I say again: Follow confidently <hi rend="italic">your own feeling</hi> of the matter; with an eye on what is past, and on what is coming.</p>

<salute>Dear Milnes,</salute>
<p>I wish you would tell me something definite about that grand Proposal of manning the Civil Service by persons chosen according to their merit?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Entry into the civil service was by nomination and minimal qualifying exam. TC refers to the Northcote-Trevelyan <hi rend="italic">Report on the Organisation of the Permanent Civil Service together with a Letter from the Rev. B. Jowett</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, 27, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), dated <date when="1853-11-23">23 Nov. 1853</date>, pbd. on presentation to Parliament, <date when="1854-02-24">24 Feb.</date>, leaked to the press two weeks before. Many of TC&#x2019;s friends were concerned about it; it aroused heated discussion and some resentment. TC himself was already known for urging its recommended reforms, including &#x201C;active research,&#x201C; like the Chinese, &#x201C;to discover the men of talent &#x2026; in the young generation&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi>, 5:169), the need for an &#x201C;aristocracy of talent&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi>, 10:27&#x2013;33), and better ways to find good administrators as in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi>. Some time after this, he dashed off a response; see K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Unpublished Comments on the Northcote-Trevelyan Report,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Annual</hi>, 10 (<date when="1989-00-00">1989</date>): 5&#x2013;13 (MS: Beinecke Lib., Yale Univ.; pbd: Fielding, 8&#x2013;12). It shows mingled approval and doubt about competitive academic examinations, the need for personal integrity in candidates, and a reform of all current shams. Lord Ashburton was on Macaulay&#x2019;s committee for the parliamentary report on examinations for candidates to be appointed by merit for the East India Co. (submitted late <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550214-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1855-02-14">14 Feb. 1855</date></ref>); but Milnes &#x201C;was not altogether in favour of the reform&#x201C; of the civil service (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:495). TC&#x2019;s private thoughts went even beyond <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> and perhaps account for his omission from the 40-odd notables (inc. Mill, Henry Cole, and Edwin Chadwick) who were officially invited to comment. TC rightly foresaw delay. An order in council, <date when="1855-05-21">21 May 1855</date>, merely set up three commissioners to deal with admission to the service, and no more than gradual changes occurred until another such order, <date when="1870-06-04">4 June 1870</date>, when Robert Lowe ensured that the original proposals were made to bite. TC meanwhile retired to his attic room.</note> Or if you know little or nothing about it, will you (for my sake and your own) make some precise inquiries in the proper quarter; and pause again in your riding, <pb id="pg-29-35" n="29:35"/>some day soon, to tell me how it stands with that matter. I really am much interested about it; and can find nobody to give me information that will amount to anything. Certainly there never was in my time such a &#x201C;Reform&#x201C; set on foot as this same might be; a thing worth all other &#x201C;reforms&#x201C; put together; and indeed practically inclusive of all (for there is no other wanted, or even conceivable, according to my notions); and I confess I would not exchange the right <hi rend="italic">attempt</hi> at this, for all the ballot boxes, or want of ballot boxes, in the world; which latter entities (with their franchises, beer-barrels, hustings oratory &#x26;c &#x26;c) have, after long sinking, quite reached zero many years ago with me.</p>
<p>I can foresee endless difficulties in the execution of such an attempt: but the attempt is great, salutary, and I believe <hi rend="italic">indispensable:</hi> your Chancellor of the Exchequer, or whoever it is that has charge of, must in no wise abandon it for difficulties; let him persist in Heaven&#x2019;s name and England&#x2019;s; gradually all good citizens, all wise men, will rally to him, and he will have begun a new epoch in English History, and done a service required by God and man!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He wrote in his Journal, around this time: &#x201C;New mode of manning the Civil service: all to be chosen by fair competition. What a scheme of &#x2018;reform&#x2019; is there! This seems to me worth all the reform-bills ever heard of; I am really ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to be again interested in this: I feel that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> &#x2018;includes everything&#x2019; (as Jane said, when I told her). But it will be difficult to <hi rend="italic">do:</hi> how <hi rend="italic">will</hi> poor Gladstone [chancellor of the exchequer] try it? With all my heart I would help him if I could.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>In short, come to me again soon, and give your wisest account of all that, not to speak of other things. I am here daily till 3&#xBD; p.m.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Mr. Allingham,&#x2014;</salute>You are not taking it ill of me that I did not thank you for your poems <hi rend="italic">before reading them?</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Day and Night Songs</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>); rev. and enlarged as <hi rend="italic">The Music Master, A Love Story, and two series of Day and Night Songs</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>).</note> at least were I in your case <hi rend="italic">and knowing what I know</hi>, it would be far from me to take it ill!</p>
<p>I have now read every line of these poems&#x2014;a great praise in itself&#x2014;considering the anti-poetic atmosphere I live in, and how impatient I am become, at second-hand, of the general run of Poems; and to speak quite sincerely I find <pb id="pg-29-36" n="29:36"/>all of them good reading, and some of them really beautiful and worth getting by heart. &#x201C;The Dream&#x201C; in particular pleases me, and one verse of it brought a gush of tears from my eyes,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably the sixth stanza, which reminds her of her mother: &#x201C;How long since I saw that fair pale face! / Ah! Mother dear! might I only place / My head on thy breast, a moment to rest, / While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest!&#x201C; In a review, <date when="1854-04-29">29 April</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> described Allingham as &#x201C;a real minstrel. His lines make music to the ear rather than to the eye &#x2026; . His style is Tennysonian; and the quality of his thought is sweet and simple rather than broad and grand. He is very clear.&#x201C;</note> and if you knew what remarkably dry eyes I read with generally&#x2014;nay, live with generally&#x2014;you would attach some importance to this manifestation of feeling!</p>
<p>Even Mr. C. read &#x201C;The Dream&#x201C; without a word of objection and a good many of approbation. I wish you great success in your enterprise. It must be a hard fight in the beginning for anybody unless born with &#x2018;a popular novel&#x2019; in his mouth, to live by literature in London. But I do believe always to a certain imaginable extent, that &#x201C;our wishes are presentiments of our powers.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Come and tell me all about it the first Sunday morning you have leisure.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Yours truly with many thanks /</salute></closer> <name>Jane Carlyle</name></p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>:</salute>
<p>A week ago I received your kind and pleasant letter, intimating to me, among other welcome things, that you had received the Illinois Bond safe, and would, as your beneficent purpose had been, take charge of it in due business form, which is all right and a real favor done me; which in fact, as it were, absolves my lazy mind from any farther thought or trouble about that matter; there being evidently nothing half so good I could have done with it, and therefore in the meanwhile, nothing further whatever that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to do with it. With many sincere thanks, let it so stand therefore! I have only to add that the 3 coupons you inquire about are quite gone beyond my reach or inquiry. I suppose them to have been given off for 3 installments of interest, which were, (as I can remember) paid to me in regular succession, long years ago, when a worthy friend, a merchant in the city, now deceased, had charge of the Bond for me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hamilton (d. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400211-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:43</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-02-11">11 Feb. 1840</date></corr></ref>), see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510814-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:130&#x2013;31</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-08-14">14 Aug. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> if that was not their fate, I cannot form a guess about it; <pb id="pg-29-37" n="29:37"/>but in any case, they are to be held, these 3 coupons, as extinct for us, and finally gone. And this is now all I have to say upon the Illinois Bond. Requesting you only not to bother yourself with it, beyond what comes quite in your way in the current of far wider operations, I will leave that rather memorable Document now at length well lodged in your repositories, and dismiss it again quite into the background of my own remembrances.</p>
<p>We are struck with a glad surprise to hear you have been so supremely hospitable to our voyaging painter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Laurence, Butler&#x2019;s guest during his stay in New York; he sketched and painted Butler and his family.</note> To snatch him, the thin-skinned, sea-worn man, from the horrors of a stranger hotel or boarding-house, and bid him come and rest in safety, under soft covers and protection, in the house of a human friend; this is indeed a high and fine procedure; but it is far beyond what is demanded or expected in these later unheroic ages! I can only say we find a beautiful &#x201C;politeness of the old school&#x201C; in all this, and in the way all this is spoken of and done; and do very much thank Miss Lynch and yourself for all your kindnesses; and shall (if we be wise) silently regard the existence of such a temper of mind, thousands of miles away from us, as a real possession in this world.</p>
<p>Miss B.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Delia Bacon.</note> sends no sign whatever from St. Albans; we suppose her to be, day and night, strenuously wrestling down in her own peculiar way, that monstrous problem she has got; poor lady, I really wish I heard of her safe home again, and well out of it, on any terms.

According to Alexander Herzen (see <ref target="volume-27/ed-27-introduction"><sic>27:xi&#x2013;xiv</sic><corr>27:introduction</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/ed-27-biographical-notes"><sic>397</sic><corr>27:biographical note</corr></ref>) who was also there, President Franklin Pierce (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>) was &#x201C;being sulky&#x201C; with the European govts., so a diplomatic dinner was given &#x201C;to the enemies of all existing governments.&#x201C; Mazzini had sent Herzen a note with Saunders&#x2019;s invitation &#x201C;saying that the dinner was being given to annoy someone and to demonstrate sympathy with someone else.&#x201C; Despite both having lived in London for several years, Kossuth and Ledru-Rollin met formally for the first time (introduced by Buchanan and Mazzini) (<hi rend="italic">The Memoirs of Alexander Herzen</hi>, trans.

Undoubtedly a diplomatic mistake (in a small way) on the part of Mr. B.; which, however, it is expected he will amply redeem by and by.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sister,&#x2014;</salute>I sent you off a parcel of Pamphlets today (<hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> one of them); but I wanted to write a word too, and had not quite time at home (owing to &#x201C;hours of departure&#x201C; in Chelsea), so have run in here to do it.</p>
<p>The last that wrote was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> you, I think, but myself? Well, that is no matter; I want a little word from you at any rate. James&#x2019;s Newspaper came this week <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the Strokes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The strokes were usually put on the newspaper to mean all was well.</note> which is quite unusual, and excited various speculations in me: Jane did indeed gainsay, all she could,&#x2014;but, on the whole, I had rather have a word if all is right; and still more now, if all is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.</p>
<p>Of myself I had almost <supplied>[no]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> account to give that is worth writing. The frosty spring weather is not favourable to my health; it never quite knocks me down, but is apt to keep me perceptibly <hi rend="italic">unfitter for work</hi> than the average. &#x201C;Work&#x201C; accordingly gets on very badly indeed: alas, alas!&#x2014; Poor Jane has been kept within doors in a lamed state these ten days by a kind of cold, not very severe tho&#x2019; troublesome enough: she now begins to venture out again, tho still encumbered by the remnants of the disorder. Our weather is beautiful to look upon; useful for the husbandman too, and therefore not to be complained of: but it is not wholesome for persons of thin skin. Every morning there is <hi rend="italic">rime</hi>, ice if opportunity have offered; cold indeed is sharp and snell, and till 10 o&#x2019;clock or so we have a dirty fog which makes it complete: <hi rend="italic">after</hi> which, the sun having got the master, we have a blazing splendour as of summer, and one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">lightest</hi> coat is welcomest till towards evening when all is Greenland again.</p>
<p>The Town is got full, and is getting fuller and fuller, with noises of Parliament &#x26;c &#x26;c: but we are very little concerned indeed with all that, and live, I daresay, about as quietly as you do, if not more so,&#x2014;seeing, or seeking to see, I at least, an extremely small number of persons; if it be not <hi rend="italic">on the street</hi>, where (in gloomy solitude of meditation) I see tens of thousands!</p>
<p>Jack has sent no word, this some time; indeed I suspect it is I that am in <pb id="pg-29-39" n="29:39"/>turn to write. I fear he has got no house yet?&#x2014; <closer><salute>A word, now, on the Sunday, if you can;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Fri.</note> and so good b&#x2019;ye again, dear Sister; for I must end at this point</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have seen my Cousin M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Pringle.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Pringle, b. Hunter, m. to Dr. Pringle of Lann Hall, nr.

But the longer she sat with me, the more apparent it became that she had made such &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a guy</hi>&#x201C; of herself, thro&#x2019; sheer simplicity. On her second visit she was dressed like a rational creature, and looked as well again. Tomorrow evening she is to bring her husband whom I have not seen yet, The child I never wish to see again! It is an &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">enfant terrible</hi></foreign>&#x201C; [outrageous child]&#x2014; How such a sensible woman allows her child to be so tiresome is almost as incomprehensible to me as how she comes to wear <hi rend="italic">such a cloak!</hi> All this in <hi rend="italic">confidence</hi> of course&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I have run in hither to write you a small bulletin; one word to signify that I and my affairs are alive, and that on the whole things in general remain with me precisely as they were. Is not that an important purpose on my part? Do you get many Letters of that depth of meaning?&#x2014;</p>
<p>But in serious truth if any demon <hi rend="italic">should</hi> whisper into your noble heart that you are getting forgotten in the Suburb of Chelsea, that you are no longer so loved and regarded as in times past,&#x2014;that there is in that locality a base Judean who will throw a pearl away richer than all his tribe,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 5.2.</note>&#x2014;then do not, Oh never do believe said demon; for he is and will be speaking <hi rend="italic">false</hi>, and predicting a thing that cannot occur.&#x2014; And so let it rest: alas, the times are hard; and we must wait for better,&#x2014;with or without much hope of their coming.</p>
<p>I am myself still as low in humour, as helpless and hopeless, as when you left me; keep daily struggling to do some work, and daily fall (as it were) afaint amid my tools, and cannot so much as dig a barrow of rubbish, and wheel it away! This is bad; but this must mend. In fact my spirits (as you naturally guess) are not joyful but mournful just now; all thought still gravitates with me towards one sad subject; common talk and intercourse (right <hi rend="italic">labour</hi>, as I said, there is not) are but as a light film of froth, and the black still water is below.&#x2014; Perhaps it is good for me, too:&#x2014;we must say no more of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written at length in his Journal, <date when="1854-02-28">28 Feb.</date>, about continued difficulties in writing <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, which looked like never taking shape: &#x201C;in fact, the problem is, to burn away the immense dungheap of the <date>18th century</date>, with its ghastly cants, foul blind sensualities, cruelties, and <hi rend="italic">inanity</hi> now fallen <hi rend="italic">putrid</hi> &#x2026; . Sunday morning last, there came into my mind a vision of the old Sunday-mornings I had seen at Mainhill &#x26;c &#x2026; it has all melted into the still sea; it was &#x2018;rounded with a sleep.&#x2019; So with all things. &#x2026; This tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Exeunt omnes</hi></foreign>,&#x2019; &#x26; how the generations are like crops of grass &#x2026; these things, tho&#x2019; half a century old in me, possess my mind as they never did before &#x2026; . &#x2018;Like Ulysses,&#x2019; as I say, I &#x2018;converse with the Shade of my Mother;&#x2019;&#x2014;and sink out, of all company and light common talk, into that grand element of sorrow &#x26; eternal stillness. &#x2026; Oh pious Mother, kind good brave and truthful soul as I have ever found &#x2026; your poor Tom (long out of his schooldays now) has fallen very lonely, very lame and broken in this pilgrimage of his, and you cannot help him, or cheer him by a kind word any more!&#x201C;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-41" n="29:41"/>Jane continues still poorly; ventures out a little now in the sunny hours, but still has a great deal of cold. I am myself decidedly below par; as almost everybody is. The weather is full of frost, a sullen blistering fog (frozen-fog) every morning till ten or 11; then sun like midsummer for two or three hours: it is extremely pernicious weather to the thin of skin. Today the fog has continued, or only lifted itself a few years;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;yards&#x201C;?</note> and we have no tradition of sun: but I think I smell <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>, and a change, which will perhaps do better.</p>
<p>One day Milnes gave me a visit; very fat, and happy as ever; full of amusement at Drummond&#x2019;s Pamphlet &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Drummond (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8067"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310817-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:341&#x2013;42</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-17">17 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>), author of <hi rend="italic">The Fate of Christendom</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), in which he writes of the corruption into which hierarchical govt. has fallen and the dangers of democracy.</note> I read Drummond since you went: really a most notable piece; very <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> withal, much more so than the <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> of Henry almost ever is, and abounding in utterances and calculations that are enough to make the ears tingle,&#x2014;if anybody <hi rend="italic">heard</hi>, or listened, which the Bookseller tells me nobody does. &#x201C;Bless you, sir, 250 copies or so: I believe he has lost some 7 or 8 thousand pounds by his Writings before this!&#x201C;&#x2014;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Bosworth. The pamphlet had three edns. in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>.</note> For the rest, I in <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> greatly agree with Henry in this Pamphlet; deducting &#x201C;Christ&#x201C; &#x26;c, I find he has seen into many things in a really true and remarkable way.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-02-28">28 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;Mad, shamefully dark and narrow theory of the world, but such an earnestness of moral conviction as is very far from common just now. In the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of the matter I have large tracts of perfect agreement with him.&#x201C;</note> I sent off my Copy of it (along with one of <hi rend="italic">Common Things</hi>)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Ashburton Prizes for the Teaching of &#x201C;Common Things.&#x201C;</hi></note> to the good Thomas Erskine,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine wrote from Edinburgh, <date when="1854-03-22">22 March</date>: &#x201C;Drummond&#x2019;s pamphlet is a strange production &#x2026; . Your friend Lord George Hill has done something it appears, &#x26; gives occasion to deserve the multiplication of Lord Georges. He &#x26; Lord Ashburton both act on Nelson&#x2019;s signal &#x2018;England expects every man to do his duty&#x2019; &#x2026; . We had a visit from your friend Kingsley &#x26; I heard his lectures on Alexandria in company with dear old James Mackenzie &#x2026; . Poor fellow he has lost his sisters this last winter, one by death &#x26; the other by mental disease, which makes him very lonely&#x2014;but he has a fine sociable loving spirit.&#x201C;</note> who likes to see signs of the times.</p>
<p>I had your Oxford Professor, Vaugh<supplied>[an]</supplied>,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted; Henry Halford Vaughan.</note> too, one afternoon: he dined, walked, took tea; the long visit and fret (tho&#x2019; of my own seeking) was very unfriendly to my nerves for two days after! Vaughan is a clear, still-eyed, intelligent, almost clerical-looking man (tho&#x2019; far <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> from Orthodoxy, as I can perceive): an especially serious-minded carefully cultivated person;&#x2014; <pb id="pg-29-42" n="29:42"/>would be perfect, if his talk flowed a little more freely, and especially if his <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> did. He has indeed a decided deficiency of fun (tho&#x2019; not a total want), and tends slightly, in vise [view?] of that, towards the stickish in some outward respects. But I think him a most worthy man, and design to see more of him as I have opportunity.</p>
<p>I wish L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> interest yourselves about the Civil Service and Promotion by merit. The more I think of that, the more important it seems to me,&#x2014;the crown and summary of all conceivable &#x201C;reforms&#x201C;; and <hi rend="italic">immensely</hi> wanted, if it could be well done? And how can it ever be done, if the wise and distinguished do not help to say, &#x201C;Try it; let us <hi rend="italic">all</hi> try it!&#x201C; It seems to me the real <hi rend="italic">Noah&#x2019;s Ark</hi> for this perishing Epoch. That is the way to &#x201C;translate&#x201C; us;&#x2014;and Drummond shan&#x2019;t go!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Enough, enough, dear lady of ladies: I am far too long here, and must run for my life.</p>
<p>Bid Lord A<hi rend="italic">n call</hi> if he ever come to Town; can&#x2019;t you? No answer: I will write again before long.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I got both your Notes with many thanks for them; but have been hindered hitherto, by small causes, from writing. I send a hasty word today, lest you may think there is something wrong; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there is not.&#x2014; We have indeed very unwholesome weather,&#x2014;today, for example, the <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> is still hanging over us in the form of pestilential sooty fog, and I am here <hi rend="italic">burning daylight</hi> (cannot <hi rend="italic">see</hi> at all otherwise) as in the worst days of Nov<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> not to say that my fingers, in spite of the swift walk from Chelsea, are half-numb as in winter frost! The weather has given poor Jane a cold, and has somewhat lamed me too; but that is all that can be reported out of joint.</p>
<p>I much wish, and partly hope, you may find <hi rend="italic">Dienbie</hi> an eligible house: no steadiness of any kind is to be expected till once you are fairly fixed in that particular.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denbie House, about 5 mi.

John wrote, <date when="1854-04-12">12 Apr.</date>, that it was &#x201C;still unfinished inside, one of the best rooms being unplastered. It is 7 miles from Lockerby &#x26; Ecclef<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x2014;8 from Annan 11 from Dumfries&#x2014;vast though it is very dry; &#x26; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> require many things before we could inhabit it.&#x201C; They were unable to see it in early <date when="1854-04-00">April</date> because Phoebe became unwell on the journey; the owner J. H. Carruthers, a navy surgeon, then advertised it, John and Phoebe losing interest in renting it.</note> I forgot always to say that if you did come up to London, looking for houses, or on any other errand, the room at Chelsea is now in perfect <pb id="pg-29-43" n="29:43"/>order,&#x2014;and the whole house,&#x2014;really a very good house, of its kind, tho&#x2019; we have bought it dear.</p>
<p>Today I send a Newspaper wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has come to me this morning, with indication in it that W. Forster of Bradford&#x2019;s Father, the good Quaker, is dead; rather suddenly, it seems, in Tennessee, in the American West.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Edward Forster.

<p>Anthony Sterling has decided to go and fight the Russians!

Campbell of Islay who was engaged to one of his grandmothers. Campbell commanded the Highland Brigade, <date when="1854-02-10">10 Feb.</date>, appointing Sterling his brigade maj. They embarked at Woolwich, <date when="1854-04-05">5 April</date>, and reached Constantinople, <date when="1854-04-25">25 April</date>.</note> He professes to have little hope of fighting, expects rather to die of dysentery (about Varna,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fortified seaport, NE Bulgaria, on the Black Sea, where the British and French were organizing their forces for invasion of the Crimea; the Russian fleet was at Sebastopol.</note> I think) somewhere in the Danubian-Bog Countries!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Danubian principalities were Moldavia and Wallachia; they became the principality of Rumania, <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>.</note> He came down to us one night; gloomy as the Abyss, and spoke hardly anything: indeed he is not far from <hi rend="italic">mad</hi>, and his Wife<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Sterling.</note> (they suppose) is again going to be so.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am surely much your debtor for that fine Book you sent me last week;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">My Schools and Schoolmasters; or the Story of My Education</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>).</note> which was welcome in two ways, the extrinsic first, and now the intrinsic; for I have read it to the end (not a common thing at all in such cases), and found it right pleasant company for the evenings I stole in behalf of it! Truly I am very glad to condense the bright but indistinct rumour labelled to me by your name, for years past, into the ruddy-visaged, strong-boned, glowing Figure of a Man which I have got,&#x2014;and bid good-speed to, with all my heart!</p>
<p>You have, as you undertook to do, painted many things to us; scenes of life, scenes of Nature, which rarely come upon the canvas;&#x2014;and I will add, such <hi rend="italic">Draughtsmen</hi> too are extremely uncommon, in that and in other walks of painting. There is a right genial fire in the Book, everywhere nobly tempered down into peaceful radical-heat, which is very beautiful to see. Luminous, memorable; all wholesome, strong, fresh and breezy, like the &#x201C;Old Red Sandstone Mountains&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His highly thought of <hi rend="italic">The Old Red Sandstone</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), serialized, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, in the <hi rend="italic">Witness</hi>, was about the geology of the sandstone of Ross and Cromarty where he grew up.</note> on a sunny summer day:&#x2014;it is really a long while since I have read a Book worthy of so much recognition from me; or likely to be so interesting to soundhearted men of every degree&#x2014;I might have my objections and exceptions here and there (not to the matter, I think, however, if sometimes to the form); but this is really the summary of my judgment on the business. <closer><salute>And so, once more, I return you many thanks, as for a Gift that was very kind, and has been very pleasant to me;&#x2014;and, with many respects and good wishes, remain, / My dear Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>You have come upon a great truth; one of the deepest and most fertile, in reference to all provinces of human affairs;&#x2014;which has never, I suppose, been expressly <hi rend="italic">controverted</hi> by anybody, but which has been forgotten profoundly on all hands,&#x2014;as we may see everywhere, from Hugo Reid&#x2019;s &#x201C;ventilation&#x201C; (attempting to make air circulate by bellows-blasts)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugo Reid (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23329"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), educational writer, author of school textbooks, mainly on scientific subjects. TC may refer to his <hi rend="italic">Natural Philosophy; Adapted for Self-Instruction and Use in Schools. Book First, Pneumatics</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>); he is also referring to Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s pamphlet; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540209-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1854-02-09">9 Feb.</date></ref></note> up to Oxford-University &#x201C;Education,&#x201C; and higher! A truly fatal oblivion and ignoring on the <pb id="pg-29-47" n="29:47"/>part of almost all men. To attempt &#x201C;educating&#x201C; in ignorance of this principle produces&#x2014;what we see among the Educated: Education by <hi rend="italic">cram;</hi> really, in many respects, to feeding by <hi rend="italic">cram</hi> (instead of by <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> with <hi rend="italic">appetite</hi>); out of which strange processes no body and no soul ever was, or could be, increased in strength or in health, however much it might be blown up in diameter!&#x2014; I recommend you much to prosecute that idea; which will lead to great results, in Education especially.</p>
<p>As I said, there is nobody known to me who has ever <hi rend="italic">contradicted</hi> the idea; nor could anybody, at least since the notion of <hi rend="italic">Original Sin</hi> was, to all practical purposes, tacitly given up;&#x2014;indeed it is in the notion of Man being originally <hi rend="italic">damned</hi>, and only likely to get his salvation by learning to read certain Greek and Hebrew <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> that Oxford University and the other <hi rend="italic">Cram</hi> Establishments can make a good excuse for themselves; excuse partly valid while that notion lasted. But as to affirming, and expressly setting forth, of this idea, I know nobody who has done so with anything like such faculty as Goethe in the Meister&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wanderjahre;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The second of Goethe&#x2019;s novels dealing with Wilhelm Meister, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>, trans. by TC as <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels</hi> (vol. 4 of <hi rend="italic">German Romance</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>]; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 24:191ff).</note> which Book I again join My Lady in much recommending to you, as worthy of perusal and re-perusal, till you have completely got into the Author&#x2019;s point of view, which is not easy for an English reader. You will find that no man was ever more completely filled with your notion than Goethe, tho&#x2019; perhaps he says little of it in express terms; and that his whole Scheme of Education is a beautiful (and truly unrivalled) symbollical <hi rend="italic">preaching</hi> of the same. Richter also, whose <hi rend="italic">Levana</hi> you know,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. P. F. Richter, <hi rend="italic">Levana</hi> (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>; extended <date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), a treatise on education, trans. as <hi rend="italic">Levana, or the Doctrine of Education</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>).</note> has many good hints on the subject; and in particular, I can remember, pleased me much by inculcating that nothing, no passion, tendency, should be <hi rend="italic">rooted out</hi> in a man, but only <hi rend="italic">guided</hi>, and the counter-tendency encouraged if necessary; the worth of the man being simply the <hi rend="italic">sum</hi> of these and of his wise management of these.</p>
<p>In my own reading I can recollect no Book worth classing in the same list with these, as respects this matter. But I believe there is a good deal about it, under a very inferior but more practical form, in the writings of Pestalozzi;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><sic>Johannn</sic><corr>Johann</corr> Heinrich Pestalozzi (<date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), Swiss educational reformer.</note> most of which, I suppose, are to be had in French, if not in English, out of the original German; and the whole of which are probably worth your attention while occupied in this way. Pestalozzi&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, I believe, is <hi rend="italic">biographically</hi> interesting as well;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There are various autobiographical works by Pestalozzi; possibly <hi rend="italic">Meine Lebensschicksale als Vorsteher meiner Erziehungsinstitute in Burgdorf und Iferten</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>) or <hi rend="italic">Leben und Ansichten in einem wortgetreuen Auszuge aus s&#xE4;mmtlichen von Pestalozzi herrruhenden Schriften zur Feier von dessen hundertstem Geburtstage</hi>, ed. R. Christoffel (Zurich, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>).</note> and may be safely recommended, to begin with: you will <pb id="pg-29-48" n="29:48"/>doubtless get there, best of all, indication of what else he has written in the line that interests you. <hi rend="italic">Fellenberg&#x2019;s</hi> Books and Pamphlets might also be examined with good hope:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philipp Emmanuel von Fellenberg (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>), Swiss educationist. His father had been a friend of Pestalozzi.</note> a Swiss Baron who set up a School of his own for Peasants, and practically hoed and ploughed with them, for many a year;&#x2014;indeed you are, as it were, bound to make due acquaintance with such a neighbour and foregoer in this of &#x201C;Common Things.&#x201C;&#x2014; Of our English works on Education I know none even by name, except Locke&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Educ</hi>n, and Roger Ascham&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Schoolmaster;</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Locke, <hi rend="italic">Some Thoughts Concerning Education</hi> (<date when="1693-00-00">1693</date>). Roger Ascham, <hi rend="italic">The Schoolmaster</hi> (<date when="1570-00-00">1570</date>).</note> both of which I, in like manner, hold you &#x201C;bound&#x201C; to read, tho&#x2019; probably you will get little out of them for your present objects. Pestalozzi&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> is the first new thing. If in getting it, or getting, or inquiring after, anything else, or all things else, of course I shall be but too happy. And so, right good speed to your Lordship on this new career; and may some of the things you are privileged to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> for truths get themselves a little realised into blessed facts among us by the great help you can in various ways give them!

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I yesterday got, from Scotsbrig, these Canada Letters, which I think you have not seen: I send them at any rate; and after you have done with them, you can send them on to Mary. They contain little, but on the whole nothing that is not favourable, except that <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> or illness of Alick&#x2019;s youngest boy,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander and Janet&#x2019;s youngest boy was Robert (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1932-00-00">1932</date>), but it was their third (out of six), Alexander (<date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1931-00-00">1931</date>), who had been ill. In his letter of <date when="1854-03-24">24 March</date>, Alick wrote: &#x201C;poor Alick has been ill of inflammatory rheumatism all winter nearly&#x2014;he can now move about the doors and sleeps moderately well.&#x201C;</note> of which I had heard nothing before. I conclude indeed that there has been one Letter of his and Jenny&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning, TC&#x2019;s youngest sister.</note> to somebody or other about Annandale, which I have never seen; Letter written in <hi rend="italic">answer</hi>, namely, to the sad tidings I sent from Scotsbrig while there? To myself there has come nothing of reply, except the little yellow fraction of Newspaper-cover, which I likewise send,&#x2014;and which came only <hi rend="italic">two days ago</hi>, tho&#x2019; it seems to be (by the <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> itself) to be<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> of <hi rend="italic">a fortnight</hi> earlier date.&#x2014; Poor souls, they are all toiling on, yonder; and we must all toil on!&#x2014; While Time yet is!</p>
<p>I got your Letter in due season, and gave it many welcomes; I have been a little busier (perhaps); and always put off answering, having really nothing articulate to say. I never was more <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>, since I came to London; keeping far away from all the idle babbles, and rumours of Turk war and other nonsense, in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed I cannot be said to take the least interest: alas, I have a very heavy packet of accounts to settle within my own mind, and need all my industry twice over to get tolerably thro&#x2019; these, if I ever do get! Last night an Anonymous Lady writes to me from Paris, at great length and with much earnestness, That I must immediately get <hi rend="italic">converted</hi> to her way of religion, or that I shall <hi rend="italic">infallibly</hi> be &#x26;c &#x26;c. Nine tenths of the Letters I receive are of an <pb id="pg-29-50" n="29:50"/>equally engaging nature to me. The remaining tenth, those that do need answer, I answer with uncommon brevity,&#x2014;growing ever briefer! One becomes like a kind of lighted lantern, against which all the dark owlets in Creation are liable to come flapping;&#x2014;can&#x2019;t be helped.</p>
<p>Our weather is much improved; and we with it: Jane herself is now on foot again. We are to have a final <hi rend="italic">Papering</hi> of that famed upper room (Painting is done long since, and well): I think of shifting up thither, as the sun strengthens: it is really a fine roomy quiet place, <hi rend="italic">light</hi> as day (from the <hi rend="italic">top</hi>); and indeed the whole house is now a very good one for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>.&#x2014; Jack does not write much lately;&#x2014;does not fasten upon <hi rend="italic">Dienbie</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540306-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-03-06">6 March</date></ref>.</note> (I fear); we heard by a side channel that they calculate on being up <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in April coming.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister: here has &#x201C;Darwin&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erasmus A.

<p>I send you today a Facsimile of one Frederick&#x2019;s Letters, which, if you have not seen it before, will well entertain you for a moment. It differs considerably in spirit and style from the Palmerston-Napier eloquence that was heard in the Reform Club lately!&#x2014; By the bye, I hear that much complained of everywhere; and indeed it seems to my own private thought a rather sorry <pb id="pg-29-51" n="29:51"/>aspect of our affairs. Somebody told me Napier was seen, at the finish of the night, down in the Reform-Club Kitchen, eagerly swallowing a pot of small-beer; and heard saying, as he drank, to the scullions and others, &#x201C;In the course of a month, I shall either be in Heaven or in Hell or in St Petersburg!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vice Admiral Sir Charles Napier (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19747"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:10&#x2013;11</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>), commander of the Baltic fleet, which left <date when="1854-03-11">11 March</date>.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It seems a long time since I heard anything definite about your proceedings; <pb id="pg-29-52" n="29:52"/>I surely wrote last too? Tho&#x2019; that indeed is a small matter.&#x2014; I conclude you have not yet been able to fix on any house, or else you would have told me of it; and am sorry to think of the confusing uncertainty you must still be in on that account. Jean&#x2019;s glimpse of <hi rend="italic">Dienby</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denbie House.</note> which was the last view I had of the matter, seemed rather promising; but I suppose that came to nothing practicable either. The locality is very central for all the friends and kindred we now have in Scotland: a wholesome, quiet place too, and cheerful enough so far as scenery goes;&#x2014;the House I do not know, nor anything more of it than the <hi rend="italic">Gate</hi> on the Dumfries and Annan road, which is very present to my memory.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote, <date when="1854-04-12">12 Apr.</date>; &#x201C;The porter lodge on the Dumfries-Annan road belongs to Whitecroft &#x26; not to Denbie.&#x201C;</note> On the whole I very heartily wish you had got some suitable settlement; for the period of doubt, speculation and inquiry is far from agreable, and very destructive to whatever industry one may be carrying on. A speedy settlement is to be wished; but still more, of course, a right and wise one: for the house one occupies, especially the neighbourhood one is in, is a very influential item in one&#x2019;s affair. I can only <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> right heartily (if that were of any effect), your choice may at last be fortunate and judicious!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane incidentally heard from Mrs Fraser,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Fraser, 14 Montpelier Sq., Brompton, whose house might be available; see <sic>JWC to JAC</sic><ref target="volume-29/lt-18540509-JWC-JAC-01"><corr>JWC to JAC</corr>, [<date when="1854-05-09">9 May</date>]</ref>. Probably Mrs. William Fraser.</note> a while ago, that you meant to be up in Town, both of you, in the course of April. That also may be extremely wise, especially if you have yet found no house. Here clearly are houses in abundance, and ever more houses, such a building, and piling of rotten bricks under roman-cement as never was seen before! But it is a <hi rend="italic">frightful</hi> place to take up one&#x2019;s abode in, too; this I very sincerely, and often with a sorrow which is not now impatient, being irremediable now, feel to be the case. But indeed, to me, all localities and habitations are pretty sure to be &#x201C;frightful&#x201C; more or less, and the &#x201C;suitable&#x201C; one, I believe, has not been discovered yet!&#x2014; But what I had to say about April is, that we are engaged for Easter to be out at Addiscombe,&#x2014;I think from the <date when="1854-04-18">18</date><hi rend="italic">th</hi> to the <date when="1854-04-28">28</date><hi rend="italic">th;</hi> note these days, I pray you, and let us not lose so much of neighbourship, which falls to us so seldom. For the rest, write me a word some day soon.</p>
<p>We are quiet here, almost as if in Siberia, much quieter than Moffat, I dare say;&#x2014;struggling to be a little busy, and keeping out of the way of all people. Turk war, Palmerston eloquence, Reform Bill <hi rend="italic">on</hi> and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> off: all this is leather &#x26; prunella<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pope, <hi rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi>, Epistle 4:204.</note> to us. Weather grey again and shockingly cold, which is good for neither of us.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother, I dare not begin another slip.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You are very mindful of me, and very kind; and I am again much obliged to you for a Book that has arrived the other day: <hi rend="italic">Graffigny</hi> in 2 volumes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fran&#x26;ccedil;oise d&#x2019;Issembourg de Graffigny (or Grafigny), <hi rend="italic">Vie priv&#xE9;e de Voltaire et de Mme Du Ch&#xe2;telet, pendant un s&#xE9;jour de six mois &#xE0; Cirey; suivie de cinquante lettres in&#xE9;dites, en vers et en prose, de Voltaire</hi>, 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>); cited in <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 14:190. TC&#x2019;s copy: HCC.</note> handed in <foreign><hi rend="italic">gratis</hi></foreign> by your Bookseller&#x2019;s punctuality.</p>
<p>The other Book on <hi rend="italic">Madame du Ch&#xe2;telet</hi>, which came a good while ago, with the Paper on it by a Lady in the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi>,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540105-TC-EM-01">TC to EM, <date when="1854-01-05">5 Jan.</date></ref></note> ought to have been acknowledged at the time when it was received,&#x2014;&#x201C;ought,&#x201C; alas! and my conscience has been reproaching me about it* (*no; I did write about <hi rend="italic">it;</hi> it was your Note <pb id="pg-29-54" n="29:54"/>I never answered!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parenthetical sentence written above the line.</note> ever since; however, I hoped you would understand that silence itself signified &#x201C;Yes&#x201C; in that case. I read the Book and the <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> with true interest; and got, especially out of the former, a perceptible increase of light upon <hi rend="italic">Madame</hi>, and her relations to Voltaire and to the world; for which I am very thankful. The Lady&#x2019;s Paper was also very good; tho&#x2019; done somewhat <foreign><hi rend="italic">en beau</hi></foreign> [prettily but superficially], and less to be depended on, for various reasons.&#x2014; Note, if you at any time bethink you of any other Paper in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des 2 Mondes</hi>, which you think may be useful to me, be satisfied with <hi rend="italic">indicating</hi> it to me in the first place; I can, at least if it is within 10 or 12 years, at once procure any back N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi>.</p>
<p>This Book of <hi rend="italic">Graffigny</hi> is far the best I have yet seen on that subject; and really is of high interest for the Biography of Voltaire, and his beautiful <hi rend="italic">Tigress:</hi>&#x2014;I cannot say I get more in love with the Du Ch&#xe2;telet, the more I know of her; and indeed I sympathize very much with Frederic the Great, who, I noticed long since, had from the very first decided (I suppose on <hi rend="italic">Keyserling</hi> &#x201C;Cesarion&#x2019;s&#x201C; report)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Friedrich has translated the name <hi rend="italic">Keyserling</hi> (diminutive of <hi rend="italic">Kaiser</hi>) into &#x2018;Caesarion&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:199). Col. Keyserling, Frederick&#x2019;s friend and, while crown prince, &#x201C;official companion&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:168).</note> that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> never would have any meeting with that &#x201C;divine Emelie,&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louise Colet cites a letter in which Frederick so calls her, in French (<hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> n.s. 11 [<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>]:1032). TC includes Voltaire&#x2019;s reply in which he also calls her divine (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:198).</note> he, for one! Thro&#x2019; Graffigny, an excellent rational and practical woman, one obtains a direct glimpse into Cirey and its strange inmates: I design to read her Book a second time with still more attention; it is rare that such a reporter turns up; and especially in so curious a scene.</p>
<p>If you discover anything about Voltaire&#x2019;s genealogy kindred, or family connexions, I shall be very eager to know it: certainly it is astonishing that no Biographer has thought of mentioning to us what Brothers and Sisters he had, and what became of them in the world.&#x2014; Neither, I fear, is there the least information to be had about his <hi rend="italic">Lawsuit</hi> with the Jew at Berlin (in <date when="1751-00-00">1751</date> or <date when="1752-00-00">&#x2019;2</date>)?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751-00-00">51</date>; for Voltaire&#x2019;s lawsuit with Abraham Hirsch (or Hirschel, see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430719-TC-JWC-01"><sic>16:293</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-07-19">19 July 1843</date></corr></ref>), see TC&#x2019;s chapter, &#x201C;M. de Voltaire has a painful Jew-lawsuit,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:277&#x2013;300.</note> In the <hi rend="italic">Suppl&#xE9;ment</hi> to Frederic&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Posthumes</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >6 vols.

<p><hi rend="italic">Thi&#xE9;bault&#x2019;s</hi> Book is very common in this Country; and I have known it for a long time.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dieudonn&#xE9; Thi&#xE9;bault, <hi rend="italic">Mes souvenirs de vingt ans de s&#xE9;jour &#xE0; Berlin; ou, Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric le Grand, sa famille, sa cour, son gouvernement, son acad&#xE9;mie</hi>, 5 vols.

In fact there never was a duller set of mortals than those who have written about Frederic;&#x2014;no <hi rend="italic">man of genius</hi>, that I can see, ever yet opened his mouth upon him, except Mirabeau alone, and he saw him only for half an hour.&#x2014; &#x2014; I begin to get quite overwhelmed with the masses of futile nonsense accumulating round me; and in general, despair of ever myself writing anything upon the subject.</p>
<p>Our soldiers are marching off, day after day, in high ardour, to have a dash, along with yours, at the &#x201C;rugged Russian Bear&#x201C;: I myself have no enthusiasm in that matter; and wish all our friends were well home again, and <hi rend="italic">Turkdom</hi> (not a beautiful object, that) wheresoever it shall please the fates!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >France and Britain had declared war on Russia, <date when="1854-03-28">28 March</date>. TC wrote in his Journal about this time: &#x201C;Russian war, soldiers marching off &#x26;c &#x26;c, never such an enthusiasm seen among the population. Cold I, as a very stone, to all that: seems to me, privately, I have hardly seen a madder business. &#x2026; A lazy, ugly, sensual, dark fanatic that Turk, whom we have now had for 400 years. I, for my own private part, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not buy the continuance of <hi rend="italic">him</hi> there, at the rate of 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a century. Let him go whenever he can stay no longer, with all <hi rend="italic">my</hi> heart. It will be a beautifuller, not an uglier, that will come in his place; uglier I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not know where to look for, under the sky at present.&#x2014; Then as to Russian increase of strength &#x26;c, really, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wait till Russia meddled with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, before I drew <hi rend="italic">sword</hi> to stop his increase of strength.&#x2014; It is the idle population of Editors &#x26;c that have done all this in England: one perceives clearly that Ministers go forward ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> their will; indeed I have seen no rational man who is not privately very much inclined to be of my own opinion; all fools, and loose-spoken inexperienced persons, being of the other. It is very disgraceful for any &#x201C;ministry&#x201C; (or Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi>); but such is the fate and course of all Ministries here at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi>,&#x2014; inevitably. &#x2026; Poor souls&#x2014;, what could the ministry <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, after all? To attend to their home affairs, fortify their coasts, encourage their own fisheries (for new seamen), regulate their own population into (or towards) proper manliness of spirit and position, and capability of self-defence, and so bid defiance to all the earth, as England peculiarly might: to do this, or any portion of this, is far from <hi rend="italic">them;</hi> therefore they must do the other thing.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I have seen one Letter from you since that sad one I wrote from Scotsbrig in winter: I have often meant to write to you again in these weeks; for it seems to be really a shame that I, whose trade is <hi rend="italic">writing</hi>, should <pb id="pg-29-56" n="29:56"/>ever fall into such a state of silence towards you, and have so many feelings in my mind to which I give no utterance to a Brother who is the object of them. Alas, I fall always short nevertheless; for indeed I am quite torn to pieces in this wild roaring whirlpool of a place:&#x2014;and so even at this moment I write at a galloping pace, as <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than not writing at all; and must beg you to interpret kindly my obstructions, dispiritments, confusions; and <hi rend="italic">never</hi>, in your saddest humour, to interpret my silence into neglect or forgetfulness.&#x2014; Oh no, that will never be the meaning of it, nor can, while I continue in this world.&#x2014; Do you know there is an old reaping-hook you got me at Carlisle almost twenty years ago, which has hung in the garden ever since; and the rusty ghost of which still hangs there, awakening strange remembrances in me! Moreover, I still have somewhere the little Note which did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> find you at Liverpool when you were embarking, but was sent back to me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430623-TC-AC-01"><sic>16:213&#x2013;14</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1843-06-23">23 June 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> I would have sent it this day, after so long an interval of waiting; and will yet send it; but at present it is not to be found in the drawer where I thought it lay, and there is not a moment to spend in searching.</p>
<p>The loss of our dear Mother has fallen heavy on me, as on us all; heavier almost on myself than I could have fully anticipated, considering how old I had grown, and how weak and heavy-laden the last year or two had been to her who is now gone. Oh, God teach us <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> thoughts on that subject; for it is great and deep to me, and rises as a most sad background in my mind ever since. The poor Mother, I saw her that day I got to Scotsbrig after a night&#x2019;s railwaying: she had still all her wits and clearness of sense, distinct to a singular degree, but utterly worn down (as it were) with weakness and weariness: I remember her eyes, as she lay in bed, after I had done speaking with her, and her faint but true smile of gladness at sight of me had passed away again: the winter-light shone in, at that <hi rend="italic">end</hi> window you remember; the poor Mother was as if both awake and asleep; her eyes always opening, and then again closing, as if pressed down by leaden weight: nev<supplied>[er]</supplied> can I forget that sight;&#x2014;she that had always loved us all, as none other ever will or can, was now about to take her leave of us; and all scenes of Time with her were soon to be transfigured and become Eternal. Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; But I will not speak another word on all this: why should I incite you also to sad thoughts? Tho&#x2019; there is blessedness in such sorrow withal; and we may say truly, God be ever thanked that He gave us such a Mother; and continued her with us till she <hi rend="italic">could</hi> no longer stay!</p>
<p>I get rather fewer Letters of late out of Annandale; but suppose there is no point of news that escapes me either. They are all in their usual health, and course of work; doing well enough, all of them. Martha Park of Relief<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s sister; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540306-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-03-06">6 March</date></ref>.</note> <pb id="pg-29-57" n="29:57"/>(whom I suppose you knew) has had a sad death (by <hi rend="italic">Cancer</hi>) since I was in that Country; which has no doubt saddened them at Scotsbrig, tho&#x2019; otherwise all seems to be going well enough there. Farming, I understand, is a good trade for the last year or two,&#x2014;seems to go mainly upon <hi rend="italic">sheep</hi> now,&#x2014;the railways having opened all the large Towns with their markets; and Commerce having been very brisk till lately. Poor Grahame at Burnswark is himself grown very dull and old; and I fear his Sister<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William and Elizabeth Graham.</note> is very poorly, in some kind of lethargic or half paralytic condition; which of course grieves and weighs on him extremely: but I have got no special word from John about him for some time.&#x2014; John&#x2019;s last tidings to me were about the <hi rend="italic">sale</hi> of those poor Houses at Ecclefechan: how they had announced a <hi rend="italic">Roup;</hi> and positively <hi rend="italic">nobody</hi> came, so that they had to postpone it till a new season.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Built by their father and owned by their mother. Janet and Robert Hanning and Alick had written a formal note to James Carlyle consenting to the sale, <date when="1854-02-10">10 Feb.</date> (MS: Acc. 9086); the roup of <date when="1854-03-24">24 March</date> was advertised as of &#x201C;that large property in Ecclefechan, sometime belonging to the deceased James Carlyle, farmer in Scotsbridge&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1854-03-14">14 March</date>). James eventually bought them; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550322-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1855-03-22">22 March 1855</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Jack, poor fellow, is very busy searching for a House just now. He can find nothing quite suitable in Moffat; is trying up and down Dumfriesshire, Deanbie, &#x26;c &#x26;c, but has not yet decided: I sometimes rather guess he will land in London at the tail of the account. His Wife, of whom you have now often heard, is a very reasonable-looking person, of lady habits, and still pleasing enough appearance,&#x2014;turned of forty, and in good health, with good store of money (it appears),&#x2014;and Jack &#x26; she seem to do very well together. I saw her for some two weeks very often in winter gone a year, and was well contented with all I saw; but we did not get to any intimacy, and I have never seen her again.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I am sorry and ashamed to break off here: I had so many things to say, and am but just getting my wallet open! I promise to write again <hi rend="italic">before</hi> long. You must remember me to Jenny, to the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Jenny &#x26; Household at Hamilton; to your own good Tom,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jenny, his wife, their son Tom, and Janet Hanning.</note> whom I fancy to be an effectual useful fellow by this time. <closer><salute>We rejoice to hear that your farming affairs go rather better; above all that you have health, and a heart whole yet: God bless you dear Brother, dear to me for above half a century now!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>It was a morning not like any other which lay round it, a morning to be marked with white,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rev. 2:17.</note> that one, about a week ago, when your Letter came to me; a word from you yet again, after so long a silence! On the whole, I perceive you will not utterly give up answering me, but will rouse yourself now and then to a word of human brotherhood on my behalf, so long as we both continue in this Planet. And I declare, the Heavens will reward you; and as to me, I will be thankful for what I get, and submissive to delays and to all things: all things are good compared with flat <hi rend="italic">want</hi> in that respect. It remains true, and will remain, what I have often told you, that properly there is no voice in this world which is completely human to me, which fully understands all I say, and with clear sympathy and sense answers to me, but your voice only. That is a curious fact, and not quite a joyful one to me. The solitude, the silence of my poor soul, in the centre of this roaring whirlpool called Universe, is great always, and sometime strange and almost awful. I have two million talking bipeds without feathers,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Plato, <hi rend="italic">The Statesman</hi>.</note> close at my elbow, too; and of these it is often hard for me to say whether the so-called &#x201C;wise&#x201C; or the almost professedly foolish are the more inexpressibly unproductive to me. &#x201C;Silence, Silence!&#x201C; I often say to myself: &#x201C;Be silent, thou poor fool; and prepare for that Divine Silence which is now not far!&#x201C;&#x2014; On the whole, write to me whenever you can; and be not weary of welldoing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Thess. 3:13. Emerson who had previously written, <date when="1853-08-10">10 Aug. 1853</date>, wrote, <date when="1854-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x201C;Ah my brave giant, you can never understand the silence &#x26; forbearances of such as are not giants. To those to whom we owe affection, let us be dumb until we are strong, though we should ever be strong. I hate mumped &#x26; measled lovers. I hate cramp in all men,&#x2014;most in myself.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>I have had sad things to do and see since I wrote to you: the loss of my dear and good old <pb id="pg-29-59" n="29:59"/>Mother, which could not be spared me forever, has come more like a kind of total bankruptcy upon me than might have been expected, considering her age and mine. On those last two days, that last Christmas sunday! She was a true pious brave and noble mother to me; and it is now all over; and the Past has all become pale and sad and sacred;&#x2014;and the all-devouring potency of Death, what we call Death, has never looked so strange, cruel and unspeakable to me. Nay not <hi rend="italic">cruel</hi> altogether, let me say; huge, profound, <hi rend="italic">unspeakable</hi>, that is the word.&#x2014; You too have lost your good old Mother, who staid with you like mine, clear to the last:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After expressing sympathy for the death of TC&#x2019;s mother, Emerson wrote: &#x201C;My mother died in my house in <date when="1853-11-00">November</date>, who had lived with me all my life, &#x26; kept her heart &#x26; mind clear, &#x26; her own until the end. It is very necessary that we should have mothers,&#x2014;we that read &#x26; write, to keep us from becoming paper. I had found that age did not make that she should die without causing me pain. In my journeying lately, when I think of home, the heart is taken out.&#x201C; Ruth Emerson, b.

Ralph Waldo was the fourth of eight children, three of whom were living.</note> alas, alas, it is the oldest Law of Nature; and it comes on every one of us with a strange originality, as if it had never happened before.&#x2014; Forward, however; and no more lamenting; no more than cannot be helped. &#x201C;Paradise is under the shadow of our swords,&#x201C; said the Emir: &#x201C;Forward!&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Attributed to Muhammad.

Rendell, Newton, Mass., ca. <date when="1980-00-00">1980</date>).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I make no way in my Prussian History; I bore and dig toilsomely thro&#x2019; the unutterablest mass of dead rubbish, which is not even English, which is German and inhuman; and hardly from ten tons of learned inanity is there to be riddled one old rusty nail. For I have been back as far as Pytheas<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pytheas (<date>4th cent. <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Greek navigator and geographer of Marseilles, explored the European Atlantic coast; see <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:55, 64.</note> (who first of speaking creatures) beheld the Teutonic Countries; and have questioned all manner of extinct German shadows,&#x2014;who answer nothing but mumblings. And on the whole Fritz himself is not sufficiently divine to me, far from it; and I am getting old, and heavy of heart;&#x2014;and in short, it oftenest seems to me I shall never write any word about that matter; and have again fairly got into the element of the <hi rend="small-caps">Impossible</hi>. Very well: could I help it? I can at least be honestly silent; and &#x201C;bear my indigence with dignity,&#x201C; as you once said.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Emerson&#x2019;s lecture, &#x201C;The Transcendentalist&#x201C;: &#x201C;though we had few virtues or consolations, we bore with our indigence, nor once strove to repair it with hypocrisy or false heat of any kind&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Dial</hi> <date when="1843-01-03">3 [Jan. 1843</date>; reprint: New York, <date when="1961-00-00">1961</date>]: 310).</note> The insuperable difficulty of <hi rend="italic">Frederic</hi> is, that he, the genuine little Ray of Veritable and Eternal that was in him, lay imbedded in the putrid Eighteenth Century, such an ocean of sordid nothingnesses, shams, and scandalous hypocrisies, as never weltered in the world before;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:8&#x2013;10.</note> and that in everything I can find yet written or recorded of him, he still, to all intents and purposes, most tragically <hi rend="italic">lies</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">There</hi>;&#x2014;and ought not to lie there, if any use is ever to be had of him, or at least of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> about him; for as to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, he with his work is safe enough to us, far elsewhere.&#x2014; Pity me, pity me; I know not on what hand to turn; and have such a Chaos filling all my Earth and Heaven as was seldom seen in British or Foreign Literature! Add to which, the Sacred Entity, Literature itself is not growing more venerable to me, but less and ever less: good Heavens, I feel often as if there were no madder set of <pb id="pg-29-60" n="29:60"/>bladders tumbling on the billows of the general Bedlam at this moment than even the Literary ones,&#x2014;dear at twopence a gross, I should say, unless one could <hi rend="italic">annihilate</hi> them by purchase on those easy terms! But do not tell this in Gath;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Sam. 1:20.</note> let it be a sad family-secret.</p>
<p>I smile, with a kind of grave joy, over your American speculations, and wild dashing portraitures of things as they are with you; and recognise well, under your light caricature, the outlines of a right true picture, which has often made me sad and grim in late years. Yes, I consider that the &#x201C;Battle of Freedom and Slavery&#x201C; is very far from ended; and that the fate of poor &#x201C;Freedom&#x201C; in the quarrel is very questionable indeed!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote, <date when="1854-03-11">11 March</date>: &#x201C;America is growing furiously, town &#x26; state, new Kansas new Nebraska looming up in these days, vicious politicians seething a wretched destiny for them already in Washington [by debating in Congress whether slavery would be allowed in the two territories]. the politicians shall be sodden, the states escape, please God! The fight of slave &#x26; freeman drawing nearer, the question is properly, whether slavery or whether freedom shall be abolished. Come &#x26; see. Wealth, which is always interesting, for from wealth power refuses to be divorced, is on a new scale. Californian quartz mountains dumped down in New York to be repiled architecturally along shore from Canada to Cuba, &#x26; thence west to California again. John Bull interests you at home, &#x26; is all your subject. Come and see the Jonathanization of John.&#x201C;</note> Alas, there is but one <hi rend="italic">Slavery</hi>, as I wrote somewhere;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;The slavery of the strong to the weak; of the great and noble-minded to the small and the mean! The slavery of Wisdom to Folly,&#x201C; imposed by the ballot box and universal suffrage (not in the original &#x201C;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 40 (<date when="1849-12-00">Dec. 1849</date>): 670&#x2013;79, but in the revised &#x201C;The Nigger Question&#x201C; [<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>], <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:360).</note> and that, I think, is mounting towards a height, which may bring strokes to bear upon it again!

That is my sad case really, or my abstruse humour;&#x2014;which however should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be indulged in. I shove aside my dreary Books, Maps and other chaotic apparatus today in time; and will insist on writing you a word, if only to tell you that it <hi rend="italic">so</hi> stands with me.</p>
<p>My health, as usual, has a great deal to do with all that: I have indeed nothing in particular to complain of,&#x2014;only the perpetual misery which has kept me company for 35 years or so, all days and all nights, give a considerable <hi rend="italic">bias</hi> naturally to rolling of the bowls with me, and is calculated to surprise people that are otherwise situated now and then. I need not, at this late stage of the journey, begin kicking at my burden; no, let me rather get along in a silent sliding pace, if I can; in that way, the back is least apt to be hurt by what you have to carry!&#x2014; I must say, too, there is not the least <hi rend="italic">waygate</hi> hitherto with my unfortunate task of work: I have had some rough confused tasks; but I do not think there ever in my life fell any task to me which was so obstinately <hi rend="italic">inexecutable</hi> as this same. Little <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> executing, too, I often say to myself;&#x2014;alas, I am getting old, and not so ready with my enthusiasms as I once was, nor so ready to get fairly <hi rend="italic">on fire</hi> about a task! That, I perceive, will be the condition of getting thro&#x2019; this present task, if it is ever to be got thro&#x2019;;&#x2014;but I often say, it never will; and then add sometimes, &#x201C;Why <pb id="pg-29-62" n="29:62"/>should it? Be humble, be quiet; and admit then, I cannot do it, I am myself <hi rend="italic">done!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; But I hope better things, tho&#x2019; I thus speak!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390505-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>11:94</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1839-05-05">5 May 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>

Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I long to hear how Jack settles about Deanbie; I did write; but am again in his debt, and have no right to expect news till I make a fresh demand. My idea always rather is, they will not fix on anything in your region: I hope they will <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> somewhere; roving about the world is surely the worst way of settling such uncertainty</p>
<p>We have beautiful weather here; at times almost uncomfortably <hi rend="italic">hot</hi>, and always very dry, too dry; today the wind has risen, and changed also to eastward, with some supply of clouds, which we hope may end in rain. When the weather <hi rend="italic">fairly</hi> warms too much, I fly aloft into my new watchtower, which is now quite habitable, and even getting books &#x26;c into it.&#x2014; All manner of Scotch people have been up here, about their &#x201C;Education Bill&#x201C;;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The education (Scotland) bill was introduced by the lord advocate, James <sic>Moncrieff</sic><corr>Moncreiff</corr> (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18947"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), <date when="1854-03-03">3 March</date>, to provide a centralized board of education in Edinburgh to superintend Scottish education.

The proposition for its rejection of the Bill was carried by the votes of English Members &#x2026; . It was made to a great extent a party question, and the ground &#x2026; was this &#x2026; alone&#x2014;that &#x2026; they did not continue the exclusive superintendence of the Established Church in Scotland, and the exclusive privilege of members of that denomination to teach in schools.&#x201C;</note> we saw some, avoided many.&#x2014; Bad luck to it, here is a fellow knocking; will come up (I have no doubt) for it is half past 3! <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Sister;&#x2014;I hope to write again soon, and be in better trim somewhat.

He had been depressed and in poor health for four years. In its obituary, the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1854-04-08">8 April</date>, said that Wilson, &#x201C;with all his genius, was personally one of the most strangely eccentric of the many eccentric characters existing in his day in the metropolis of the north.&#x201C; TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-04-29">29 April</date>: &#x201C;Wilson had much nobleness of heart, and many traits of noble genius: but the central <hi rend="italic">tie-beam</hi> seemed always wanting. Very long ago, I perceived in him the most irreconcilable contradictions: Toryism with <hi rend="italic">sansculottism</hi>, methodism (of a sort) with total incredulity;&#x2014;a noble loyal and religious nature not <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> enough to vanquish the perverse element it is born into.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There is not, I grieve to report, any trace of the <hi rend="italic">October N</hi>o (or indeed of any N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> here: Jane sent <hi rend="italic">one</hi> away to the Reichenbachs<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oskar and Hedwig von Reichenbach.</note> at Philadelphia, for the sake of an Article of Saffi&#x2019;s that was in it;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Aurelio Saffi&#x2019;s unsigned article was &#x201C;Religion in Italy,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> n.s. <date when="1853-10-00">4 (Oct. 1853)</date>: 311&#x2013;41.</note> this we conclude must be the missing N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and it is irrecoverable from our stock. I suppose the L.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >London.</note> Library could send it? If you still specially want it, tell me, and I will endeavour to get hold of it somewhere. I well enough remember Froude&#x2019;s Article on <hi rend="italic">Job;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Anthony Froude&#x2019;s unsigned article was &#x201C;The Book of Job,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> n.s. <date when="1853-10-00">4 (Oct. 1853)</date>: 417&#x2013;50, in which he implicitly questions original sin, the Thirty-nine Articles, and the immutability of theological systems. John Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1854-04-12">12 April</date>: &#x201C;I beg you will take no farther trouble in regard to that <date when="1853-10-00">Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> number of the Westminster Review. It seems unlikely, after what you say, that Froude would throw any light on the Book of Job for us.&#x201C;</note> it was sufficiently <hi rend="italic">heterodox</hi> (as all his are) in an indirect way; <pb id="pg-29-64" n="29:64"/>and had traces of ingenuity and serious reflexion; but did not seem to me to have hit the secret of <hi rend="italic">Job</hi>, or to bring the Book into any clear condition, being indeed almost professedly built on <hi rend="italic">second hand</hi> learning if on any.</p>

<p>We long to hear what you have decided on as to Houses: Deanbie must be settled now? Is there anything else thereabouts in your eye?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle replied, <date when="1854-04-12">12 April</date>, that Denbie House could only be rented from year to year: &#x201C;we should have to go to it without any feeling of being settled &#x2026; .

<salute>Dear Spring Rice,</salute>
<p>A certain Mr Allingham, lately of Coleraine, whom I have occasionally <pb id="pg-29-65" n="29:65"/>seen for some years past, has just been here; bewailing his sad and very foolish situation: How, about two months ago (under the influence of opium, taken in some bodily disorder, as he now thinks), he gave up his good appointment in the Customhouse Service, and came to London to live by Literature; how he finds the life by Literature, a mere life of misery and impossibility; longs vehemently to be back to his Customhouse again, never to quit it more; and has written to you, imploring your help and counsel in the matter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Allingham wrote to his sister, <date when="1854-06-03">3 June</date>: &#x201C;I still like living in London, and find I could make quite as large an income by writing as I expected &#x2026; . But to do this I must give myself up entirely to desultory and ephemeral writing, truckle to editors and people, and undergo countless anxieties and annoyances, which would not at all suit me; and therefore I think it much better, all things considered, to return to the quiet exile and make the best of that &#x2026; . I believe all my friends here are sorry I am going&#x2014;though some, Carlyle in particular, think it a blessed escape for me out of the profession of literature&#x201C; (H. Allingham and D. Radford, eds., <hi rend="italic">William Allingham. A Diary</hi> [<date when="1907-00-00">1907</date>] 72).</note></p>
<p>What you and your fellow Commissioners may find good, or even may be able to do, in so peculiar a case, I do not presume to conjecture, and will not attempt influencing: but I can certify with considerable freedom that this poor Allingham does really seem to me a young man of superior worth and faculty, a perfectly honest, ingenious and even genial young man; that this sad <hi rend="italic">escapade</hi> into the regions of &#x201C;Literature,&#x201C; which is not likely to be repeated, is perhaps pardonable when all the circumstances are considered;&#x2014;that, on the whole, if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> save such a youth from the consequences of his one error, it will probably be well worth doing, a blessed mercy to him, and to the public perhaps an advantage too (for really there is a good stuff in this young man, and his rustic delusions have been terribly shaken out of him in these two last months): in fine, that it would give a certain friend of yours real pleasure <hi rend="italic">if</hi> such did prove the fact and issue arrived at; on this latter point there is no manner of doubt! And so I will leave it with you; having indeed nothing more that is definitely clear to me to say on the subject; and trusting well that the Native Humanities will not be voiceless in you, however vocal other stricter considerations may be, in settling this piece of business.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have not gone to Addiscombe, and are not going at present: owing to bad cold of Lady A.&#x2019;s (from which she is recovering out there in solitude, and getting ready for a run to Paris), the whole business has been given up; and I stay here over my confused Papers, which is evidently the thriftier method for me, and everyway the most agreeable as my humour runs. You may write, therefore, to the Common Address, when there is anything for us in your thoughts. And this is really the substance of all I had to say, in my present hurry, amid the bleak spring winds, and futile industries that occupy me at present.</p>
<p>Libri has sent another Note (indisposed, or he would not have delayed <hi rend="italic">bringing</hi> the Book, which he now sends):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Count Guillaume B. I. T. Libri-Carucci (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>), Italian mathematician, aristocrat, book collector; inspector gen. of libraries under Louis Philippe; friend of Guizot, on whose behalf he wrote from 3 Chepstow Villas, Bayswater, <date when="1854-03-30">30 March</date>, to offer TC &#x201C;a copy of his <hi rend="italic">Life of Cromwell</hi>, which he sent me from Paris for that purpose.&#x201C; TC sent the letter to John Carlyle, who replied, <date when="1854-04-12">12 April</date>, that the letter was &#x201C;probably written by the same Libri who was accused of taking books from various libraries in France some years ago, &#x26; who had been a prot&#xE9;g&#xE9; of Guizot&#x2019;s before the revolution of <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>.&#x201C; He had been accused of stealing valuable MSS and books from French libraries.</note> Note I think is burnt; Book (two heavy volumes) goes to Chorley who wants it; I have written some <hi rend="italic">screwed</hi> word of thanks, if possible not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> untrue, to Guizot;&#x2014;and so <hi rend="italic">this</hi> matter again is brushed away from me.</p>
<p>Bosworth threatened the Leader with Law; whereupon they were forced to eat their leek in the way you see!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, <date when="1854-04-08">8 April</date>, gave what purported to be a letter from &#x201C;An Author&#x201C; saying that Thomas Bosworth, publisher of TC&#x2019;s pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi>, had advertised &#x201C;a pamphlet called &#x2018;Shall Turkey Live or Die? By Thomas Carlyle, Esq.,&#x2019; which we incidentally learn at Messrs. Chapman and Hall&#x2019;s (the publishers of the mass of Carlyle&#x2019;s writings) is sought after by numbers at their shop as &#x2018;Carlyle&#x2019;s new work.&#x2019; Deeming the affair at least a questionable one on the part of Mr. Bosworth &#x2026; , we take his shop on our way, and find no less than a dozen copies of &#x2018;Shall Turkey Live or Die?&#x2019; &#x2026; arranged in the centre of the window, as its most important furniture. We step within, and our worst suspicions are confirmed.&#x201C; The two pamphlets were for sale. &#x201C;Slowly groping for threepence thus asked for under undoubtedly false pretences, we first touch the book and then its neighbour, with the remark, &#x2018;Not by the same man, eh?&#x2019; To which after a moment&#x2019;s hesitation, the young gentleman who serves us replies&#x2014;&#x2018;No, it isn&#x2019;t the same, but it&#x2019;s a cousin of his. &#x2026;&#x2019; On being further asked how it sold, he said at the rate of about a hundred copies a day.&#x201C; The <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, <date when="1854-04-15">15 April</date>, reported that it had received a communication from Bosworth demanding the name of the writer: &#x201C;Mr. Bosworth&#x2019;s statement convinces us that he is not justly liable to the imputation of our correspondent. Indeed that letter appeared to us to be unjustified by the facts that it comprised, and we had condemned it as improper for publication. Its appearance in our columns was the result of one of those accidents to which printing-offices are liable; and the statement of that fact is sufficient expression of our regret at the occurrence.&#x201C; Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4696"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), an Edinburgh advocate and Irvingite apostle who lived in Albury, Surrey, was often confused with TC; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320218-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:132</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-02-18">18 Feb. 1832</date></corr></ref> and later vols. &#x201C;Eat their leek;&#x201C; cf.

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>I have been waiting from day to day that I might have something to tell you of the affair you had so well commenced for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably helping Sarah Ann Newton find work as a companion with nursing expertise.</note> But altho&#x2019; she forwarded her address immediately in the same cover you sent, she has had no further news. She desired me to tell you how much she felt your and your wifes interest in her. She continues in the Lying in Hospital altho her time has been up three weeks ago. The officials like her, and are pleased she should stay, and she thinks it best, having nothing else to do for the moment, to take <pb id="pg-29-68" n="29:68"/>all the practice she can get. But it is very trying work for her health&#x2014;up night after night with &#x201C;cases&#x201C;&#x2014;that last sometimes the whole night long&#x2014;and, like me, she cannot sleep during the day Having been <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> the work of the Hospital for 7 weeks at a stretch she need never fear the fatigues of waiting on any single Lady&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> Lady&#x2014;I should say rather&#x2014;to avoid even the sound of <hi rend="italic">impropriety</hi>.</p>
<p>I told all about her to Sir James Clark<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Clark, eminent physician; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:159</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> the last time I dined with him at Bath House. and he told me by all means to send her to him as tho&#x2019; not in that sort of pra<supplied>[c]</supplied>tice<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> himself he might have opportunity to be of use to her. She went accordingly and after a long conversation in which he amused her very much by telling her three times over, she &#x201C;had only to keep <hi rend="italic">steady</hi>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps as in &#x201C;keep the same course,&#x201C; from the nautical &#x201C;steady&#x201C; as opposed to the Scots &#x201C;steady: continuously.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;which English people understand in a quite peculiar sense&#x2014;he gave her his own card with recommendation of her to the world at large written on it!&#x2014;which between ourselves was the act of a kindhearted man rather than of a scrupulous Physician&#x2014;for he had not seen her [two?]<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Number unclear.</note> certificates&#x2014;and had only <hi rend="italic">my</hi> word and her <hi rend="italic">own</hi> for her fitness&#x2014; She <hi rend="italic">has</hi> excellent certificates however&#x2014;from the Hospital D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Matron&#x2014;and may be considered I think fairly afloat&#x2014; If only the Husband dont come back and swamp her. In fact he writes that he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see her and <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come to London for a day or two at least&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">he</hi> cant get in to the Lying in Hospital!&#x2014;and her Mother wont receive him in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house&#x2014;and happily he has no money so if she keep to her good resolutinos to have no concern with him he cannot <hi rend="italic">force</hi> himself on her&#x2014; Yes, I am afraid you are right!&#x2014;he is not so near death and foregiveness as one thought&#x2014;</p>
<p>By the way, Sir James Clark asked me that same night where <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were and what doing. And great was his surprise to find you <hi rend="italic">married</hi>&#x2014;! and to his old patient M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Watts,&#x2014;of whom he seemed to entertain a quite affectionate remembrance. You were to be sure to go and see him both of you when you came to town&#x2014; It &#x201C;would give him real pleasure to see his old patient as your Wife.&#x201C;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>This came yesternight: so soon as you have read it, you may despatch it on its rounds, I suppose to Moffat first of all. Poor Alick seems very sad of humour; as indeed is not unnatural: I cannot but be very sorry for him on account of his peculiar part of the affliction, the loss of his poor little lassie, who has, as it were, just looked into this world, to taste only misery in it, and then returned.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick wrote, <date when="1854-03-27">27 March</date>, that Euphemia had been born &#x201C;on the tuesday immediately following the decease of our ever dearly beloved good old mother &#x2026; and on last tuesday again was taken back to the Alwise disposer of events, having lived in our world twelve weeks&#x2014;four of which she spent mostly in severe and painful suffering.&#x201C;</note> Ah me, ah me!</p>
<p>There came at the same time two Canada Newspapers; one evidently addressed by Jenny (to whom I had sent a Newspaper not long since); the other, after study, proved to be from John our Half-Brother;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle, son of their father&#x2019;s first marriage.</note> I suppose, in gratitude for his weekly copy of <hi rend="italic">the Nation</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dublin weekly, founded and ed. by Charles Gavan Duffy. John wrote, <date when="1855-05-03">3 May 1855</date>, thanking TC for &#x201C;the Nation which I have received from your hand so long.&#x201C;</note> which he has got this long while. Jenny&#x2019;s had the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> duly.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning had written to Isabella Carlyle, calling her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dear Dear</hi> sister,&#x201C; <date when="1854-04-01">1 April</date>, that she had heard from Alick &#x201C;with the sad news&#x201C; about the baby&#x2019;s death; her third da. (born since rejoining her husband in Canada), Catherine Ann, &#x201C;was a great <hi rend="italic">divert</hi> she is a great <hi rend="italic">hit</hi> with their Father. He is receiving Clark at the Railway depot &#x2026; . I will never forget your kindness to me when I was in great want of some one to give me comfort but now thank goodness I have a kind Husband and a very comfortable home&#x201C; (MS: Acc. 9086).</note> Nothing farther to be noted was in either of the Papers.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-70" n="29:70"/>I wrote a word to the Dr the other day; principally to signify that our Addiscombe visit was not to take effect, sickness (not of a grave character) on the part of the Hosts having caused it to be put off. It now appears that we are, after all, to go out for at least one day, and attend them in their solitude, about the end of this week. As the place is only ten miles off, and the weather as <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> as a bone, this will not be attended with difficulty. I confess, for the rest, I was much better pleased to be left alone, in my present humour and confused situation. I cannot get daylight thro&#x2019; my work at all; and never was engaged with such a crooked job of work since I first took tools up. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This morning I read in <hi rend="italic">Aird</hi> that Mrs Bell of Craigenputtoch has got twin daughters:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wife of Thomas Bell. Thomas Aird was ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi>.</note> poor little souls! I hope she herself <hi rend="italic">is</hi> more out of danger than when I last heard account of her. Tell me a little about Aird; he seems getting very <hi rend="italic">rusty</hi> in his Newspaper labours: the death of Wilson at Edinburgh must have been a heavy stroke to him, tho&#x2019; it had been long expected as inevitable. Wilson was by far the weightiest literary figure left in Scotland, or indeed in Britain; and might have been, in fact, a great man, could he have taken care of himself. But he could not; there was from the first a loose joint about the very centre of his existence,&#x2014;a want, namely, of distinct <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> of mind;&#x2014;so all his fine great gifts went tumbling helter-skelter into huge uncertainty, into inextricable confusion: and on the whole he had to call in the aid of <hi rend="italic">whisky-punch</hi> to a large extent, for many years; and has come to nothing more than we see. Poor fellow, there was something very generous in him, too; very proud and stout: nor is it easy for so <hi rend="italic">big</hi> a waggon to get thro&#x2019; the dirty intricacies and vile parish-roads of this world, at present!&#x2014; I have not <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> my day&#x2019;s work yet; I must not stay clattering here with you, if I am to come to any good issue with it at all! <closer><salute>My kind regards to James and to everyone. Write when you have half an hour.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We came home from Addiscombe on Monday last;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1854-04-24">24 April</date>.</note> and have been very demure here (rather in a bilious condition, one of us) ever since. We had gone out on the Thursday before; nobody there but the Host &#x26; Hostess (to <pb id="pg-29-71" n="29:71"/>whom a certain &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Poodle</hi> Byng,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Frederick Byng.</note> so called, was added for the last 2 days): we had an altogether quiet time; mostly spent in reading;&#x2014;and one <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> day, fit for sitting in the open air, in solitude, was really the pleasantest I have had for long.&#x2014; On Sunday (utterly cold and stormy) we made a pilgrimage to the Crystal Palace which is but some 2 miles off: a monstrous mountain of a glass building on the top of Sydenham Hill<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Great Exhibition of <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date> was held in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park; the building was dismantled, summer <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, and reassembled at Sydenham, 6 mi. S of London Bridge, where the first column was raised, <date when="1852-08-05">5 Aug. 1852</date>, and formally opened in the presence of the queen and Prince Albert, <date when="1854-06-10">10 June 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:13&#x2013;14</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-01-12">12 Jan. 1851</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511010-TC-AC-01"><sic>199</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1851-10-10">10 Oct. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> (very conspicuous from Cheyne Walk here), innumerable &#x201C;objects of art&#x201C; in it, whole acres of Egyptian monsters, and many really good copies of classical and modern sculpture, which will deserve examination one day: the living visitors, not very numerous in so huge an edifice (probably not above 200, sparsely scattered up and down) were almost all <hi rend="italic">Jews;</hi> outside were as many thousands of the Christian persuasion, or rather Christian-Cockney, unable to get in: the whole matter seemed to me the very highest flight of Transcendental Cockneyism yet known among mankind; one saw &#x201C;regardless of Expense&#x201C; written on every fibre of it, and written with the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> Cockney Judgement, yet still with an essentially Cockney one. Regardless of Expense: that was truly the grand miracle of it.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Since our return, I have been utterly stupid and sleepy, owing to dyspeptic reasons. Our weather still fierce from the north &#x26; east, with only occasional brief touches of wet hitherto. I am good for almost nothing, but hope to rally in a day or two.</p>
<p>This morning I had sad news, as you will guess from the inclosed leaf: the death of poor Redwood,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1854-04-21">21 April</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540509-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-05-09">9 May</date></ref>. TC had visited him twice, and Redwood had regularly sent the Carlyles Christmas gifts of game and other provisions.</note> my good Welsh friend, of whose illness I had heard no hint. He wrote to me after my return from Scotsbrig; I rather think, I did not answer; and alas that was the finale of all. He was one of the most veracious beings, I ever knew; and liked me well, for which I was grateful always, tho&#x2019; his society was never entertaining to me. <foreign>Eheu, eheu</foreign>!</p>
<p>The Laird of Deanby<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. H. Carruthers.</note> seems really to be &#x201C;halfmad,&#x201C; as Jean defines him. A House with Plasterers still in it is evidently not of the most covetable sort.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written, <date when="1854-04-12">12 April</date>, that it was &#x201C;still unfinished inside, one of the best rooms being unplastered.&#x201C;</note> You will have ample time to take survey, and form your best conclusion, by the plan now adopted.</p>
<p>I am very sorry indeed to hear of Jamie&#x2019;s loss: &#xa3;50 is far too heavy a sum for <pb id="pg-29-72" n="29:72"/>him if it could be helped!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John wrote about James to TC, <date when="1854-05-15">15 May</date>: &#x201C;This year, he says, has been a good one for him, with the exception of his loss in horse. I gave him &#xa3;50 &#x26; Isabella &#xa3;10, as a wind-up to my long stay at Scotsbrig &#x26; my going to &#x26; from it.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Along with your Note, came one from Jean; to whom I have not yet written in answer. They were all well, as probably you have heard since. We have not seen Neuberg this long time: his letter is fully nicer than his presence, in most cases!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

Your tour to Nottingham,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Neuberg had previously lived and been in business. Neuberg had written to TC from near Nottingham in a letter misdated <date when="1854-04-29">29 April</date>, probably in mistake for <date when="1854-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x201C;I ran away from Willesden last saturday [<date when="1854-04-22">22 April</date>] in a sort of despair and to try, if possible, to shake off a dead weight of indolence and weakness that had vexed me sorely of late. Here, amidst old scenes, I find emotions, if not strength!&#x2014;.&#x201C;</note> and the look into old earnest scenes, will do you good: I too suffer dreadfully by <hi rend="italic">sluggishness</hi> in late times; the fruit partly of increased years, as I compute, which is beyond Doctor&#x2019;s help,&#x2014;but partly also of sleepless German travels and these unutterable household uproars, <hi rend="italic">which</hi> is perhaps abating by degrees.</p>
<p>I had received a Letter from Abeken,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bernhard Rudolf Abeken. Neuberg had written: &#x201C;A letter from D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Abeken I have just received leads me to surmise, that the same courier which brought it, brought also for you Pertz&#x2019;s treatise on <hi rend="italic">Wilhelmina&#x2019;s Memoires</hi> &#x2026; . Abeken was glad to hear that you stick to Frederic; a rumour had reached Berlin that you had given up the enterprize. He laments much that our <foreign><hi rend="italic">grosse Zeit</hi></foreign> [great age] is so filled up with <foreign>Kleine Menschen</foreign> [small persons].&#x201C;</note> and Pertz&#x2019;s Disquisition <foreign><hi rend="italic">in corpore</hi></foreign> [in the flesh]:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georg Heinrich Pertz (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>), historian; chief librarian in Berlin, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>. The paper was <hi rend="italic">&#xdc;ber die Denkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten der Markgr&#xE4;fin von Bayreuth</hi>, read in the Berlin Akademie der Wissenschaften, <date when="1850-04-25">25 April 1850</date>; cited <hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 14:385n.</note> if you write soon to Abeken, pray thank him very kindly for me; I mean to write myself before very long. The <hi rend="italic">Pertz</hi> is not worth very much; it settles what <hi rend="italic">Manuscripts</hi> there are, and indicates that Pertz and the Royal Library have at length got the real original, and parent of them all (purchased at some Hanover Auction, for 45/, lately); it admits the exaggeration and shrieky perversion of the Magravine,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires de Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ricke Sophie Wilhelmine de Prusse, Margrave de Bareith</hi>, 2 vols.

TC describes it in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> as a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">veracious</hi> Book, done with heart &#x2026; . It is full of mistakes, indeed; and exaggerates dreadfully, in its shrill female way; but is above intending to deceive&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:320).</note> without trying anywhere to correct <pb id="pg-29-73" n="29:73"/>them; indicates that there is still a <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of Travels into Italy (hardly worthy of publishing);&#x2014;and, on the whole, leaves one at rest upon the question, &#x201C;Have you not seen <hi rend="italic">Pertz</hi>, then!&#x201C; We have now seen <hi rend="italic">Pertz;</hi> Heaven make us thankful.&#x2014; Abeken&#x2019;s Berlin account of my relation to Friedrich and his History is really not so far out; alas, if it were entirely the truth, I believe it might be better for me! In my life I never got into such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Frischer Haff</hi></foreign> [unused lagoon], not half a fathom deep, of brakish water, anywhere, in endless square miles of superficies, and nothing but sand round one to the world&#x2019;s end. If I ever do make a readable little human Book out of Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, it will be a kind of miracle in Literature. However, I do stick to it, by mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi></foreign> [force of inertia], and as if by a kind of sad enchantment into the realms of sand and brakish <foreign><hi rend="italic">Haffs!</hi></foreign> A new cargo of German Books arrived the other day; I have been to the Museum also, looking after one <hi rend="italic">K&#xF6;hler</hi> (much the sensiblest of all these poor Professors),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann David K&#xF6;hler (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>), historian. In a marginal note in K&#xF6;hler&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Gedenkw&#xfc;rdigkeiten des jetzt lauffenden achtzehnten jahr-hunderts. Ier Theil</hi> (Nuremberg, <date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>) (HCC), TC calls him: &#x201C;By far the best of German &#x2018;historians&#x2019;,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; quite &#x2026; out of sight to the modern reader.&#x201C;</note> but found I had got the wrong reference, and my small object was to be fished (if I could) out of 24 quartos.</p>
<p>We went to Addiscombe the thursday before you left; staid there, no <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> company but ourselves, till Monday; pleasant enough days, on the sunny side of green bushes, with the pure spring country all spread round one, and a <hi rend="italic">Vie du Prince Henri</hi> (unluckily worth nothing)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anon., <hi rend="italic">Vie priv&#xE9;e, politique et militaire du Prince Henri, Fr&#xE8;re de Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric II</hi> (Paris, <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>), which TC describes in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> as &#x201C;a poor, vague, and uninstructive, though authentic little Book&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:274n). Henri (Heinrich Friedrich Ludwig) (<date when="1728-00-00">1728</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), Frederick&#x2019;s youngest brother.</note> in one&#x2019;s hand. On sunday we made a pilgrimage to the &#x201C;Crystal Palace&#x201C;: a wonderful place, with &#x201C;regardless of expense,&#x201C; and some very little <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, written conspicuously on every feature of it;&#x2014;announcing in fact that the age of miracles is not past; that here is a new age of miracles, tho&#x2019; alas only a Cockney one, regardless of expense! However, there will be really many good copies of remarkable objects; classical and other excellent sculptures,&#x2014;whole acres of Egyptian nightmares are already in order,&#x2014;not to speak of Florentine carvings, Tombs of Knights Templars<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Religious and military order, founded in <date>12th cent.</date>, for service in the Holy Land.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c: in short, on some private day (such as there are to be) I shall wish to go back, and examine several things. That is the way to manage with Museums: walk direct towards some object specifically preappointed, shutting your eyes to all the rest; otherwise &#x201C;the rest,&#x201C; if you have any sense and seriousness of mind, will tend continually to drive you mad. As we experienced in the <foreign>Kunstkammer</foreign> [art gallery], of famous memory, that day;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably in Dresden, <date when="1852-09-00">Sept. 1852</date>.</note>&#x2014; <pb id="pg-29-74" n="29:74"/>which in fact is but the acme of Museums; or chaotic <hi rend="italic">omnigatherums</hi><note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coinage for &#x201C;gatherings of everything.&#x201C;</note> offered to a human soul really seeking <hi rend="italic">nourishment</hi> for itself.&#x2014; The Country all round Sydenham is getting torn up into breadbox architecture; and indeed everywhere the bricklayer is thrice busy (Croydon itself, I think, will be a bit of London before long); as if all the vulturous creatures in Creation had said to each other, &#x201C;Come let us fly to the biggest Dead Horse that ever was; over in London yonder there is offal without end!&#x201C;&#x2014; I suppose this may come to <hi rend="italic">good</hi> too, in some remote way, in some infinitesimally small degree? At lowest it will (on present terms) rot away into powder before very long, and be scattered into nothing by the winds.</p>
<p>When you get back, come to see us. I think we are to be from home on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> come-a-week, our only night of absence; but the next night we shall hope to be at home as usual.</p>
<p>Do not forget to satisfy Abeken about the Copy of the Charlottenburg Picture<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The painting by Antoine Pesne (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), which TC called &#x201C;The Little Drummer Boy,&#x201C; of Frederick, age two, and his sister, age four; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:opp. 370 and <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530203-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>28:25&#x2013;26</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1853-02-03">3 Feb. 1853</date></corr></ref>. The copy&#x2019;s whereabouts is unknown. Charlottenburg is the royal palace in Berlin.</note> which has come to Bath House. The real truth is, it is an excellent Copy of an extremely beautiful and interesting Picture; I know not that any Picture has come to us, for generations back, better worth having at its price: a truly &#x201C;Historical Painting,&#x201C; which I would not exchange for whole galleries of <hi rend="italic">Kaulbachism</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilhelm von Kaulbach (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), painter and illustrator, in somewhat melodramatic style, of Shakespeare, Goethe and others, whose &#x201C;huge Allegorical Paintings&#x201C; TC had seen in Berlin and detested; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530313-TC-JMA-01"><sic>28:78</sic><corr>TC to JMA, <date when="1853-03-13">13 March 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> or other Hypocritic Nonsense on Canvas.

The edn. was finished with vol. 6, <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>. John Knox (<date when="1505-00-00">1505</date>&#x2013;<date when="1572-00-00">72</date>), religious reformer and historian, greatly admired by TC.</note> an especially welcome Gift, came to me about a week ago; and I do expect to be well interested in examining it, one day before long: to see it fairly out before the world in this clean-dressed form, and fitted for the inspection of mankind, is itself a real pleasure to me. In fact if the Wodrow &#x26;c Society, before expiring,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Wodrow Soc., founded <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date> for pbn. of the works of early writers of the Church of Scotland (see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430107-TC-DL-01"><sic>16:11</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1843-01-07">7 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>), pbd. vol. 1 of Laing&#x2019;s edn.

I hope there is no danger of its now sticking fast by the way! If Subscribers for the 3 remaining volumes fall short, and my name can be of any use to you, please put it down; it will count for one at any rate, and I shall for once in my life have the satisfaction of subscribing to a Book wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I do think worth printing and publishing, and reckon it a sin and disgrace not to have properly published. Meanwhile many thanks for your Gift of this 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol; and all good speed to you in getting forward with the others. We cannot expect indeed that they will be of such eminent value as the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> volumes<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Knox&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Reformation of Religion within the Realme of Scotland</hi> (pbd. in part: London, <date when="1564-00-00">1564</date>; complete: London, <date when="1664-00-00">1664</date>) was given in the first two vols. of Laing&#x2019;s edn.</note> which indeed are <hi rend="italic">intrinsically</hi> I reckon quite a superior work: nevertheless I am not afraid, if fit elucidations by well-managed (sparing) annotation you make the others <hi rend="italic">legible</hi> to modern man, the others either will want readers: no word really uttered by John Knox but is a word distinguished by coming from the heart of a brave and true man, and must be worth listening to by here and there a man.</p>

I referred to the former project, and added, that possibly it might be revived when the new buildings on the Mound were completed. In order to call attention more directly to this point, I suggested whether he might not write a letter expressing his views on the subject &#x2026; to call public attention to the proposal in a definite form&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> 284&#x2013;85). The National Gallery of Scotland, on the Mound between the Old and New Town in Edinburgh, was built, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>.</note> but, alas, the matter never got beyond the stage of an aspiration with me; and it must be for others, if far other qualities and opportunities to get it successfully on foot as a project. Under that latter aspect, it has never seriously before me. What my rude notions are / I will with great frankness not grudge to throw down before you / you shall hear, with great frankness on my part.</p>
<p>First of all I have to record as an experimental fact that in all my Historic investigations, it has been and is one of the most primary wants to procure a Likeness of the personage inquired after; a good <hi rend="italic">portrait</hi> if such exists; failing that, an indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> if sincere one; in short <hi rend="italic">any</hi> representation made by a faithful human creature of that Face and Figure which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> saw with his eyes, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I can never see with mine, is now valuable to me, and much better than none at all. This wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is my own deep experience I believe to be in a deeper or less deep degree a universal one; and that every student and reader of History who longs and strives to conceive for himself what manner of <hi rend="italic">man</hi> this vague <pb id="pg-29-77" n="29:77"/>Historical Name (and distracting summary of incoherent rumours) can have been will as the first &#x26; directest indication of all search eagerly for a Portrait, for all the reasonable Portraits there are, &#x26; never rest till he have made out if possible what the man&#x2019;s natural face was like. Often I have found a Portrait far superior in information to half a dozen written Biographies, as Biographies are written;&#x2014;or rather that the Portrait was a small lighted candle by wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Biographies c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> first of all be <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, and some human interpretat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> made of them,&#x2014;the Biographic hero no longer an empty impossible Phantasm or distracting aggregate of incoherent rumours (in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> state it is worth nothing to anybody; but yielding at last some features wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find to be human. Next to a Portrait of the Person are perhaps autograph genuine and with <hi rend="italic">Autograph</hi> Letters wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are a stamp or impress of the: the directest impressions one can hope to get of the man: the actions he did tho&#x2019; symbolical in a still deeper degree are so involved complex and undecipherable stamp or im<supplied>[press]</supplied> in doubt by their complex nature and by the distractions and stupidities of other men, as to be nearly indecipherable with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> these helps.</p>
<p>This I may take as the highest pitch of interest there is in Historical Portraits, this that the zealous and studious Historian feels in them; (but the interest to other classes of men, tho&#x2019; less in degree, is also real) and all men just in proportion as they are &#x201C;Historians&#x201C; (which every mortal is who has a <hi rend="italic">memory</hi> and uses it in a human manner), will feel something of the same, so that I suppose there is absolutely nobody so dark and dull and narrow that a Series of Historical Portraits, especially of his native Country, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be of real interest,&#x2014;and a thing he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> wish to see, tho&#x2019; no newspaper admonished him ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it.</p>

<p>From this long prologue if you have patience to consider it over, you will see suff<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> what my notion of the main rules for executing the project would be. Two things will be essential to success: 1&#xB0; zeal, unwearied industry in hunting up what Portraits there are, scattered wide over County mansions in all parts of Scotland, skill in negotiating for them and getting them together; and 2&#xB0; (what will indeed be still more import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in the long run) knowledge and good jug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in (The grand interest in view is that wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have defined as for the <hi rend="italic">Historian;</hi> the only <hi rend="italic">real</hi> interest for the general body of mankind may be well considered as only a more and more diluted form of that. Walk straight towards that therefore,&#x2014;not refusing to look to the right and left; but with your face continually towards that. What w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the best-informed ingenuous Scottish soul most like to see for illuminating and vivifying Scottish History to himself? That is what concerns us; and on the whole, the only; for all other men will by and by follow this best-informed &#x26; most ingenuous one; and at the end of the account, I believe if you have served him well you will have served everybody well. Two things essential&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; / good judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in selecting, exhibiting and elucidating these. But Beyond all things <hi rend="italic">fidelity</hi> of mind will be vital to it; I mean a real and serious human aim faithfully endeavoured after, instead of a vague chaos of mostly showman and charlatan aims as is far commonest in such cases! For tho&#x2019; the thing must in good measure depend on popular support, it must by no means be done by B<hi rend="italic">n</hi> methods of the nature of a <hi rend="italic">Barnum</hi> business;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;B<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x201C; for &#x201C;Brummagen&#x201C; (worthless), see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520105-TC-JMA-01"><sic>27:3</sic><corr>TC to JMA, <date when="1852-01-05">5 Jan. 1852</date></corr></ref>.

If faithfully done (the <hi rend="italic">chaff</hi> faithfully well suppressed the wheat honestly given), I cannot doubt but it might succeed,&#x2014;or honourable help be got for it among the wealthier and wiser classes of Scotchmen.</p>
<p>On these principles (to come now to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> specific questions) I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be inclined <pb id="pg-29-80" n="29:80"/>to judge 1&#xB0; That no <hi rend="italic">living Historical</hi> Scotchman however sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be admitted; and even I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> counsel that you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be extremely chary ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such as have died within the last 25 years,&#x2014;it requires always the space of a generation to let popular dusts allay themselves; and the really great to be discriminated from the merely big and noisy. But from that point, especially from the beginning of this Century and backwards, you have free scope, and ever freer to the very beginning of things,&#x2014;which alas in this pictorial respect I fear will only be some poor 3 centuries back or little more. But you will do your utmost for the earlier figures, as for all; authentic engravings, coins, casts of sepulchral monuments; any genuine help to conceive the likeness of the man will be welcome there as in all cases. The one question is, that they be genuine, and that they <hi rend="italic">be</hi> helps. As to the number of portraits admissible for each, in cases where you have a plurality, I should be inclined to admit, for the earlier and more uncertain species, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that could be had that were genuine, that were &#x201C;helps&#x201C; as above said. Nay such even as were <hi rend="italic">half</hi> genuine if there were no others:&#x2014;marking well that they were but h<hi rend="italic">f</hi> gen<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. As you come lower down, the selection will be stricter; and unless the man is extremely important, and the duplicate portraits extremely excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you will not care for above one or a couple, especially if they do not differ materially, or <hi rend="italic">agree</hi> in some interesting way;&#x2014;your true aim always is, to let us see the man&#x2019;s natural face; that once done, more w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be surplusage &#x26; chaff.

<p>3&#xB0; My vote w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> clearly be to make the rule absolute <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to admit any one of those,&#x2014;at least till I saw one that was not an infatuation of insincere Ignorance and a mere distress to an earnest and well-instructed eye.

I know it only by Engravings; always hasten on when I see it in a window; and would not for much have the original hung on the wall beside me.

<p>Lastly as to the Catalogue,&#x2014;I am accustomed to conceive the Catalogue, well done, as one of the best parts of the whole. Brevity, knowledge, exactitude, <pb id="pg-29-83" n="29:83"/>
honesty, sincerity ought to be the characteristics of it even feature of it. Within not more than half a page to by far the majority of figures; hardly more than a page to any; historical, lucid, above all things exact. I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give the dates,&#x2014;birth death and main transactions of each character,&#x2014;brief all, and condensed to the uttermost very marrow in fact the condensed essence of his history; then add references (carefully distinguish<hi rend="italic">g</hi> the indubitable from the doubtful) to the Books (Chapter &#x26; verse, and <hi rend="italic">year</hi> of edition) where his History and character can be learned farther, by such as wish to study it. Afterwards in a line or two indicate the actual Habitat of the Picture here exhibited, its History if it have one, that it is <hi rend="italic">known</hi> to be by such and such a master (and on what authority) or that it is only guessed.&#x2014; What excellence and value might lie in such a Catalogue, if rightly done, I need not say to D. Laing; nor what labour knowledge and fidelity w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be needed to do it well. But it would be worth doing; and useful in a far more permanent way than any Exhibition. When once well done, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have it printed in some bound form, still very cheap, and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> expect it might have an immense sale at railway stations and elsewhere, and be long treasured by students as an inval<hi rend="italic">ble</hi> help in their pursuits.

<p>But enough now: your patience must not be ridden quite to death.

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>With regard to that <hi rend="italic">General Exhibition of Scottish Historical Portraits</hi>, it is certain there are many people more qualified to speak than I. In fact, it has never been with me more than an aspiration&#x2014;an ardent wish, rather without much hope: to make it into an executable project, there are needed far other capacities and opportunities than mine. However, you shall at once hear what my crude notions on the subject are or have been, since you wish it.</p>
<p>First of all, then, I have to tell you, as a fact of personal experience, that in all my poor Historical investigations it has been, and always is, one of the most primary wants to procure a bodily likeness of the personage inquired after; a good <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> if such exists; failing that, even an indifferent if sincere one. In short, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> representation, made by a faithful human creature, of that Face and Figure, which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> saw with his eyes, and which I can never see with mine, is now valuable to me, and much better than none at all. This, which is my own deep experience, I believe to be, in a deeper or less deep degree, the universal one; and that every student and reader of History who strives earnestly to conceive for himself what manner of Fact and <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> this or the other vague Historical <hi rend="italic">Name</hi> can have been, will, as the first and directest indication of all, search eagerly for a Portrait, for all the reasonable Portraits there are; and never rest till he have made out, if possible, what the man&#x2019;s natural face was like. Often I have found a Portrait superior in real instruction to half-a-dozen written &#x2018;Biographies,&#x2019; as Biographies are written;&#x2014;or rather, let me say, I have found that the Portrait was as a small lighted <hi rend="italic">candle</hi> by which the Biographies could for the first time be <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, and some human interpretation be made of them; the <hi rend="italic">Biographied</hi> Personage no longer an empty impossible Phantasm, or distracting Aggregate of inconsistent rumours&#x2014;(in which state, alas his usual one, he is <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> nothing to anybody, except it be as a dried thistle for Pedants to thrash, and for men to fly out of the way of),&#x2014;but yielding at last some features which one could admit to be human. Next in directness are a man&#x2019;s genuine Letters, if he have left any, and you can get to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> them to the bottom: of course, a man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">actions</hi> are the most complete and indubitable stamp of him; but without these aids, of Portraits and Letters, they are in themselves so infinitely abstruse a stamp, <pb id="pg-29-85" n="29:85"/>and so confused by foreign rumour and false tradition of them, as to be oftenest undecipherable with certainty.</p>
<p>This kind of value and interest I may take as the highest pitch of interest there is in Historical Portraits; this, which the zealous and studious Historian feels in them: and one may say, all men, just in proportion as they are &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Historians</hi>&#x2019; (which every mortal is, who has a <hi rend="italic">memory</hi>, and attachments and possessions in the Past) will feel something of the same,&#x2014;every human creature, something. So that I suppose there is absolutely nobody so dark and dull, and every way sunk and stupified, that a Series of Historical Portraits, especially of his native country, would not be of real interest to him;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">real</hi> I mean, as coming from himself and his own heart, not <hi rend="italic">imaginary</hi>, and preached in upon him by the Newspapers; which is an important distinction.</p>
<p>And all this is quite apart from the <hi rend="italic">artistic</hi> value of the Portraits (which also is a real value, of its sort, especially for some classes, however exaggerated it may sometimes be): all this is a quantity to be <hi rend="italic">added</hi> to the artistic value, whatever it may be; and appeals to a far deeper and more universal principle in human nature than the love of Pictures is. Of which principle some dimmer or clearer form may be seen continually active wherever men are;&#x2014;in your Antiquarian Museum, for example, may be seen, giving very conspicuous proofs of itself, sanctioned more or less by all the world! If one would buy an indisputably authentic <hi rend="italic">old shoe</hi> of William Wallace for hundreds of pounds and run to look at it from all ends of Scotland, what would one give for an authentic visible shadow of his face, could such by art natural or art magic, now be had!</p>
<p>It has always struck me that Historical Portrait Galleries far transcend in worth all other kinds of National Collections of Pictures whatever; that in fact they ought to exist (for many reasons, of all degrees of weight) in every country, as among the most popular and cherished National Possessions:&#x2014;and it is not a joyful reflection, but an extremely mournful one, that in no country is there at present such a thing to be found. What Louis-Philippe may have collected, in the way of French Historical Portrait, at Versailles, I did not see: if worth much (which I hear it is not) it might have been the best memorial left by him, one day. Chancellor Clarendon made a brave attempt in that kind for England;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Hyde (<date when="1609-00-00">1609</date>&#x2013;<date when="1674-00-00">74</date>), 1st earl of Clarendon, lord chancellor; his great collection of books and pictures was dispersed on his exile to France. TC had written about it in his paper on a National Portrait Gallery sent to Lord Ashburton, <date when="1853-09-08">8 Sept. 1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530909-TC-RWE-01"><sic>28:264</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1853-09-09">9 Sept. 1853</date></corr></ref> and Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:39&#x2013;46. TC seems to use this paper, now lost sight of, in the present letter, and regrets that his &#x201C;Gallery of English Portraits went to the winds.&#x201C;</note> but his House and &#x2018;Gallery&#x2019; fell all asunder, in a sad way; and as yet there has been no second attempt that I can hear of. As matters stand, Historical Portraits abound in England; but where they are, or where any individual of them is, no man knows, or can discover except by <pb id="pg-29-86" n="29:86"/>groping and hunting (<hi rend="italic">underground</hi>, as it were, and like the mole!) in an almost desperate manner: even among the intelligent and learned of your acquaintance, you inquire to no purpose. Nor is the English National Gallery poorer in this respect than others,&#x2014;perhaps even much the reverse. The sad rule holds in all countries. In the Dresden Gallery, for instance, you find Flayings of Bartholomew, Flayings of Marsyas, Rapes of the Sabines: but if you ask for a Portrait of Martin Luther, of Friedrich the Wise, nay even of August the Big, of Marshal Saxe or poor Count Br&#xfc;hl, you will find no satisfactory answer. In Berlin itself, which affects to be a wiser city, I found, not long ago, Picture Galleries not a few, with ancient and modern <hi rend="italic">virt&#xf9;</hi> in abundance and superabundance,&#x2014;whole acres of mythological smearing (Tower of Babel, and I know not what), by Kaulbach and others, still going on: but a <hi rend="italic">genuine Portrait of Frederic the Great</hi> was a thing I could nowhere hear of. That is strange, but that is true. I roamed thro&#x2019; endless lines of Pictures; inquired far and wide, even Sculptor Rauch could tell me nothing: at last it was chiefly by good luck that the thing I was in quest of turned up.&#x2014; This I find to be one of the saddest of those few defects in the world which are easily capable of remedy: I hope you in Scotland, in the &#x201C;new National Museum&#x201C; we hear talk of, will have a good eye to this, and remedy it in your own case! Scotland at present is not worse than other countries in the point in question: but neither is it at all better; and as Scotland, unlike some other countries, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a History of a very readable nature, and has never published even an <hi rend="italic">engraved</hi> series of National Portraits, perhaps the evil is more sensible and patent there than elsewhere. It is an evil which should be everywhere remedied: and if Scotland be the first to set an example in that respect, Scotland will do honourably by herself, and achieve a benefit to all the world.</p>
<p>From this long Prologue, if you have patience to consider it over, you will see sufficiently what my notion of the main rules for executing the Project would be. The grand interest to be held in view is that which I have defined as the <hi rend="italic">Historian&#x2019;s</hi>, the ingenuous sincere <hi rend="italic">Student of History&#x2019;s</hi>. Ingenuous and sincere student; not <hi rend="italic">pedantic</hi>, fantastic and imaginary! It seems to me all <hi rend="italic">real</hi> interest for the other classes of mankind, down to the most ignorant class, may well be considered as only a more and more diluted form of that interest. The rule therefore is, Walk straight towards that; not refusing to look to the right and left, but keeping your face steadily on that: if you can manage to secure that <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, all else will follow from it, or attend it. Ask always, What would the best-informed and most ingenuous Scottish soul like most to see, for illuminating and verifying of Scottish History to himself? This is what it concerns us to try if we can get for him and for the world;&#x2014;and on the whole this only; for it is certain, all other men will by and by follow this best-informed and most ingenuous one; and at the end of the account, if you have served him well, you will turn out to have served everybody well.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-87" n="29:87"/>Great zeal, great industry will of course be needed in hunting up what Portraits there are, scattered wide over country mansions in all parts of Scotland;&#x2014;in gathering in your raw-material, so to speak. Next, not less, but even more important, will be skill,&#x2014;knowledge, judgment, and above all, fidelity,&#x2014;in selecting, exhibiting and elucidating these. That indeed, I reckon, will be the vitallest condition of all; the cardinal point, on which success or failure will turn. You will need the best Pictorial judgment (some faithful critic who really <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> the Schools and Epochs of Art a little, and can help towards the solution of so many things that will depend on that); especially all the <hi rend="italic">Historical</hi> knowledge and good sense that can be combined upon the business will be indispensable! For the rest, I would sedulously avoid all concern with the vulgar Showman or Charlatan line of action in this matter. For though the thing must depend, a good deal, at least, on popular support, the real way to get that (especially in such a matter) is, to deserve it: the thing can by no means be done by <hi rend="italic">Yankee-Barnum</hi> methods; nor should it, if it could.&#x2014; In a word, here as everywhere, to winnow out the chaff of the business, and present in a clear and pure state what of <hi rend="italic">wheat</hi> (little or much) may be in it; on this, as I compute, the Project will stand or fall. If faithfully executed,&#x2014;the chaff actually well suppressed, the wheat honestly given,&#x2014;I cannot doubt but it might succeed. Let it but promise to deserve success, I suppose honourable help might be got for it among the wealthier and wiser classes of Scotchmen.</p>
<p>But to come now to your more specific questions, I should be inclined, on the above principles, to judge&#x2014;</p>
<p>1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, That no living Scotchman&#x2019;s portrait should be admitted, however &#x201C;Historical&#x201C; it promised to be. And I would farther counsel that you should be extremely chary about such &#x201C;Historical men&#x201C; as have died within the last twenty-five or thirty years; it requires always the space of a generation to discriminate between popular monstrosities and Historical realities in the matter of Man,&#x2014;to let mere dust-clouds settle into their natural place and bulk. But from that point, especially from the beginning of this century, you have free scope, and ever freer, backwards to the very beginning of things,&#x2014;which alas! in the Pictorial respect, I fear will only be some two or three centuries or little more! The oldest Scottish portrait I can recollect to have seen, of any worth, is that of James IV. (and only as an engraving, the original at Taymouth), though probably enough you may know of older. But for the earlier figures&#x2014;I would go back to Colm and Adamnan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Columba (521&#x2013;97), founded a monastery on Iona, Inner Hebrides; St. Adamnan (ca. 625&#x2013;704), his successor as abbot, wrote a life of St. Columba.</note>&#x2014;if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi>, by any old illuminated missal or otherwise? You will have engravings, coins, casts of sepulchral monuments&#x2014;I have seen Bruce&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">skull</hi>, at least, cast in plaster!&#x2014;; <pb id="pg-29-88" n="29:88"/>and remember always that any genuine help to conceive the actual likeness of the man will be welcome, in these as indeed in all cases. The one question is, that they be genuine (or, if not, well marked as <hi rend="italic">doubtful</hi>, and in what degree doubtful); that they <hi rend="italic">be</hi> &#x2018;helps&#x2019; instead of <hi rend="italic">hindrances</hi> and criminal misguidances!</p>
<p>2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, In regard to modern pictures representing historical events, my vote would clearly be, To make the rule absolute <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to admit any one of these; at least not till I saw one that was <hi rend="italic">other</hi> than an infatuated blotch of insincere ignorance, and a mere distress to an earnest and well-instructed eye! Since the time of <hi rend="italic">Hollar</hi>, there is not the least <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi>, even of intention, in such things; and, for most part, there is an <hi rend="italic">ignorance</hi> altogether abject. <hi rend="italic">Wilkie&#x2019;s John Knox</hi>, for example: no picture that I ever saw by a man of genius can well be, in regard to all earnest purposes, a more perfect failure! Can anything, in fact, be more entirely <hi rend="italic">useless</hi> for earnest purposes, more <hi rend="italic">unlike</hi> what ever could have been the reality, than that gross Energumen, more like a boxing butcher, whom he has set into a pulpit surrounded with draperies, with fat-shouldered women, and play-actor men in mail, and labelled <hi rend="small-caps">Knox</hi>? I know the picture only by engravings, always hasten on when I see it in a window, and would not for much have it hung on the wall beside me! So, too, I have often seen a <hi rend="italic">Battle of Worcester</hi>, by some famed Academician or other, which consists of an angry man and horse (man presumably intended for Cromwell, but not like him),&#x2014;man, with heavy flapping Spanish cloak, &#x26;c., and no hat to his head, firing a pistol over his shoulder into what seems a dreadful shower of rain in the distance! What can be the use of such things, except to persons who have turned their back on real interests, and gone wool-gathering in search of imaginary? All that kind of matter, as indisputable &#x2018;chaff,&#x2019; ought to be severely purged away.</p>
<p>3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, With respect to <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi> of portraits, when you have the offer of more than one? The answer to that, on the principles already stated, will come out different in different cases, and be an affair of consideration and compromise. For the earlier (and more uncertain) figures, I should incline to admit <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that could be got; certainly all that could be found genuine, that were &#x2018;helps,&#x2019; as above said. Nay, such even as were only half genuine, if there were no others, marking well their doubtful character. As you come lower down, the selection will be stricter; and in quite modern times when pictures are plentiful, I should think <hi rend="italic">one</hi> portrait would in general be the rule. But of course respect must be had to the importance of the man, the <hi rend="italic">excellence</hi> of the portraits offered (or their peculiar worth for your objects), the quantity of house-room you are like to have, &#x26;c., &#x26;c., and the decision will be the summary and adjustment of all these considerations.</p>
<p>For example, during the <hi rend="italic">Reformation period</hi> I would take of John Knox, and his consorts and adversaries (Lethington, Kirkcaldy, Regents Murray, <pb id="pg-29-89" n="29:89"/>
Morton, Mar, Buchanan, Bothwell, even Rizzio, and the like), any picture I could get; all attainable pictures, engravings, &#x26;c., or almost all, unless they be more numerous than I suppose,&#x2014;might promise to be &#x2018;helps,&#x2019; in that great scarcity, and great <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> to be helped. While, again, in reference to <hi rend="italic">The Forty-five</hi>, where pictures abound, and where the personages and their affair are so infinitely insignificant in comparison, I should expect that one portrait, and that only of the very topmost men, would well suffice. Yet there is a real interest, too, in that poor Forty-five&#x2014;for, in fine, we lie very <hi rend="italic">near</hi> it still, and that is always a great point; and I should somehow like to have a <hi rend="italic">Hawley</hi>, Sir John Cope, Wade, and Duke of Cumberland smuggled in,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hawley (<date when="1679-00-00">1679</date>&#x2013;<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>), lieut.-gen., commanded cavalry at Culloden, <date when="1746-04-00">April 1746</date>, when the Jacobites were defeated. Sir John Cope (d. <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>), lieut.-gen., commander-in-chief in Scotland, routed at Prestonpans, <date when="1745-09-00">Sept. 1745</date>. George Wade (<date when="1673-00-00">1673</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470912-TC-JAC-01"><sic>22:64</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1847-09-12">12 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>), field marshal; commander-in-chief in Scotland from <date when="1724-00-00">1724</date> who carried out a program of road-making, <date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738-00-00">38</date>, as part of the process of ruling the Highlands after the <date when="1715-00-00">1715</date> Jacobite rebellion; commander-in-chief later in <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date> who failed to stop Prince Charles Edward&#x2019;s march south. William Augustus (<date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">65</date>), duke of Cumberland, 3rd son of George II, commanded government army at Culloden. &#x201C;Smuggled in&#x201C; because English, and reviled in Scotland because of the severity of the repression of the Highlands after the Jacobite defeat.</note> by way of &#x2018;illustrative Notes,&#x2019; if that were possible. Nay, I really think it should be done; and, on the whole, perceive that the <hi rend="italic">Forty-five</hi> will be one of your more opulent fields.</p>
<p>The question &#x2018;Who is a Historical Character?&#x2019; is, in many cases, already settled, and, in most cases, will be capable of easy settlement. In general, whoever <hi rend="italic">lives</hi> in the memory of Scotchmen, whoever is yet practically recognisable as a conspicuous worker, speaker, singer, or sufferer in the past time of Scotland, he is a &#x2018;Historical character,&#x2019; and we shall be glad to see the veritable likeness of him. For examples, given at random,&#x2014;George Buchanan, David Rizzio, Lord Hailes, Lord Kames, Monboddo, Bozzy, Burns, Gawin Douglas, Barbour,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Barbour (<date when="1316-00-00">1316</date>&#x2013;<date when="1395-00-00">95</date>), poet, author of the <hi rend="italic">Brus</hi> (ca. <date when="1375-00-00">1375</date>), celebrating the war of independence, and other works.</note> Jamie Thomson. I would take in, and eagerly, David Dale (of the cotton manufacture), less eagerly Dundas (of the suffrage ditto), and, in general, ask myself, Who said, did, or suffered anything truly memorable, or even anything still much remembered? From Bruce down to Heathfield and Abercromby,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Gen. Sir George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1790-00-00">90</date>), defender of Gibraltar, gov. <date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>; and Gen. Sir Robert Abercromby (<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), who served in the American Revolution and India, and was gov. of Edinburgh Castle, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540502-TC-DL-01">TC to DL, <date when="1854-05-02">2 May</date></ref>.</note> the common History books will direct you plentifully as to one class; and for the others, knowledge and good judgment will be the methods.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-90" n="29:90"/>4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, Lastly, as to the Catalogue. I am accustomed to conceive the Catalogue, if well done, as one of the best parts of the whole. Brevity, sound knowledge, exactitude, fidelity, ought to be the characteristic of every feature of it. Say you allow, on the average, not more than half a page to each, in by far the majority of cases; hardly more than a page to any: historical, lucid, above all things exact. I would give the <hi rend="italic">essence</hi> of the men&#x2019;s history, <hi rend="italic">condensed</hi> to the very utmost; the dates, his birth, death, main transactions&#x2014;in short, the <hi rend="italic">bones</hi> of his history; then add reference to books and sources (carefully distinguishing the good from the less good), where his history and character can be learned farther by such as wish to study it. Afterwards, in a line or two, indicate the actual <hi rend="italic">habitat</hi> of the picture here exhibited; <hi rend="italic">its</hi> history, if it have one; that it is <hi rend="italic">known</hi> to be by such and such a master (and on what authority), or that it is only guessed. What value and excellence might lie in such a Catalogue, if rightly done, I need not say to David Laing; nor what labour, knowledge, and resources would be needed to do it well! Perhaps divided among several men (with some head to <hi rend="italic">preside</hi> over all), according to the several <hi rend="italic">periods</hi> and classes of subject;&#x2014;I can perceive <hi rend="italic">work</hi> enough for <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, among others, there! But, on the whole, it could be done, and it would be well worth doing, and a permanently useful thing. I would have it printed in some <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> form, not as a pamphlet, but still very cheap; I should expect a wide immediate sale for it at railway stations and elsewhere while the Exhibition went on, and a steady and permanent sale for it afterwards for a long time indeed. A modern <hi rend="italic">Nicolson</hi>, done according to the <hi rend="italic">real want</hi> of the present day, and far beyond what any &#x2018;Historical Library,&#x2019; with its dusty pedantries, ever was before!</p>
<p>But enough now. Your patience must not be quite ridden to death, and the very paper admonishes me to have done. Accept in good part what hasty stuff I have written; forgive it at least. I must say this small National Project has again grown to look quite beautiful to me,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">possible</hi> surely in some form, and full of uses. Probably the real &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Crystal Palace</hi>&#x2019; that would beseem poor old Scotland in these days of Exhibitions,&#x2014;a country rather eminently rich in men perhaps, which is the pearl and soul of all other &#x2018;riches.&#x2019;&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me yours ever truly,</salute></closer></p>

<p>Under great hindrances, and in a very hasty and poor manner, I have now likewise written down some rough and ready things on the General Portrait Exhibition. Here the poor Paper is, as it stands; with all its faults on his head! It is far too <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, for one very fatal fault. But on the whole I could not help it: that is what the angry gods permitted me to do at this time; and you must make of it what you can. It will give me real pleasure, if the project do take root, and one day come to perfection in sight of all the world.&#x2014; In haste,</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I myself have been often thinking of that small sad and sacred matter;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their mother&#x2019;s epitaph; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540516-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-05-16">16 May</date></ref>.</note> the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> duty, as you say, that we can render to one who will be forever dear to us! Jamie &#x26; I had been speaking of it before I left Scotsbrig; but at that time the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of birth was only in process of being ascertained: it is probably quite ascertained now; and I was often thinking, in these days, of writing to Jamie about it, when you now write. By all means, let us set about it straightway. The <hi rend="italic">inscription</hi>, as you say, should <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> very simple (honest like <hi rend="italic">her</hi> dear <hi rend="italic">self</hi>);&#x2014;if any mark of our universal love and reverence for her could be <pb id="pg-29-92" n="29:92"/>introduced, it would of course be gratifying to us; but I suppose it cannot, after what has been inscribed upon the stone already?</p>
<p>The first thing will be to ascertain <hi rend="italic">what</hi> room there is (for how many lines, and the average number of letters a line admits); also what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> said already on the stone:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540516-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-05-16">16 May</date></ref>.</note> if the date and place of birth are then ascertained, we can at once proceed to draw out the little Inscription. If you like, you may try something, and let me see it; or if you like <hi rend="italic">better</hi>, I will do it myself and leave <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to be critic. Let us lose no time now, however; that poor act of mournful piety will be good to have done.&#x2014; Alas, I can well understand how you should still feel &#x201C;all your existence changed&#x201C; by the Event which had been so long foreseen as inevitable! With me too, who lay at any rate <hi rend="italic">divorced</hi> from the scene, and could mostly commune with her only in thought, it has made a most sad <hi rend="italic">breach</hi>, into the very heart of my whole way of life, and is generally present with me still at all hours of the day; speaking with a <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> that puts all &#x201C;language&#x201C; to silence. Oh, Alas!&#x2014; But we must <hi rend="italic">say</hi> no more. It is by the oldest law of Nature; and is <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, doubtless, tho&#x2019; infinitely stern. We shall all follow soon; let us be <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>, if we can!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Redwood&#x2019;s Clerk, at my request, has sent me the inclosed account of that catastrophe.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Rees wrote to TC, <date when="1854-05-05">5 May</date>, from Cowbridge to say that Redwood had been ill since <date when="1853-05-00">May 1853</date>. He had been bathing from time to time at Taffs Well, nr. Cardiff, for his health. Finally he went to Bath, <date when="1854-04-05">5 April</date>, where he died, <date when="1854-04-21">21 April</date>. &#x201C;I have not been able to find any of your letters in the office, but should I hereafter, I will immediately forward them to you.&#x201C; On the back of the letter TC wrote: &#x201C;Death of poor Redwood / (no <hi rend="italic">Papers</hi> left) / <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>.&#x201C; The papers survived.</note> Pray return it when you next write. It seems to me poor R. had produced some <hi rend="italic">congestion</hi> in the brain by that incessant puddling and bathing &#x26;c, and most probably brought about his <hi rend="italic">end</hi>, by excessive caution to keep his health perfect. It was not fear of death either; it was a kind of religion in him, a <hi rend="italic">reverence</hi> for cleanliness and the virtues of temperance. Poor soul, I shall miss him considerably: no <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> being lived on the Earth, and to me he was faithfully attached,&#x2014;I cannot well spare any out of that small list now left me. His Christmas message<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Usually with a gift of game or a turkey.</note> (silent and certain as the course of the sun) will come hither no more.</p>
<p>I am getting very ill on with my work; in fact, not in the least &#x201C;getting on&#x201C; with it at all, only incessantly struggling with it. In very bad circumstances too; but in fine it is my <hi rend="italic">only</hi> chance; I must stand by it, or be lost without salvage!</p>
<p>We have fine splashes of real <hi rend="italic">rain</hi>, for this day or two, at last; thunder is growling even now: hours of hearty rain there have been; <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> (very temporary at this season), and yesterday a shower of hail. For the rest we are quiet <pb id="pg-29-93" n="29:93"/>as mice in the wall; walk in the morning (I, after bathing), read at night, and are hardly ever out or interrupted. Jane has a cold; and it was got by a contrary course, however! We went to Procter&#x2019;s to dine, on Saturday night,&#x2014;partly by accident, after refusing <hi rend="italic">once</hi>.

<p><salute>But&#x2014;my Dear!</salute> You astonish me!&#x2014; This statement of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser&#x2019;s, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> suggested to her to go out of town and let her house to you, is wholly and absolutely <hi rend="italic">false!!</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1854-05-17">17 May</date>, that he and Phoebe had &#x201C;given up the idea of taking Mrs Fraser&#x2019;s house&#x201C; in Montpelier Sq. and &#x201C;mean to get some lodging about Hans Place or near the head of Sloan Street.&#x201C; They rented Mrs. Fraser&#x2019;s house in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>.</note> I certainly called for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser last Saturday and sat some <pb id="pg-29-94" n="29:94"/>twenty minutes with her&#x2014; But the rest is <hi rend="italic">without an atom of foundation</hi>. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser is too well up to managing her own affairs for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> ever to have dreamt of offering her a suggestion. Besides that, just as little should I have dreamt of striking unasked into <hi rend="italic">your</hi> affairs, now that you have a wife of your own to arrange for you. In short the two ideas&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">your coming</hi> and M<hi rend="italic">rs Frasers house</hi> never so much as pointed towards each other in my brain!</p>
<p>Really if the little woman wished to <hi rend="italic">let</hi> her house, she ought to have offered it to you on her own responsibility; instead of <hi rend="italic">using up</hi> my call of condolence for that end.</p>
<p>For the rest, if you like the situation, I see no objection to the house. It is sure to be free of bugs&#x2014;and there is room enough for temporary purposes&#x2014;and it is not <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> my <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> powers&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I should have liked you had gone no further off than where you stayed before<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hemus Terr.</note>&#x2014; Your old Landlady M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Thorburn has removed some time since into a nice large house in the Kings road&#x2014;one of those with the gardens in front&#x2014;when I last saw her, her first floor lodgers had just gone&#x2014; Had you been seeking <hi rend="italic">lodgings</hi> and applied to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;I was meaning to go and examine these&#x2014;which are within five minutes walk of here. But if you have settled with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Fraser; there is no more to be said or sung. I suppose you would bring the Ladysmaid with you to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Frasers? or does she offer you her servants too?&#x2014; At all events look well into <hi rend="italic">that</hi> condition&#x2014;if she have made it one. She told me her cook was a &#x201C;nasty creature whom she did not at all like&#x201C;&#x2014; Housemaid she has had none latterly only a char woman.</p>
<p>I have got the Influenza again&#x2014;caught cold returning from a dinner-party at the Procters on saturday night, and am at present in the third stage of the thing&#x2014;the coughing and sneezing stage&#x2014;</p>
<p>I saw &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Noble Lady</hi>&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Dorothea Montagu, Anne Procter&#x2019;s mother, widow of Basil Montagu (see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18231014-JBW-TC-01"><sic>2:451</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1823-10-14">14 Oct. 1823</date></corr></ref>).</note> that night&#x2014;and a strange tragic sight she was! sitting all alone in a low-ceilinged, confined room at the top of Proctors house&#x2014;a french bed in a corner&#x2014;some relics of the Grand Bedford Square Drawingroom<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where the Montagus had lived.</note>&#x2014;(small pictures and the like) scattered about&#x2014;Herself stately, artistic as ever&#x2014;not a line of her figure, not a fold of her dress changed since we knew her first, 20 years ago and more. She made me sit on a low chair opposite her&#x2014;(she had sent for me to come up) and began to speak of Edward Irving and long ago as if it were last year&#x2014;last month! There was something quite overpowering in the whole thing&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">pagan</hi> grandeur of the old woman&#x2014;retired from the world, <hi rend="italic">awaiting death</hi>, as erect and unyielding as ever, contrasted so strangely with the mean bedroom at the top of the house&#x2014;the uproar of <hi rend="italic">company</hi> going on below&#x2014;and the past which she seemed to <pb id="pg-29-95" n="29:95"/>live and move in felt to gather round me too, till I fairly laid my head on her lap and burst into tears. She stroked my hair very gently and said &#x201C;I think, Jane, your manner never changes, any more than your <hi rend="italic">hair</hi> which is still black I see.&#x201C; &#x201C;But you too are not changed&#x201C; I said&#x2014;&#x201C;You know she said when I was still a young woman, I dressed and felt like an old one and so age has not told so much on me as on most others.&#x201C; When I had staid with her an hour or so she insisted on my going back to the company&#x2014;and embraced me as she never did before Her embrace used to be so freezing always to my &#x201C;youthful enthusiasm&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC attributes the phrase to John Sterling in JWC to the Sterling daughters (undated letter; MS: NLS Acc. 9086); cf. &#x201C;beautiful enthusiasm,&#x201C; coterie speech, the phrase of Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s sister, Miss Benson; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530524-JWC-JAC-01"><sic>28:153</sic><corr>JWC to JAC, <date when="1853-05-24">24 May 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> but this time she held me strongly to her heart and kissed my cheeks many times heartily&#x2014;like a mother&#x2014;I was near going off into crying again. I felt that she was taking eternal farewell of me in her own mind. But I dont mean it be so&#x2014;I will go again to see her very soon. The great gentleness was indeed the chief change in her&#x2014;not a hard word did she say about anyone&#x2014;and her voice tho&#x2019; clear and strong as of old had a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> modulation in it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>You get your Newspaper very irregularly; this week, for example, you do not get it all, for it has never come to me: I know you will excuse the irregularity, and will understand even, without my telling you, that it does not come from <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, but from Thornhill; and that I have not, for my poor share, contributed to it at all,&#x2014; nor mean to contribute, but will send off the poor <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> whenever it does arrive, the very same day in general.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC seems to say that the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Herald</hi> was sent from Thornhill (the Russells) to Cheyne Row, then sent on to James at Scotsbrig.</note> This I wished once to tell you, that there might be no suspicion of my bad behaviour in so small a matter. The use of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> is as near as possible nothing, I doubt; to me it is about absolutely nothing except as a kind of hank upon Scotsbrig; and I would not fail in that small but real employment of it.</p>
<p>You have heard nothing from me direct, this long while; no Letter since we parted in the frost, in that sad mood and situation!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After their mother&#x2019;s funeral.</note> I take it for certain that John, to whom I write pretty often, keeps on a level with our occurrences here; he does not fail to give us a notice pretty frequently of what is going on in <pb id="pg-29-97" n="29:97"/>your circle; a very welcome service to us always. I sometimes think you might take a pen, and give me a few words of your own; but that, I know, is a <hi rend="italic">sweer</hi> kind of task with you, so we do not insist on it,&#x2014;except on rare occasions.</p>
<p>You have been no strangers to trouble, I fear, since the time I left you, with one great trouble <hi rend="italic">fallen</hi> on us all. Poor Martha Park!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s sister-in-law.</note> I was very sorry for her: a tragic fate; which indeed I already anticipated from what I heard while still in the neighbourhood. It was just the history of poor &#x201C;Aunt Jeannie,&#x201C; as we called the good Templand Daughter of Walter whom you remember.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh; JWC&#x2019;s aunt, her mother&#x2019;s sister.</note> I felt for poor Isabella too; who has now a sad blank on that side of her world. As to Robert Park and the poor Bairns, the sorrowful bereaved condition they are suddenly left in is too evident.</p>
<p>John tells me of bad accidents in the Farm lately; first one very heavy indeed then another, if not <hi rend="italic">so</hi> bad, yet too bad (if one could have helped it): one never can help such things; they come always, tho&#x2019; at irregular times, and are to be accounted a piece of the <hi rend="italic">history</hi> of farming and indeed of all human enterprises.</p>
<p>I have not been very prosperous either, since you parted with me: generally in rather poorish health (at least in very poor spirits) even for me; and making no right <hi rend="italic">way</hi> in my work, which is the only consolation left now. Sad smearing and <hi rend="italic">glarring</hi> I do generally make of my day&#x2019;s work, and leave it in sad humour for most part; but I do begin again next day, and always stick to the thing in a languid helpless but obstinate way: so I hope there <hi rend="italic">may</hi> one day, be some improved symptoms reported of me and it. With or without success, I must ever hold on: all <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> itself is gone without that.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;room&#x201C; up aloft, which you heard so much about, is now pretty well finished, and there is even some furniture (four chairs, <hi rend="italic">half</hi> a table) and some books &#x26;c placed up there: but I very seldom visit the place, and only contemplate trying it perhaps when the weather is grown too hot for these lower stories and this western exposure. As a room that was to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi>, inaccessible to sound, it is a most perfect <hi rend="italic">failure</hi>, one of the undeniablest <hi rend="italic">misses</hi> ever made! So that all my labour and suffering, and &#xa3;200 or more of ready money has been quite thrown away, so far as that grand intention goes: only a little <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> of London workers and Builders (which indeed I did not <hi rend="italic">want</hi> before) has been my conquest in that adventure! However, our <hi rend="italic">noises</hi> are already (thank Heaven) nearly all but away <hi rend="italic">otherwise;</hi> and I have one of the quietest <hi rend="italic">bedrooms</hi> I ever had in my life, which is the only noiselessness <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> essential to me: so we will put up with the disappointments;&#x2014;and reflect only that a man <hi rend="italic">has</hi> to &#x201C;eat a very great deal of dirt&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> in this world! Nay the room is <pb id="pg-29-98" n="29:98"/>really not unhandsome; large enough, and quite admirably <hi rend="italic">lighted:</hi> I believe I shall by and by get some good of it after all.</p>
<p>Jane had a little cold some day or two back, but it is now so far gone again that she has ventured out today, tho&#x2019; the weather is none of the favourablest to her. Dampish and cold, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> great falls of rain with thunder &#x26;c; the wet was greatly needed, and even with it there will now, I should think, be great scarcity of hay for next year.&#x2014; Jane is generally about the old pitch of health: not worse, I should say; always very weakly, but very active too, and seldom or never giving in.&#x2014; My poor Welsh friend Redwood (whom you remember my going to visit more than once) is suddenly dead. The news came quite unexpectedly about 10 days ago; poor fellow, he had been ailing a little for some six months or more, but went to Spa-<hi rend="italic">wells</hi>, went hither and thither, and considered he got benefit;&#x2014; I myself suspect he had produced some flow of blood to his <hi rend="italic">brain</hi> by all these bathings and well-drinkings:&#x2014; at last he went for a week to Bath; thought himself somewhat better, and decided to stay another week,&#x2014; the other week was not half done, when he suddenly died one morning. It was among strangers, and in an inn,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >White Lion Hotel, Bath.</note> poor soul! After his mother&#x2019;s death,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Redwood (d. <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470924-TC-CR-01"><sic>22:86</sic><corr>TC to CR, <date when="1847-09-24">24 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>).</note> I think he was never heartily familiar with anybody; he had half-brothers; but they were of a different course and way of thinking, so he never saw much of them. He was kindhearted, full of affection; but led the loneliest life, withdrawn from men and their bad ways, which he <hi rend="italic">hated</hi> in his heart, but hated also to quarrel about. He had got the name of the &#x201C;honest lawyer&#x201C; in the countryside; indeed there was hardly to be found a more perfectly truthful and honest man. I never got much good by speaking with him: but he loved me well, was infinitely patient with me; and his death will be long felt as a loss here.</p>
<p>Dear Jamie, my pen is very bad; or my two pens, the <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> and the goose one,&#x2014;hardly know which suits <hi rend="italic">worst</hi>, on this miserable paper: many thing are <hi rend="italic">bad;</hi>&#x2014; and almost all things (as I often say) in the way of furniture for writing! But indeed I had to end at any rate, the hour being come.</p>
<p>John will talk to you, next time he comes, about a small <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> and pious matter, a <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> we have still to do to one who is gone from us; you and I talked of it, I remember, before my leaving; but it was not then ready. I hope it will now be done without delay.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Give my best regards to Isabella (in which Jane sure enough <hi rend="italic">would</hi> join, were she present); my continual wishes for you and all yours. I hope to write again soonish, even if nobody answers. Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I will at once return you my Draught of the Inscription:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For their mother&#x2019;s grave. John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1854-05-15">15 May</date>: &#x201C;I send the inscription. I went down to copy it last saturday, Jamie meeting me with the gig. We found our mother&#x2019;s grave grown quite green, &#x26; the sight of it had a soothing effect upon me which is not yet gone. / The space left on the stone seems large enough. The distance of the last word &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">here</hi>&#x2019; from the bottom of the stone is the same as its distance from &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">to</hi>,&#x2019; thus leaving absolute room for some eight lines if they could be cut to the very bottom. And certainly five or six lines, or perhaps seven, might be cut well enough. / The lines on the stone are the same as my lines. &#x2018;Erected to the&#x2019; is in German Letters; &#x2018;died&#x2019; in line 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> stands as I have copied it; &#x26; the lines at the bottom, you will see, contain many more letters than those at the top. The &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Also</hi>&#x2019; in line 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> is in large Italics, the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">And</hi>&#x2019; in line 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> is in small Italics; &#x26; &#x2018;JAMES CARLYLE&#x2019; in line 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi> is in large capitals. &#x2018;Jannet&#x2019; [Janet Carlyle, their father&#x2019;s first wife, d. <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>] is spelt as you see. I should like the inscription for our mother written by you.&#x201C; The inscription already on the stone was &#x201C;Erected to the / MEMORY OF Jannet Carlyle. / Spouse to James Carlyle, Mas / on in Ecclefechan, who died / the <date when="1792-09-11">11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.

She brought / him nine children; whereof four / sons and three daughters survived / gratefully reverent of such / a Father, and such a Mother.&#x201C;</note> I have a kind of pious <hi rend="italic">threep</hi> in me to do it this day,&#x2014;the very <hi rend="italic">first</hi> work I do in my new upstairs room, whither they flitted up my things yesterday, and sent me to my task this morning. I have sat in serious enough mood (as you may fancy), considering it this long while up and down. What already stands on the Stone is rather confusing, and does not give a good basis for the new record. If there is room for this, and you like it at all, it seems to myself, for the present, admissible. Any corrections or suggestions from your fresh mind will be apt to be improvements. Do your faithfullest in regard to it,&#x2014;make another altogether, omit &#x26;c, exactly as you find fittest;&#x2014;and I shall be well satisfied. I find (judging from the Inscription to our Father) you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ascertaining the absolute day; but do not give it up till the <hi rend="italic">impossibility</hi> is become evident.&#x2014; I have only to propose farther that you and I (without any other) bear the little expence of this Inscription jointly, if you will not give it up to me altogether as to the Eldest. No other should be concerned in it. And so now pray get forward with it; and let us expect to talk of it as a thing <hi rend="italic">done</hi> against the time you come up in June.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-100" n="29:100"/>I know not how I am to get on here: everything is yet strange to me, and I feel as if whirled by angry elements to this lofty solitary point,&#x2014;apart from all fellow creatures whatsoever. I am not yet <hi rend="italic">hefted</hi>, but doubt not I shall be before long. The place is far enough from being absolutely <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>, as promised: but it is certainly very quiet, beyond all other rooms (the squirting of my pen, and some rumbling of the east wind overhead, are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> I hear at this moment); at worst, there is hardly the 20<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi> part of any sharp sound that gets in to me, the <hi rend="italic">softer</hi> being all killed in their road;&#x2014;and as for light, it is perfectly superb, extremely <hi rend="italic">comfortable</hi> for failing eyes.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-05-20">20 May</date>: &#x201C;Came up hither to this topmost <hi rend="italic">new</hi> sky lighted room, which I have got built with such unutterable expenditures of trouble, suffering, money and every kind of resource,&#x2014;for the purpose of being <hi rend="italic">soundless</hi>, absolutely <hi rend="italic">quiet;</hi> which I find I am very far indeed from being. A <hi rend="italic">failure</hi>, therefore, this; one of many. No matter; I have succeeded otherwise (thank God) in getting rid of the <hi rend="italic">anti-sleeping</hi> noises, have my old bedroom quite quiet again; and this, for a working room, is at least much quieter than common, and surely ought to <hi rend="italic">suffice</hi> on that side. Hope only I shall succeed in getting some vestige of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> done; am to try <hi rend="italic">today</hi> (after 3 days of sorting rubbish &#x26;c) whether I cannot get <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> with that sad F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> of mine. <foreign>Eheu</foreign>, begin, begin!

<dateline><place>Chelsea</place>, <date when="1854-05-16">16 May, 1854</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I am certainly shamefully in your debt in the matter of writing; and I know not how it has been, for nothing <hi rend="italic">particular</hi> has turned up to prevent me,&#x2014;nothing but the old never-ending brabble of confusions, attended perhaps with a little worse spirits occasionally, and for one or two days last week, with a rather lower pitch of biliousness than usual. However, I will now pay off; and promise, if I can, to be more punctual for some time coming.</p>
<p>This is the first day of my getting up into my celebrated New Room; I write to you at present under a magnificent sky-light, and shut out by double doors <pb id="pg-29-101" n="29:101"/>from all concern (so far as possible) with the external world! My very <hi rend="italic">first</hi> work in this new place was a Note to John about a certain poor <hi rend="italic">Inscription</hi>, the nature of which you will guess. He says you have never yet found out the exact date of our departed mother&#x2019;s birth:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1854-05-15">15 May</date>, saying that he had asked Jean Aitken to &#x201C;get the place &#x26; year of our mother&#x2019;s birth&#x201C; from the &#x201C;register of the old meeting-house &#x2026; Scott, who is now minister of it, seems to be a very loose and unpunctual man. &#x2026; James Aitken had often called upon him in vain, &#x26; the register could never be found.&#x201C;</note> pray try all your industry to do it now, for I would fain have the thing done; the last sad pious duty we can have to do for one who will be precious and dear to us while life continues. I could not give the thing up today; and felt that somehow I ought to do that <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, in this new and somewhat foreign position I have got into. Really a kind of <hi rend="italic">flitting</hi> went on yesterday; new <hi rend="italic">bookcase</hi>, and all manner of <hi rend="italic">plenishing</hi> to rearrange and haul hither and thither: today I feel drearyish, as a person that had got <hi rend="italic">from home</hi>, not yet used to his new quarters: a very little matter will suffice to push some of us out of joint!</p>
<p>The room considered as a <hi rend="italic">soundless</hi> apartment may be safely pronounced an evident <hi rend="italic">failure:</hi> I do hear all manner of sharp noises,&#x2014;much reduced in intensity, but still perfectly audible; it is only the <hi rend="italic">dull</hi> noises that are quite annihilated: for the rest, it <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be defined as an eminently <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> room, far <hi rend="italic">less</hi> noise in it than in any other; it is roomy too, all my own (to stick <hi rend="italic">maps</hi> on the wall &#x26;c &#x26;c), and perfectly isolated from the rest of the house: the <hi rend="italic">light</hi> too, as I have said, is beyond praise. No doubt had I once got the steam up, and succeeded in falling to work with any complete heartiness, I shall find the place a real improvement: &#x26; Jane meanwhile is very proud of the fine new drawingroom she has realized for herself. I am to be out of that till the time of fires come again; and she has it, or will soon have it, in a very bright state indeed, now that I am out of it.</p>
<p>What is this that you speak of now and then, about going to America? Has James such a notion practically in his mind at all? Of course I can understand he might find a far larger scope for his faculty of work, and might (if he were lucky) gain far more money than in poor half-ruinous Dumfries: but into a superior community of man, community less given to quackery and all active and passive service of the Evil Principle, I am by no means sure that he is likely to go; and that, I suppose, is what his heart tacitly strives after, and not finding that, he will <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> disappointed as it were of all. No, no; I hope that will not become a practical project! At least let things be growing evidently worse and <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>, towards the unendurable pitch, before you think of it. I hope, not; I hope, not: to me indeed, such years have I arrived at, all <hi rend="italic">change</hi> has an unwelcome sound in it; and I would have, so far as possible, all stay where it is,&#x2014;lest it &#x201C;go father and fare no better!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-102" n="29:102"/>Of Dr Brown<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dr. Samuel Brown.</note> I cannot give you the least tidings of a direct nature: the last thing I had from himself was that Note you got,&#x2014;and that, I grieve to remember, is still unanswered! I saw lately in an Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Newspaper (the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi>, which somebody sends me) a Review, evidently by Brown, of a new Poem called <hi rend="italic">Balder</hi>,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sydney Thompson Dobell, <hi rend="italic">Balder</hi>, pt. 1 (<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>, with preface).</note> no great shakes of a Poem; but the Review was friendly to it, and very well done, indicating a considerable stock of <hi rend="italic">birr</hi> in [MS torn] directly know. A Mrs Stoddart<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jemima Stodart.</note> since [MS torn] Lady now here whom I was asking about him, describes him as keeping very private, inaccessible in his lodgings to all but an intimate few; for the rest, supposed not to be in a dangerous state, but in a very lame and tedious one.&#x2014; I wish Mr Aird (to whom give my respects) would write to him, get some news, and send the same to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>
<p>Yesterday Jane and I made a visit to Lockhart (Sir W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott&#x2019;s son-in-law) who is just returned, said to be &#x201C;recovered in health,&#x201C; from Rome.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Gibson Lockhart had been in Rome from <date when="1853-07-00">July 1853</date> (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530727-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:226</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-07-27">27 July 1853</date></corr></ref>).</note> Alas, he is not &#x201C;recovered&#x201C;; he is only a little better; and seems greatly wasted away in body, tho spirited, courageous and talkative, indeed active in mind as much as ever. The sight of him was very affecting, and has not yet ceased hanging about my thoughts. He thinks of removing farther out into the mere [words missing: sub]urbs, and I suppose giving up [MS torn] not of <hi rend="italic">travelling</hi> more in search of amusement.</p>
<p>Dear Sister, I must now draw bridle; having indeed written more than enough, I do believe.&#x2014; If you can remember, send me, next time you write, a <hi rend="italic">pennyworth of small brass wire</hi>,&#x2014;my stock (due to you also, I think, in old days) is at length quite done; and no <hi rend="italic">pipe</hi> is to be depended on without it!</p>
<p>We have wild N.E. wind here again for the last 30 hours: I suppose it will bring a farther weight of rain, which latter will be very welcome besides all we have got.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Good be with you always, dear Jean; may blessings be on your house and on all precious to you. I am always Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi> Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Spring Rice,</salute>
<p>I am greatly obliged to you for the sake of poor Allingham, to whom you <pb id="pg-29-103" n="29:103"/>have surely done the duty of a Good Samaritan.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540416-TC-SSR-01">TC to SSR, <date when="1854-04-16">16 April</date></ref>.</note> The foolish little Poet (who, I hope, has here got one good lesson which he will not need to repeat) ought to thank you all the days of his life,&#x2014;and to stand with double energy to Her Majesty&#x2019;s service in the Customs henceforth, whatever other thing he may find himself capable of combining with it. There has not been in my experience a more mildly-dealt-with foolish young gentleman. But I believe he deserves it too, poor soul; for there is something really good in him, really true ingenious and kindly, and capable of growing to use in many ways, now that you have saved him from delirium and destruction, which were all he had <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> look for on the &#x201C;literary&#x201C; course. Thanks and Well-done, therefore I say again; and may your shadow never be less.</p>
<p>I remember Mr Prescott<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry James Prescott (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>), banker, former gov. of the Bank of England, or his brother, William George Prescott (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), partner in the banking firm of Prescott, Grote &#x26; Co., whom TC may have known through the Ashburtons and their association with the family banking firm Baring Bros.</note> very well, and very kindly indeed out of old days; and it would surely give me pleasure to see him again in any feasible way. His kindness to me is great in this Proposal: but, alas, do you know what a &#x201C;Dinner&#x201C; means to the unfortunate individual now writing? It means a brief enjoyment purchased by ten days of nightmare wretchedness; a thing which Rhadamanthus<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400417-TC-HMS-01"><sic>12:114</sic><corr>TC to HMS, <date when="1840-04-17">17 April 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> (especially when, as now, the liver is <hi rend="italic">below</hi> par) has sternly, and in a very audible manner, ordered me to avoid. Such is my sad fate; that really is the truth, and I ought to take it as such.</p>
<p>If you and Mr Prescott would come down hither any evening (we have tea at 7&#xBD; p.m. and later),&#x2014;we are at home almost <hi rend="italic">any</hi> evening,&#x2014;and could make a very nice and really <hi rend="italic">human</hi> thing of it.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I now return the Inscription; Jane too approves of your way, therefore let it so stand.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1854-05-17">17 May</date>: &#x201C;The only part of your inscription that seems a little indistinct &#x26; doubtful to me, &#x26; also to Phoebe, is the last line. Would it do better as I have modified it in the enclosed? / I have not heard from Jean &#x2026; . I am not sure about the year (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>), &#x26; I recollect well that our mother told me she was born either the monday before or after the Rood Fair of Dumfries. Now that fair always falls on the <date when="0000-09-29">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of <hi rend="italic">September</hi></date>, or the first Wednesday after the <date when="0000-09-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, so that the monday before or after it is seldom in <hi rend="italic"><date when="0000-10-00">October</date></hi>. I rather think our mother was born in <date when="1769-00-00">1769</date> or <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>; &#x26; it would be easy to ascertain from the Parliamentary Reports in the London Library on what day the Rood Fair fell in <date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>, &#x2013;<date when="1770-00-00">70</date>, &#x26; &#x2013;<date when="1771-00-00">71</date> &#x2026; .

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>it is certain Jean said the Monday <hi rend="italic">after:</hi> I marked the passage in that Letter of hers you sent me; and if you have not destroyed it (for it was returned to you in my last packet), you will still find it. My own indistinct recollections, which however did lean to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">after</hi>&#x201C; too, are not worth much: but Jamie is in general a precise witness in regard to things of memory,&#x2014;is he not? If he and Jean go together, the point may be taken as pretty well settled. This is all I had to say. If Jean have, <hi rend="italic">since</hi> that Letter, revoked her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">after</hi>,&#x201C; the case is altered; and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> proposed settlement (of last night) is of course the true one.&#x2014; I am glad the poor little enterprise is to go on now without delay: the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> service we shall ever get to do to her who is gone into Eternity, and has left us here (for a little while) in the vortexes of Time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Not long since, David Laing applied to me for a <hi rend="italic">written</hi> word upon what I had been once mentioning to him while here last autumn,&#x2014;a Scheme of making a grand <hi rend="italic">Exhibition</hi>, one good time for all, of whatever real <hi rend="italic">Portraits of Historical Scotchmen</hi> were discoverable now in the world! I wrote David accordingly (a too <hi rend="italic">long</hi>, and very bad Letter,&#x2014;being ill-off at the moment, not even a <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> that would write); this is David&#x2019;s return, which I here inclose,&#x2014;half the Letter <hi rend="italic">smoked</hi> away, unhappily; but <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> left, I have no doubt! Throw it in the fire when you have read, if you like to read. Last night at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> the Dilettanti bodies would be speaking of the thing;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laing presented TC&#x2019;s letter to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, <date when="1854-05-22">22 May</date>, as a support for the proposal that a national exhibition of Scottish portraits be held in Edinburgh in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>. The Society agreed to appoint a small committee of the society to forward the arrangements, and, further, that the Royal Scottish Academy be invited to name a committee for the purpose. The meeting approved, thanked TC and Laing, and named a committee of four, including Laing (<hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</hi> 1 [<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>]:284&#x2013;92).</note> but whether it will ever come to a result, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2014;nor care.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady Stanley,&#x2014;</salute>Do not be angry at me: here are 3 of a Bundle of Papers I have got; one you are to keep for your own behoof; the other 2 you are, with your accustomed benevolence, to &#x201C;leave where they may be useful,&#x201C;&#x2014;that is to say, where young gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ambitious <supplied>[for]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted. The leaflet, Weimar <date when="1854-05-00">May 1854</date>, headed &#x201C;English &#x26; Continental Education / at Saxe-Weimar,&#x201C; advertised: &#x201C;The Rev. Thomas Wilson, Graduate of Cambridge and Oxford, Author of &#x2018;Travels in Syria and Egypt&#x2019; &#x26;c. &#x26;c., now officially resident at the Grand-Ducal Capital of Saxe-Weimar, undertakes to prepare English Gentlemen for the Universities and learned or military professions. / Terms, with residence on the footing of an English Home, including able instruction &#x26; daily conversation in the German and French languages 200 pounds sterling per annum. / Terms, for non-resident pupils &#x2026; 100 pounds sterling per annum &#x2026; / M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. Wilson, being under the immediate sanction and special notice of His Royal Highness the Reigning Grand-Duke, feels authorised in promising his pupils various advantages peculiar to a brilliant and accomplished Court&#x201C; (copy: Strouse).</note> a German education are thought to exist.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-107" n="29:107"/>I have known this Mr Wilson a long time; and can fearlessly describe him as an honourable, well-bred, well-conditioned, cultivated, ingenious and amiable man. What he says of Weimar I know also to be quite true;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The leaflet said: &#x201C;The Saxe-Weimar State-Church is advanced Lutheran &#x2026; . The Grand-Ducal Government is at the same time &#x2026; of a tolerant temper towards every conscientious form and development of Religious belief. / A residence at Weimar (so long the favourite resort of young Englishmen of a high class) is still as well adapted as ever for the acquirement of all elegant accomplishments at the hands of Professors attracted from different parts of Germany by the liberal and judicious patronage of their Royal Highnesses.&#x201C; Franz Liszt (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), eminent composer and piano virtuoso, was &#x201C;permanent Director of the Royal Opera, Master of the Chapel Choir &#x26;c. / The Court-Theatre, of such European celebrity under the illustrious management of GOETHE and SCHILLER, is still unsurpassed in classic representations from the German Drama.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;to which it may be added that the best dialect of German is spoken in those parts; and that the Town is very quiet, clean, and the region understood to be wholesome. These are facts; which may perhaps concern certain persons in your sphere.</p>
<p>For the rest, if your Ladyship is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> impatient, and cannot stand such a thing in this top of the season,&#x2014;throw the Papers into the fire; and dismiss me and them, with a free pardon!&#x2014; I sent this Wilson to the young Duchess of Weimar,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie Luise.</note> at her request, for a grand &#x201C;Institution&#x201C; she has been setting up; and he pleases greatly, as I expected; which practically ought to finish <hi rend="italic">my</hi> account with <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for the present, unless the remaining items be easy rather than otherwise.</p>
<p>We never see you; I never see you; tho&#x2019; I call occasionally. I suppose I must persist, tho&#x2019; unsuccessful. The fates have not been kind to me at all in these latter times; but we must not growl at their ill usage, perhaps it will improve. <closer><salute>Good be with you always, dear Lady Stanley.

<p><salute>Dear Lady, dear Friend,&#x2014;</salute>If I had anything that was pleasant or useful to send you out of this high garret of mine, how gladly would I! But there is nothing such; nothing to say that you do not either know, or that were better not said;&#x2014;and here is such a sputtering vile pen, and such scandalous paper; made as all things are, on the &#x201C;cheap and nasty&#x201C; principle! A most poor garret this, inhabited by a solitary, who may be defined at present as the poorest of all souls that now are.&#x2014; However, it is certain said poor soul still continues well affected to your high Nobleness, very much so indeed; and it seems natural I should continue to wave you some melancholy signal now and then so long as we both continue living on this Earth.</p>
<p>My garret really, after all, is not so bad; lumin<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; for &#x201C;luminous.&#x201C;</note> as day, almost too much light rather, and almost perfectly silent (for all practical purposes), at least on windy days, when I can get it shut completely. For example, all is clangorous with bells &#x26;c (God knows for what) when I go down into the Garden; and up here there is nothing to be heard but the general howl of the East wind,&#x2014;all bells, organs, dogs, fishwomen, Times articles and other noises beneficently swept away in it. The misfortune is, I am lamed and broken utterly in my own inner man; unable yet to rally heartily, and get on fire for any victory of working or endeavouring,&#x2014;&#x201C;victory,&#x201C; alas, alas! However I am getting up the needful Books &#x26;c about me; getting accustomed to the strange place; <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> daily to do some vestige of work;&#x2014;above all things, getting daily more wretched, desperate, and utterly enraged at myself, so long as I can do none. You know the nature of the beast; not alterable by hellebore or human art: pray for the poor devil, and don&#x2019;t be quite angry at him till we see!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I met a great crowd of known faces about Hyde Park Corner on Sunday,&#x2014;few or none of them beautiful to me, unluckily;&#x2014;and I had not time to go and look at Bath House, and convince myself that it still stood there. The bird was flown; I knew; the Bird of Paradise, and even the Green Chimera;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s parrot.</note> but I hoped they would come back to me in a week again. One Adderley (whom I think you love) informed me the Twisletons were now in Paris; due here on the <date when="1854-06-10">10<hi rend="italic">th;</hi></date> Twisleton and the <hi rend="italic">Petite</hi> are therefore to be restored to us: blessings of their sort, perhaps, as matters go. The said Adderley, a well-intentioned, placid, and I doubt always rather stolid man, poked into me some questions, of Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, of the Turk war; got nothing out of me but mere fire and brimstone, of which I was heartily ashamed, so soon as I got away from the astonished <pb id="pg-29-109" n="29:109"/>country gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> and the poor young ladies he had about him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward and Ellen Twisleton; Charles Bowyer Adderley (<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>), Twisleton&#x2019;s paternal cousin (see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:289</sic><corr>26:biogrophical note</corr></ref>); he had five das.; the &#x201C;young ladies&#x201C; were presumably the three oldest, Anna Maria Margarette (b. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>), Caroline Jane (b. <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), and Frances Georgina Mary (b. <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note> Fleming<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Fleming (d. <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>); see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:293</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>.</note> came next: &#x201C;A message from Lady Alice Peel&#x201C;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Alice Jane Peel, b.

Unluckily I knew nothing of this Lady, except incidental rumour of her name, thro&#x2019; Another very greatly more important to me: &#x201C;Lady Ashburton is to be there,&#x201C; said Fleming; &#x201C;and the Duc d&#x2019;Aumale,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henri Eug&#xE8;ne Philippe Louis d&#x2019;Orl&#xE9;ans (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1897-00-00">97</date>), duc d&#x2019;Aumale, son of Louis Philippe; army officer, former gov.-gen. of Algeria, and historian.</note> and&#x201C;&#x2014;in fine he has sent a Note yesterday (which burn); but I promised nothing; and cannot by any means go; and am thinking only to manage that in the politest way,&#x2014;which I suppose will be by silence, and a card left afterwards?</p>
<p>Senior hove in sight afterwards; fat and jolly himself;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nassau William Senior.</note> full of news about the general &#x201C;detestation&#x201C; everybody in Paris felt for everybody,&#x2014;of a general <hi rend="italic">union</hi> (on the Senior plan) produced by mutual repulsions,&#x2014;which is a very unprofitable speculation to me. Senior vanished, however, and everybody vanished; and one was left alone with the dark riddle of things,&#x2014;and a few dull Books on the History of the <hi rend="italic">Heilige R&#xF6;mische Reich</hi> [Holy Roman Empire].&#x2014; The day before yesterday I even left a card at Stafford House for your sublime Friend;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Duchess of Sutherland.</note> was even ready for a brief interview, had the flunkies been propitious; but they were not; in fact I believe her Highness had really gone out to walk before dinner. That account at any rate was settled.&#x2014; Today I am for the lanes and Parks; do not mean to see London Town at all; having got little but weariness, chagrin and contemptible sorrow out of it since a certain human being went to live elsewhere for a time.</p>
<p>Today there is a stormy wind blowing down the great Avenue at The Grange; you must go southwards (on the back of <hi rend="italic">Patience</hi>) if you are well advised. Abbotston Down,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hilly chalk country, Hampshire.</note> sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you be rash enough to climb thither, will quite blow you to pieces; at least blow bonnet and <hi rend="italic">ugly</hi> both away, and you will return home in a distressed condition!&#x2014; However, I hope Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is getting fast on; and that you have a pleasant interval of quiet, you too, among the summer luxuriances and blessed solitudes there.&#x2014; If you know of anybody aiming for &#x201C;German Education,&#x201C; this is the Wilson sent by me to that country;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540531-TC-LST-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, <date when="1854-05-31">31 May</date></ref>.</note> please <pb id="pg-29-110" n="29:110"/>send his Paper (which is all <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, I believe)<supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> such fit party: if you know none, burn and forget it at once.

And so I now leave it altogether with you.</p>
<p>We have very wild cold weather here, for two days past; wind raging from the N.E. with grey troubled skies; likely to issue in floods of rain again. I am struggling and endeavouring daily up here, so far as the weakness of the nerves, liver, heart (and spirit too alas!) will permit; but I make no way hitherto; and lead but a disconsolate profitless existence in the meanwhile. In the distance, however, there do perhaps lie, after terrible struggling, some better results dimly visible. Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>One good thing surely is the prospect of soon seeing you again! I hope you will get tolerable Lodgings somewhere within reach of us; by Phoebe&#x2019;s Lady friend or otherwise. I was to say meanwhile that if you wanted to look out deliberately yourselves, or for any other reason would think of it, there is plenty of room here,&#x2014;the front bedroom comfortably furnished, a good servant in the house &#x26;c &#x26;c;&#x2014;and in short a wide-open door (as is to be presupposed, in this and in all times) for your landing here at N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5 on the night of your arrival. I need say nothing more of that, I hope. The fact is very clear; and I leave it with you.</p>
<p>Jean wrote to me lately; she seems sorry about your going; otherwise in good enough heart.&#x2014;No news among us; or none that I bethink me, worth <pb id="pg-29-111" n="29:111"/>writing to you when you are so soon to be here ready for word of mouth.&#x2014; Whew!

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I had wrapped up the <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> on Saturday, and meant to send it off; but, being hurried, forgot it&#x2014;only recollected it when I was gone a mile. The same day I had intended you a word of writing; but that, of course, was still farther from my hand!&#x2014; I send the whole thing in a heap today; still very hard up for <hi rend="italic">time;</hi> being in fact a bad manager of time, I fear, which surely is a bad character of me.</p>
<p>Your Note came in due course; you will have got little James, I mean <hi rend="italic">James the Younger</hi>, home with you at present; and I fancy to myself how glad a blink of time that will be for you, amid the common run of days! Little Jim, I hope, is doing well, and has got over all his preliminary difficulties at Glasgow? Let him stand faithfully to his work; and there is no danger of him. A man that can and will do the work cut out for him may fairly expect the wages appointed;&#x2014;only if <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi>, he can expect nothing, especially in such a scene as Glasgow now is. I believe my little Nephew to be a very good fellow by nature: with plenty of born faculty, if he be diligent enough; sense, patience, punctuality; above all things, and in all cases and in all senses, <hi rend="italic">integrity</hi> (doing faithfully to the bottom what can be expected of you, and <hi rend="italic">refusing</hi> in any way to take the Evil Genius into partnership with you!)&#x2014;these are the qualities a man ought to have, if he will prosper there, or in this God&#x2019;s-Universe anywhere!&#x2014; Give my best regards to him. Tell him too I recommend, for one very preliminary thing, a great attention to his <hi rend="italic">penmanship;</hi> he must never cease struggling and endeavouring till he get a swift, correct and acceptable <pb id="pg-29-112" n="29:112"/>form of handwriting. Bid him not quarrel, or bother at all, with his Cousin Jamie;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James (Jamie) Carlyle (b. <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>), son of James and Isabella, with whom James Aitken had lodged in Glasgow. Janet Hanning wrote to James Carlyle, <date when="1854-10-30">30 Oct.</date>, asking if James Aitken was still in Glasgow, saying, &#x201C;I think you are better by yourself&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> bid him <hi rend="italic">determine</hi> to be peaceable and friendly with him,&#x2014;or in fact to keep out of his way, and forget him quite, when that is not possible.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack is to be expected here about Thursday or Friday, he says. They have not taken the <hi rend="italic">House</hi>, I know not for what reason; they have some friend of Phoebe&#x2019;s appointed to seek them <hi rend="italic">Lodgings</hi> in this quarter of the Town. The Fraser House was about a mile and a half from us, <hi rend="italic">rather</hi> on our road up to Town, but not quite; the Lodgings I hope will be equally or still more handy in that particular. What the poor Dr meant to do about settling or returning, I conjecture, is a great mystery still to himself; and will not be settled till after much hithering and thithering, and admonition from within and from without. However, he has always a companion now, as you observe; and is no longer a solitary wanderer and wayfarer.</p>
<p>I am getting on as poorly as ever with what is charitably called my &#x201C;work&#x201C;: alas, I never had so ungainly a thing to subdue to my own likeness; totally without internal inspiration towards it, moreover; and to crown all, I am getting old, and very &#x201C;stiff to ye <hi rend="italic">rise</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400723-TC-AC-01"><sic>12:204</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1840-07-23">23 July 1840</date></corr></ref>.</note> compared with times I can remember! However, we will not give in; not quite, while the life is in us, if we can help it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our weather is dreadfully cold these last 3 or 4 days; probably a deluge of rain to be expected again, after these howling storms from the North and East. Jane had been complaining slightly, and keeping within doors out of the wind, for some days; but I took her out yes<supplied>[ter]</supplied>day,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters omitted.</note> and I hope set her agoing again,&#x2014;unluckily catching a dirty little whiff of cold for myself by the operation.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note came yesterday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote from Moffat, <date when="1854-06-04">4 June</date>, enclosing Lorimer&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1854-06-01">1 June</date>: &#x201C;The stone-cutter is to meet James at Ecclefechan to-morrow &#x2026; . The inscription shall be put as it now stands if possible; &#x26; if the space for it be found too small, Jamie shall have the necessary alterations before him when he meets Lorimer &#x2026; . We shall have Phoebe&#x2019;s maid with us &#x26; also one of her little boys, so that you cannot receive us all; but I will come myself alone, if we get no suitable lodging in time; &#x26; will let you know a day or two before our arrival.&#x201C; They were going for a short stay at Windermere on their way to London. John Lorimer (b. <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>?), engraver and copper plate printer, 41 Church St., Annan.</note> and there is only perhaps a word of answer, one word, that can be of use; let me therefore write that just now,&#x2014;in the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> of my dreary so-called day&#x2019;s-<hi rend="italic">work;</hi> <hi rend="italic">before</hi> going down to smoke my first pipe!</p>
<p>If you should chance to come on <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi> night, and it were <hi rend="italic">after</hi> 7 p.m., you will find us gone out for some hours. We are to dine at the Marshalls&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Garth and Mary Alicia Marshall, 37 South St., Grosvenor Sq.</note> that night; so you must give us warning,&#x2014;that Anne, the Servant, may be warned and all may go smooth for you as if we ourselves were there. Anne is a very judicious good woman; will know you at once by face (especially if warned), get you tea, chops, rasher of bacon or whatever you like; and about 11 &#xBD; you will see us return, if you have not preferred to go to bed first.&#x2014; This is all I had to say.</p>
<p>Our weather is still grimly cold; northwind very strong, and nothing but grey clouds all over the sky. Neuberg was here (by appointment,&#x2014;he never comes otherwise, good soul) on Sunday night: very well; and solicits to be sent to the Museum for me; in which I surely might gratify him! He lives at Willesden, in a pleasant convenient kind of big house, and solitary place,&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">lodger</hi> only,&#x2014;and seems to make no movement towards getting a House of his own. Farie, who now &#x26; then catches me on the street, but never formally appears <hi rend="italic">here</hi> now (having learned wit) is about translating, abridging, or doing something or other to <hi rend="italic">Haxthausen&#x2019;s Russia</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie. His trans. of August von Haxthausen (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500805-TC-JWC-01"><sic>25:141</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1850-08-05">5 Aug. 1850</date></corr></ref>) was <hi rend="italic">The Russian Empire</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>).</note>&#x2014; Lockhart, who looks very pale and weak, but has still all his faculties about him, and can be very entertaining company for half an hour, was here yesterday: poor L. the sight of him affected me with strange feelings.&#x2014; <closer><salute>But enough, enough. I will say only <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gl&#xfc;ck auf dem Weg</hi></foreign> [Good luck on your way]; and subscribe myself Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> affectionate</salute></closer></p>

Something evidently is wrong, or else I should have seen you long ago: how much may be wrong, it is better to know, than to keep guessing, in the morbid humour one gets into. Alas, calamities abound, and sorrows of a harsh nature and also of a soft; and there is no want of burdens for the poor pilgrim in this world,&#x2014;who often gets foot-sore too, not so able to struggle along, with his load. I am afraid you are not yourself in good health, in addition to all; but may have gone to Malvern,&#x2014;where indeed the fresh hill-breezes may do you good, tho&#x2019; the medical <hi rend="italic">steepings</hi> &#x26;c not very much.</p>
<p>I am myself in rather poor case this long while; decidedly below par in bodily health, and with a very fair proportion of other things to keep my spirits from rising <hi rend="italic">above</hi> their due level!

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>Many thanks for your lucid and very inviting Report upon <pb id="pg-29-118" n="29:118"/>the Mitchell Papers.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Andrew Mitchell (<date when="1708-00-00">1708</date>&#x2013;<date when="1771-00-00">71</date>), British envoy to Prussia, <date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>; accompanied Frederick in the Seven Years&#x2019; War. The papers (British Lib.) are described in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:36.</note> If I could get fairly at them, I feel as if there was much still to be dug out of them. But the attempt at reading or examining anything <hi rend="italic">there</hi> fills me with mere horror!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The fragments of <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> by F<hi rend="italic">k</hi>, as given in <hi rend="italic">Mitchell</hi>, &#x201C;origin of evil&#x201C; &#x26;c are all now in print,&#x2014;I believe, <hi rend="italic">all;</hi>&#x2014;but a great many of the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> appear to be still hidden. Preuss,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann David Erdmann Preuss.</note> for example, ought to wish very much for a sight of that letter you have copied: Dresden (beginning of <date when="1757-09-00"><hi rend="italic">Sept</hi>r) 1757</date>; which is very curious,&#x2014;at least far <hi rend="italic">more</hi> curious than thousands he has printed. The <hi rend="italic">black border</hi> on it is for his Mother&#x2019;s death (<date when="1757-06-28">28 june, 1757</date>);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie Doroth&#xE9;e (<date when="1687-00-00">1687</date>&#x2013;<date when="1757-00-00">1757</date>), m., <date when="1706-00-00">1706</date>, Friedrich Wilhelm I (<date when="1688-00-00">1688</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>) of Prussia; Frederick&#x2019;s mother and sister of George II of Great Britain (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530415-TC-JN-01"><sic>28:107</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1853-04-15">15 April 1853</date></corr></ref>). For her death; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:193.</note>&#x2014;he is just come into the Saxon Western Regions, and manoeuvring about,&#x2014;towards <hi rend="italic">Rosbach</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rossbach, in Prussian Saxony, a village where Frederick defeated the French and Austrians, <date when="1757-11-05">5 Nov. 1757</date>.</note> as it proved. I will ask you to copy farther for me, if it is not too troublesome, the <hi rend="italic">Pressis</hi> (pr&#xE9;cis) <hi rend="italic">des Argumens dont se servira un Ministre Autrichien</hi> which you indicate in Vol 41 of the Mitchell Papers (&#x201C;l&#x2019;an <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>,&#x201C; or <date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>? It is a little indistinct. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi></p>
<p>2. To look over Mitchell&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> (which seem to be in vol. 64 and vol. 67); I do not mean, to <hi rend="italic">read</hi> them; but to ascertain what they principally turn upon, and what worth they may be expected to have.</p>
<p>3. &#x201C;Relations of Battles&#x201C; &#x26;c in vol. 65;&#x2014;can you ascertain <hi rend="italic">what</hi> Battles <hi rend="italic">are</hi> there described by Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi>. Those by Prince Henri are also of some importance (if Battles where the Prince was present,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Prag</hi>,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Prague; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540115-TC-KAVE-01">TC to KAVE, <date when="1854-01-15">15 Jan.</date></ref>; for Prince Henri (Heinrich Friedrich Ludwig), Frederick&#x2019;s younger brother, at Prague; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:138 and 141.</note> for one); but generally not of so much.</p>
<p>4. In vol 55 are letters from <hi rend="italic">Marquise d&#x2019;Argens</hi>, and M<hi rend="italic">me Maupertuis</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mlle. Cochois, a Berlin actress, m. Jean Baptiste Boyer, Marquis d&#x2019;Argens (<date when="1704-00-00">1704</date>&#x2013;<date when="1771-00-00">71</date>), French writer invited to Potsdam and admired by Frederick; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:318&#x2013;19. Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (<date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>), French mathematician and astronomer; elected director of the Academy of Science of Berlin, <date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>, pres. of Royal Academy of Sciences, <date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>; his widow was Eleanor, b. von Borck.</note> (both Ladies are <hi rend="italic">widows</hi>, I suppose, when they write?) If you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> run your eye over a few of them; see whether they do not yield Biographic indications,&#x2014;especially the <hi rend="italic">Maupert</hi> portion, all being very <hi rend="italic">obscure</hi> about Maup<hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the printed Books.</p>
<p>5. (Which is the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> important inquiry for me of all). I find by the printed <pb id="pg-29-119" n="29:119"/><hi rend="italic">Mitchell</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Papers of Sir Andrew Mitchell</hi>, ed. A.

This is a request Fritz is always making; and I never know fully why they won&#x2019;t gratify him. For angering Russia over-much? this I have sometimes suspected;&#x2014;but sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to hear what Holderness <hi rend="italic">publicly</hi> can say of it.&#x2014; This is enough for one bout.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> question and the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> (1 and 6) are of <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> importance to me; and may be the thing you begin with. I do not demand a <hi rend="italic">Copy</hi> of Holderness, at least not yet!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I find there are 3 <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> folios by Leibnitz (Hanover, <date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>): <hi rend="italic">Scriptores Rerum Bruswicarum</hi> (or some equivalent title);<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz, <hi rend="italic">Scriptores Rerum Brunswicensium</hi>, 3 vols.

<p>I also want, and have long wanted, to find a certain Book of <hi rend="italic">Toland</hi>&#x2019;s, which seems to be some account of a Journey he made to the Court of Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> first King of Prussia, especially to Charlottenburg,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sophie Charlotte&#x2019;s palace, near Berlin; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521007-TC-LOA-01"><sic>27:324</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1852-10-07">7 Oct. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> and the sublime Charlotte (our Fritz&#x2019;s grandmother), whom Toland calls <hi rend="italic">Serena</hi>, and praises to the very skies. I think his Book itself (or Pamphlet) is called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Serena</hi>&#x201C;?<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Toland, <hi rend="italic">Letters to Serena</hi> (<date when="1704-00-00">1704</date>); he also wrote <hi rend="italic">An Account of the Courts of Prussia and Hanover, sent to a Minister of State in Holland</hi> (<date when="1705-00-00">1705</date>).

Neuberg had sent J. P. Erman, <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires &#xE0; l&#x2019;histoire de Sophie Charlotte</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>) to TC in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520418-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:86</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-04-18">18 April 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> But you will see in Stenzel.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gustav Adolf Harald Stenzel, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des Preussischen Staats</hi>, 5 vols.

<p>n.b. There is on this subject a certain old French Book, which you might also take a glance of:</p>

<p>Finally, Is K&#xF6;nig&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Berlin</hi> in the Kings Library? I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> confidently expect it was.

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I think it is you that are in debt on the Letter account at present; but I have been thinking to send you a word for some days past, reflecting how much more convenience I have for writing than you,&#x2014;when, last night, the inclosed Letter from Alick was brought me (by <hi rend="italic">post</hi>, so busy is our Doctor, or so disposed for writing Notes, at &#xBE; of a mile distance!)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was at 21 Westbourne Pl.</note> with order to forward it to you,&#x2014;and from you to Grahame the owner of it. Read then; and despatch when you have done. Poor Alick is very sombre of mood,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of the death of his infant da. and his mother.</note> as indeed some others of us may be; but otherwise mostly well, and going on well.</p>
<p>As for us here, we have no news at all; nothing that is worth speaking of, much less writing;&#x2014;in fact, I am in a lowish kind of way, in very many sad respects, I for one; and <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get my work forward at all at all; therefore may be said to have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> comfort; for, in truth, the one satisfaction I could have in the world, and the one sure defence and amends amid perversities whatsoever, is at present denied me, do what I may! However, I persist in endeavouring, and will persist while life is left: perhaps some other day you may still hear some better tidings from me? We shall see. The truth is, I have not strength of nerves, nor fire of heart left at present to <hi rend="italic">subdue</hi> those horrid masses of lumber, and wring out of them what their available essence is: that would be &#x201C;work,&#x201C; my &#x201C;Work&#x201C; itself; and I should then be quiet under every rebuke, and make no complaint more. But we are not there yet; we are a pretty way off that yet, I doubt!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the raging Town will, in a three weeks, empty itself of about 150,000 idle noisy people; and I look forward to sensible increase of <hi rend="italic">quiet;</hi> which will be a real blessing.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your new Excerpts from <hi rend="italic">Mitchell;</hi> which are very interesting indeed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote to TC from Willesden, <date when="1854-07-01">1 July</date>, sending extracts from the Mitchell Papers (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540622-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-06-22">22 June</date></ref>): &#x201C;You ought to take a look at these documents, too; they have a singular <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> about them, and enable you to <hi rend="italic">march</hi> with Frederic and his soldiers, hear the rumours of the day, and share in the suspense of the hour. / But I must also say that the atmosphere in the reading room [in the British Museum lib.] was most poisonous.&#x201C;</note> That <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (unless it be far <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> than I suppose) seems to be a thing that ought decidedly to be <hi rend="italic">printed</hi>,&#x2014;in Prussia, if England cannot stand it: Raumer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich Ludwig Georg von Raumer (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>), German scholar; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520606-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>27:138</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1852-06-06">6 June 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> if he had been very wise, would have taken the whole of that along with him, I think, instead of leaving it utterly unnoticed! How long is it?&#x2014; I must also, as you say, get into personal communication with those Mitchell Papers, so soon as possible.</p>

<p>I do believe this voyage might do me good in the bodily way, as surely it would be very agreeable to the mind: nevertheless I must ruthlessly deny myself, and answer the beneficent Sea goddesses and you with a mournful shake of the head. It is very clearly my function to sit immoveable here at home; steadily gazing upon these enormous rubbish-mountains that have gathered round m<supplied>[e]</supplied> (frightful to the eye and soul);&#x2014;that is very clearly the first preliminary towards getting some of them perhaps wheeled away in process of time.</p>
<p>A right pleasant voyage to you and your lucky messmates;&#x2014;and many compliments to the brave Gowland,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Vigilant</hi>, on which they had sailed.</note> if he is still with you and remembers me.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I should be sorry indeed if my hard word went farther than I intended, and were to discourage you from any noble impulse you may trace in yourself! I did not, and do not, <hi rend="italic">deny</hi> you talent, even for writing Books one day; I only sought to make you aware of the inexorable conditions that determine whether <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> shall become <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> in such cases, or shall remain always <pb id="pg-29-125" n="29:125"/>futile. I write, too, in great haste; and have little time for any matter but those hugely confused ones that are among my own hands.</p>
<p>By all means, employ your spare time in seeking knowledge; redeem, if you can, a few hours of every day; read Books, and try to make sure that they are wise Books; consort with wise men, avoid the company of fools; think, reflect, inquire; study earnestly to find some true and noble thing in this world to which you can swear fealty: the day may come when you are really called to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> to your fellow creatures;&#x2014;but I can tell you, it will be happier for you if it never come; if whatever nobleness and wisdom are in you can come out in the way of silent work and successful conduct,&#x2014;appealing to the Eternal Powers (who are good judges, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> reward), not to the Ephemeral Reviewers, who have no power except in the Circulating Libraries, and no judgement that is infallible for the guidance of men!</p>
<p><closer><salute>Believe me yours with many good wishes</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle&#x2014;</name>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have a great favour to ask of you, to me a very great one; which, from your known courtesy, I need not doubt you will grant me if you can; and if you cannot, excuse me for asking.</p>
<p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Mss</hi>. in your custody there is one large mass of volumes called the <hi rend="italic">Mitchell Papers</hi>, which it is at present extremely necessary for me to consult and examine,&#x2014;neither Raumer nor the English Editor of Mitchell having (as I am led to conjecture) by any means exhausted the significance of that important and peculiar body of Documents.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540622-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-06-22">22 June</date></ref>, and <date when="1854-07-02">2 July</date>. Von Raumer includes some of Mitchell&#x2019;s letters in his <hi rend="italic">Beitr&#xE4;ge zur neueren Geschichte aus dem Britischen Museum und Reichsarchiv</hi> (<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">37</date>; English trans. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 15:9: &#x201C;a very indistinct poor Book, in comparison with what it might have been.&#x201C;</note> To carry on this investigation, or indeed any serious study or examination whatever, in the common Reading-room of the British Museum, I have found, after many sad trials, to be once for all, impossible to me: whatsoever therefore cannot be seen except <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, is to me as good as invisible; and many books and resources, not without good promise to me, I have had to surrender accordingly, and give up the idea of; but this of <hi rend="italic">Mitchell</hi> I am unwilling to surrender.</p>
<p>If there were, in your interior premises, any quiet corner, capable of being conceded to me for a while, where, delivered from noise, dust, confusion, and unbreathable atmosphere, I might have a fair opportunity upon these volumes of Mitchell (with perhaps a few subsidiary Books &#x26;c got from the Panizzi department), I should consider myself a lucky man, <hi rend="italic">able</hi> to complete my small enterprise in this particular, and owe you a lasting debt of thankfulness for striking off <hi rend="italic">these</hi> paltry fetters from me, whatever others may remain.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Madden refused TC&#x2019;s request as he could only offer him a seat in his dept.&#x2019;s room which had workmen in it (Diary, <date when="1854-07-11">11 July</date>; MS: Bodleian). In <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> TC speaks of the Mitchell papers as &#x201C;now in the most perfect order for consulting (thanks to Sir F. Madden)&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:36).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>Mr G. H. Lewes, whom I have long known, and whom everybody here knows as an ingenious brilliant, entertaining, highly gifted and accomplished man and writer, will deliver you this little Note in Weimar, where he purposes to rest himself among you for certain weeks, or at least give up his heavier labours in favour of lighter and more genial. He has had on hand this long while, and I believe is far advanced in it, a <hi rend="italic">Life of Goethe:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lewes had long been interested in Goethe and concerned that he had not received proper recognition for all aspects of his genius, especially the scientific ones. Lewes had written &#x201C;Goethe as a Man of Science,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>, n.s. <date when="1852-10-02">2 (Oct. 1852)</date>: 479&#x2013;506, and various earlier essays on Goethe; he had been thinking of writing his life for some time and of going to Germany to research it. By spring <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> the plan was settled for him to go there with Marian Evans; they set off, <date when="1854-07-20">20 July</date>.</note> what that will <pb id="pg-29-129" n="29:129"/>mean, in reference to his visit to Weimar, I need not suggest to you. I have promised that you will open all reasonable paths to him in those inquiries, and do for him whatsoever you can in the way of friendly welcome,&#x2014;which, for his own sake, you will soon find that he well deserves of you. He has a Card of mine for Eckermann;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Johann Peter Eckermann.</note> Wilson<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> he already knows: he speaks German, French like a native; has roamed and read in all directions, ancient and modern, grave and gay; and &#x201C;has not his tale a-seeking&#x201C; (as the Scotch say), but on the contrary has it <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>, in a pertinent and sprightly form, towards any man on almost any subject. Pray be good to him, all of you, while he sojourns in your old city.</p>
<p>I am not myself in a very victorious condition just at present; health none of the best, work absolutely refusing to move for me at all. However, we must persist; &#x26; hope the wheel will gradually turn a little, by good pushing long continued.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Taylor,</salute>
<p>Very unluckily I am engaged for this evening; neither is there now so much as time to announce the fact to you till too late. For Thursday I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come; and tho&#x2019; that turns out to be a day of my own choosing, I decide that we will still stand by it, according to your kind assent, lest farther puzzles and worse cross-purposes befal us! Nothing is more tragical, in a small way, than two persons of intense politeness meeting on a staircase, and mistaking the turn,&#x2014;jumping and rejumping to afford each other passage, and at every new <pb id="pg-29-130" n="29:130"/>jump merely again knocking their heads together. The remedy is that one of them become <hi rend="italic">un</hi>polite or less polite, and stand stock-still.</p>
<p>Your beautiful hand has been spoiled by imitating Taylor&#x2019;s; a kind of forgery withal I see nothing but ruin, unless you stop short in that course!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Thanks many times for your beneficent remembrance of me!&#x2014; I never saw the Burney Book, nor met with this account of the Interview at Ferney before:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote, <date when="1854-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;I stumbled upon these anecdotes of Dr Burney a day or two since. They may indicate where more such are to be found.&#x201C; Charles Burney (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), musician, composer, and author. <hi rend="italic">The Present State of Music in France and Italy: or the Journal of a Tour through those Countries, undertaken to Collect Materials for a General History of Music</hi> (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>) 55&#x2013;61 records his visit to Ferney, nr. Geneva, and meeting with Voltaire, <date when="1770-07-00">July 1770</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:157.</note> if you have the Book, or if it is in the London Library, I shall decidedly <pb id="pg-29-132" n="29:132"/>want to see it. The other Piece (is that too given by <hi rend="italic">Burney</hi>?) comes from a Lampoon written by Voltaire after his quarrel with Frederic, and was known to me, as well as F.&#x2019;s Letter on the little event:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably the piece, <hi rend="italic">Diatribe de Docteur Akakia</hi>, written <date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>, and Frederick&#x2019;s letter, &#x201C;uncertain date&#x201C;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:358&#x2013;64.</note> but it increases my desire to see <hi rend="italic">Burney</hi>.&#x2014; I will come to you one of these days, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on a friday or thursday; and have a bit of dialogue and consultation again.</p>
<p>For the rest I get on <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than was ever heard of in Literary or other History; and do not mean to go out of Town this autumn at all, but to stay at home and if I can do no work, be at least very miserable for doing none!</p>
<p>Take care of yourself dear Forster; keep that ugly enemy at bay,&#x2014;and better times will come yet for those that deserve them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote, <date when="1854-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x201C;I have been, and am, very shaky indeed &#x2026; . / My thoughts often travel Chelseaward&#x2014;and many times I wish to see you and dear Mrs Carlyle.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I do not see any chance of my getting into the <hi rend="italic">review</hi> line again, at the present time. Far too busy otherwise; and needing, above all things, to stick close by what I have on hand,&#x2014;or alas hitherto, &#x201C;would fain <hi rend="italic">have</hi> on hand&#x201C;: that is the truer phrase!</p>
<p>If there do arise anything fitted or demanding to be uttered in the review manner, you shall certainly hear of it:&#x2014;but I ought perhaps to say withal, the very <hi rend="italic">prices</hi> you pay (30 per cent below what I refused to work <hi rend="italic">under</hi>, and always was wont to be paid, 20 years ago, in the <hi rend="italic">Edin</hi>r &#x26;c) would be a sufficient prohibition of me from the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>,&#x2014;except in cases of aggravated heterodoxy or the like, which I have no disposition towards, if I can help it.&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-133" n="29:133"/>Your last N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> seemed to me fully better than any prior one: the <hi rend="italic">Wolsey</hi> very good;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

<p>I have this moment got the Letter with <hi rend="italic">Rabener&#x2019;s</hi> Extracts &#x26;c.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent <date when="1854-07-27">27 July</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540717-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-07-17">17 July</date></ref>.</note> Thanks also for that nice basket of &#x201C;little fishes&#x201C;! Very good things there. I never heard of Rabener&#x2019;s getting his Introduction to F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> made out; there is notice of a long dialogue with <hi rend="italic">Gellert</hi>, two or three with <hi rend="italic">Gottsched;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian F&#xfc;rchtegott Gellert (<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>&#x2013;<date when="1769-00-00">69</date>), author and prof. at Leipzig; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:339&#x2013;43.

Pharsalia, <date>48 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>, where Julius Caesar defeated Pompey.</note> There are still questions; and except that the game is rather worthless, a good deal of excellent candle might still be spent in prosecuting it. I accepted your ingenious solution as the plausiblest attainable, and keep it safe, being unwilling to waste human intellect farther in such a pursuit.</p>
<p>However, there came yesterday, extracted from a late edition of the <hi rend="italic">Conversations Lexicon</hi> (later than mine of about <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, which contains no article <hi rend="italic">Guichard</hi>), the following sentence given under that Head of <hi rend="italic">Guichard:</hi> &#x201C;<foreign>Einstmals in Gespr&#xfc;ch &#xfc;ber den Centurier Ilicius, der beim Polybius, erw&#xE4;hnt wird und den der K&#xF6;nig Icilius nannte</foreign>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Polybius (<date>200?&#x2013;118? <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Greek historian whose most famous work was a history of Rome. Neuberg wrote, <date when="1854-08-03">3 Aug.</date>, with an extract from his <hi rend="italic">Conversations-Lexicon</hi> about Guichard: &#x201C;[Once in conversation over the centurion Ilicius, mentioned by Polybius, and whom the king called Icilius].&#x201C; TC noted on the letter: &#x201C;Neuberg / <hi rend="italic">Quintus Icilius</hi> (Conv.Lex&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> all).&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Conversations-Lexicon</hi>, 6 vols. (first edn.: Leipzig, <date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>&#x2013;<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>); TC&#x2019;s edition probably the 7th, 12 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note>&#x2014;which gives a new figure to the inquiry, and throws Nicolai as it were out of the game.</p>
<p>The problem now would be to find a Centurion <hi rend="italic">Ilicius</hi> in Polybius, whom the King could have misnamed Icilius;&#x2014;or <foreign><hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi></foreign> would do equally well, and be still more likely as an origin for Guichard&#x2019;s nickname. But alas on going to Donne<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Bodham Donne.</note> yesterday with this discovery, and trying all his editions of Polybius (the French Folard and the Greek Schweigh&#xE4;user)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Histoire de Polybe</hi>, trans. Vincent Thuiller with commentary by Jean Charles de Folard, 6 vols. (Paris, <date when="1727-00-00">1727</date>&#x2013;<date when="1730-00-00">30</date>).

(Leipzig, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">95</date>).</note> there is nowhere <pb id="pg-29-138" n="29:138"/>in the Indexes such a name as either Icilius or Ilicius; and as of course there cannot be any talk of Pharsalia &#x26;c in Polybius, we are thrown out into the beach again, and remain almost more helpless than before!</p>
<p>Far be it from me to wish or even permit you to search into dim old Books for such a waif as this <hi rend="italic">Ilicius</hi> the extremely insignificant Centurion (if he were even that, or were anything) of 2000 years ago: only I could not but report the new phasis of the riddle to you; and will say, If you do ever in Polybius or elsewhere come upon such a name, pray mark it down, and give me notice.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donaldson replied, <date when="1854-08-09">9 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;It seems to me that the statement in the Conversations Lexicon is merely a conjecture&#x2014;I might say, a piece of guess-work. For the name Ilicius does not exist, at least so far as I know. And certainly it is more likely that the confusion in Frederick&#x2019;s mind was produced by the similar sounds of Quintus Icilius &#x26; Quintus C&#xe6;cilius than by a transposition of letters like that in Icilius &#x26; Ilicius. If, contrary to my expectations, I should ever fall in with the name Ilicius I will at once let you know. And as there never was a Quintus Icilius either in or out of the Roman army-list, I am still convinced that Frederick wished to stereotype his own blunder, &#x26; to create, for the first time an officer of that name.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>We are here all autumn; nearly drowned with rain at present; and not in any respect too triumphantly circumstanced. If you ever come to Town in these months, in all likelihood we are to be found here.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>Will you come and dine with us tomorrow (Tuesday); nobody to be here; the hour &#x201C;5 &#xBD; for 6.&#x201C; We will expect you if we hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>.</p>
<p>The Quintus Ilicius of the Convers<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> Lexicon would do extremely well (and I fancied actually we had got hold of the solution at last)&#x2014;only unhappily there is no such name as either Ilicius or Icilius to be found in the Index of <hi rend="italic">Polybius</hi> either Greek or French; and, what is bad too, it cannot have been about the Battle of <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> the two moderns were talking (which Nicolai reports it to have been, Nicolai an exact man who heard it from Guichard himself),&#x2014;nor of Pharsalia; Polybius being dead and gone before that happened. To our Librarian<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. B. Donne.</note> moreover, who is a bit of a scholar, it seems doubtful whether <hi rend="italic">Ilicius</hi> was a roman name at all.&#x2014; So that, on the whole, we are still at sea: and unless some German <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gelehrter</hi></foreign> [scholar] will help us to a solution, I see no prospect of settling the miserable little riddle. Positively (as matters go) there ought to have been <hi rend="italic">Theses</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dissertations</hi> upon it before now!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I wish you knew of anybody that could give me a sound opinion about the <pb id="pg-29-139" n="29:139"/><hi rend="italic">present</hi> practice of Prussian Law; and the real result Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> had upon it by his strenuous exertions on that behalf.</p>
<p>The little Statistic Book will do me excellent service in its degree: many thanks for it;&#x2014;n.b. it was an ounce over-weight by post: weigh always!</p>
<p>For genealogy the Conv. Lex<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is good enough in details: but the open legible general <hi rend="italic">List of Births and Deaths</hi> is oftenest what I want in that matter.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Yesterday morning Lord Goderich, from whom came the enclosed little Document, informed me Lord De Grey had been kind enough to write to you about Sir Thomas Robinson&#x2019;s Papers, on my behalf.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Goderich wrote, <date when="1854-08-24">24 Aug.</date>, from Newby Hall, nr. Ripon: &#x201C;You will remember, perhaps, asking me some time ago, whether there were any papers or letters of Sir Thomas Robinson&#x2019;s in the possession of my Father or of Lord de Grey connected with his Embassy to Vienna in the last century &#x2026; . Lord de Grey tells me that he is not very sure what papers he has in his House in London, but he thinks that there must be some relating to Sir Thomas Robinson.&#x201C; TC could use them, he wrote, and he had &#x201C;written to Mr Martin, who takes charge of his Library, begging him to look over the papers in St. James&#x2019;s Square &#x2026; and to afford you all the information and assistance he can.&#x201C; TC apparently replied since Lord Goderich wrote again, <date when="1854-08-30">30 Aug.</date>, saying that he was pleased the papers would be useful. Sir Thomas Robinson (<date when="1695-00-00">1695</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>), 1st baron Grantham, ambassador at Vienna, <date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740-00-00">40</date>, Lord Goderich&#x2019;s great grandfather. Thomas Philip de Grey (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11565"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Earl de Grey, was the grandson of Sir Thomas, and Lord Goderich&#x2019;s uncle.</note></p>
<p>Tho&#x2019; the Papers in question touch only, as it were, on a corner of my present pursuits, and I cannot expect to get very much light out of them for myself, yet I shall be glad of what there is; and certainly, on quite general grounds, they are an object of historical interest, and ought to be at least examined, sorted, and carefully reposited, for their own sake.</p>
<p>I shall be much obliged if, when you have had time to examine the matter, you will let me know what success you have had; and appoint me a meeting to consult farther what is to be done.</p>

<p>I write a word for my poor Brother to ask your attendance on Wednesday morning at the funeral <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> her whom he has lost. The hour of <hi rend="italic">Starting</hi> from this House (N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 21 Westbourne Place) is 10 a.m. Wednesday <date when="1854-08-30">30th</date>;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phoebe Carlyle had died in childbirth, <date when="1854-08-26">26 Aug.</date> TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;A blazing hot day, now noon: I am just returned from the last act of one of the saddest tragedies,&#x2014;burial of my poor sister-in-law &#x2026; a widow of good family and circumstances, whom he had known at Rome &#x2026; . She was 4 or 5 months gone in the family way; but full of life, vigour, and locomotion:&#x2014;a good prudent cheerful woman, whom it was very easy to live with; whose plain, natural, wholesome ways were gradually gaining upon me more and more. John and she ran about in all directions; seeking houses, seeing sights: they had both been used long to a traveling roaming life &#x2026; . On Thursday the week before last &#x2026; they had gone together into the Watford region, seeking houses; were in the N.W. Railway not far from Harrow, when some alarm <hi rend="italic">and</hi> imminent danger of a collision occurred; there was probably no collision (only the grinding off of handles &#x26;c from their carriages, by the trucks of a luggage-train out of its place); but her terror (tho&#x2019; John seems to have behaved well) was great,&#x2014;pale &#x26;c, and trembled for some time after. Next day she complained of nothing, was at Wandsworth looking after a house, was here in the evening: neither on the second morning (Saturday <date when="1854-08-19">19<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>) did she complain of anything; but in the afternoon she was suddenly seized with fits, successive violent fits wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> proved to be of a hysterical nature, and c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be stopt for about 30 hours after,&#x2014;not in fact, tho&#x2019; the Physicians did not regard it, till the energies of life itself were worn out. What a week! &#x2026; On Saturday she bore, without difficulty, quite on the sudden, a dead child; the Doctors then tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it was surely now all well, and we were out of danger. Messages came hither once or twice &#x2026; all of a hopeful character;&#x2014;suddenly ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> nine p.m. came a last message that she was gone; she had fallen into a kind of faint, or partial fit (too weak now to have a whole fit), lay so for about an hour, when life itself fled, and all was over,&#x2014;I have not in my time been near such a tragedy before. An amiable good woman, to whom in life (privately) I was perhaps hardly just in my estimate of her; so <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> to be happy &#x2026; . Two of her little boys sat today in the carriage with John and me; weeping now and then, as only the young can do, sacred tears &#x2026; . My poor brother has been painful to contemplate, all this while; not sad only but worse. He has slept here ever since her death.&#x201C;</note> so that you have to be here <hi rend="italic">sharp</hi> by that hour,&#x2014;sooner than the hour is not necessary.</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There came a Letter for you this morning; which, having to go out to look over certain old Ambassador-Papers (in Lord de Grey&#x2019;s, St James&#x2019;s Square), I put in my pocket; intending, when I should have finished, to carry it over to the Athenaeum, and there add a word before despatching it. Unluckily the clock struck five while I was still among my old Papers; I ran to the Club, could hardly find a Pen there, and had to despatch your Letter with merely a stamp stuck on it.&#x2014; This will explain the bare state it was in.</p>
<p>Your Note to me with the two inclosed came yesternight; delivered me by Piper as I went out after dinner. I am very glad you are getting quieted down in that retirement after so sad an excitation; and are all doing well there.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Leamington.</note> You will need much serious reflexion; and many things will rise on you more clearly the better you are left alone with yourself.&#x2014; As for me, I must not think of the Country this year; all travelling and changing is quite formidable and forbidden to me.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-143" n="29:143"/>Last night I walked out to the Brompton Cemetery;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Phoebe was buried.</note> the sun just setting when I got to the place. All is still and smooth <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> hushed up into eternal rest. I sat down on the stone near by, for a little while, and thought painfully of many things.</p>
<p>Jane got all her &#x201C;sheets&#x201C; &#x26;c she says,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540828-JWC-IC-01">JWC to IC, <date when="1854-08-28">28 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;wishes she could get much <hi rend="italic">else</hi> that has gone from her on this sad occasion! Two nights ago she was taken not <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">threatened</hi> with illness; I sat with her for an hour till improvement appeared;&#x2014;she burst into a passion of tears, thinking of all that sad avalanche of death. She is very weak ever since,&#x2014;but I suppose gathering herself again, in spite of the unfavourable climate &#x26; time. Our kindest regards to the poor little Boys.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur and William, the two youngest Watt boys. Henry was at sea and Tom at school in Germany.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry I missed you today: I had gone to look at a mass of old 
German-Ambassador Papers (Sir Tho<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Robinson of Vienna&#x2019;s, the now Lord de Grey&#x2019;s grandfather), which will perhaps yield some fraction of result one day; I did not get home till near six.</p>
<p>You must not go to Germany without seeing me,&#x2014;unless you are very busy indeed. I am at home, I think, every night this week, except Thursday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC writes on Tues.</note> and shall be glad of you at tea.&#x2014; Never mind that scribbled rubbish I gave you: it really is hardly of the slightest moment whether it ever be copied; don&#x2019;t let it bother you at all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wrapped in a page of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of <date when="1854-09-04">4 Sept. 1854</date>, TC encloses a sketch of Ludwig the Springer, graf von Schauenburg (d. <date when="1123-00-00">1123</date>) which he was unable to use in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, and Neuberg&#x2019;s copy of R&#xfc;diger of Manesse, <hi rend="italic">Sammlung von Minnesinger</hi>, ed.

In notes on him, TC wrote: &#x201C;Why does nobody know the death he died? B&#xfc;nau [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:83n] gives 3 or 4 accounts (&#x2026; and there is in Mentzel [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:91n] still another) as if they were all of equal value: surely <hi rend="italic">somebody</hi> must have known, many thousands known, and all were not <hi rend="italic">alike</hi> near it that wrote upon it [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:83&#x2013;84] &#x2026; .

(<date when="1854-09-01">01 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1854</date>).&#x201C; In further notes on the Holy Roman Empire of about the same date, TC wrote about the superiority of former times to the present, which aims &#x201C;to consecrate their so-called Crystal Palaces, inaugurate their Hudson Statues&#x2014;and call that the pleasure of the Lord. Not for them to doubt but a &#x2018;Glass box of never-imagined Size,&#x2019; filled with select spiritual marine stores and well-devised cooking-apparatus, is verily at last the patent road to Heaven, New-Jerusalem for the million, and visible advent of the Millenium, over which men can and must sing <foreign>Domine dimittis</foreign> [Lord, let us depart], and comfortably call for dinner at 3/6 a head, port included &#x2026; . (How I fall, from every <hi rend="italic">place</hi>, as by an invisible proclivity, into this strain of growling &#x26; satirizing! That is not what I most want to do just now. Oh Heaven, Oh Heaven!)&#x201C; At the end of more notes about this time on early German emperors, TC wrote: &#x201C;I seemed so ill in writing down any tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I had: ah me! The reason doubtless is, my th<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is not <hi rend="italic">ripe;</hi> I have not yet got it matured into utterability&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x201C; (MS: Yale).</note></p>
<p>Moir was here the other night (Chapman&#x2019;s man);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Macrae Moir.</note> but I do not think much good is to be done with him at present.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>In this week&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> you will notice the announcement of the death of our poor Doctor&#x2019;s Wife:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1854-09-05">5 Sept.</date>, announced her death on <date when="1854-08-26">26 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;Phoebe Elizabeth Hough Fowler &#x2026; wife of J. A. Carlyle, M.D.&#x201C;</note> I know not whether he, in his great hurry and sorrowful confusion, may have written to you on the subject, nor is he just now beside me to be asked;&#x2014;wherefore I will write you a little word myself, having long had it in view to write, tho&#x2019; I did not expect so sorrowful a topic would occur among us.</p>
<p>John and his Wife, as you probably have heard, quitted Moffat in June last, having looked over many houses in Dumfriesshire, but found none that would suit as a residence for them: they came up hither, and settled in Lodgings within a mile of us, intending, as we could guess, to make choice of some residence in these neighbourhoods. Poor Phoebe, a very cheerful quiet <pb id="pg-29-145" n="29:145"/>and good lady, with whom it was easy to live pleasantly, used to come often down in the summer evenings with John: they ran about at a great rate thro&#x2019; the day, &#x201C;looking for houses,&#x201C; also &#x201C;seeing sights,&#x201C; for she was of a travelling roaming turn like her husband, and they did not seem in any haste to fix upon a house,&#x2014;tho&#x2019;, as she was five or six months gone with child, we always silently thought it altogether desirable they should be <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>. However, she was uncommonly strong; had been used to easy confinements; cared for no fatigue; and ran about, he and she, as if there had been nothing ahead. Alas, alas, this security has been sadly punished, if it was a crime! Some three weeks ago, they were in a railway, 15 or 20 miles off town (going about &#x201C;houses,&#x201C; as usual), when an alarm was given about some collision or accident likely to befal; and I believe there was imminent danger, but by the skill of their engineer no harm, or none to speak of was done,&#x2014;none except the terror itself, which the Doctor strove well to moderate, I believe, and behaved very wisely in, but which in her tender state proved <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, and equal to the wreck of the world, for poor Phoebe! It had <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> her child, now in its 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> month; and brought on all the sad tragedy that followed. For two days more, Phoebe made nothing of it, but ran about as usual. But about noon of the third day (Saturday) she was suddenly seized with fits, hysteria fits, and had the most frightful continued series of such for 30 or 48 hours,&#x2014;in fact till the whole strength of life was worn out:&#x2014;so that, tho&#x2019; the Doctors (skilful men) gave us good hopes all along, and she even <hi rend="italic">bore</hi> her dead child without difficulty, and was quite clear and cheery in mind, and to apearance suffered only from weakness, and we thought the <hi rend="italic">danger</hi> quite past, it had been quite otherwise appointed; and suddenly, on Saturday evening, a week after her seizure, and only a few hours after the birth, she sank away among their hands, sheer weakness dragging her down; and without pain, was gone to her rest forever.</p>
<p>This is the brief history of the tragedy we have had: one of the saddest scenes, or perhaps the very saddest I ever was concerned with. We all thought this coming child, and this good and prudent and cheerful Wife might prove of the most marked advantage to all parties concerned; and now it has suddenly all vanished; and our poor Brother is mournfully thrown loose, and his poor Life-partner crushed down in that overwhelming manner. What he will do next for a life-arrangement I think he does not yet even much consider: he is busied with many things connected with his late Phoebe&#x2019;s affairs and the children she already had: he went three days ago, with two of these Boys (the only two in England) and one Dr Hunter a friend he has, to Leamington (a quiet Watering place 100 miles off this), there to repose for a week before going farther; there he still is. He bears well, seems stout in health too: but is of course much flurried, shocked and confused by the sad change that has overtaken him.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-146" n="29:146"/>The rest of us, so far as I hear or understand, are all in our usual way of health;&#x2014;Jane and I <hi rend="italic">here</hi> thro&#x2019; the solitary autumn, which proves none of the healthiest hitherto. But we could not think of the bother of travelling &#x26; lumbering about in the weak humour we are in. Besides I wanted much to get forward with <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, a sad chapter in my history of late. And alas it does not much prosper with me, tho&#x2019; I still try and try. Courage, dear Brother; let us hold on, and stand to it faithfully to the last!&#x2014; I have <hi rend="italic">found</hi> today the actual little bit of Writing <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> once to Liverpool, and returned upon me; you receive it now, after 11 years:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s farewell letter, <date when="1843-06-23">23 June 1843</date>, that missed Alick at Liverpool; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430623-TC-AC-01"><sic>16:213&#x2013;14</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1843-06-23">23 June 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have not the heart to look into it; and perhaps you too had better throw it into the fire!

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>You are very good to remember me unworthy;&#x2014;you are as good as ever, I perceive; and surely my heart thanks you for that same. For if there be nothing in <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for me, there cannot readily be much in the rest of the Human Species for me, in the days that now are!</p>
<p>I have not written; because it was better not; because there was nothing pleasant that I could write. Things go much against me, without and within. Things great and small, an accumulation of painful things, have come upon me in late times,&#x2014;have crushed me quite low indeed; and admonished me to go into the corner and say nothing, till I had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> a little better. There I still sit; unwilling to make complaints, unable to do much else; and pretty faithful only to one duty, that of keeping well apart from all mortals, and consuming my own smoke&#x2014;so much as possible.</p>
<p>We did not get to Addiscombe; alas, no: Heaven opens its gates in vain; if the Other Place have already been too busy with us! I thought once I might at least have got out occasionally on a Saturday, have dined next day on brown bread and milk (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have needed no &#x201C;cookery&#x201C;), and come home refreshed <pb id="pg-29-147" n="29:147"/>from the green solitudes on Monday morning: but even this I have not done; such were the weaknesses, such the impediments, too heavy for the worn-out soul. Perhaps it is almost just as well? I have one thing fixed deep into my mind, where so much else is dark and doubtful: that unless I can get a little more work out of myself, there is not any hope for me; no good possible, in this world or the next. &#x201C;Up thou weakling sluggard!&#x201C; I have often said to myself: &#x201C;one effort more, some work while thou art still alive&#x2014;there is deep enough sleep, and long rest coming, not far off now!&#x201C; That is excellent doctrine; and I do struggle to fulfil it, here in my garret, with the bad tools I have; unhappily with no great success as yet, indeed with the worst success; tenacity in trying being hitherto my only merit.&#x2014; On the whole you may pray for me, my Lady; you may, if your heart is in a merciful mood. Perhaps I shall have grown better before you return, at the end of the month? We will hope so. The poisonous heat of the weather, at least, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is one great evil, is visibly going down.</p>
<p>I had to write to you (or thought of it) about Lord Clarendon, and some admission to the State-Paper Office where I want to look at some small things. But I will not today,&#x2014;nay why not today? I can write the particulars on another slip of paper, and have them with you. <closer><salute>And so <foreign>adieu</foreign> for this day.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Note which I got from Jean this morning, in answer to an inquiry of mine: as you perhaps have not heard of the pain she has been in from that <hi rend="italic">whitloe</hi> of hers, I send you the last account of it. I never had a whitloe; but it seems there is often a fierce misery connected with that insignificant looking thing.&#x2014; I also send Ker&#x2019;s Letter about the Niggers; which may entertain your thoughts for a moment, after the various rounds it has made.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alan Ker (ca. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440719-TC-JWC-01"><sic>18:146</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1844-07-19">19 July 1844</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520202-JWC-ET-01"><sic>27:28</sic><corr>JWC to ET, <date when="1852-02-02">2 Feb. 1852</date></corr></ref>), in the judicial service in Antigua since <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; presumably the same letter forwarded, <date when="1852-08-00">Aug. 1852</date>, when JWC wrote that TC would &#x201C;find in Ker&#x2019;s letter something about the Blacks worth your reading&#x2014;as it corroborates your own views of them&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520805-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:210</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-08-05">5 Aug. 1852</date></corr></ref>).</note> You may <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> it now, and let it cease.</p>
<p>There has nothing new happened here, except that I have caught a whiff of cold last night; and likewise for some days (what is not at all <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, unfortunately) <pb id="pg-29-148" n="29:148"/>have been getting on very ill with my work;&#x2014;arrived again <hi rend="italic">at a cleft stick</hi> with it, in fact. I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get on; there is no resource whatever but that!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We shall be anxious to hear what you decide on after Leamington is done. I suppose, contrary to Mr Blake&#x2019;s advice,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; or possibly the Blake introduced to TC by William Graham; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460218-TC-JAC-01"><sic>20:124</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-02-18">18 Feb. 1846</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460303-TC-JAC-01"><sic>135</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-03-03">3 March 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> you will find it better to get your sad work <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>, and that there is even a relief in the effort to wind it up.&#x2014; I have not even seen Chorley since that sad day: I rather avoid seeing anybody just now; there are few that can do anything but (unconsciously) fret and derange me more or less, and <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> my worthlessness and sorrow.</p>
<p>The announcement of the Death was in both the Dumfries Newspaper;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> I wrote a Note to Alick, chiefly almost exclusively on that subject, not knowing but perhaps he might be still unapprised.</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother. We expect a Note from you one of these days. Do not dwell on the dark side of things,&#x2014;indeed I think that is not your habit;&#x2014;if we look with <hi rend="italic">sincere</hi> earnest eyes upon the saddest thing, we shall find solemnities and blessed admonitions in it withal.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I am afraid your <hi rend="italic">whitlow</hi> is still in a troublesome way; I begin to long again for the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> on the Newspaper, which are still wanting. Pray dictate without delay another word to me by Anne.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her da.</note> No matter how short; just to tell me how you are getting on. I am in hopes the Surgeon may be <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> as to that of &#x201C;bits of the bone&#x201C; coming away; I hope he cannot certainly <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that! At any rate tell me; a single line once in the two or three days, till you have your own hand again, would be very welcome;&#x2014;or, not to trouble you too much, let me say &#x201C;once in the week, and as short as you like.&#x201C;</p>
<p>The enclosed Letter came, thro&#x2019; us, the other day; and has returned this morning, with directions that it be forwarded to you, as now. Jack in the interim had quitted Leamington (the Boys being gone), and run across the country to Malvern, where a &#x201C;Mrs Wansey&#x201C; lives,&#x2014;a kind of Cousin<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> of his poor Phoebe&#x2019;s;&#x2014;he writes me the shortest Note you ever saw from her house (along with this Canada Letter), just about returning to Leaming,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">from</hi> <pb id="pg-29-149" n="29:149"/>which place he will write. Poor soul, he is quite <hi rend="italic">disanchored</hi> again; and I daresay is floating about in a very uncertain way. What he will do is very uncertain to me; to himself perhaps almost more.</p>
<p>Alick writes with a mournful tone, yet not an uncomfortable one; and is struggling away as usual.&#x2014; I myself get on as ill as need be; I mean in regard to doing work,&#x2014;which would be the solace for all miseries, and without which there is no solace. I cannot see my way at all, at all; I am <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> till I do see it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In notes of about this date on the Teutonic knights (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:90&#x2013;99), TC wrote about something they did valiantly: &#x201C;no details to be had ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it; absolutely none &#x2026; did anybody ever see such a business? If I could <hi rend="italic">teach</hi> people this, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a &#x2018;teacher&#x2019;!

But I won&#x2019;t yield either; no! In fact the <hi rend="italic">grand</hi> &#x201C;impediment&#x201C; is my own weakness; the fault, as ever, lies with <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

He hoped John would write.</note> I despatched a Letter yesterday from somebody at C&#xF6;then in Germany. This morning I hoped we should have heard from you, as &#x201C;Thursday&#x201C; was the end of your projected Leamington stay;&#x2014;I conclude you will still stay there a few days longer; we guess farther that you may be away, on some Cheshire or other piece of duty, just at present,&#x2014;the rather as I have not heard anything farther of Alick&#x2019;s news from Canada which were forwarded the other day.&#x2014; Write a few words to poor old Grahame: he means most kindly, tho&#x2019; his ways are grown a little wearisome, poor old man.</p>
<p>Darwin had an attack of Dysentery since he returned hither; but it did not last, nor seem (yesterday when Jane saw him) to have produced any mischief, tho&#x2019; rather alarming in these days of epidemic. He and the Wedgwoods<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hensleigh and Fanny Wedgwood.</note> were to be off on this day, to Shrewsbury and the adjoining regions.</p>
<p>I am getting on as ill as possible with my work! The strength has gone quite out of me,&#x2014;under the load of so many years. Heaven help me, I shall lose my <pb id="pg-29-150" n="29:150"/>wits if I can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> nothing more; there is no use farther in my existing at all!&#x2014; Plumbers came to mend my window; hammered away for two days, yesternight came rain, and the window&#x2014;leaks precisely as before. Never mind, never mind.</p>
<p>I hear nothing from Jean; and this morning the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> comes with <hi rend="italic">no</hi> strokes upon it. From which I infer that the whitloe is still in a baddish way.&#x2014;&#x2014; I should like to hear, deliberately, what you are thinking, doing, my dear Brother, in this wild turn your affairs have suddenly taken: if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> in anything help you, you do not doubt how ready I should be! <closer><salute>Good be with you

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have this minute got your Letter,&#x2014;came by the one-o&#x2019;clock delivery, I suppose;&#x2014;and have already locked it in my drawer, not without a sad enough feeling. Of course I will sacredly attend to it, should the chance, which is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> according to the order of nature, ever summon me: may Heaven forbid!&#x2014; Meanwhile you will do well to put the arrangement into some authentic law-binding form so soon as ever you are a little in composure again.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear of your going to Mr Hostage&#x2019;s:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hostage (d. <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>) and his wife, who probably lived in Northwich, Cheshire.</note> you will at once be among good people that can sympathize with your loss (and encourage you to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> about the past and the future), as well as start you upon <hi rend="italic">acting</hi> what things are necessary in consequence of it, which latter is your chief solacement just now. I also think clearly you will do well not to withdraw your hand from those poor Boys; but to reserve for yourself, with due caution, and regard to all the intricacies of the situation, the privilege of interfering with any help that may be possible to you. But think it over on all sides, before you practically determine the <hi rend="italic">How;</hi> it is possible enough there may troubles arise, one is not <pb id="pg-29-151" n="29:151"/>certain of the contrary in any condition or position; and your power of extricating yourself from all misconception ought always to be complete.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle faithfully continued to look after his four stepchildren.</note></p>
<p>Today I had to send you a word at any rate: Jean&#x2019;s Letter, which came this morning, being ordered to be forwarded to you. She does not seem to be <hi rend="italic">well</hi> at all, with that finger of hers; nor to be well related to her Doctor which also is an uncomfortable thing. I know nothing about the man: but may not <hi rend="italic">slitting open</hi> the finger be really a necessary operation? Or is it, in any case, only a <hi rend="italic">furthersome</hi> one; the wound only healing more slowly if it is not done? If you can give her any clear advice on that matter&#x2014; But in fact I suppose nobody can who had not seen the case with his eyes. She might go to the Gill, and amuse herself <hi rend="italic">with reading</hi>?&#x2014; I hope you will write to her one of these days. To us you will write when you go to Cheshire, at latest. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate Brother</salute></closer></p>

<p>What stuff the sons and daughters of men are made of, and how the Empyrean and the Cloaca Maxima<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Main sewer of ancient Rome.</note> combine in their existence!</p>

<p>I cannot find you at home;&#x2014;I think I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> you today too, after I had called; but I was not in luck. I had a trifling message also to deliver, to this effect:</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Many thanks for your application to the Foreign Secretary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Clarendon.</note> on my behalf. I have yet heard nothing from his Lordship; suppose he may be out of Town, or may fancy I am out of Town. Today I send him a Note, requesting an extension of my range, so that it may embrace the Austrian Despatches of the Period as well. Till lately, I fancied <hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas Robinson&#x2019;s</hi> Papers (now in the hands of Lord de Grey, and accessible to me) would serve for that Austrian department: but these de Grey Papers I find, on examining them, to contain chiefly Letters <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Sir T. Robinson; the Letters <hi rend="italic">from</hi>, about some of which I am curious, must be in the State-Paper Office. So I have written to Lord Cl<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. I had a certain difficulty in writing to him: for it occurs to my mind he, good amiable man, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> acted rather a weak part towards me,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-29-153" n="29:153"/>believed mere lies,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably about TC&#x2019;s opinion of his vice-regency in Ireland and TC&#x2019;s relations with Gavan Duffy; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490706-TC-LC-01"><sic>24:101</sic><corr>TC to LC, <date when="1849-07-06">6 July 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> and on the basis of mere lies and <hi rend="italic">zeros</hi>, withdrawn his human regards from me, which I could have repaid with human d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and am now forbidden:&#x2014;but perhaps I am well served, after all, now when I think of the whole matter. So let it rest. His Lordship will grant me the Admission required; and that alone is the essential at present. Human creatures do make innumerable mistakes about one another: that is a thing I discovered some time ago!</p>
<p>Today there came a charming letter from Lord A<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> full of deer-stalkings, otter-fisheries (presided over by a certain Queen of the Lakes), and breezy with the fresh air of the Highland Hills: to which I will certainly answer;&#x2014;and in the meanwhile you can tell his Lordship that the question of the <hi rend="italic">Beard</hi> is under serious deliberation; that I do greatly envy him his freeflowing noble beard; and that, in fact, the Beard-movement, if it is seriously going on, may count always on my poor furtherance so far as that will carry it.</p>
<p>Lady Sandwich called here last Sunday; but unluckily we were out: Jane has since seen her, reports well of her spirits and appearance; I have tried twice, but was not successful either time. A speculation is afloat of her coming to us on Saturday night perhaps, to meet the two little Goderichs (who are so far on their way to Pau, and the Pyrenees region, for the winter): nobody else but they; so Lady S. must be <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>, if she is to come; &#x201C;too insignificant to write about,&#x201C;&#x2014;that is the law of the case! I continue to like this little Goderich; there is a certain <hi rend="italic">authenticity</hi>, composure, and ingenuous veracity about him, which promises well, in a solid, if perhaps limited way: his Socialisms &#x26;c are settling fast into the right pitch, and will do him good, not ill.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was liberal M.P. for Huddersfield. A follower of F. D. Maurice&#x2019;s Christian Socialist movement, he had written a Christian Socialist tract, <hi rend="italic">The Duty of the Age</hi> (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), which Maurice at first suppressed as too radical in its argument for democracy.</note> He is brown as a berry with Yorkshire sunburning; and has flung away the ghastly H. of Commons air. Let us hope well of the good young man!</p>
<p>I myself sit aloft here, in nearly utter solitude; &#x201C;sparrow-like, companionless, on the housetop, alone,&#x201C; as the Hebrew Psalmist has it:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ps.102:7.</note> to appearance, I might do a great deal of work; but except it be the old trade of burning <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>, there comes, with all my effort, little or nothing into view hitherto. Woe&#x2019;s me! But <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>, to almost immeasurable extent, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> to be burnt: that also is a bit of one&#x2019;s work; and indeed I often feel as if that were like to be nearly all now left me. Let us see, at any rate, that that be done, then! Fredk. and continents of waste Brandenburg <hi rend="italic">sand</hi>, wherein no green thing will ever grow: alas, what is to become of me? The Fates perhaps will yet open me a way.</p>
<p>You are not coming then till the middle of October! Shall I pray for heavy <pb id="pg-29-154" n="29:154"/>rains to drive you home sooner? I feel as if it would be a great thing to see that face again; which in fact it will. We have had, as you say, a dreadful time. Unusually bad nerves; disease<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cholera.</note> all round us (nothing to be done but determine not to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> of it) and then that saddest of all the tragedies I have ever been so near.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phoebe Carlyle&#x2019;s death.</note> A healthy, cheerful, innocently limited soul; wanted so very little; that little so sternly denied; quenched in cataracts of swift destruction,&#x2014;ah me!&#x2014; I will write to Lord A. soon. <closer><salute>God bless you ever, dear Lady. /</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Till this morning, when My Lady&#x2019;s Letter came, I never doubted but you were in the Bear&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Ellice who had a home at Glenquoich, Inverness.</note> country, &#x201C;to go on Wednesday,&#x201C; not to return till probably monday. I am in the greater haste to despatch my Note; which was meant at any rate for this day.</p>
<p>You give us a most lucid and interesting glimpse of your Hyperborean life. I know those misty Highland Hills, with their threatening vapour on them, those damp moaning winds; and then the rapid retreat, and the little brooks kindling all into silvery visibility on the black Hillside,&#x2014;which latter sight it is best to enjoy from the <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> of the windows! Stanley&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward John, Lord Stanley.</note> waiting in vain, for five hours, to have a shot; and going, like the Primeval Serpent, on his belly:&#x2014;would he take so much trouble, or the half of it, to pay the whole National Debt, for instance, or to reduce the Czar of Russia to a Pillar of Salt,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nicholas I; Gen.19:26.</note> and make all friends of progress happy for evermore? Not a bit of it.&#x2014; I am shocked to find My Lady fishes <hi rend="italic">with an Otter;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A kind of fishing tackle used by poachers.</note> I imagined she went out with rod and fly, in a Christian manner, and disdained such associates! I myself have no game here, of any kind, except it be spiders in the garden, where I go to smoke; of which, being disgusted at last beyond endurance (for they are black spiders, and in size like robin-redbreasts, such spiders and so numerous as I never saw), I have killed near upon 50 brace, I should think. A sad operation, but an indispensable one. What an opulence of life there is in this Universe, especially among the more contemptible branches of its population! &#x201C;You cannot kill a fly,&#x201C; they say, &#x201C;but there will come forty to its funeral.&#x201C; Which is true also of other things, in the metaphorical sense, to a very sad degree!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-155" n="29:155"/>But what shall I say of the grand question, the Beard?

Really the Beard-movement does proceed, I perceive.

That latter evil will not apply to me. Nor do I think practically the little boys will much interfere. Moustaches are already very abundant; and one young gent (of the <hi rend="italic">gent</hi> species) carries a beard in these streets, black, immense, sticking out from the chin of him like a kitchen kettle. Consider therefore what you will do!</p>

<p>On getting your first letter dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2014;before reading a word of it&#x2014;I <pb id="pg-29-156" n="29:156"/><hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it was about poor Mary;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mills.</note> that it was to tell me she was dying or dead. for, you see; glad as I should be to hear from you oftener, you never write to me &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all from yourself&#x2014;out of your own head</hi>&#x201C; (as the children say) and of poor old Mary at her age, any <hi rend="italic">news</hi> could be hardly good news. If you had not mentioned that she was not in need of money, I should have written instantly to beg you to supply what was needed. As it was; being in the first heavy stupidity of a great cold in my head, I waited till I should be in a clearer mood, and also rather expecting a second letter from you to the purport of the one now come. It is well the poor old kindhearted creature has had so gentle an end&#x2014;at her age <hi rend="italic">life</hi> could scarcely be a blessing and yet she seemed content to hold to it such as it was, and so one wished her to live&#x2014; Besides I have always felt her a sort of living legacy from my darling Mother, and now even that poor little tie is broken! and there is one heart fewer in the world of those <hi rend="italic">who loved</hi> my mother and gratefully revered her memory.</p>
<p>I have not a doubt that all was done for her that could be done to prolong her existence and to make her end soft&#x2014; I have the most implicit reliance on your kindness of heart and on your wish also to supply my Mothers place to poor Mary&#x2014;God bless you for all the troubles you have taken about her. You will tell me when convenient about her funeral, and if there be any thing to pay after her own money was expended. I had hoped to see the poor soul again before she departed from this earth where her place was so mean and yet so tolerable thro the contented grateful spirit in which she accepted it. I should have liked to hear her speak of my Mother&#x2014; But my last look at her innocent face was taken the day I stept out at the Templand gate<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1841-07-00">July 1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410724-JWC-JF-01"><sic>13:197</sic><corr>JWC to JF, <date when="1841-07-24">24 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;never to find a home there again. And how many others are gone since then!</p>
<p>We have staid quietly here this whole year, in spite of the Cholera<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The official figure for deaths during the cholera epidemic (which lasted about 10 weeks) was 6,120. In the week ending <date when="1854-09-02">2 Sept.</date> there were 1,267 deaths in London, but by <date when="1854-09-13">13 Sept.</date> the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> had announced that the epidemic was decreasing.</note>&#x2014; But indeed what use is there in flying from Cholera in a town, when it finds its way into such fresh open places as about Ecclefechan&#x2014; It was very sad to walk out her<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> for many weeks&#x2014;in a single half mile of street I often met as many as six funerals. I think I have not written to you, have I, since M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> John Carlyle&#x2019;s death&#x2014; That was a horrid business&#x2014; It looked such a <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> of a Woman and Child. Of course she was to die&#x2014; Yet humanly viewed one could not help believing if she had staid at home and taken the ordinary cares of herself that her situation required, she might have born a living child and done well. But her constant excursions on railways and sight seeings and house huntings <pb id="pg-29-157" n="29:157"/>seemed to us often even <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the <hi rend="italic">accident</hi> which brought on her mortal illness, a sheer tempting of providence.</p>
<p>I heard from my Aunt Elizabeth<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh in Edinburgh.</note> the other day, and she sent with her letter a small book on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Grace</hi>.&#x201C; They are indefatigable in their efforts at conversion&#x2014; Except to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Convert me</hi>&#x201C; she seem to take no interest in me whatever&#x2014; Mrs George Welsh is coming to stay at Richmond with her son<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Welsh&#x2019;s mother, Margaret.</note>&#x2014;thro&#x2019; the winter at least&#x2014; He is a good and clever lad and a kind son as ever was made&#x2014; I only wish he had more <hi rend="italic">salary</hi> to be kind with.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>You have heard I had <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the important State-Paper liberty: your Letter met me the morning after, on my sally forth into the cool sunshine in quest of heat after bathing;&#x2014;the sight of your handwriting is not a phenomenon that greets one every morning, or passes out of one&#x2019;s head at once! A thousand thanks for your assiduous goodness;&#x2014;and you may thank poor Lord Clarendon too, for doing blamelessly all that you asked him on my behalf. Yesterday I made my actual appearance in the State-Paper edifice; went thro&#x2019; certain remaining formalities; and even read a great mass of Prussian Despatches,&#x2014;with considerably more profit than I had expected from them. Tomorrow, and other days,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I see it will cost me a headache daily,&#x2014;I mean to go back. The Papers, I perceive, have never been read by any Prussian or English writer on that Period, and they tend very decidedly, especially our Ambassador Hotham&#x2019;s, to throw light on boisterous Old Friedrich Wilhelm and those &#x201C;double marriage&#x201C; businesses.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Hotham (<date when="1693-00-00">1693</date>&#x2013;<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>), 5th bart., British envoy to the Prussian court of Friedrich Wilhelm I. The &#x201C;double marriage&#x201C; affair was of Sophie Doroth&#xE9;e&#x2019;s project by which her son, Frederick, and da. Frederika Sophie Wilhelmina (<date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">58</date>) (referred to as Wilhelmina by TC in <hi rend="italic">Works;</hi> see also <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530203-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>28:26</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1853-02-03">3 Feb. 1853</date></corr></ref>), would marry Amelia Sophia Eleanora (<date when="1710-00-00">1710</date>&#x2013;<date when="1786-00-00">86</date>) and Frederick Louis (<date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751-00-00">51</date>), children of George II of Britain (<date when="1683-00-00">1683</date>&#x2013;<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:214&#x2013;21, 229&#x2013;43.</note> I found this Hotham a distinct observer, a truly able kind of man;&#x2014;he prophesied of young Frederic (then about 18) that he is likely to make a great figure in the world; I also discovered <pb id="pg-29-158" n="29:158"/>that <hi rend="italic">Ranke</hi> (who indeed is a poor broken-backed creature, in spite of his reputation) has committed one gross mistake about this Hotham, and that the old King&#x2019;s &#x201C;making a movement as if to kick him, on one occasion&#x201C; &#x26;c is the merest moonshine, and even the reverse of the truth.&#x2014;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leopold von Ranke (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>), historian, author of <hi rend="italic">Neun B&#xfc;cher preussischer Geschichte</hi>, 3 vols.

Alas, I have tried many, and find them all naught:&#x2014;some <hi rend="italic">way</hi> or other, I must be out, or else choke in a very miserable manner.&#x2014; Are the present Hothams<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beaumont Hotham (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), 3rd baron in Irish peerage, soldier and Tory M.P., or the family of his brother, Rear Adm.

<p>We suppose you are setting off for Dunrobin<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dunrobin castle, ca. 85 mi. N of Inverness, Scottish seat of the Sutherlands.</note> in a few days; after that, we hope the weather will so increase in coolness that you will be glad of Newcastle coals and southern shelter again. I can testify, Bath House still stands firm on its foundations (solid Hannah<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An Ashburton maid.</note> testifying by screens, window curtains, up or down, that she is awake within it); and indeed the mansion seems to long for you back, if fancy do not deceive me. The &#x201C;November Session,&#x201C; yes it will seem highly advisable to one humble individual, who otherwise is supremely indifferent to &#x201C;sessions&#x201C; or the want of them just now!<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning that TC would be glad of the Ashburtons&#x2019; return for the start of the parliamentary session, early <date when="1854-11-00">Nov.</date>; Parliament had been prorogued, <date when="1854-08-12">12 Aug.</date>, first to <date when="1854-10-19">19 Oct.</date>, then <date when="1854-11-16">16 Nov.</date>, and finally met, <date when="1854-12-12">12 Dec.</date>, for the queen&#x2019;s speech.</note>&#x2014; Come; and you will see beautiful sunsets here too, tho&#x2019; tinged a little with smoke. Smoke enough always, and copious descent of &#x201C;the blacks&#x201C;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smuts from smoke.</note> as heretofore: I cannot perceive <pb id="pg-29-159" n="29:159"/>that Lord Palmerston has made the least alteration in that particular;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As home sec., Palmerston had introduced and robustly supported the first successful Smoke Abatement Act, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>. It had very little effect.</note> I suppose London smoke, like the Russian Czar in virtue of his very <hi rend="italic">baseness</hi>, and near kindred to <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi>, is invincible to his Lordship,&#x2014;taking a Sebastopol from him,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British and allied troops landed in the Crimea, <date when="1854-09-14">14 Sept.</date>, intending to take Sebastopol. Palmerston was confident the campaign would be short, but in the first attack a few days later more than 3,000 allied troops were killed. The city was taken 11 months later.</note> cutting out a steeple-chimney or two, is as nothing; he merely retires a little, and has not the least notion of being &#x201C;conquered&#x201C; by the like of that! His Lordship is great, but not great enough, it would seem,&#x2014;more power to his elbow.</p>
<p>We have never yet been to the Crystal Palace or anywhere; we are silent here as if we were already in Hades; as if these hard pavements were the Asphodel meadows, and the loud dirty tumult of Cremorne and other things were the mere raging of Ixion Tantalus and Company confined to the Stygian regions all round.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cremorne House, Chelsea, popular entertainment gardens. In Greek myth, Ixion was fastened to an ever-turning wheel, and Tantalus stood up to his chin in water that drained away when he tried to drink.</note> I have not been so solitary for 20 years as since you went; hardly ever so sad of humour, but often far unhappier. Nay occasionally I feel as if this were the only sort of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> now possible for me,&#x2014;as if, in the heart of this black raging horror of an existence, there lay an element of blessedness for a man, stern as Death and stronger too, and worthier of the man. Let us <hi rend="italic">be</hi> silent, then, if that is the order; for in that too there is profit that may be precious.</p>
<p>Unluckily I make no way at all, as above indicated, in getting thro&#x2019; my Book; which must nevertheless be done, or at least ended, if this world is to continue habitable to me. Alas, alas, my heart is sad enough grim enough for writing a <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio</hi>, if I had otherwise the talent; and in this generation there is no Purgatorio, Inferno or Paradiso,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Like Dante&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Commedia Divina</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">Purgatorio, Inferno</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Paradiso</hi>.</note>&#x2014;nothing but a poor withered sceptical warehouse of Voltaire&#x2019;s Frederics and other meanly &#x201C;doleful creatures&#x201C;; whom I could find in my heart to set a coal to, rather than write about! This probably is the very central impediment in the subject I am upon.</p>
<p>By the bye, what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to become of that beautiful Picture of Fritz drumming?<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540428-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-04-28">28 April</date></ref>.</note> I declare it is a shame to have it buried as now! Probably one of the prettiest Pictures, if well seen into; and there it stood (when Jane was in Bath House last) with its <hi rend="italic">back</hi> turned to the world (and the flies), no eye getting the least good of it. I pray you advise with his Lordship where to put it, and so that one may see it now and then. I spoke to the man who did Talbotypes of me, <pb id="pg-29-160" n="29:160"/>since you went, about doing one of that Picture; which he readily undertook if you would permit. He is a <hi rend="italic">Painter</hi> (nothing of the Mechanic in him in any way) this man; and you must really lend him the Picture, for a day, to that end; he will take the strictest care of it, return it without harm, and do me a small benefit by the operation.&#x2014; When you come home will be time enough for this: my Artist (one Tait,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Tait.</note> in Queen Anne Street, Portland Place region) is at present in Weimar, still for a week or two.</p>
<p>Lady Sandwich, as you have heard, did come to us that Saturday Evening, and was very pleasant, and agreeable to old and young in our small reunion. The Goderiches are gone; they left me two Talbotypes of a pair of <hi rend="italic">Maria Theresas</hi> which they have in the North Country,&#x2014;not good for much, I am afraid, tho&#x2019; one of them was given by the <hi rend="italic">Kaiserin</hi> [Empress] herself.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Theresa (<date when="1717-00-00">1717</date>&#x2013;<date when="1780-00-00">80</date>), archduchess of Austria, wife of Francis I (<date when="1708-00-00">1708</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">65</date>), Holy Roman Emperor, who ruled in her own right.</note> Lady Sandwich was here again, last Sunday,<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1854-10-01">1 Oct.</date></note> and brought me a great <hi rend="italic">mass</hi> of Gotha Almanacs;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Almanach de Gotha</hi>, annual German pbn., founded <date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>, on royal and titled European families.</note>&#x2014;there is actually no available genealogy to be got (I fear) out of those scrubby little Books; except perhaps by taking them in block? The Lady Mama is tolerably well always; and very good and agreeable: Jane and she, in particular, seem to pull very well together. You must try to keep the good old Lady here for the future,&#x2014;if indeed &#x201C;trying&#x201C; be of any virtue!</p>
<p>Well, you must pardon an Outside barbarian; I am not disloyal to you, very far indeed from that, whatsoever your Ladyship&#x2019;s misguided mind may imagine. <closer><salute>And I still, in a secret corner, half unknown to myself, have a hope of better days under the sun. Or if even <hi rend="italic">not</hi>&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Miss Bacon</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>We are very glad to hear of you again, and that you are doing well, and getting that wild jungle of sticks victoriously tied into fagots. That is a right success, due to all faithful workers, and which nobody can deprive one of.</p>
<p>My wife cannot by any means recollect the least particular of Mrs. Spring&#x2019;s address at Hampstead, though she was once there, and saw the place with her eyes. However, she assures me it would have done nothing for your present <pb id="pg-29-161" n="29:161"/>enterprise; it was a place let (<hi rend="italic">un</hi>furnished with servants) as a whole house; was very dear, and also (as is thought) very dirty,&#x2014;not at all like what you require.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She left St. Albans in <date when="1854-10-00">Oct.</date> Mrs. Spring is unidentified.</note> Other lodgings, no doubt, are abundant in Hampstead, especially at this season of the year; but neither of us here knows specially of any, nor can Jane bethink her just at once of any person whom she could confidently consult on the matter.&#x2014;I myself do, at this moment, call to mind a certain Mrs. Dr. Wilkinson, an accomplished <hi rend="italic">American</hi> lady withal, and wife of an accomplished and truly superior man,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emma Anne Wilkinson, b. Marsh, da. of William Marsh of Diss, Norfolk, not American; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510423-JWC-EAW-01"><sic>26:67</sic><corr>JWC to EAW, <date when="1851-04-23">23 April 1851</date></corr></ref>; m., <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, James John Garth Wilkinson (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1899-00-00">99</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29427"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471113-TC-RWE-01"><sic>22:155</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1847-11-13">13 Nov. 1847</date></corr></ref>). They lived at 24 Finchley New Rd., St. John&#x2019;s Wood.</note> who lives in that neighborhood, not quite <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Hampstead, but on this side of it,&#x2014;to whom I would offer you an introduction if you went towards that region. Hampstead is very airy, and has still a set of silent country walks, though the Bricklayer is fearfully busy there too in these last years; you could have no real difficulty in getting a cleanly, honest, and tolerable lodging there; the worst fault I know is that of the water; very <hi rend="italic">hard</hi>, all of it, from the chalk; which fault, however, applies only to the Hill, or Old Village, as I suppose? Nay, indeed there is no pure water to be had in this big Babylon itself, for all its wealth and faculty; the Queen herself has to drink dirty water (as I often think) when she favors us with her company,&#x2014;so extremely wise a set of &#x201C;successful men&#x201C; are we hitherto in these parts.&#x2014; Of lodgings about Chelsea, or indeed, in all quarters urban and sub-urban, Jane thinks there can be no doubt of ample choice on every hand; and she will very gladly give help whenever you embark on such a search.</p>
<p>Her notion, in which I entirely agree, is at present, That whenever you decide on a removal you are simply to leave your things all <hi rend="italic">packed</hi> at St. Albans, and come off at once to the vacant room I told you of as waiting to welcome you here,&#x2014;therefrom to institute whatever search your fancy and judgment point to, under the favourablest auspices. This really is the wisest, and also the easiest; confess that it is, O you of little faith,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 8:26. She refused the invitation, found lodgings briefly in Hatfield, and early in <date when="1854-12-00">Dec.</date> moved to 12 Spring St., Sussex Gardens.</note> and do it.&#x2014; I was just going out (by appointment) yesterday when your letter came; could not write till now.</p>

<p>I think this will do very well now; I destroy the other Copy, and send you that back.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the inscription for Phoebe Carlyle&#x2019;s gravestone; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541017-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-10-17">17 Oct.</date></ref>, and later letters.</note> Yesterday I was at the State-Paper Office,&#x2014;in search into Prussian History, Heaven help me,&#x2014;I was just going out when your Letter arrived. Today I must go again, and probably a good many days, for the old Despatches proved comparatively instructive; I found <hi rend="italic">Ranke</hi> in one ugly error (<hi rend="italic">Convict</hi>, beyond doubt), and that apparently no Prussian had ever examined these or an equivalent set of Documents. <hi rend="italic">Raumer</hi> indeed has a Book pretending something of the kind; but it is pretence only.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540710-TC-SFM-01">TC to <sic>Sir FM</sic><corr>SFM</corr>, <date when="1854-07-10">10 July</date></ref>.</note></p>

<p>Our weather gets cool; amazingly <hi rend="italic">still</hi>, and sometimes rather foggy and subject to showers of &#x201C;the blacks.&#x201C; I feel on the whole better since the weather cooled.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>There are, in these verses you have sent me, evidences of talent, ardour, generous aspiration; good gifts both intellectual and moral;&#x2014;which I should be extremely sorry to think of your devoting to the idle trade of what is called &#x201C;Poetry&#x201C; at present. I recommend you rather to store your mind assiduously <pb id="pg-29-163" n="29:163"/>with good knowledge, with noble ideas worked out to the shape of clear conviction and purpose: this for a long while, by every method in your power,&#x2014;by the study of good Books and converse of good men (avoiding <hi rend="italic">bad</hi>, in both kinds, as you would avoid poison); and still more by nobly and manfully <hi rend="italic">doing</hi>, as it should be done, whatever employment is entrusted to you:&#x2014;you will then, in a mature manner, begin to perceive much better what real <hi rend="italic">Poetry</hi> is, and how little it has to do with the tagging of verses (for most part) in this so terribly serious epoch of the world.</p>
<p>You may believe me I wish you cordially well, and should be glad your talent were not wasted, neither wrapt in a napkin to rot, nor brought into the vulgar marketplace to be sold by auction on the melancholy terms now common. <closer><salute>I subscribe myself</salute></closer></p>

<p>&#x2026; Brompton Churchyard,&#x2014;once more to that Grave which none of us will ever forget. No sorrow or confusion <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> all is still and pure, the Azure of Eternity encompassing all.&#x2014; The Grave has not yet been covered with Turf; perhaps it is not meant to be so? It lies just as you last saw it; perhaps a child&#x2019;s or other light footprint or two upon the mould, but nothing in the least disorder: the early sun was shining, bright and windless, and here and there a meditative mourner (chiefly women, and only 3 or 4 in all) was gliding about, to or from some <hi rend="italic">shrine</hi> the place contained for her.</p>
<p>At breakfast that other doleful little Note,&#x2014;of the death of Thomas Bell,&#x2014;was handed in; which to you also will be sad news. To me the occurrence is every way a loss, and is a sorrow to my mind, more than I could have fancied from one I knew so little of. But that also is surely a human Tragedy!

He was in all things of a gentlemanly turn; I did think an amiable &#x26; pretty man. Poor fellow.&#x2014; If you write to, or meet, the chief mourner (writer of that <pb id="pg-29-164" n="29:164"/>Note), pray try if you can in some simple way convey these feelings of mine to him.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Letter came on Saturday:&#x2014; Jane, out of medical prophecy, has a theory of her own about the origin of the whitlow! If that be correct, we shall hear better news (we hope) in the course of months! But perhaps you had better be silent too, in the meanwhile.</p>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>We hear nothing of you since you went away: I hope you got safe to Heidingsfeldt,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nr. W&#xfc;rzburg, where Neuberg&#x2019;s mother had a house.</note> found all safe there that you expected, and are passing your time in some quiet useful and not unpleasant way. This world gets very <hi rend="italic">autumnal</hi> to one, at our time of life; but autumn too has its advantages, its satisfactions; and there is the everlasting azure over one, with the stars and the eternities, at all seasons.&#x2014; In a little while we shall begin to look for you back; to ask when you are about returning.</p>
<p>Here there has been nothing of moment since you went: equinoctial winds, with once or twice a stormy deluge of rain, but the weather in general bright, of agreeable coolness, and to me perceptibly wholesomer than it was. Cholera, after killing about 10,000 of our 2 millions, seems to be almost gone from this big Babel:&#x2014;it has been in all quarters of the Island; and I sometimes privately wonder how the Editors can keep maintaining with such composure that it depends all on <hi rend="italic">air:</hi> in my native village, one of the clearest spots under the sun, it has killed 9 persons out of 1000; which is about <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the proportion of its virulence in London: we read also that it is doing its business in the Isle of Skye, where surely there is no want of &#x201C;drainage,&#x201C; whatever else may be defective!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Sutherland&#x2019;s &#x201C;Report on Epidemic Cholera in the Metropolis in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>,&#x201C; presented by the General Board of Health, was to emphasize the part played by the lack of proper sewerage and accompanying pollution, lack of house drainage, bad water, unfit housing and crowding, and too many local authorities without sufficient power to deal with these problems (<hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>, XLV:73).</note></p>
<p>As to my labour so-called, I have sat here with all the old obstinacy, and <pb id="pg-29-165" n="29:165"/>with nothing but the old success: it is yet quite unapparent to me how I am ever to reduce the extant Histories of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great to a <hi rend="italic">human</hi> condition; it is as if the poor man lay, for me, diffused and <hi rend="italic">dissolved</hi> in a century of mere froth, falsity and inanity, the vague dishonest babble of which, and indeed most of its works and words, are from of old contemptible and detestable to me. F<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> Century <hi rend="italic">did</hi> nothing that I can completely approve of and rejoice in, except <hi rend="italic">cut its own throat</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> end its dishonest nonsenses, in the French Revolution! Alas, and I begin to see that even that process was a much more lengthy, miscellaneous &#x26; dismal one than I had in former times imagined. A long ugly Slough of Despond<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The deep bog that Christian passed through in Bunyan&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>.</note> indeed; and in the outlook <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> (which I still privately believe in), it is as if almost nobody w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go along with me; and the whole world, rejoicing in its Crystal Palaces, its Turk Wars &#x26;c &#x26;c, requested me to be so kind as hold my tongue. How even to speak to the &#x201C;fit audience tho&#x2019; few,"<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 7:31.</note> I do not, at this moment, on this subject, at all see. However, we will wait patiently, we will try diligently;&#x2014;we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> even hold our tongue to the end of time, if that be the law. In fact the longer I live, it is certain the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> sublime grows the speaking function, now so admired under the name &#x201C;Literature,&#x201C;&#x2014;Oh Heavens!&#x2014;and I only stick to it because the iniquity of Fate has allowed me no other whatever in this my day and generation.</p>
<p>I write great quantities of stuff, tho&#x2019; there is nothing that can ever be printed of it; I get even many useful views &#x26; reflexions suggested (not speakable the greater part of them) by this long pondering on the Chaos of German History: I do begin to see into it like a boundless dim land of <hi rend="italic">spectral</hi> realities, knit to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> by thousandfold human considerations; stratum after stratum of the vanished ghosts that once inhabited this Earth where I now am in their likeness:&#x2014;on the whole, I have a faith that real labour does get some kind of wages in due time; that profit will come to me out of this long digging in the minds;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> so I persist, in spite of the dreariness, the dismal solitude and hopelessness: clink-clink; we shall perhaps get out one day with life left after all!</p>
<p>Last week, after some negociation, I got into the State Paper Office; have been thrice there reading the Despatches about that sad &#x201C;Double-Marriage&#x201C; affair, and F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> W<hi rend="italic">m&#x2019;s</hi> real figure in regard to it. Hotham our Ambassador is an able, dignified kind of man; a great deal of new light and distinctness is to be had out of those old Papers;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it is clear to me no Prussian or other Historian has yet taken the pains to read.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In notes headed &#x201C;STATE-PAPER OFFICE (<date when="1854-10-07">7 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1854</date>)&#x201C; TC began: &#x201C;I went to the State-P<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Office, Tuesday 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ult.; have been there twice since: saw Lemon &#x26;c,&#x2014;saw the Despatches of Hotham, Guy Dickens &#x26;c, during the troubles of young Fritz, have left yellow slips of paper in No<hi rend="italic">s</hi> 40&#x2013;44 (5 volumes in all), a little uncertain what ought to be done with them. The light they yield is not absolutely without value; fixes a variety of things by precisely <hi rend="italic">dating</hi> them, bringing them up into the category of things <hi rend="italic">present</hi> to a human observer. Ought I to persist in glancing thro&#x2019; the whole of the volumes? I will write down, with great rapidity, what pencillings I have got from the parts already examined&#x201C; (MS: Yale). Robert Lemon; Melchior Guy Dickens, army capt., sec. to the British minister at Berlin; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:230; his papers cited 14:278n.</note> They ought to have <hi rend="italic">been</hi> all printed <pb id="pg-29-166" n="29:166"/>(i.e. the fit selection wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d represent</hi> them all),&#x2014;but in Prussia, not here. What can or could be done <hi rend="italic">here</hi> with them is quite a problem to me;&#x2014;in which I often think to myself, &#x201C;Would that Neuberg were returned!&#x201C; The place one gets into is a very quiet little room in that State P<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Office, only 3 persons in it, some times only yourself and the Keeper,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Charles Lechmere, deputy keeper.</note>&#x2014;from 11 o&#x2019;clock till 3;&#x2014;but it gives me daily a headache, and tumbles me up a great deal. However, I mean to go back still: I never <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> nearly so well, nor indeed saw him at all before.&#x2014; There are paper-marks stuck in wherever I have found anything; and for the 4 voll.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I was very glad to hear of your precise locality again; I hope to hear something farther, and more in detail, before long,&#x2014;tomorrow perhaps? Alas, Moffat is a changed place to you; a sadly changed place even to me when I think of it! But we must not look too much behind; we must do what is at hand and ahead; our life, and what we have to <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, is still ahead. It will give me great comfort indeed to hear that you have gathered yourself well together, and made a wise arrangement for still profiting by your future years.</p>
<p>At present I have not a moment: the Painter Tait, returned from Germany, is just come in; and is <hi rend="italic">sitting</hi> upon Jane&#x2019;s patience, till I dress, and go out with him. I would not let the Friday&#x2019;s post go without one little word.</p>
<p>We are living as heretofore; &#x201C;nothing&#x201C; the matter. I have been several times at the State-Paper Office, looking after my weary problem: God help me with it. If I live, I must get thro&#x2019; it; in one form or another, it is my faith, there comes <hi rend="italic">good</hi> fruit out of all good labour;&#x2014;and probably <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of this is good!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC noted: &#x201C;The Rheinpfalzen: with Notes on <hi rend="italic">Neuberg</hi>, Swedish King &#x26;c / <date when="1854-10-10">10 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1854</date>&#x201C; includes &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Discoveries in Geography</hi>&#x201C;: &#x201C;the mystery of Pfalz-<hi rend="italic">Neuberg</hi>, with which I have repeatedly grappled in vain, begins now to clear itself&#x201C; (see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:254&#x2013;58).

<p>One rather strange thing I must announce. Lord Ashburton came here, unexpectedly, one morning; hot from the Highlands (on some sudden errand, connected with dangers in the money market, I imagine); he was to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> in 48 hours; and I did not see him again. He wore a respectable really rather handsome <hi rend="italic">beard:</hi> once, in a careless way, I had said, last year, if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> adopted a beard, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> follow: he now claimed my promise, Jane and he combining; I admitted the promise, the desirability &#x26;c, but strove to postpone; on a sudden he calls Jane to him, goes up to my bedroom,&#x2014;takes away <pb id="pg-29-168" n="29:168"/>all my razors; <hi rend="italic">has</hi> them now with him, sealed up!&#x2014; It is a fact, I am now 4 days with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> shaving, and in very questionable mood about it,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I do save half an hour daily by the job; and see no way <hi rend="italic">out</hi>, except to let the hirsute process go on!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I, fourteen days ago,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">ceased to shave</hi>. Lord Ashburton, himself <hi rend="italic">bearded</hi> and pleading a former bargain with me, came in one morning two weeks ago fresh from the Highlands; took away, <foreign><hi rend="italic">brevis mani</hi></foreign> [high-handedly], all my razors: and so here I am, with a chin in very sad condition! I do save some half-hour thereby every morning: but I have not yet got to any good way of spending that increment of my time occurring just then; and the feeling I have is still one of confused <hi rend="italic">uncleanness</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the region of the lips. I am not disinclined to <hi rend="italic">turn back</hi>, tho&#x2019; beards are now common on the streets, and there is nothing extraneous to force one either way. <date when="1854-10-08">8 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1854</date>; that, I think, (or <date when="1854-10-09">9</date>?) was the <hi rend="italic">last day I shaved</hi>.&#x201C; TC apparently stopped shaving, <date when="1854-10-09">9 Oct.</date>, Lord Ashburton having taken the razors, <date when="1854-10-08">8 Oct.</date>; he wrote to his wife that he had just called at Cheyne Row, and that TC was &#x201C;not looking well, but he is wellsatisfied with his <foreign>trouvailles</foreign> at the Foreign Office. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> C. is all for the beard. He was shilly shallying, so I made an attack at once on his room, &#x26; with her aid, I carried off all his razors. He nothing loth, accepted the situation and he will appear hirsute to you on Sunday next&#x201C; (NLS:MS Acc. 11388; n.d.).</note>&#x2014; Give my kind remembrances to Mr Riddle.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev.

TC spells the name variously as Maves, Mares, Mayres, Mayers. Possibly John Thomas May, statuary maker, mason, and builder, North St., E India Rd., Poplar.</note> found one of the Brothers at home, who readily undertook, and professed perfectly to understand: I was to call again on Monday (that is, yesterday <hi rend="italic">now</hi>), and see whether the <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> Brother (for he was not then on the ground) had, in a completely exact manner, got hold of the Inscription with its <hi rend="italic">points</hi>, <hi rend="italic">capitals</hi> &#x26;c; I accordingly did call yesterday; got answer in the affirmative, &#x201C;everything being quite plain&#x201C;; I intended to make the man actually <hi rend="italic">read</hi> the thing <hi rend="italic">punctuatim</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s error for &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">punctatim</hi></foreign> [letter by letter].&#x201C;</note> along with me, but he could not get at it, after several trials, the &#x201C;Brother&#x201C; having locked it up and gone out. However, he said there was no doubt or difficulty. He was to proceed immediately, and to send for me to <hi rend="italic">in</hi>spect, before it was taken out of the workshop. So I expect it will be satisfactorily done before long. There is no &#x201C;trouble&#x201C; to me in it whatever; and if there were?&#x2014; I pray you get that <hi rend="italic">comma</hi> altered on the other melancholy Stone;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their mother&#x2019;s gravestone.</note> then tell me what it has cost that I may have the solace of contributing my part.</p>
<p>Today for the first time I have got my <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> lighted here; now that the windows and double doors &#x26;c are all closed, I am greatly quieter; and with this excellent light, in such isolation, ought to try if I could accomplish something! The whole lies like a boundless mountain of dust, broken crockery, rubbish and Dryasdust marine-stores; the great difficulty is to get anything of <hi rend="italic">human</hi> worked out of it; the great merit (if it ever be done) will be to have <hi rend="italic">well forgotten</hi> 999 out of every 1000 portions I have gathered. Heaven help me!&#x2014; My beard is still unshaven, inexpressibly ugly as yet; but nobody minds me with it, and I save half an hour daily. Probably I may persist.</p>

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your remembrance of us: I am very glad to hear of you again; and will at once make answer, and report as desired.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1854-10-14">14 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I should sometimes write to you if I had anything worth telling, or worth putting you to the trouble of answering me. About twice in a year however I do not mind asking you one thing which is easily answered&#x2014;how you and Mrs. Carlyle are?&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>We have been here all this while; not out of Town even for a day, in spite of cholera, hot weather, and whatever else befel. I have got myself, of late years, so smashed in pieces, and reduced to despair, by incessant fluctuations, within doors (from bricklayers and carpenters) and without whenever away from home, that I had to resolve at length on <hi rend="italic">staying where I was</hi>, as at once the simplest and the most promising course for me. It is astonishing what <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> it creates in my affairs,&#x2014;and I believe, in those of most men,&#x2014;this habit we have of getting into <hi rend="italic">express trains</hi> for all reasons and for none! I do seem to experience that I am slowly getting better, in health both of body and mind, by simply staying at home, and sorrowfully and silently endeavouring to put to rights day by day the innumerable multitude of things that have gone out of square with me. For my work is all lying in such distraction, I feel as if the infinite Chaos would swallow me alive;&#x2014;which perhaps, by this method, it will not quite succeed in doing. Any way, what other chance was there?</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cholera</hi> visitation formed a very bad accompaniment; concerning which, in the circumstances, we had no resource, except to take what precautions Nature herself dictated,&#x2014;and for the rest, what was a very important precaution, rigorously to hold our peace about the matter. Thank God, that is now gone, or we hear no more about it. I do not much believe in that omnipotence of &#x201C;bad air,&#x201C; which is now so currently accepted as the secret of cholera pestilence. In my native village where the &#x201C;air&#x201C; is as pure as at the <pb id="pg-29-171" n="29:171"/>north-pole, there died just <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> the proportion we have lost in London! &#x201C;Bad air&#x201C; means poverty, misbehaviour, bad living, bad morality,&#x2014;when London and large towns are spoken of. Let the people clean their gutters and cesspools, by all manner of means; let them <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> whatever will aid and urge them in so evidently good a work. But the truth is, <hi rend="italic">Cholera</hi> is as yet an entirely unintelligible business;&#x2014;and indeed <hi rend="italic">Death</hi> itself, or even <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, has never been very completely understood, I believe!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing can go worse on than my studies in German History and on Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great. The German <hi rend="italic">Dryasdust</hi> is an infinitely dreadfuller fellow than even the English; excels in stupidity, I often think, all other created Entities! Upon the whole, I have got again into the very belly of the <hi rend="small-caps">Impracticable</hi>; and, alas, I have no such object as an O<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Cromwell, but only far inferior ones, to incite me towards &#x201C;doing the <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi>.&#x201C; Probably you will never hear of me more in useful Book-writing; you ought not to wish to hear of me in useless d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>. But we shall see, we shall see; we must not die without a struggle!</p>
<p>I noticed <hi rend="italic">Hafiz</hi> in Fraser, with respect, with surprise; and might have bethought me of Cowell,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald called TC&#x2019;s attention to &#x201C;some prose Translations of Hafiz&#x201C; by Edward Byles Cowell ([<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>&#x2013;<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32595"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>], scholar, FitzGerald&#x2019;s friend and tutor in Persian), &#x201C;Hafiz (Part I),&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 50 (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>):288&#x2013;95. Pt. II: <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 63 (<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>):228&#x2013;34.</note> which however I did not. If you write to him, pray offer my continued kind remembrances.&#x2014; There is an Article on <hi rend="italic">Odin</hi> in the last <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541004-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-10-04">4 Oct.</date></ref></note> which perhaps you might like to read, and he. I take it to be by a man <hi rend="italic">Neuberg</hi>, a German about my own age, once a merchant in Nottingham, now an idle man with some money, who volunteers, many a time, to work for me in the British Museum and such places. There is loyalty for you,</p>
<p>I saw Thackeray not long since; complaining of <hi rend="italic">liverish</hi> sickliness; otherwise very pleasant and good: my Wife says his girls are vastly improved, and doing extremely well.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray&#x2019;s daughters were Anne Isabella and Harriet Marian.</note>&#x2014; Have you heard about poor Lewes, &#x201C;hairy Lewes&#x201C; as we sometimes call him? He has put away his Wife <hi rend="italic">at last</hi>, and for right good cause; but the rest of the rumour about him I believe to be, in brief, <hi rend="italic">lies</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rumors were widespread that Lewes had left his wife for another woman. Because of Lewes&#x2019;s known connection with Thornton Hunt as fellow editor of the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, it was supposed by some that Lewes and Hunt had swapped wives (see Rosemary Ashton, <hi rend="italic">G. H. Lewes</hi> [<date when="1991-00-00">1991</date>] 153&#x2013;54). According to Gavan Duffy, the Carlyles were caught up in the gossip. JWC said that &#x201C;when one was first told that the strong woman of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> had gone off with a man we all knew, it was as startling an announcement as if one had heard that a woman of your acquaintance had gone off with the strong man at Astley&#x2019;s [circus]; but that the partners in this adventure had set up as moralists was a graver surprise.&#x201C; TC allowed that Lewes was &#x201C;lively and pleasant&#x201C; and that &#x201C;in this final adventure it must be admitted he had escaped from worse, and might even be said to have ranged himself. He had originally married a bright little woman &#x2026; but every one knew how that adventure had turned out. Miss Evans advised him to quit a household which had broken bounds in every direction. His proceeding was not to be applauded, but it could scarcely be said that he had gone from bad to worse&#x201C; (Duffy 222&#x2013;23). Marian Evans wrote in her Journal, <date when="1854-10-11">11 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;A painful letter from London caused us both a bad night.&#x201C; Lewes then wrote to TC, &#x201C;explaining his position&#x201C; (Gordon S. Haight, ed., <hi rend="italic">The George Eliot Letters</hi> [New Haven, Conn., <date when="1954-00-00">1954</date>] 2:176n). The letter is lost, but the envelope, PM: Weimar, <date when="1854-10-13">13 Oct. 1854</date>, has TC&#x2019;s note: &#x201C;G. H. Lewes and &#x2018;Strong minded Woman&#x2019;&#x201C; (MS: Parrish Coll., Princeton). TC apparently wrote to Lewes about the rumors and his belief that they were largely untrue; in her Journal, <date when="1854-10-19">19 Oct.</date>, Evans refers to &#x201C;a letter of noble sympathy from Carlyle&#x201C; (2:176n). For Lewes&#x2019;s reply, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541102-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-02">2 Nov.</date></ref></note> He <pb id="pg-29-172" n="29:172"/>is a good soul in several respects in spite of his hair.&#x2014; Nay what do I say hair: I myself have <hi rend="italic">ceased shaving</hi> now for the 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi> day; and am rapidly becoming <hi rend="italic">bearded</hi>.

But the whole History of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> W<hi rend="italic">m&#x2019;s</hi> Court, I perceive, lies there, for the first time; and we shall surely be able to make something of it,&#x2014;Wilhelmine of Baireuth<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick&#x2019;s sister.</note> and we!

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> Today I enclose your Scotch military Letter, as I am not to see <pb id="pg-29-175" n="29:175"/>you tomorrow, in your transit thro&#x2019; our dim regions. The poor man&#x2019;s remarks, especially his spellings &#x201C;Malty&#x201C; &#x26;c are very amusing. Undeniably the Grand Turk &#x201C;is but a poor body to have so many wives,&#x201C; and to get 3000 brave English soldiers blown to pieces for his cause and theirs!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abdul Mejid I (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), sultan of Turkey, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>. At the battle of Alma, <date when="1854-09-20">20 Sept.</date>, the French and British forces overcame the Russians but lost about 3,000 men, mostly British. &#x201C;Malty&#x201C; may be Alma. The Scottish soldier is unidentified, but Lady Ashburton had heard from A. W. Kinglake (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15611"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), who was present at the battle and wrote to her two days later: &#x201C;It occurred to me (whilst thinking of those who had been kind to me in England) that you might like a note from this place. &#x2026; We had a great battle here. &#x2026; It was very bloody but most glorious and decisive. I was with Lord Raglan all the day &#x26; was able to see how nobly and skilfully he did his part. We are burying our dead &#x26; tomorrow we march on Katcha. Last night I helped with two other men to give biscuits &#x26; water to about an <hi rend="italic">acre</hi> of wounded Russians closely laid out. A sad scene&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note> I am sorry to feel less and less enthusiasm about that high matter the longer I think about it!

On the other hand, the Russians themselves, in surprising of Schweidnitz two years afterwards (or helping Laudon and the Austrians to surprise it) came upon an unexpected wet Ditch; paused on the edge of it; and, by word of command, marched into it,&#x2014;till they were drowned in sufficient quantity to make a bridge.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the capture of the Silesian village Schweidnitz by Austrian Gen.

My poor Uncle, Sir Henry, has been quite overwhelmed by his loss&#x2014;his favourite son, and the one whom he trusted was coming home to marry and live with him! Every alleviation that the case admitted of they have. The poor (?) boy had a presentiment that he should fall, and wrote the day before to take leave of his father and sister, expressing his last wishes. The next evening he was found surrounded by his brother-officers close to the Russian gun, lying sword in hand, the ball having passed through his forehead. He evidently had died instantaneously. &#x2026; London looks very melancholy from the quantity of black worn in the streets, although this proceeds from the ravages which the cholera made rather than from those of the war&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memorials of Charlotte Williams-Wynn</hi>, ed.

<p>I went yesterday to the State-Paper Office, consulted Mr Lemon, was by him referred to Mr Lechmere the head man there (Keeper of the Rolls or something equivalent),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Lemon and Charles Lechmere.</note> both of whom treated me with the last degree of politeness, and, on hearing and considering the matter, explained that Neuberg would simply have to petition Lord Clarendon, and that there would not be the least difficulty. I have sent Neuberg the form of a little Petition which he is to write, and given him along with it a short Note for Lord Clarendon in which the thing can be inclosed:&#x2014;if your beneficent Ladyship could, by any opportunity, say a little word about it to the Foreign Secretary, there might be some <hi rend="italic">expiditive</hi> and generally favourable virtue in the same. I hope and trust, however, there will be no stop even otherwise.&#x2014; It is an infinite relief to me to see some prospect (as there is here) of getting thro&#x2019; a portion of that horrible job: the <hi rend="italic">History</hi>, I perceive, does in part lie <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, for the first time; and Neuberg, above all men, is the thick-built, patient and clearsighted man to <hi rend="italic">fish</hi> it for me, by the half-ounce a day, from the wide lakes of water in which it there swims. Pity me, O my Lady; and don&#x2019;t be angry at me.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I perceived by the Gate,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Bath House.</note> you were gone; I can only hope Lord A.&#x2019;s bad twinge is off again: it is too hard to fall directly into that a second time, on just looking at London.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is positively a shame that I have not written to you long ago! It seems so easy done any day; and yet it is still to do. The truth is, I <hi rend="italic">intended</hi> faithfully; and surely could, and should, have saved a half-hour out of some forenoon, for the sake of one I like so well: but alas, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> forenoons, and some of them to an insupportable extent, are filled with confusions, and <hi rend="italic">un</hi>fulfilled labours for me; I think always I ought to get some definite task of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> done; and every forenoon proves hours too short for any available good I can get of it! Never in my life had I such an unbounded <hi rend="italic">burble</hi> (<hi rend="italic">wide</hi> as five parishes!) to try whether I could ravel out, and weave into a web! You must have patience with me. I can only say I do not design again to be so long in sending you a line of writing. One has not now so many persons in the world whom it is in the least worth while to write to, that one should neglect those that in every sense <hi rend="italic">are</hi> worth while and must continue to be, while we are alive along with them. Alas, alas!&#x2014; But no more of all that.</p>
<p>We have staid steadily here, as you know; I have never been away one night <pb id="pg-29-178" n="29:178"/>since that bright stern morning when you put me into the Rail at Ecclefechan: one grand duty, therefore, I have not been remiss in; that <hi rend="italic">of staying at home</hi>. Which indeed has various advantages; and is, at any rate, the <hi rend="italic">easiest</hi> method. I do not find that my shattered nerves get rapidly better by dint of mere <hi rend="italic">letting alone;</hi> but I sometimes think they do improve rather than otherwise; and it is the monition of long and sad experience to me that the uproar of railway journeying, and the confusion produced in me by all <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of any kind, are good to be <hi rend="italic">avoided</hi>, for most part. We have been, and are, after <hi rend="italic">our</hi> fashion, quite tolerably well; never <hi rend="italic">specially</hi> unwell, either of us:&#x2014;if I were able to get master of my work, and see it progressing under my hands, I should never complain of health,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is very mainly <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of health, and of the consequent stock of <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, energy and good spirits, that so terribly holds me back, and prevents any conquest over this immense Coil of disorder that is round me. If <hi rend="italic">I</hi> myself were once in a right fiery state of activity, I should dash it to the right and left in some way, and get thro&#x2019; it. One of the chief effects of age, almost the only one I very definitely trace, is this great decay of <hi rend="italic">interest</hi> in things presented to me: the sad question, &#x201C;What is the use of it? Where lies the beauty, worth or importance of it?&#x201C; is <hi rend="italic">much</hi> readier with me than it used to be; and it requires a far greater stretch of effort to &#x201C;get up the steam&#x201C; about anything than was of old the case. No wonder!&#x2014; I often think of an old <hi rend="italic">spavined</hi> horse; cannot mark the ground till it is once got warm; but can then go a reasonable pace still, for some time. We must try, we must try!</p>
<p>There was in Autumn a good deal of <hi rend="italic">cholera</hi> here; evidently an unwholesome atmosphere, tending to biliary disorders; plenty of cases in Chelsea and all about: we endeavoured to <hi rend="italic">avoid speaking of the subject</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">terror</hi>, so far as I can judge, is the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> &#x201C;predisposing cause&#x201C; of all); and to follow our affairs as if it were not there. After all, what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> one do to better the business. Seemingly there was little use in running away, which with an effort we might have done: Cholera was in the <hi rend="italic">Isle of Skye;</hi> in the airy quiet village of Ecclefechan, I find, the cases were just about <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> as numerous in proportion as here in London: you lost about 1 in the 100, we 1 in the 200! The disease has now disappeared, at least gone out of notice;&#x2014;swallowed in Russian victories &#x26;c &#x26;c, in <hi rend="italic">which</hi> also I cannot find that there is much to disturb my composure. From the first I regretted and disapproved all that Turk affair, a thing recommended by the fools of the Country and not by the <hi rend="italic">wise;</hi> and I believe we shall get as little by it as by most things we have tried lately.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1854-10-25">25 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;&#x2018;Victory at the <hi rend="italic">Alma</hi>,&#x2019;&#x2014;fierce and bloody forcing a passage right across fortified heights and 45,000 Russians, to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> the siege of Sebastopol: a terrible and almost horrible operation,&#x2014;done altogether at the command of the Newspapers:&#x2014;what have I to do with all that? In common, I believe, with nearly all the rational men in the country, I have all along been totally indisposed to this miserable Turk war; the windy fools alone, it is the immense majority of that class that have done, and do, this last enterprise of ours. Would we were well out of it: That is all my prayer and thought in regard to that.&#x2014;&#x201C;</note> As even fools <pb id="pg-29-179" n="29:179"/>will discover by and by!&#x2014; One other bit of news, more interesting to everybody, is, that the <hi rend="italic">American</hi> harvest is deficient, and that we are not to have cheap prices in spite of our own abundance: the price of corn (wheat) is still high, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">rose</hi> 10 shillings&#x201C; within the last week, as I heard. But indeed there is such <hi rend="italic">gambling</hi> in the Corntrade, I believe, one can hardly ever know what the real price will be or should be. We find the <hi rend="italic">potatoes</hi> much more tolerable in quality then they have been for seven years back or more.</p>
<p>You must have got done with all shearing and digging by this time; I have always from time to time heard of your operations; and hoped you were reaping a &#x201C;good crop.&#x201C; Tell me, some way or other, or bid Isabella or the Doctor tell me, how that is.&#x2014; Poor Doctor! That was a sad visit he made to London this year; and he had to leave it in sadly changed circumstances! I have not been concerned, that I remember, in a more sorrowful and miserable thing; and my heart is yet often sad to a degree when I think of poor Phoebe and her fate. What the Doctor, poor fellow, will now do, I cannot guess; can hope and pray only that he may decide on some course that will be useful for him and the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>.&#x2014; Dear Brother, I have done with this bit of paper; and the iron pen (I have now been driven mostly to <hi rend="italic">iron</hi>) is but a disobedient one. I must not start another sheet; I must let you go for this time. <closer><salute>Give our kind regards to the good Isabella; bid her not forget us, as we do not her. I surely mean to write again, myself, before long; and hope I shall, some way, soon hear news of you.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have, with many thanks for your goodness to me, received your pretty little volume.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Poems by a Painter</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>).</note> Everywhere in it, I find proof of your assiduity, your ingenuity,&#x2014;in short, of your talent for doing something much more useful in the world than writing rhymes never so well. If you will take any advice of mine in this matter (which I hardly expect you will), then know that, according to my notion, a man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> is next to nothing in comparison with the man&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">deed:</hi> what he can <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, and practically perform; not at all what he can <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sing</hi>, <pb id="pg-29-180" n="29:180"/>is the first question we ask of every man;&#x2014;to which I only add that if the man <hi rend="italic">has</hi> anything to say, he had better <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it instead of <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> it, at this time of day.</p>
<p>Silence, with pious thought and strenuous practical exertion superadded, will do much more for a man of worth and parts than any &#x201C;speech&#x201C; can or could.&#x2014; You may depend on it, I have nothing but goodwill towards you, tho&#x2019; I say these unwelcome things. I am</p>

<p>On the other Leaf is notice that the State-Paper affair is open to us.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Clarendon wrote from the Foreign Office approving Neuberg&#x2019;s admission to the State Paper office &#x201C;according to your desire.&#x201C; TC noted on the letter: &#x201C;To me; came night before last / T.C.&#x201C;</note> I suppose you will perhaps today receive your Official Letter on the subject; after which due measures can be taken for commencing.</p>

He is to paint &#x26;c &#x26;c so soon as the Inscription is cut; expects to have it perfectly dry and ready about this day week: after which I am to go and see it in its place, and if I say <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to Mayers, it will mean that I have informed <hi rend="italic">you</hi> it is all right, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is to consider his money earned. And so it stands;&#x2014;and I think you have nothing more to do but <hi rend="italic">let</hi> it so stand.</p>
<p>This morning there came this Letter from Jenny in Canada; of which I can make little except that they have not <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the Letters sent them: I remember very well indeed writing to Alick a long letter; to him at least, whither any expressly to Jenny I do not quite remember.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540906-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1854-09-06">6 Sept.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>The end of last week I caught an ugly whiff of cold,&#x2014;being in fact in a most deranged state of liver at the time; liver <hi rend="italic">obstinately neglected</hi> for a long while. I was obliged to take strenuous measures therefore: blue pill, castor &#x26;c on Sunday; which beat back the cold altogether, but has left me a very weak being ever since.&#x2014; &#x201C;Dreadful spirits,&#x201C; for most part; and totally unable to make the slightest impression on my work; which is the saddest feature of all! I try, I try; but to no purpose, or next to none: Heaven help me; for on Earth nothing is very likely to do it, I imagine!</p>
<p>Have you returned from Scotsbrig? I infer you would not stay long: young Jamie&#x2019;s Note to me indicated you as coming. From Jean I have yet heard nothing: poor soul, I fear her finger is not yet very handy for writing, and that I myself ought to have written. I have somehow always fancied her in Glasgow, and have put off.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I ought to <hi rend="italic">cease</hi> here, having my whole day&#x2019;s work still ahead of me; and <hi rend="italic">will</hi>,&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Yesterday afternoon I was at Mares&#x2019;s, and have been again this morning before breakfast: I believe I may say now the <hi rend="italic">Inscription</hi> is completely ended, exact in all points, and well enough put on,&#x2014;all in roman capitals; perhaps a little <hi rend="italic">shallower</hi> (or perhaps not?) than would have been my custom, but no doubt conformable to theirs. The man had ended, <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi>, all but a few finishings that required a lighter tool; and was <hi rend="italic">painting</hi> the stone when I arrived: there were a comma or two that needed rectifying; about which I again indoctrinated Mayers this morning (the man not being there), and I have no doubt it is now right, and in all points <hi rend="italic">conformable</hi> to your Paper. Next week, perhaps about Wednesday or earlier, I expect to report that I have seen the Stone <hi rend="italic">right in its place;</hi> and then, as I told Mayers, he has only his account to present.</p>
<p>My blue-pill operations have very much deranged my poor <hi rend="italic">interior</hi>, in their fashion; but my cold is quite gone; and I shall profit in due season. Meanwhile <hi rend="italic">boiledness</hi>, irritability of nerves, weakness, weakness! And I have sat here all day, vainly striving with a task I could not <hi rend="italic">do</hi>,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">could</hi> not in spite of all my struggling;&#x2014;and so am going out, into the remains of the winter sunshine, in a rather bankrupt humour. Another day I shall do better;&#x2014;what we do but hope!</p>
<p>Tait is trying to &#x201C;paint&#x201C; me; has got one sitting, is to have just one other: his Picture looks to me <hi rend="italic">horrible</hi>, and useless wholly;&#x2014;a sad thing to have a man hunt you about, to &#x201C;sit&#x201C; painfully a fraction of your time away to him, that he may manufacture a miserable splash of caricature from you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The portrait, rejected in <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>, was shown at the Royal Academy, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; now in Carlyle&#x2019;s House, Chelsea; repro.

<p>Lewes, <hi rend="italic">Ape</hi> Lewes, or &#x201C;hairy Lewes,&#x201C; as we called him, has not only gone to Weimar, but is understood to have a &#x201C;strong minded woman&#x201C; with him there, and has certainly cast away his Wife here,&#x2014;who indeed deserved it of him, having openly produced those dirty sooty skinned children which have Th<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Hunt for father, and being ready with a <hi rend="italic">third;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had fathered three children by Agnes Lewes: Edmund (b. <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), Rose (b. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), and Ethel (b. <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>); the fourth, Mildred, was born, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>.

I sat at your feet when my mind was first awakening; I have honoured and loved you ever since both as a teacher and friend, and now to find that you judge me rightly, and are not estranged&#x201C; as others had been. He assured TC there was &#x201C;no foundation for the scandal as it runs&#x201C; and that his separation had not been &#x201C;caused by the lady named <supplied>[Marian Evans]</supplied>.&#x201C; The letter to Harriet Martineau was not by Evans and was, he said, &#x201C;a pure, or impure, fabrication&#x201C;; he would be &#x201C;doubly bound&#x201C; to TC if he would &#x201C;on all occasions, clear the lady from such unworthy aspersions.&#x201C; At the end of Lewes&#x2019;s letter TC wrote: &#x201C;Alas, alas!&#x2014; I had (at his request) approved unequivocally of parting <hi rend="italic">such a marriage;</hi> and advised to contradict, if he could, on his word of honour, the bad rumours circulating about a certain &#x2018;strong-minded woman&#x2019; and him. He assures me, on his word of honour, the strong minded did not <hi rend="italic">write</hi> etc.; as well as assure me her stockings are both of one colour; that is a very insignificant point!&#x2014; No answer to this second letter&#x201C; (Haight, <hi rend="italic">George Eliot Letters</hi> 2:176&#x2013;77).

It is hardly necessary to tell you that I have had no communication with Miss Martineau, and that if I had, she is one of the last persons to whom I should speak as a confidante,&#x201C; adding that Lewes had written to TC &#x201C;stating as much of the truth as he can without inculpating others&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">George Eliot: A Biography</hi> 162). Martineau disliked Lewes, and this had caused a rift between Evans and Martineau.</note>&#x2014; Such are our sublime George-Sand <pb id="pg-29-185" n="29:185"/>Philosophies teaching by experience.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>That grave futurity you allude to was in my thought too, in superintending of Mares; and there is full provision made for it: the Stone, in fact, the available part of the stone, is hardly above <hi rend="italic">an inch</hi> shortened by the change I suggested; and in the state Mares had brought it to (divided into <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>,&#x2014;which also had some advantages), that was a real improvement. I believe it is all perfectly satisfactory so far as that goes.</p>
<p>Mares&#x2019;s man has already been here with the Note they had got from you; he found me still at breakfast: I explained to him what it meant; and that he must go on as before. I write you this word the first thing I do, lest something else prevent me afterwards; being very sorry to think of your sad anxieties on that mournful score: Ah me, Ah me!</p>
<p>Having my whole days work still ahead, I will write no more at present. Perhaps you will let me hear again more deliberately from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>? If you have time;&#x2014;let it all depend on that.</p>
<p>I am glad to hear Jean has gone to Glasgow at last; she will get to the root of the matter there, and see what is feasible, what not. If you can in any way help <pb id="pg-29-186" n="29:186"/>her, of course you will.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written to Archibald Glen about Jean&#x2019;s son, James, <date when="1854-10-19">19 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I do not know the details of his position quite accurately; but he himself will explain them to you. &#x2026; He is an honest, faithful boy, &#x26; would do well I think in any wholesome place. But at present, with Messrs Lehmann &#x26; Leipman he has almost nothing to do but wait a certain number of hours in their office daily; &#x26; they seem to be shabby Jewish people whom it is not comfortable to live under or work for. He means to make out the year for which he is engaged with them; &#x26; perhaps make another engagement with them, but both my brother Thomas &#x26; I think he would be better rid of such Jews if any other places were to be had. &#x2026; Perhaps you may see his mother too in Glasgow this week, as she has to take a deaf &#x26; dumb child of hers to some institution there, &#x26; has an introduction to you from my brother&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 5311). Gustar Liepmann and Charles Lehmann of Liepmann &#x26; Lehmann, commission merchants, 72 Virginia St. The institution for Thomas was presumably the Deaf and Dumb Institution, 36 Parson St., run by Duncan Anderson.</note> I had a Letter yesterday from D.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received the little Volume you were kind enough to send me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Edward Irving: An Ecclesiastical and Literary Biography</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) was dedicated to TC, &#x201C;the most trusted of philosophers and the most admired of historians,&#x201C; and to F. D. Maurice &#x201C;by their common disciple.&#x201C;</note> You may assure yourself &#x201C;Offence&#x201C; is not the feeling suggested by what you have seen good to do, either in dedicating or in writing. I have gone thro&#x2019; the little Book, strange memories crowding on me (as you may fancy), and almost in an <hi rend="italic">apocalyptic</hi> mood. I find no complete or accurate Likeness of Edward Irving there, few specific details being given, and those few not always exact: but <pb id="pg-29-187" n="29:187"/>there is a recognizable Outline of a Likeness; the gallant valiant man, and his wild and tragical career, are taken up in a generous and loyal manner; and the impression left is much nearer the truth than in other Books or Criticisms I have seen. The many Excerpts you give,&#x2014;strongly seasoned with pious wise meaning, all or most of them,&#x2014;will do <hi rend="italic">good</hi> to many readers; and tend to bring that question and other still more important ones, nearer their true issue. On the whole, you write in a manful honourable temper, and with a free-flowing ingenious pen; and have deserved thanks, from me at least, by what you have done.</p>
<p>I know not whether the Public would sufficiently acknowledge, at this time, a <hi rend="italic">finished Biography of Irving;</hi> nor whether you could engage in the great trouble and study that would be necessary to it: but there do exist (I have little doubt) sufficient materials, if well inquired after; and you, it is pretty evident to me, might accomplish such a work far better than is common in such cases.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wilks had also pbd. the pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Palmerston in Three Epochs: A Comparison of Facts with Opinions</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), which, according to the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1854-02-18">18 Feb.</date>, endeavored &#x201C;to prove that our Home Secretary is not so clever and witty as people imagine.&#x201C;</note></p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Your beneficent message, couched in satirical terms, came duly; and was duly welcomed, satire and all: there cannot well any writing come to me of a more canonical character than writing done in that hand, to whatever effect it be!

God help me,&#x2014;and Oh do you have some pity on me; for truly I am ill off to a degree, and if not beaten (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I suspect), was never nearer it! But you have no mercy, I suppose; will have none? Well, I cannot expect much; I am a useless wretch, and deserve <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi>, or next to nothing.</p>

<p>Jane, I can perceive, means to <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to The Grange, and nothing other, when the time suits.

<salute>Dear Hope,</salute>
<p>I have done nothing in the <hi rend="italic">reviewing</hi> way for very many years back; and am so busy, at any rate, with an abstruse mass of <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> matter that I cannot go into the <hi rend="italic">poetic</hi> line at all,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;but must leave &#x201C;Hannah and her chickens&#x201C; to battle with the <hi rend="italic">Gled</hi> on their own footing, as they best may!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian August Gottlieb Eberhard, <hi rend="italic">Hannah and her Chickens</hi>, trans. from German by James Cochrane (Edinburgh, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>). &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Gled</hi>,&#x201C; sparrow hawk, i.e., reviewers.</note> For your sake, or to oblige any friend of yours, I should have been very glad: but, on the whole, even to Mr. Cochrane<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Cochrane probably also trans. <hi rend="italic">Herman and Dorothea. From the German of Goethe</hi> (Oxford, Glasgow, [<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>]).</note> it could not be of much real service, or perhaps of any at all,&#x2014;if not even of less than none. So we leave it there.</p>
<p>I have not been in Annandale, nor indeed have quitted home at all, since the sad errand I had at Christmas last. I am fond enough of my poor old country; but feel very like a <hi rend="italic">ghost</hi> when I go to it now. My work is not quite done either; my only remedy for all things is, to stand well to that. If I only could;&#x2014;but alas, tho&#x2019; &#x201C;the spirit is willing&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 26:41.</note></p>
<p>Poor Grahame is indeed getting very dim: pray be kind to him among you, for he is a right good soul, and never did other than kindness to any friend,&#x2014;or to any enemy, I might almost say, if he ever had one! I am glad to think of my old friend and benefactor, Mr. Johnstone, as returned to his native region, after so many wanderings.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Johnstone (<date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>13:215&#x2013;16</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-08-15">15 Aug. 1841</date></corr></ref>; corrected date of death), Presbyterian minister and TC&#x2019;s Latin teacher; emigrated to the U.S., <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, returned during the summer. John Carlyle had written, <date when="1854-06-01">1 June</date>, that Johnstone was coming back with his only da. to live with his brother Eben who was &#x201C;now very frail, yet totters about the streets for a space every day.&#x201C;</note> May all good that can be yet possible wait on him there. It is a long time now since he drilled me in the <hi rend="italic">syntaxes;</hi> and, with beneficent mockery and otherwise, brought me to understand that I as yet understood nothing.</p>
<p>My Sister, Mrs Aitken, will perhaps have called upon you (or perhaps not) before you read this. She is in Glasgow, I believe, for a couple of days just about now; looking into her eldest Boy&#x2019;s position with her own eyes: if help to her, in any form, lay in your course, I am sure it would be ready enough on demand. My poor Brother John is in Edinburgh, for the present week; his principal employment lately has been the sorting up of sad mortuary details; <pb id="pg-29-191" n="29:191"/>and no doubt his outlook is sorrowfully changed,&#x2014;and I suppose, very uncertain as yet.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote to Hope, <date when="1854-11-06">6 Nov.</date>, from Edinburgh, saying TC had written &#x201C;that he had heard from you lately; &#x26; I feel a tendency to take Glasgow on my way to Ecclefechan, <hi rend="italic">on wednesday first</hi>. If you can give me lodgement for a night without inconvenience, let me know by return of post, &#x26; I will run across to see you &#x26; your old city again&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9654).</note> <closer><salute>I remain, in haste, but heartily as ever, Yours faithfully /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>Last night, I was favoured with your Letter from Berlin, inviting me, on most kind and liberal terms, to lecture to the New York Literary Association next winter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Literary Assoc., New York City, founded <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, which met weekly.</note> Please to thank those Gentlemen in my name, and to accept thanks yourself from me. To any one whose business were Lecturing, the terms offered are sufficiently handsome and tempting; and in the fact itself, <pb id="pg-29-192" n="29:192"/>and your way of presenting it, there is something which has value for me, and ought to have.</p>
<p>To see America some day, where I have friends very dear to me, and interests of various kinds, has often been among my daydreams; and perhaps is not yet entirely dismissed. But multifarious obstacles lie in the way; and the project hangs always unexecuted,&#x2014;always very far off being executed. For this coming Winter, and for above a year beyond, it is plainly <hi rend="italic">in</hi>executable; not to be thought of till once (if ever) certain confused operations and engagements here at home are brought to some completion. With many thanks and regrets I must therefore deny myself that pleasure.</p>

I am haunted day and night with the thought of all the women over England Scotland and Ireland who must be in agonies of suspense about their nearest and dearest&#x2014; Thank God I have no husband or brother or father or son in that horrible War&#x2014; I have some few acquaintances however, and one intimate friend Colonel Sterling the Brother <pb id="pg-29-194" n="29:194"/>of John Sterling&#x2014;and I read the list of killed and wounded always with a sick dread of finding <hi rend="italic">his</hi> name<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling, brigade maj., then asst. adj.-gen. in the Highland division, was decorated for his service at Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman (<date when="1854-11-05">5 Nov.</date>), and Sebastopol. Kate Sterling had written a long, effusive letter to JWC, [<date when="1854-10-20">20 Oct.</date>], from Matlock, Derbyshire, where she was staying with the Maurices, &#x201C;such inveterate &#x2018;lovely scenery&#x2019; seekers, when once they get out of London.&#x201C; She &#x201C;never once have sent a line to tell you how often I thought of you my dearest kindest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle and longed to hear of you! But truly I have been <hi rend="italic">very</hi> mad (as some dear cousins of ours say I always am, but &#x2018;that is easily accounted for, as such things are in families, and you know &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">poor</hi> M<hi rend="italic">rs Sterling</hi>&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so&#x2019;!). &#x2026; I would have given <hi rend="italic">Republics</hi> to be by your side for a moment.&#x201C; She was coming to London, <date when="1854-10-28">28 Oct.</date> The letter was also about a visit to Portsmouth with Johnny [presumably a cousin, perhaps on Charlotte Sterling&#x2019;s side] and Lotta who &#x201C;got him exchanged to another ship &#x2026; at Sheerness for a few months then &#x2026; probably onto the Blk Sea.&#x201C; Johnny was anxious about Anthony Sterling: &#x201C;I think there is no one <hi rend="italic">now</hi> who loves him, in the same fresh, fine, reverential manner as Johnny, for of course he is ignorant of all that has deprived us of our reverence.&#x201C; Apparently once Anthony Sterling had fallen out with JWC, he had transferred his affection to &#x201C;Miss Farrer,&#x201C; presumably the elder Mary, as Kate refers to &#x201C;that ludicrous fact of his perseverance in writing to Miss Farrer.&#x201C; She had hoped that &#x201C;after he had been at work for a time he would come to his senses anent his weakness and childish folly. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> of course never hear from him, but he writes often to Lotta short business official notes, touched up with despair. &#x2026; Poor dear fellow it makes me very fainthearted to think of him in the midst of all that carnage. &#x2026; If he would but be braver (not physically). &#x2026; Lotta and Johnny took themselves to South Place &#x2026; which they found in dreary plight the two mad women worse and worse, Aunt C. being now <hi rend="small-caps">Quite</hi> foolish, and Miss Campbell more pious idiotic, and dirty than ever.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute> I have got cold, since last week; worse at present; and am a very worthless man today: nevertheless I must write you a word, to report progress, if nothing more.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to Windsor, as arranged; was met on hands by the due facilities; had in fact good success,&#x2014;and much reason to thank the beneficent individualities who had made all roads so smooth for me there. The collection of Engraved Portraits, Miniatures &#x26;c &#x26;c far exceeds, in quantity and quality any I had ever had access to; some of them are of great excellence, great value as Historical possessions; and a larger proportion were of interest to me, in my present affair, than I could at all have expected. In short I was never in any Picture Gallery or similar establishment where I got half as much benefit,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-29-195" n="29:195"/>and that generally with the expence of twenty times as much misery and trouble as any I had to endure there. Glover is an intelligent handy cheerful man, of London-Official nature; not wanting in what learning is needful to him; and very expert, swift and orderly: he has driven <hi rend="italic">high-roads</hi> (of arrangement) very successfully through the big wilderness of things, and has it already well under command: for the rest he was civility itself to me (thanks to certain persons), and we grew very familiar in the course of the day. I had four very good hours there, and saw much that I shall remember: the only thing was, I <hi rend="italic">talked</hi> a great deal too much (having acquired no art of keeping silence, even where I want to do so, fool that I am!),&#x2014;and flurried all my nerves, even had there been no other mischief in it!</p>
<p>Towards 4 o&#x2019;clock there came a light footstep to the door; I still busy among a 100 Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Portraits did not look up; till Glover said, &#x201C;Prince Albert&#x201C;!&#x2014;and there in fact was his Royal Highness, come for a sight of the monster before he went;&#x2014;bowing very graciously, and not advancing till I bowed. Truly a handsome flourishing man and Prince; extremely polite (in the English way too);&#x2014;and with a far better pair of <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> than I had given him credit for in the distance. We had a very pretty little dialogue: about F<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> Portraits first (and your despised Picture now turned to the wall at Bath House,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The copy of Pesne&#x2019;s painting of Frederick as a child; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541004-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1854-10-04">4 Oct.</date></ref></note> the original of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is well known to H.R.H. came in among other things); after which, by a step or two, we got into the Saxon genealogies, Elector F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Wise,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Friedrich III, elector of Saxony.</note> Martin Luther, Wartburg, Coburg, and had the whole world free before us! Very fair indeed: but a noiseless, almost voiceless <hi rend="italic">waiter</hi> glided in just at this time, out of whom I caught the words, &#x201C;gone out to the Terrace&#x201C;;&#x2014;wherefore, after a minute or so, his R.H., our Dialogue winding itself up in some tolerable way, gracefully vanished (back foremost, as I noticed, the courteous man!) and I saw him no more. That was about the finale of my day; and I need not deny, was a pleasant, not a painful one,&#x2014;and left me with a multiplicity of thoughts, inarticulate and other, about the young Brother Mortal I had just been speaking to; thoughts surely not of an ungrateful unrecognising nature, whatever else they might be in these confused and confusing epochs of the world!&#x2014; That is the history of my day; which I thought good to lay at your Ladyship&#x2019;s feet, that you may see how &#x201C;the pleasure of the Lord prospers in your hand,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Isa. 53:10.</note> when you do kindnesses to your friends.</p>
<p>For the rest, I am in hopes to get <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> into this horrid Enterprise of mine, &#x201C;at the long and the last&#x201C; (as our Scotch phrase is): I actually must or go out of my wits before long. The prayers of good Christians (of a certain <pb id="pg-29-196" n="29:196"/>indifferent Christian in particular), and the utmost stretch of pity and toleration, are earnestly desired.&#x2014; Jane wrote, I understand; and is in some way to come: I too right willingly,&#x2014;but I think always in some quieter time; and then how cheering, pleasant and useful it might be! That is my hope;&#x2014;and really it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perhaps surprise you if you saw how little &#x201C;hope&#x201C; of any kind I can be said to have at this epoch of my affairs: all &#x201C;hopes&#x201C; pretty much gone into <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, of which I shall <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be disappointed. On the other hand no fear either, no &#x26;c &#x26;c; so that it comes all wonderfully nearly to <hi rend="italic">the same</hi>. We are a singular race of beings, we of the Posterity of Adam.</p>
<p>But when are you coming to Town again: never more?&#x2014; Please bring up that <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. rubbish I gave you last time; lest by chance it be wanted some way.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Answer</hi> to Neuberg&#x2019;s &#x201C;Petition&#x201C; has never come: Lord Clarendon&#x2019;s Note said it was all granted;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541026-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref></note> but there needs a half-page of formal writing signed by him and addressed to Neuberg before the poor man can get admittance. I begin to fear there has been some <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> difficulty occurred; the good &#x201C;Mr Lemon&#x201C; perhaps (for <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had seemed averse or uncertain, and only Lechmere the Chief returned me, after consulting with Lemon, an ardent emphatic Yea):&#x2014;or perhaps there may be nothing all that in it? Do not you trouble the harrassed Sec<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of State, or your own noble self, any farther in it. I will write to Lemon shortly, if this embargo continue; will explain to him a little; and fairly <hi rend="italic">give up the pretension</hi> if he continue irreconcilable, for he&#x2019;s a worthy man and servant in that place, and I would not have <hi rend="italic">pressure</hi> exercised upon him; so let the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> rest, I request you; let all rest&#x2014;till we see.&#x2014; Dark shades of winter and twilight are falling thro&#x2019; my very sky-window, &#x26; I must run. Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I fear is not yet well. I did not see Lady S<hi rend="italic">h</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sandwich.</note> again; perhaps Jane is there now.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >31 South St., Grosvenor Sq.</note> <closer><salute>May all the gods be good to you, Lady of the world.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your little Note from Glasgow the other morning; which I suppose you had to write with the <hi rend="italic">wrong finger</hi>,&#x2014;the more is the pity! That is really a bad job, and all the worse as it still bothers you, with <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> in <pb id="pg-29-197" n="29:197"/>addition to inability. The pain, no doubt, will go off; and I always try to flatter myself somehow the <hi rend="italic">power</hi> will come back,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; John tells me he fears, not, the sinew being gone. It appears there has been a great deal of <hi rend="italic">whitlow</hi> this year, more of such diseases in the hand than were ever known before: so said a London Doctor, attending one of Jane&#x2019;s ladyfriends who was suffering in that way; &#x201C;he had never known <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> so many cases as this year.&#x201C; A young working man, in the next street here, has <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> part of his hand (half of the thumb, I think); still goes with a sling; and was quite astonished by some strange malady he got of that kind.&#x2014; I beg you keep a good lookout, and don&#x2019;t use the hand <hi rend="italic">ill</hi>, lest it again grow worse upon you.</p>
<p>Perhaps John did come to you in Glasgow? He spoke of doing so, last letter; but I have heard nothing of later date than yours. I happened (by rare accident) to be writing to D. Hope, and mentioned that perhaps you would call. But probably you did not;&#x2014;probably he could have done little at any rate, tho&#x2019; very willing he would have been, good man. On the whole, if I could hear that you had got Jim fairly shifted into a better shop, it would give me real pleasure: I do not like to think of the poor lad puddling about in that barren Jew establishment. Tell me how the matter now stands: if you did fairly try for a new place, and how you sped?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning had written to James Carlyle, <date when="1854-10-30">30 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;have you ever been in partick [in Glasgow]. &#x2026; I have often heard that Glasgow is a very wicked Town &#x2026; . there are several very Cliver Ministers&#x201C; there (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note></p>
<p>I am trying desperately to get some progress made in my work here; but with lamentable want of success hitherto. Nothing but despair urges me on; I am like a poor old <hi rend="italic">garron</hi> yoked in a big waggon; I do <hi rend="italic">straighten the chains;</hi> but as to any turning of the wheels&#x2014;alas, alas! I have got a dirty cold too; am <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> as death, for most part, and hold away from company of my fellow creatures: <hi rend="italic">one</hi> good is possible for me, to get a little work still done, with or without wages. As our brave Father used to say, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll <foreign><hi rend="italic">gar</hi></foreign> myself do it,&#x201C;&#x2014;I must!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I went to Windsor; for the sake of innumerable Portraits, Engravings, Miniatures &#x26;c which I had got access to there. It is some 20 and odd miles off: one of the beautifullest Palaces,&#x2014;for situation &#x26;c much the beautifullest I ever saw. Built on a sheer steep Hill (high for these parts, and beautifully <hi rend="italic">clothed</hi>); commanding an immense plain, the richest in the Island; with Oak forests, with the River, with &#x26;c &#x26;c to all lengths. I regarded little or nothing of that; but proceeded straight to my Print rooms, where a Mr Glover the &#x201C;Librarian&#x201C; of the place, was extremely kind to me, and I saw really a great many things that may be useful in my operations; and had four diligent and goodish hours out of a day. I mean to go back when the weather is brighter (for Pictures and old eyes), and when &#x201C;the Court&#x201C; is not there. Towards 4 o&#x2019;clock, while I was busy with a <supplied>[h]</supplied>undred Prints of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>, <pb id="pg-29-198" n="29:198"/>there came a soft step to the door; I did not look up till Glover said; &#x201C;Prince Albert!&#x201C;&#x2014;and there in truth was the handsome young gentleman, very jolly and handsome in his loose greyish clothes, standing in the door, not advancing till I bowed. His figure and general face were well known to me, well-built figure of near my own height, florid <hi rend="italic">blond</hi> face (with fair hair); but the <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> were much better than I had fancied; a pair of strong steady eyes, with a good healthy briskness in them. He was civility itself, and in a fine simple fashion: a sensible man withal. We talked first of Fred<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> Portraits; then went, by a step or two, into the <hi rend="italic">Saxon genealogy</hi> line, into the Wartburg, Coburg, Luther, Frederick the Wise (that is the Prince who caught up Luther, put him safe into the Wartburg; he is <hi rend="italic">Ancestor</hi> of Albert); we had there abundant scope of talk, and went on very well, the Prince shewing me a Portrait he had copied of &#x201C;Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Wise&#x201C; (not ill done), telling of a Luther Autograph he had (from Coburg, and a joke appended to the getting of it there),&#x2014;when a <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> glided in upon us, murmured something, of which I heard, &#x201C;gone out to the Terrace!&#x201C; (Qu<supplied>[ee]</supplied>n out, wants you,&#x2014;he had been in Town all morning)&#x2014;whereupon, in a minute or two, our Dialogue winding itself up in some tolerable way, P<hi rend="italic">ce</hi> Albert (prince of Courtesy) bowed himself out, back foremost and with some indistinct mention of &#x201C;Your <hi rend="italic">works</hi>,&#x201C; which did not much affect me; and so ended our interview. I had had an indistinct questionable anticipation of some such thing all day; but tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> too I was safe, having <hi rend="italic">met</hi> his Carriage on the railway as I came. However, it was managed as you hear; and I was not ill pleased with it, nor had any reason&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">well</hi> pleased to have it over as you may fancy. <closer><salute>Not a word more, dear Jean.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Last night Mayer came to me himself with a new difficulty. He had that day taken the Stone to the ground, in a perfect state as he conceived, and meant to set it up, when the Manager or Clerk of the Cemetery (whose permit is requisite) objected that the name in his Books was <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fowler</hi>&#x201C;; that there was no such name as Fowler in his records, Doctors Letters, or other entries (tho&#x2019; evidently the one meant in this Inscription); and that it was contrary to <hi rend="italic">rule</hi>, and he could not permit it! Mayer had to no purpose demonstrated, pleaded; the man stood inflexibly upon his regulations; the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> line should have been (after the &#x201C;In memory of&#x201C;) &#x201C;Phoebe Hough <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>&#x201C; <pb id="pg-29-199" n="29:199"/>(&#x201C;only Daughter of&#x2014;Fowler&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Fowler; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18521105-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:349</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-11-05">5 Nov. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x26;c); and so it must now be, or the Stone could not go up.&#x2014; What was to be done? That one word, Mayer assured me, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> be changed to <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> without the least injury to the Stone, and without its being noticeable by any scrutiny: to have <hi rend="italic">started</hi> with, I thought it would perhaps have been fully as suitable, and would have pleased <hi rend="italic">you</hi> perhaps almost better. On the whole there was no alternative either, but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> or effacing the whole: so I permitted him;&#x2014;and this day (our appointment was) they are making that change; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, with renewing the <hi rend="italic">paint</hi> &#x26;c, will require two days. the stone is still in the cemetery (not brought back), where I am to go and see it today, and again after it is up.</p>
<p>Do not vex yourself my dear Brother about this thing. I believe poor Mayer is hardly to blame, and may be forgiven the oversight if it is one; nor is the poor Pedant Clerk to be blamed;&#x2014;nor, in fine, is the Inscription injured at all, if they do the thing <hi rend="italic">well</hi> which I shall take care they do.</p>
<p>Not knowing certainly where you are today (for you spoke of going to Glasgow for a short time), I will write no more at present than this the barely needful. By next Letter I hope to report that the work is all done and well, and this little act of piety properly accomplished. I am sorry there has been so much bother to you in it; I did not expect there could have been <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of these fluctuations and uncertainties that have occurred.</p>
<p>I am still working; but with a <hi rend="italic">success</hi> that is really pitiable! I must persevere, and get on better, under pain of going almost mad.&#x2014; The day before yesterday I was at Windsor, looking into Portraits, Prints, Miniatures &#x26;c (by private favour),&#x2014;saw many a thing; and at length &#x201C;the Prince&#x201C; himself, with whom there was a pleasant enough little Dialogue; of which you shall know all the particulars one day, if you like. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hat nichts zu bedeuten</hi></foreign> [It does not matter]. I returned home, much flurried by my day&#x2019;s travel and activity; and have had a worse dose of cold ever since.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I have come up hither with the Twisleton Note; a week ago I learned &#x201C;he had been here that very day,&#x201C; while at the Oxford and Cambridge they &#x201C;saw him rarely&#x201C;: so that I infer <hi rend="italic">this</hi> must be the Club for an Address;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oxford and Cambridge Club, Pall Mall. TC wrote on Athenaeum Club paper. Ellen Twisleton wrote, early in <date when="1854-11-00">Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Edward has met several of his friends at the Clubs. &#x2026; I cannot imagine women&#x2019;s wishing their husbands to give up their clubs,&#x2014;I only wish we ladies had some way of meeting our friends&#x201C; (Twisleton, <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 257).</note>&#x2014;but in passing thro&#x2019; the lobby, the real servant was out, and only a blockhead in his place; so that I as <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> cannot positively say till I go down again. Anyway I will take charge of getting the Note to him, if the common wit of man be (as we may suppose it) adequate to that function. Tw<hi rend="italic">n</hi> has never been to see me; so that it is possible he may have gone to the country again. He and his Wife, I heard, had pledged themselves not to leave Town this time <hi rend="italic">till</hi> they had secured a House.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Twisleton wrote, <date when="1854-11-10">10 Nov.</date>, that they had taken one, &#x201C;the smallest of all, in the best situation, Grosvenor Place, Hyde Park&#x201C; (259). They eventually settled at 3 Rutland Gate.</note> Which shall be well,&#x2014;for me, among others.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Item</hi>, on friday last the Paper actually got to Neuberg; and so all is right in that quarter,&#x2014;and was always, nothing <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>, except that Lord Clarendon&#x2019;s Clerk seems to have a 14 days <hi rend="italic">arrear</hi> on hand, in this busy time. Magnanimous Neuberg goes with me tomorrow to the State-Paper Office; there to be initiated and will save me a great deal of work&#x2014; Thanks again to your noble Ladyship, never wearied of helping a poor wretch when it is possible.</p>
<p>My cold is a little gone, still very troublesome after its sort; my attempts at <hi rend="italic">work</hi> are equal to L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Raglan&#x2019;s Siege<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Raglan, commander of British forces in the Crimea; presumably of Sebastopol.</note> in point of progress hitherto,&#x2014;and I (as well as he) am in very bad spirits continually. Perhaps if the <hi rend="italic">outworks</hi> were done,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A pun on the surroundings of Sebastopol and his own preparatory work for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</note> we shall get on better!</p>
<p>Seriously, it is a dreadful business that Sebastopol, that War in general, and people everywhere are beginning to be very pensive about it. To me it becomes <pb id="pg-29-201" n="29:201"/>a platitude daily more <hi rend="italic">tragic</hi>,&#x2014;1000 men lost in one sortie, they say,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC possibly refers to the heavy losses in the charge of the Light Brigade, Balaclava, <date when="1854-10-25">25 Oct.</date> The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1854-11-14">14 Nov.</date>, had a long account; Tennyson was moved to write &#x201C;The Charge of the Light Brigade,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1854-12-09">9 Dec.</date></note> &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and daily I wish more fervently we had <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with our Turk Allies and also our French d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and were well out of that affair; <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of it upon any tolerable terms whatever. Fergus, a large Fife <hi rend="italic">linen</hi> man, tells me the other night, he has had to dismiss 500 of his 1000 people; Peto is dismissing;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Morton Peto (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22042"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), partner in the great railway construction firm of Peto &#x26; Betts; was responsible for building a railway from the seaport to the entrenchments at Balaclava, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>; Liberal M.P. for Norwich, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>.</note> everybody is falling into sixes &#x26; sevens in his trade, owing to &#x201C;that poor body that has so many wives.&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sultan Abdul Mejid I; TC is quoting Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s correspondent; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541020-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1854-10-20">20 Oct.</date></ref></note></p>
<p>On Wednesday you can tell Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, the sight of my beard w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cut him to the heart, if he have any heart in respect of beards, which is doubtful. The fact is, it and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> grow uglier and uglier, in every way, <hi rend="italic">daily;</hi> and apparently there is no return or hope of amendment to either of us. <closer><salute>In the meanwhile, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of us (perhaps both) continues ever faithful to your Ladyship;&#x2014;and hopes bad times <hi rend="italic">may</hi> mend!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Lady, seriously enough. /</salute></closer> <name>T.C.</name></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is too certain I have committed an absurd mistake; which indeed I discovered two weeks ago, with an emotion compounded of remorse, astonishment, and the tendency to laugh and cry both at once!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott was puzzled and annoyed by TC&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1854-10-26">26 Oct.</date>, because, although he had been in TC&#x2019;s house only once or twice (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510302-TC-JCA-01"><sic>26:39</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1851-03-02">2 March 1851</date></corr></ref>), they belonged to the same circle and he was &#x201C;in every way &#x2026; favourably known to him.&#x201C; Also he thought he had heard &#x201C;the very same kind of sententious elocution&#x201C; from TC before. &#x201C;It seemed an echo of something written by him I had seen in a newspaper. My first feeling soon gave way to one of mirth at the absurdity of a man whose <hi rend="italic">doings</hi> had been very feeble indeed, only as a parish schoolmaster at Kirkcaldy, and who had subsided into endless objurgatory prose speech, but for which neither I nor any other man above the village blacksmith in that <hi rend="italic">lang town</hi> would ever have heard of him&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Notes</hi> 2:21&#x2013;23), Scott wanted to continue on friendly terms and wrote, <date when="1854-11-11">11 Nov.</date>, acknowledging TC&#x2019;s influence on him but saying he was the last person &#x201C;whom it is necessary to remind that what a man does is more important than what he says or sings.&#x201C; His whole life had taught him the necessity of work, &#x201C;if not for others, then for myself,&#x2014;thus I endeavored to establish my brother&#x2019;s claims by publishing his Memoir, and thus too I send you a little volume of poems, anything but amusements in their way. My habit of <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> brings me upon your warning against idle talking and singing! / But the odd thing is, that yours is the warning voice, since maxims the most opposite are so frequently to be found in your writings. You must have forgotten the circumstance long ago, but I once had the temerity to write you regretting the absence of a Hero of Work an Art-hero, from your book of Hero Worship. Curious it is to find myself replying to your late note as I now do. / But after all the thing I most want so say is, that my book of Poems <hi rend="italic">is something done;</hi> not merely said or sung, but for the most part experienced and in some part felt to the marrow of my life. If it were merely good singing it would meet approval from a greater number than it is likely to do as it is. / My dear sir with much respect Yours / William B. Scott&#x201C; (MS draft: Strouse).</note> The truth is, I am pestered with incipient volumes of <hi rend="italic">verses</hi> from young lads that feel something stirring in them; on the frontispiece of your little volume I read &#x201C;Printer&#x201C; (not <hi rend="italic">Painter</hi>, as I should have done), nor did your written Note, in the hurry I was in, recal to me your identity: fancying therefore that it was an ingenious Printer lad, in your coaly town, who was rashly devoting his extra gifts, evidently rather valuable ones, to the trade of verse-making, I wrote and admonished (hastily reading 5 or 6 <hi rend="italic">stanzas</hi> here and there) in the singular manner you experienced! Never was a more distracted <foreign><hi rend="italic">qui pro quo</hi></foreign> [answer].<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> On discerning that <hi rend="italic">Printer</hi> was &#x201C;Painter,&#x201C; and hearing that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had published a volume of Poems,&#x2014;I at once found my young &#x201C;Idle Apprentice&#x201C; converted into a grave earnest man, of mature mastership, and a beard almost as grey as <pb id="pg-29-203" n="29:203"/>my own; whose <hi rend="italic">surprise</hi> at my reception of him it was at once ludicrous and horrible to picture to myself! This is the naked truth; and I hope you will find in it an explanation of everything.</p>
<p>For the rest, I must say, you take the affair, even in its unexplained shape, in a spirit which I must call chivalrous and every way humane and noble; for which accept praises and thanks from me, very cordial indeed. I need not add that verses of your writing, <hi rend="italic">were</hi> they only the sport of well-earned leisure, come under a very different rubrick from verses by my supposed young gentleman playing truant;&#x2014;and are likely to be much more <hi rend="italic">deliberately</hi> &#x201C;read&#x201C; and judged of in this place;&#x2014;and that my doctrine about Work and Speech was, and continues to be, so far as I can perceive, precisely your own.</p>
<p>On the whole I will ask you to come and see me again, if you can spare half an hour (3 to 4 p.m.) while in London; to consider me reading your new Poems (as my purpose was) the first spare evening I had; and always as remembering with pleasure and respect the friendly man, recognisable as an earnest fellow-labourer in the vineyard,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 20:1&#x2013;2. Scott was not much placated by TC&#x2019;s apology: &#x201C;I had signed myself &#x2018;with much respect&#x2019; &#x2026; but &#x2026; I did not feel my respect quite so great now that the explanation had come. He had a stereotyped form of discouragement for the young, even although the idle apprentice could do what he now professed to respect, finding it the work of a middle-aged friend! I did go to see him again, and in the course of conversation he told us over again the same story he had told me before, and in the exact same words! The story was of his visit to the field of the Battle of Dunbar [see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430816-TC-EF-01"><sic>17:50</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1843-08-16">16 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>], in an autumn afternoon, and seeing Irish reapers resting all along the road after their long, weary journey [in <date when="1843-08-00">Aug. 1843</date>; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:92</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430904-TC-JWC-01"><sic>109&#x2013;10</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-04">4 Sept. 1843</date></corr></ref>]. Like the tenor of my letter, this story was evidently prepared as a show-piece of descriptive elocution! Alas! yet it had become so perhaps only after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>. Whether or not, I cannot open any of his greater works without thinking of him as one of the greatest men of our time&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiographical Notes</hi> 2:24&#x2013;25).</note> whom I once saw here. <closer><salute>You may believe me</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Yours very sincerely always</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>I got the Paper this morning; many thanks to you, and low apologies, for all the trouble you take: I perceive the ancient rudimentary <hi rend="italic">scrawlings</hi> of that confused Paper had been included in the ultimate edition of it, when I snatched up the whole, that evening, and gave it to you:&#x2014;I wonder you had not flung <hi rend="italic">it</hi> into the fire, in a rather forcible manner, along with the provoked <hi rend="italic">log</hi>! In fact you were much in error, your Ladyship was, as to my meaning <pb id="pg-29-204" n="29:204"/>about the Lord Chamberlain,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane.</note>&#x2014;but infinitely magnanimous withal; as indeed you are in the habit of being. Enough, we are all right now, on that side of things; and you go about like a beneficent Genius or Goddess, commanding intricate entanglements to disappear, and paths to open themselves for a poor wayworn individual; who is at least grateful for your help.&#x2014; Let me say however that there should really be a place found for that Picture of the Boy F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Drumming:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pesne&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540428-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-04-28">28 April</date></ref>.</note> yes indeed! There are 3 or 4 prints of it at Windsor, all rather coarse and bad; the Prince Consort suggested the original at Charlottenburg (as yet ignorant that there was a first-rate Copy in these parts);&#x2014;and indeed I think it an excellent Picture, if we look at practical <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> in Pictures, and forget a little the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">corregioscity of Corregio</hi>&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antonio Allegri da Correggio (ca. <date when="1494-00-00">1494</date>&#x2013;<date when="1534-00-00">1534</date>), Italian painter.

Hang it up, therefore; hide it not under a bushel;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 5:15, Mark 4:21, and Luke 11:33.</note> let one&#x2019;s eyes light on it now and then: that is my humble petition;&#x2014;and so I end.</p>
<p>Nothing goes on here but the old story; now drenched in three days of muddy rain, now (as today) dried again by fiercely howling northwind. Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> says you are well; which is right good news, coming by accident. He himself seems to be quite well again too, which we had always rather doubted till last night. Twisleton has <hi rend="italic">got</hi> his letter (as perhaps you know, if an answer have come): I inquired next day, and found <hi rend="italic">Yes</hi>.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541113-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1854-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note> Vaughan&#x2019;s Address is &#x201C;Hampstead,&#x201C;&#x2014;I suppose, sufficient if one put &#x201C;Oxford,&#x201C; &#x201C;Professor&#x201C; &#x26;c upon it; as I did last night, and sent it on its way. I have not seen the man for a long while; a worthy man, serious, studious and wise,&#x2014;rather inarticulate, and with a tendency to be slightly wearisome if you have him long!&#x2014; Thackeray, I hear, has fled the country somewhither, not being well in these weeks:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray&#x2019;s diary notes, &#x201C;Not well for the most part of the month,&#x201C; <date when="1854-10-31">31 Oct.</date>, an &#x201C;Attack of Spasms,&#x201C; <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov.</date>; his departure for Paris, <date when="1854-11-12">12 Nov.</date>, and return home, <date when="1854-11-29">29 Nov.</date> (Ray 3:677).

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for those two little Notes; which were of great value to me, and much relieved my mind about you. In fact I find it has been one of the ugliest situations;&#x2014;and I shall be right glad to hear you have got safe home to Assembly Street<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her home in Dumfries.</note> again with poor <hi rend="italic">Jim:</hi> you will there nourish him up at your leisure; and he will bloom out into new vigour again, poor young soul, for a <pb id="pg-29-206" n="29:206"/>fresh onslaught upon the world,&#x2014;we hope under better than the old Jew Captains he has had! Meanwhile, to get him strong again, that is the point; and to get your poor self strong again, that also seems to me a great point, and well worth attending to so far as possible!</p>
<p>Jack is again gone wandering, somewhere into Lancashire; and for the present I have lost his address; but probably shall hear of him again tomorrow. Poor soul, I perceive he has no fixed scheme hitherto; fundamentally nothing to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> (that is not more or less imaginary), and knows <supplied>[not]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted. Cf. Matt. 8:20.</note> where to lay down his head,&#x2014;nor, alas, can any of us shew him where. He looked very unhappy even before Phoebe&#x2019;s death: I doubt his life is shaken much into disarray, poor soul; and there is nothing I would more gladly do than help him towards some haven, if I could by any method. But it is not easy: often he is in my disconsolate thoughts; and one has to think mournfully, in general, of the &#x201C;changes which fleeting Time procureth,&#x201C; as the poor old Ballad says.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note></p>
<p>Jane is going down to The Grange on the 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of next month; I do not go then, nor for certain at all: I have contrived to refuse, as inoffensively as I could, being flatly determined that I could not and would not go at that particular time. Ah me!&#x2014; Till the <date when="1855-01-02">2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date> therefore I am alone here; doing whatever I can (which is sorrowfully <hi rend="italic">little</hi>) towards getting <hi rend="italic">work</hi> forward: what other thing have I left for me? <hi rend="italic">On</hi> the <date when="1855-01-02">2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>,&#x2014;we shall see! I know not what Jack&#x2019;s plans are, or whether he is coming in this direction at all: we heard from some other quarter, he thought of wintering at <hi rend="italic">Clifton</hi> (suburb of Bristol): he writes continual notes to me, but contrives (as usual) to tell me almost nothing, or altogether nothing. I mean to inquire more specially the first time I write</p>
<p>A paltry little cold, coming and going, has hung about me for some time; it is pretty well off me at present; and as times go, I ought to report myself rather well than otherwise. Meanwhile I have carpenters again upon me; grate-smiths &#x26;c,&#x2014;to rage for two days yet, like the sack of Babylon<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Dan. 5.</note> (or the taking of Sebastopol, if it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> taken)! On deciding for a <hi rend="italic">carpet</hi> (when the cold weather came, and &#x201C;drugget&#x201C; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> no longer do) I perceived, more glaringly than ever that my new floor had been all made of <hi rend="italic">green wood</hi> (an incredible fact, but not an uncommon one here); that a pennypiece could be introduced anywhere between the planks, and that torrents of cold were pouring in <hi rend="italic">there</hi>,&#x2014;as the one fruit I had got from my &#x201C;ventilating trunks&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Closing my <hi rend="italic">lips</hi> (for what good is there in talk) I had to decide on mending this misery;&#x2014;and so for a week I am banished again, and sit inconveniently down stairs, my Books &#x26;c inaccessible and the house not pleasanter <pb id="pg-29-207" n="29:207"/>than common!&#x2014; I bore away, however, with a respectable Obstinacy: it sometimes seems to me the heavy wheels are groaning round at last, and the big waggon making some way thro&#x2019; its sea of quagmires: this, when you have stood many months tugging desperately at the chains without the least results (except breaking <hi rend="italic">them</hi> now and then) is a consolation, a certain glimmer of consolation, under everything! But I must not <hi rend="italic">brag</hi> yet; nor will I.</p>
<p>Soon after Monday then, if no earlier, I shall look for another word from you; may it be that you have got to Dumfries, and are wholesomely at home again.&#x2014; All the world is in disconsolation here about Sebastopol: indeed it seems to me one of the wretchedest things I ever looked at, taken altogether; but only what was to be looked for, being wholly the work of the <hi rend="italic">fools</hi> among us, not of the wise. I suppose they must take Sebastopol, if they should <hi rend="italic">all</hi> die for it;&#x2014;and it will avail them nothing (I fear) when taken. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister; good &#x26; swift return-home to you!</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have got your Letter; but have not (contrary to my hopes) the least time to write;&#x2014;nor any paper but this;&#x2014;being <hi rend="italic">again</hi> driven out of my &#x201C;room&#x201C; (sorrow on all <hi rend="italic">quack</hi> work!) by carpenters <hi rend="italic">re</hi>laying the floor &#x26;c &#x26;c!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Neuberg,&#x2014;</salute>We expected you last night: I began to reflect, however, that <pb id="pg-29-208" n="29:208"/>it had been only my own understanding of the thing, and that there was no express appointment. Let us now settle it so: Whilst this State-Paper &#x26;c business lasts, we are to meet on Sunday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, unless at any time the <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi> be specified.</p>
<p>Last week I made poor way; having again an invasion of <hi rend="italic">Carpenters</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Carpet</hi> people &#x26;c &#x26;c;&#x2014;nevertheless did not quite give in: there is a stock of <hi rend="italic">Copying</hi> now on hand,&#x2014;no great <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> about it either.</p>
<p>On Saturday or Friday I got that Stuttgart Letter: as the man apparently has nothing to give <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, I design merely to send him a <hi rend="italic">List</hi> of my Books, and bid Heaven help him. I suppose his Translator will be some poor young man, greatly incompetent for such a task: I could have greatly preferred <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for the operation, had it come in your way, and had you wished to accept it.&#x2014; By the bye, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> is the case, I suppose the former may at once be so? In that contingency (namely if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wish it) I will at once (hereby) employ <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to answer &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chelius</hi> of Stuttgard&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified further.</note> for me, and to lead him as you like by such bridle as there is! But I suspect you had better not meddle with him; he looks too like a &#x201C;railway literature&#x201C; gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> to come to much. I rather judge he should be left to his fate.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Schubarts Leben</hi> I have been reading, these 3 evenings. Strauss&#x2019;s part of it is very well done; with a certain stern business-brevity, conclusiveness and precision, that are very rare among German Editors. Schubart himself is a sad <foreign><hi rend="italic">Olla Podrida</hi></foreign> [Hodge-podge] of flabby nonsenses; but Karl the <hi rend="italic">Tyrann</hi> appears very diabolic in the background.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C. D. F. Schubart, <hi rend="italic">Leben in seinen Briefen, gesammelt, bearbeitet und herausgegeben von David Friedrich Strauss</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).

<p>I am delighted to hear of the Dickens element:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a dinner invitation.

I know it contains nothing in which you do not think with me, for no man knows your books better than I. I want to put in the first page of it, that it is inscribed to Thomas Carlyle. <date when="1854-05-00">May</date> I?&#x201C; TC agreed.</note> Saturday, then, let that <pb id="pg-29-209" n="29:209"/>stand instead of Thursday;&#x2014;I shall hope withal to have this vile cold a little better in subjection before then.</p>
<p>The pressure of grate-smiths, carpenters &#x26;c is still strong upon me: on the whole, I am definable as &#x201C;an unhappy man&#x201C; in these days that are passing. Foiled in all &#x201C;work,&#x201C; too;&#x2014;but we must not <hi rend="italic">yield</hi> to the Devil!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I know not well where you are: but here is a Note (no doubt, his <hi rend="italic">Account</hi>) which Mares left the night before last; and I am uneasy, or fancy myself so, till it get into your hands. Mares came himself; but I was at dinner, and had no long interview with him;&#x2014;indeed there was nothing more to have been said <pb id="pg-29-210" n="29:210"/>or talked, had we had the whole day at our disposal. The <hi rend="italic">Stone</hi>, he informed me (and as I had seen) was now all right; the evergreens &#x26;c put in:&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-change of the Name, he farther said, was not by specific <hi rend="italic">agreement</hi> with the Clerk of the place, but merely by <hi rend="italic">tacit sufferance;</hi> if they ever did make any objection (of which there did not seem now the least risk), he, Mares, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the person applied to, and he would and could at once make the change.&#x2014; In short, I suppose, there is nothing now to do but to pay him his account, and so end with him. A Draught on some London Bank, such as they furnish at Dumfries, with a stamp on it, and your Name written across the stamp,&#x2014;this way, or some handier that the Bankers may have, will be the method.</p>
<p>We have very wild bad weather here; nothing but deluges of rain for a week past. Yesternight, deceived by a bright day, I went out without an umbrella; got <hi rend="italic">damped</hi> thro&#x2019; my thick coat; and thereby give myself a fresh dose of cold,&#x2014;to reinforce the dirty stock I have already had for a good many weeks past, which has been a visible addition to my plagues and dispiritments of late. I have only <hi rend="italic">today</hi> got a carpet on my room, the floor, fireplace &#x26;c all put right (<hi rend="italic">am</hi> still in the drawingroom): my poor <hi rend="italic">task</hi> has not profited by these accompaniments. It is such a task as I never had, for distress, confusion, aridity, disgust, and even <hi rend="italic">remorse:</hi> however, I do persist: the only remedy lies in <hi rend="italic">getting done with it</hi>. And indeed that is (pretty literally) <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the recompense I expect from it.&#x2014; For these two days, furthermore, I am occupied with a dirty, genealogical historical bit of stuff wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to come out as &#x201C;Article&#x201C; in the new <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Prinzenraub,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540727-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-07-27">27 July</date></ref>.</note> &#x26; which is in the most refractory condition just now,&#x2014;in &#x201C;slips&#x201C; that came yesternight; <hi rend="italic">un</hi>readable to gods and men.

Burton wrote, <date when="1854-12-05">5 Dec.</date>, from Edinburgh: &#x201C;My friend Mr. Ellice told me that he thought you would like to possess a copy of some letters chiefly french addressed to David Hume edited by me some years ago and it is with very much pleasure that I post the volume.&#x201C;</note> and return you many hearty thanks for what you have done.&#x2014; So far as I read, there is not the least error in the French; nor any objection of any <pb id="pg-29-211" n="29:211"/>kind to be made against a piece of charitable labour so undeniably useful and desirable in Literature.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burton wrote to explain why &#x201C;so poor a french scholar&#x201C; should have edited French letters. &#x201C;It was understood that when I was done with them they were to be finally locked up &#x26; that my having been allowed the use of them was to be a reason for the body possessing them declining to be troubled by the application of others to see them. In this state of matters I thought it incumbent on me&#x2014;with all my imperfections as a linguist&#x2014;to endeavour to secure them for the use of literature&#x2014;and hence &#x2026; I copied these french letters &#x26; printed some copies in the volume I send.&#x201C; He wrote in his Introduction that &#x201C;having selected &#x2026; the portions&#x201C; for &#x201C;my immediate object&#x2014;the preparation of a Life of Hume, a quantity of documents still remained. &#x2026; I felt that I might be considered guilty of culpable neglect to the interests of literature, if I failed to render accessible &#x2026; the intellectual treasures of so curious and valuable a collection&#x201C; (iii).</note></p>

<p>Mr Ellice was possessed, last winter, of certain <hi rend="italic">Collectanea</hi> you had made concerning the <hi rend="italic">Keiths</hi>, Lord Marischal and his younger Brother the Prussian Field-Marshall;&#x2014;and was to give me a sight of the printed leaves (printed, he could not tell me where,&#x2014;probably in the <hi rend="italic">Spalding Club</hi> Books);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Keith (<date when="1693-00-00">1693</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>), 9th Earl Marischal, Jacobite and favorite of Frederick the Great; his brother James Francis Edward (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440420-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>18:16</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1844-04-20">20 April 1844</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520606-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>27:138</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1852-06-06">6 June 1852</date></corr></ref> [where named Frederick in error for Francis]) was made field marshal by Frederick. TC and Ellice probably refer to the <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Field-Marshal James Keith</hi> (Edinburgh: Spalding Club, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>). For the Spalding Club, see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18440210-TC-DL-01"><sic>17:261</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1844-02-10">10 Feb. 1844</date></corr></ref>; or possibly <hi rend="italic">Memoirs and Correspondence (Official and Familiar) of Sir R. M. K</hi>., ed. Mrs. Gillespie Smyth, 2 vols. (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), which gives letters about the Lord Marischal and Field Marshal Keith, cousins of Sir Robert Murray Keith (<date when="1730-00-00">1730</date>&#x2013;<date when="1795-00-00">95</date>), lt.-gen. and diplomat, and which TC calls &#x201C;a very interesting Collection &#x2026; edited with the usual darkness, of rather more&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:423n). All three Keiths are often mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>.</note> but he never did it, never could even tell me <hi rend="italic">where</hi> the piece was to be sought for. I guess beforehand it must be <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> &#x26;c, and that these are probably of no great moment; the Old Marischal, whenever I have hitherto met with him, being a very <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> and light old gentleman (his Brother considerably less so), <pb id="pg-29-212" n="29:212"/>and Frederick&#x2019;s Letters to him, mostly mere formal complimentary Notes, having only their kindness to recommend them.</p>
<p>I can by no means consent that you should take the trouble to <hi rend="italic">send</hi> me the Spalding volume, or whatever volume it is;&#x2014;do not by any means: for truly the thing is not of much moment to me, nor in the least a thing of haste. Only if you will, some time, any time, tell me where it is (what the Title of the volume is), I can at once find it here, &#x26; at once get what I want out of it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burton replied to TC from Edinburgh, <date when="1854-12-25">25 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;I have deferred a reply from a vague notion that I once knew of a collection of papers about the Keiths being somewhere accessible but I have not yet been able to recall the fact.&#x201C; He thought the book TC referred to was probably the Spalding Club <hi rend="italic">Memoir</hi>. Asking whether TC knew of Varnhagen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Leben des &#x2026; Keith</hi> (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440420-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>18:16</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1844-04-20">20 April 1844</date></corr></ref>), he offered to &#x201C;lend you either or both of the volumes. I have found the book borrowing world divided into two classes those who return books &#x26; those who do not. &#x2026; I shall take for granted that nature has placed you in the former of these classes.&#x201C;</note></p>

My poor Brother too has been here, to confuse us farther: a poor wandering soul, ever since the tragedy of August last.

<p>Neither have I the happiness to sympathize with my countrymen in this magnificent Turk war they have got into, and are all talking about. On the contrary, I reckon it one of the maddest wars lately heard of: Undertaken with immense enthusiasm of all the noisy, unwise classes and with all the quiet and wise indifferent to it, or dead against it. One wish possesses these latter, I think: that of handsomely terminating said war. For my own share, I know little about Czar Nicholas and his Russia, though often enquiring after him and it; but it is my private notion, the Czar Nicholas may probably <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a king doing more real king <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, than all the other kings that now are,&#x2014;much outweighing the whole lot of them in intrinsic value;&#x2014;and I have always well understood the Turks to be a set of dark, fanatical and sensual blockheads, <hi rend="italic">waiting</hi>, these three hundred years, to be thrown into the Black sea by anybody that was passing that way, and had leisure for the job. At least and lowest, it all surely lies a long way out of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> road; and God knows we had work enough at home, if we had stood to it. John Sterling&#x2019;s brother is now before Sebastopol, &#x201C;Colonel Sterling&#x201C; or &#x201C;Adjutant General&#x201C; (I know not what title:), unhurt hitherto: No other friend, at all near to me, is concerned there, as yet.&#x2014;</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sister</hi>,</salute>
<p>I got a little newspaper from you yesterday; I had a short letter from you not long before; and newspapers come now and then, testifying that you go on without bad accident, which it is always a pleasure to us to know. I am kept very busy here, hunted about by confusions of which you can have little idea! However, I determine to write a word today, the <hi rend="italic">first thing</hi> in the morning, let the rest of the day&#x2019;s work go as it will. Tho&#x2019; I absolutely write no letter that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be avoided, this seems to me to be one that ought to be written.</p>
<p>I have not been in Annandale, nor anywhere away from home even for a day, since the last sad journey I made about a year ago &#x2026; . I have been in poorish health, rather worse than you used to witness in me (but) not very <hi rend="italic">much</hi> worse,&#x2014;in fact the chief origin of it is, confusions of many kinds that have long been going on with &#x201C;repairing of the house&#x201C; here, (a very sad and almost endless business, as I find, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> suitable to a thin skinned man), this with <hi rend="italic">sorrows</hi> which you may judge of in part (irreparable <hi rend="italic">losses</hi> in which you also have shared), and as the result of all, little or no visible progress possible for me in the work I have on hand, is the chief cause of my sicklier condition of late. Besides, it is certain enough I am getting <hi rend="italic">old;</hi> nor do I forget that most serious fact: however, it is really wonderful how softly I am handled in that respect hitherto; only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of my eyes has yet given symptoms of failing; and except the dispiritment, and indeed the <hi rend="italic">indifference</hi>, about most earthly things, I trace wonderfully little effect of age on me yet. I hope too, by obstinate persistence, to get on a little better with my tasks; and on the whole to improve a little by-and-by. Jane too continues much as you knew her; is subject to colds, &#x26;c., in winter time; but has generally better health,&#x2014;I should say certainly not worse,&#x2014;than she has been used to these thirty years now.</p>
<p>[&#x201C;Then he goes into details of deaths and other events, among their brothers and sisters and other relatives and friends and neighbours she knew, and coming round to her affairs and her husband, Robert Hanning, he says:&#x201C;] You need not doubt we are right glad to hear of Robert&#x2019;s steady industrious behaviour, and of your content with one another. The little lasses<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret and Mary, whom TC had known; he may also refer to Catherine Ann. The fourth da. Jane was possibly not yet born.</note> too will be growing apace. Try always to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> him and them in all good things, dear <pb id="pg-29-216" n="29:216"/>Jenny: that you will find to be a great gain in the end. And take care of your health.</p>
<p>[&#x201C;Then he gives news about the weather of late and says:&#x201C;] That and the Turk War are what we mainly talk of. Give my ever-affectionate regards to Alick whom I have loved for near sixty years now! <closer><salute>My blessings on you and your household, dear sister.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I believe your bilious fit will do you good: it is probably the consequence of our long walk to and from Neuberg&#x2019;s together;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of altogether 10 mi.</note> which ailed, not quite in that way, but in an analogous one, on me too; and was accepted as advantageous.</p>
<p>My work goes ill on here; which is purely the fruit of my own languid inability to grapple heartily with it and crush it down under me. For which, except in myself, there is evidently no remedy! I merely need to get sufficiently wretched over it; then I shall rise in despair, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do it. My progress depends far more on the <hi rend="italic">stomach</hi> than on anything else; which indeed has always been sadly the case with me, but seldom to such an extent as now in these hebetated times.</p>
<p>Jane has got considerably better; fairly round out of her weakest phasis, the specific <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> about gone: she had gone out when I was last down stairs, to take advantage of the fine clean temperate day we have.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Twisleton wrote from Paris, <date when="1854-12-16">16 Dec.</date>, that she had gone to say goodbye, <date when="1854-12-01">1 Dec.</date>, to JWC &#x201C;who had been ill, ever since we were there.&#x201C; She had then breakfasted, <date when="1854-12-02">2 Dec.</date>, with Macaulay who wound up the conversation &#x201C;with an attack on Carlyle, not begun by Macaulay, but which he closed, by a most inimitable parody of the style of the French Revolution, applied to the coming opening of Parliament, at which it was impossible to help roaring with laughter. &#x2026; I do not think there is as much depth or heart in his conversation as in Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x2026; as I don&#x2019;t think there is, either, in his writings. &#x2026; Carlyle said once to Edward that there was &#x2018;something very brotherly about him,&#x2019; and that was just what struck me most&#x201C; (Twisleton, <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 255&#x2013;56).</note> It seems to me to be settled that she will go to the The Grange after all; on Wednesday next,&#x2014;after many outings and innings upon it. The Ashburtons are here for the Parliament; are to go again on Monday: I continue here safe in my garret for the <pb id="pg-29-217" n="29:217"/>present. My room is now much better; the grate decidedly improved, and much cold air excluded by pasting: I calculate I shall yet make a rather nice and warm room of it, and be comparatively very snug here, at least in the winter time.&#x2014; I got a Newspaper from Jenny this week (date, <date when="1854-11-24">24 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>), and wrote to the poor little soul since; I had also about two weeks ago a Newspaper from Alick (date <date when="1854-11-02">2 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>): we are widely scattered over the world;&#x2014;but it might be far worse too, and will not always be <hi rend="italic">so well</hi>. There is great animation here to prosecute the Turk War (which indeed is our only course now: Go all at it, since it is here, and finish it if we all can!)&#x2014;a quantity of babble is nearly all the talk one hears.&#x2014; I saw Farie the other day; asking for you; well, and as dull as ever. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your Pamphlet; and return many thanks for all your kindness to me. I am sorry to learn, as I do for the first time from this Narrative, what angry nonsense some of my countrymen see good to write of me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1854-11-00">Nov.</date> the Glasgow Univ. Conservative Club proposed Disraeli as rector. The Liberal Assoc. nominated TC, &#x201C;partly as a tribute of respect and gratitude, partly in opposition to a statesman whom they then distrusted.&#x201C; TC was attacked in the press, which charged him with irreligion and contempt for the poor and distressed and said that he lacked &#x201C;the talent,&#x201C; &#x201C;the distinction,&#x201C; and &#x201C;the position which entitle a man to such an honour as the Rectorial Chair.&#x201C; In the end both names were withdrawn. Nichol said of TC&#x2019;s supporters that they &#x201C;had nothing on which to congratulate themselves save that only the benches of the rooms in which they had held their meetings had been riotously broken&#x201C; (Nichol 123&#x2013;25).</note> Not being much a reader of Newspapers, I had hardly heard of the Election till after it was finished; and I did not know that anything of this melancholy element of Heterodoxy, &#x201C;Pantheism,&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, had been introduced into the matter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One ewspaper said: &#x201C;Elect him and you bid God-speed to Pantheism and spiritualism&#x201C; (Nichol 124).</note> It is an evil, after its sort, this of being hated and denounced by fools and ignorant persons; but it cannot be mended for the present; and so must be left standing there.</p>
<p>That another wiser class think differently, nay that they alone have any real knowledge of the question, or any real right to vote upon it, is surely an abundant compensation. If that be so, then all is still right; and probably <pb id="pg-29-218" n="29:218"/>there is no harm done at all!&#x2014; To you, and the other young Gentlemen who have gone with you on this occasion, I can only say that I feel you have loyally meant to do me a great honour and kindness; that I am deeply sensible of your genial recognition, of your noble enthusiasm (which reminds me of my own young years); and that in fine there is no loss or gain of an Election which can in the least alter these valuable facts, or which is not wholly insignificant to me in comparison with them. &#x201C;Elections&#x201C; are not a thing transacted by the gods, in general; and I have known very unbeautiful creatures &#x201C;elected&#x201C; to be kings, chief-priests, railway kings, &#x26;c, by the &#x201C;most sweet voices,&#x201C; and the spiritual virtue that inspires these, in our time!</p>
<p>Leaving all that, I will beg you all to retain your honourable good feelings towards me; and to think that if anything I have done or written can help any one of you in the noble problem of living like a wise man, in these evil and foolish times, it will be more valuable to me than never so many Elections or Non-elections.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We have not heard of you this long while, and I have almost lost your address. But I am vividly reminded of you today, by a Letter from Mr Everett of Boston in America;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written to Edward Everett, <date when="1853-12-02">2 Dec. 1853</date>, sending it and the tithe book of Ecton parish, Northamptonshire, from which Franklin&#x2019;s ancestors came, with Samuel Laurence; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531202-TC-EE-01"><sic>28:330&#x2013;31</sic><corr>TC to EE, <date when="1853-12-02">2 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> who <hi rend="italic">has</hi>, at last, after such delay, got into his hands the old Franklin Tithe-Book<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531124-TC-HTW-01"><sic>28:322&#x2013;23</sic><corr>TC to HTW, <date when="1853-11-24">24 Nov. 1853</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>Dear Mr Everett,</salute>
<p>Your Letter has arrived a day or two ago; one of the pleasantest things that has fallen in my way of late; and worthy to shine as a luminous point in this dark Hollow of the Year, which no Yule-Logs can now make very cheerful to me. I had inferred that the delay was Lawrence&#x2019;s;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Laurence had taken the book.</note> who has many virtues, but not that of promptitude, or rapidity in getting done with business. Indeed it is the good man&#x2019;s worst fault, this that I could call want of <hi rend="italic">rapidity</hi>; his chief defect both as man and Artist;&#x2014;and I hope you will cure him of it in your rapid Country, where, it would appear, he has some thought of continuing, so very kind (for which I too have debts both in New-York and Massachusetts) has his reception been.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-220" n="29:220"/>Now, however, all is right with this matter of the old Tithe-Book; and I am heartily pleased to find that it so pleases you, and is to have such honours as you indicate. A poor half-foolish and yet partly very serious and worthy old object has been recovered from its vague wanderings over Cosmos and Chaos, and at length helped into its right place in the Creation: for which small mercy let us be thankful;&#x2014;and wish only that, in bigger cases (of which in Nature there are so many, and of such a tragical sort), the same perfect service could always be done! Alas, alas!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Today I am in considerable haste; but would not lose a post in answering you about the Letter you speak of. I quite forget what was in the Letter in question; but do not doubt it would be some transcript of my then feelings about the matter on hand,&#x2014;part of the truth, therefore, and I hope not of the untruth, in regard to it:&#x2014;and I will very willingly commit it altogether to your friendly discretion to make whatever use of it you find to be reasonable and feasible. And so we will say, Long life to Franklin&#x2019;s memory! and add our little shout to that of the Bostoners in inaugurating their monument for him. &#x201C;Long life to the memory of all brave men&#x201C;;&#x2014;to which prayer, if we could add only, &#x201C;Speedy death to the memory of all who were not so,&#x201C; it would be a comprehensive petition, and of salutary tendencies, in the epoch of Barnum and Hudson!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have still a determination to buy John Cotton,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Cotton (<date when="1584-00-00">1584</date>&#x2013;<date when="1652-00-00">1652</date>), Puritan cleric, an able and influential figure, once vicar of St. Botolph&#x2019;s, Lincolnshire, who emigrated to Mass., <date when="1633-00-00">1633</date>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460220-TC-GLC-01"><sic>20:126</sic><corr>TC to GLC, <date when="1846-02-20">20 Feb. 1846</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:7&#x2013;9. TC refers to Cotton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Commentary &#x2026; upon the First Epistle Generall of John</hi> (<date when="1656-00-00">1656</date>); see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460101-TC-CHC-01"><sic>20:89</sic><corr>TC to CHC, <date when="1846-01-01">1 Jan. 1846</date></corr></ref>. Ellen Twisleton mentions visiting the church in a letter to his sister, Elizabeth, <date when="1852-09-07">7 Sept. 1852</date>, and her pleasure in seeing it (MS: Houghton).</note> if he ever turn up again. But he never has, since you last heard, when he was prematurely snatched away from me. Either his works must be becoming scarce; or perhaps (which is likelier) the Theological class of Old-Book Sellers are beginning to know their man, and do not send Catalogues as formerly. It is very possible I may never meet with Cotton more: but if I do, there shall certainly be a bid man. He was a man of real intelligence, I believe: but it is sad to think how <hi rend="italic">obsolete</hi> all human intelligences (or very <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> all) grow, in a short course of generations. The human species drifts quite away from <hi rend="italic">their</hi> old latitudes and coasts; and cannot bear the most intelligent talk on the aquatic or terrestrial phenomena that were visible there:&#x2014;only the <hi rend="italic">stars</hi>, certain stars and constellations (so to speak) continue visible thro&#x2019; long ages, and are still a present object, for some few.&#x2014;Cotton&#x2019;s memorial is properly the newer <hi rend="small-caps">Boston</hi>: that he carried some echo of poor old <hi rend="italic">St. Botolph</hi> (who little expected it in those Lincolnshire Fens)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saint Botolph (d. 680); founded a monastery probably on the site of present Boston (Botolphstown), Lincs.</note> across the Atlantic, on those surprising terms: this is the <pb id="pg-29-221" n="29:221"/>smallest but by far the most immortal of the actions of Cotton.&#x2014; But I must cease, I must cease.</p>
<p>It gives me great satisfaction to figure you as safe out of the tempests of public life;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Everett had resigned as senator from Mass., <date when="1854-06-01">1 June</date>. His speech against the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, which repealed the slavery restriction law of the Missouri Compromise (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>), was &#x201C;cool, passionless &#x2026; without a spark of the indignant spirit of the North&#x201C; (cited: Alan Nevins, <hi rend="italic">Ordeal of the Union</hi> 2 [New York, <date when="1947-00-00">1947</date>]:141). He was absent for the vote, <date when="1854-03-04">4 March</date>, claiming ill health. His Mass. constituents were incensed, leading to his resignation.</note> restored to yourself and your books and thoughts, in an agreeable country retreat, after so many years of hard work. The late Dr Chalmers used to say The <hi rend="italic">seventh</hi> decade of a man&#x2019;s life ought to be of <hi rend="italic">Sabbatic</hi> character;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Chalmers; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, 251.</note> devoted to rest and meditation. Poor Chalmers, in his own case, experienced quite the opposite fate; his &#x201C;seventh decade&#x201C; having produced Free Church, and more noise than he had ever known before.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Disruption of the Church of Scotland, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, and the founding of the Free Church of Scotland, of which Chalmers was one of the leaders; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430120-TC-MAC-01"><sic>16:28&#x2013;29</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1843-01-20">20 Jan. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> But the wish is pious and natural; and one rejoices to see it fulfilled for a good man. I myself am but a few years younger, and certainly in point of ill-health you are not my superior: I too long towards the still waters with my whole soul; but there is small chance of my ever managing that change! I am involved in inextricable dusty confusions here, as if I were still young, and able to vanquish them: chaotic &#x201C;German Dryasdust,&#x201C; Frederick of Prussia, and I know <supplied>[not]</supplied><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> what; which really (with other allies they have) are like the sons of Zeruiah &#x201C;too strong for me,&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zeruiah, cf. 2 Sam. 3:39.</note> and threaten to be my <hi rend="italic">end</hi> one day. However, we must try, we must try!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Miss Delia Bacon, whom I think you know a little, has been for about a year past in St Alban&#x2019;s (the great Verulam Bacon&#x2019;s place); writing, out of her own brain, the demonstration that Shakspeare did not write Shakspeare&#x2019;s Plays: which seems to me a rather lamentable case! She is now back in Town here; but I have not got so far as her place, nor has she come hither,&#x2014;being a very delicate, indeed painfully shy Lady, tho&#x2019; of evident worth, talent, and well liked in this house.&#x2014; Emerson never writes to me, or not once in many months, the sinful man; please give him my regards if he ever come athwart you.&#x2014; I had much to say about America, England and the world; but must suppress it all,&#x2014;unless you will write again, some time before long, and again set me going? <closer><salute>I beg you to believe me at all times,&#x2014;Yours most sincerely</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is very possible you may have yourself heard from Jean; but if not, or even any way, the enclosed Note may be worth sending you: the little sketch of the Mason working over his &#x201C;Ezechiel Wheel,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Jean&#x2019;s letter, of an unidentified Glasgow mason; for the &#x201C;Ezechiel Wheel,&#x201C; see the vision in Ezekiel ch. 1 and 10.</note> to shorten labour, or abolish pain, and bring in the new Era, gives us a very curious glimpse into the &#x201C;sin and misery&#x201C; of this epoch!&#x2014; At lowest this patch of paper will be a message from me to the Boys and you before the week terminate.</p>
<p>I have been busy enough, often, but very seldom with almost any perceptible success: I see nobody; I sit all day here, sally rapidly out about dusk; read, not often with much speech all evening;&#x2014;determine to try to the uttermost whether this beggarly thing shall quite best me in my old days! On the whole, I feel it will not and shall not. And that is really all the good of it.&#x2014; Except that, and multifarious thoughts, which have a certain sad greatness while kept in the silent state, but are apt to explode into the angry form if I utter them, I have no history at present. Thoughts enough;&#x2014;and the thought of a certain &#x201C;Christmas&#x201C; we once saw, and shall none of us ever forget, is vivid enough among them.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their mother had died <date when="1853-12-25">25 Dec. 1853</date>.</note> Ah me, ah me! But that surely is all peaceable and well; safe in the still and pure Eternity, where we too, with our work or no-work, shall soon be!&#x2014; Much is gone <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Christmas: but we must not murmur over the Past; the Present and the Future, these still make offers to us; our one business is, to profit wisely by these.</p>
<p>Jane continues to improve a little; but has not gone to The Grange; which probably was a judicious determination. There is a great <foreign><hi rend="italic">cohue</hi></foreign> [clamorous gathering] of people there, ever-shifting figures, mostly unprofitable and even wearisome to me: I suppose we may still go at some future time, but it shall be when the house is empty or nearly so.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Brookfield noted in his diary, <date when="1855-01-01">1 Jan. 1855</date>, the large number of guests at the Grange at Christmas: &#x201C;The Carlyles had been expected to arrive &#x2026; but were prevented. &#x2026; I spoke of missing Carlyle less than I had supposed, when Lady A. broke in, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Oh, nobody is ever missed</hi>&#x2019;&#x201C; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:412).</note></p>
<p>A Professor Vaughan came last night; an accomplished, serious and able Oxford man, whom I think you do not know. Better worth talking to than anybody I have tried for weeks. T. Ballantyne was also here; going to do a <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathic</hi> (&#x201C;Select Passages from the Writings of&#x201C; &#x26;c) for which Chapman is to give him a &#xa3;50, poor soul, and I have given my leave.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pbd., <date when="1855-10-00">Oct. 1855</date>, as <hi rend="italic">Passages Selected from the Writings of Thomas Carlyle With a Bibliographical Memoir</hi>. Ballantyne&#x2019;s selection <hi rend="italic">Prophecy for <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>.

(Leipzig, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">56</date>). Chapman &#x26; Hall did not publish a coll. edn. till <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>.</note> towards which, as there is no money or other clear call in it, I mean to contribute nothing. However, the man seems to have some sense, and some reality of earnestness; and I will let him be doing, with my good wishes.</p>
<p>I know not if I ever told you about a certain Old <hi rend="italic">Tithe-Register</hi>, kept by successive parsons, 3 or 2, in the Parish of <hi rend="italic">Ecton</hi> in Northamptonshire (about <date when="1660-00-00">1660</date>&#x2013;<date when="1700-00-00">1700</date>), which came into my possession, presented by a certain gaunt admirer, who had picked it up in Smith&#x2019;s Old-Book shop for a few shillings. The charm of it was that <hi rend="italic">Ecton</hi> was the native Parish of Benjamin <hi rend="italic">Franklin&#x2019;s</hi> Father and Ancestors. There accordingly they all figure; sturdy Blacksmiths of the Village, who keep so many sheep, and have so many pence to pay quarterly to the Parson: Franklins and no mistake, down to Benjamin&#x2019;s Father, whom he mentions in his Autobiography as the Emigrant to New England.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Josiah, in <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>; see <hi rend="italic">The Private Life of the Late Benjamin Franklin &#x2026; ; written by himself and now translated from the French</hi> (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>) 8.</note> -duce<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bottom of the second sheet of the letter has been cut off.</note> it at the inauguration of some Franklin Statue,&#x2014;and in short, work wonders with it, after their sort! I was sensibly entertained, and somewhat gratified, by all this small affair; which is the chief event of the present week for me. A Pamphlet has come from the poor Glasgow Boys, too, about their Lord Rectorship (poor souls), and the calumnies of certain too-orthodox Able Editors, &#x26;c &#x26;c: but of that at least I will say nothing.</p>
<p>Jane is gone out; and I ought also to have been gone. The Smith is due before this,&#x2014;to operate on my weary dreary &#x201C;grate&#x201C; again. I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get it right at last! For once in the week it will do me no harm to see an hour of daylight;&#x2014;it is now getting towards 3, and fine weather, amid our miserable mud. Clifton I dare say is very rainy too; but you have a clearer atmosphere there than we.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Near Bristol where he was staying with two of his four stepsons.</note> No doubt</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>I am up to no work today; have gone groping about for above <pb id="pg-29-225" n="29:225"/>two hours, not able to get hold of any <hi rend="italic">handle</hi> that will act on these rude rubbish-heaps round me, in my present humour and condition: I will write a word to you, pay my <hi rend="italic">debt</hi> on that side; and take out to walking,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is mud and rain; and, my <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shoes</hi> being in such a relation to one another, walking is not a good job either. But it may prove a beneficial one. For really I am quite stupified in this dark muddy element, and may be better even for a look at the Battersea Cabbage fields (on the other side of the river), and a brush from the wet southwest winds.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is just gone out in an <hi rend="italic">Omnibus</hi>, for a shilling&#x2019;s worth of driving deep into the City and back again: she is still weakly, little able to shift about, tho&#x2019; her <hi rend="italic">express</hi> &#x201C;cold&#x201C; is gone or nearly so. She has not ventured upon The Grange any more than I; after much hithering and thithering, she gave it up; and except (which also is doubtful) at some <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> future invitation, when winter is a little over, neither of us will be there this year. A big fluctuating party, many of whom you care nothing about, does not suit at all, at all. To me in my present mood, and at this present <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, it would have been intolerable, &#x26; a thing to be shuddered at. Alas, I remember too well where we were last year this time, and what we were doing and witnessing! All yesterday the scene stood before me as if I were still in it; indeed it is no day out of my mind: and I find in general it has made an irreparable breach in my existence,&#x2014;and strangely left me with a feeling of being <hi rend="italic">stript bare</hi> in this world. To you who have children of your own, and are so many years younger, the breach will gradually heal itself: but for me, I feel constantly as if I were henceforth irrecoverably an impoverished man. Our dear and good and brave old mother! Yet it is not a sorrow to me, it is a stern comfort rather, that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> is now out of the wind and wet, from which none of us could screen her loved existence. From her grave she yet calls to us, Struggle faithfully piously, and you also may reach a happy haven!&#x2014; God is great; God is also <hi rend="italic">good</hi>. We will say no more on this sad subject. It continues very sad to me, and very stern and grand and strange.</p>
<p>The Dr as you know is at Clifton, in Lodgings, with the two Boys, during their Christmas holidays. How long that lasts I do not know: he has not written to me since they got into their own lodgings; I sent him an insignificant word on Saturday last. He did not seem morbidly depressed, or much unwell either in mind or body, while here: but I apprehend it will be very difficult for him to come well to anchor again; and that is a great and constant drawback. I wish he would fasten to his <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> again: there is really no other remedy apparent to me. Poor Jack: to him also this Christmas is far other than a &#x201C;merry&#x201C; one; and much is sadly different from what it was last year!&#x2014;</p>
<p>What a strange account, that you give of your little Glasgow mason; working nightly at h<supplied>[is]</supplied> Ezechiel wheel for the purpose of &#x201C;shortening labour&#x201C; to <pb id="pg-29-226" n="29:226"/>mankind.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541223-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-12-23">23 Dec.</date></ref></note> He comes often into my head, since your Note; a strange little type of the bewilderment of Adam&#x2019;s posterity in these days.</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of Jim&#x2019;s hungry appetite. You must let him stay with you till he is quite sound again;&#x2014;and I think it will be an evident piece of wisdom <hi rend="italic">not</hi> on any terms to concern him with those Jews again. Worthy masters do exist, and will prove discoverable, even if Glen<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Archibald Glen; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov.</date></ref></note> cannot find one all at once: if you are once satisfied of the dishonesty and bad nature of a man, it is better to have no more to do with him. A <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> Helper of any ability (as I hope and believe <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> is) must be a valuable acquisition, too, to any right master. I wish I had any help for you in this business; but do not see how;&#x2014;and hope only you will get it well settled before long.</p>
<p>I am, tho&#x2019; at a scarcely perceptible rate, getting forward a little with my ungainly work. Indeed it is a radically ugly job; and will never do me any good, except <hi rend="italic">make me rid of it</hi> one day, if it please Heaven! I am much <hi rend="italic">mauled</hi>, these some years, by many causes, and do not think I shall ever get up my hand (or <hi rend="italic">liver</hi>, I ought to say!) rightly again, at this age I have reached:&#x2014;but one is not willing to be beaten either; one must <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> one&#x2019;s limits, and observe them. Thriftily employed, there is still strength in an &#x201C;old quarryman&#x201C; (tho&#x2019; not like Archy White, do you remember Archy? &#x201C;The tightest old quarryman in the whole Howrigg!&#x201C;).<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; TC&#x2019;s father might have been the source (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350719-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:181</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1835-07-19">19 July 1835</date></corr></ref>) of the phrase about Archy White (unidentified).</note></p>
<p>I have got a Pamphlet from Glasgow, about that Lord Rector Election which was going on while you were there. It contains (I was surprised to find) fierce denunciations of my Heterodoxy,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; itself very favourable, and in the way of condemning these. &#x201C;Can do thee <foreign>naither ill na&#x2019; guid</foreign>,&#x201C; all that! In fact, tho&#x2019; I find all the <hi rend="italic">rabble</hi> of Literature, or a great part of the rabble, are set against me, there is a steady, satisfactory, and to myself surprising progress with the small better class in all kinds. Which, I find on the whole, is quite as it ought to be. Let us hold on therefore; and never mind the village curs, nor the muddy ways and other difficulties.</p>
<p>I have now got my garret here made into a really habitable (I hope), and even rather pretty and commodious room. There was never seen such pasting up of holes, altering of grates, and fiddling and puddling as I have had,&#x2014;in the sorrow and the indignation of my heart! But the place is now actually warm (I hope), as well as <hi rend="italic">light</hi> to a degree; and hardly any sound at all reaches me in it, in this <hi rend="italic">close</hi> season, sometimes almost less sound than I could wish. Let us hope now I shall get something <hi rend="italic">done</hi> in it, to make it homelike and agreeable to me!&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute><pb id="pg-29-227" n="29:227"/>Give my kind remembrances to James &#x26; to James the Younger and all the little Bairns. Poor little souls, tell them and teach them unweariedly to be good and wise, and something good will await them, never fear.&#x2014; I am often angry and sorry at that sad <hi rend="italic">invalidating</hi> of your forefinger: but you seem to be learning well to make the mid-finger do instead.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>This is Newyears Day, according to our mode of reckoning; and I cannot <pb id="pg-29-229" n="29:229"/>forbear to send you expressly the &#x201C;wishes of the season&#x201C;; and will beg you to accept the inclosed small memorial of me,&#x2014;changing it into any little Gift for yourself that may promise to be useful, and bring me into your thoughts now and then. You can get the Couple of coins yourself (if you prefer that way); and may believe there is no <hi rend="italic">truer</hi> wish circulating at the present season than the one I send you for &#x201C;a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> newyear&#x201C;; if there be any such thing going under the sun just now!&#x2014; Nay, why do I murmur! There is always a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> year for him that will stir himself valiantly in it. Let us stand to our tasks then; and know that a Taskmaster is above us, whose eye, and purpose with us, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> err.</p>
<p>The Westminster Review comes today (or rather along with <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, and not till tomorrow, for it is now dark, and a blowy night): you will find in it a little Article by me called <hi rend="italic">Prinzenraub</hi> (i.e. &#x201C;Prince-<hi rend="italic">Rob</hi>&#x201C; or the Stealing of the Princes); that you can read, James and you, tho&#x2019; it will not do much for you: it is the only thing I have printed this long while. The rest of the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> I consider to be very bad; <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> is so utterly dishwashy, it really seems not worth sending but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come too, I suppose, by and by.&#x2014; I am sticking fiercely to my sad labour; and hope to do some good upon it, in time. Jack wrote last week from Clifton: nothing particular stirring. Jane is not properly on the sicklist, but is very feeble, sleepless &#x26;c Our weather is moist and muddy, very warm for the season; no frost yet to speak of.&#x2014; Commend me to James and to every one: right heartily I wish you all a &#x201C;Happy New Year.&#x201C;</p>

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>I might have sent you the Enclosed<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably &#x201C;The Prinzenraub.&#x201C;</note> a week ago, which, tho&#x2019; it was not of any use to you, would have afforded me occasion of writing: but, alas, what was there to write? I am in a very low way; little but sorrowful humours, outlooks and retrospects present to me;&#x2014;and on the whole, no remedy or help possible except in sticking to my work, and if I cannot get on, at least holding my peace. It is thus I live; seldom out of doors till the sun is down; striding along, like a gaunt spectre in the dusk (&#x201C;escaped maniac,&#x201C; Jane defines the beard to make me);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541013-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-10-13">13 Oct. 1854</date></ref>.</note> not once in the week speaking a word to anybody. The &#x201C;Merry Christmas&#x201C; is very welcome to go its ways again, for any mirth it brought into these localities!&#x2014; I often hope things will mend: surely <pb id="pg-29-230" n="29:230"/>there will be &#x201C;lucid intervals,&#x201C; at any rate; surely the sun has not set forevermore with us! We must live and hope.</p>
<p>Vaughan, as perhaps you heard, was here one night; after that I had a vile fit of ill health, worse than usual: indeed I am in general perceptibly below my average in that respect this year; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a main cause of my extreme want of success with <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k;&#x2014;I intrinsically cannot <hi rend="italic">care</hi> sufficiently about him; alas, the whole universe is occasionally little other than a valley of Jehosophat<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Joel 3:2 and 3:12, where God will appear at his Last Judgment.</note> to me, and I have to say even to <hi rend="italic">it</hi> &#x201C;Well, then?&#x201C;&#x2014; All this is very bad, O bright Lady; and I had better not say another word to you about it. Why may not I speak to you at all times, and about all things? Yes, why!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I shall like better to think of you when the Party is all gone.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Grange.</note> Somehow it obscures the image of you, as a cloud of flies (or call them birds of paradise, if you like better) round a bright object; I feel as if they ought to get away!&#x2014; When they are fairly gone (especially the fond mothers, little children, and <hi rend="italic">witty</hi> talkers of them), and the scene clear or nearly so,&#x2014;should there then remain any corner for an &#x201C;escaped maniac&#x201C;&#x2014; Well, we shall see. Jane&#x2019;s refusal<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To go to the Grange.</note> took me by surprise; she had been long hesitating, and I thought, swayed visibly the other way: however, I believe it was really a wise step, wise for all parties. She is still weak enough, often prisoner; tho&#x2019; a little better than when you were here.</p>
<p>The Turk war is still as sad a subject to me as ever. Really Great Britain ought either to cease fighting altogether; or train its people a little to administer war in the field and at home! Very impudent, you may say;&#x2014;but it does indeed distress me to the heart when I think of it all. There is now a rumour of Usedom&#x2019;s getting Peace made;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Georg Ludwig Guido, count Usedom (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), diplomat; one of the special envoys sent by Friedrich Wilhelm IV (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), king of Prussia, to negotiate a treaty with the allies. The negotiation, which failed, lasted from early <date when="1855-01-00">Jan.</date> to <date when="1855-03-00">mid-March</date>. The allies thought Prussia&#x2019;s offer to place troops on the Prussian border served Russian interests more than their own. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1855-01-23">23 Jan.</date>, pbd. a letter from the French foreign minister, Drouyn de Lhuys, to the Prussian govt., which said that Usedom must have had a bagful of treaties from which in London he had mistakenly pulled one meant for St. Petersburg. It is unclear why TC thought Usedom was negotiating for peace.</note> surely it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a good deed on the part of Usedom: there never was such a war undertaken by England before, nor one carried on in such style, so far as I can understand it!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Enough, more than enough.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>We are still going on here in the old way, nothing very particular occurring; but I will send you my &#x201C;wishes,&#x201C; as due by the season, before this first week of the New Year terminate. &#x201C;A <hi rend="italic">happy</hi> New Year!&#x201C; alas, what a mockery that seems to one, in the mood that is too frequent at present. I will say, with poor Edward Irving: &#x201C;May the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of our years be past&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311204-TC-AC-01"><sic>6:63</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1831-12-04">4 Dec. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;may, at all events, a good and better genius inspire us for the remainder of them. That will be the best kind of &#x201C;happiness&#x201C;; and that is still possible for us.</p>
<p>Our &#x201C;Merry Christmas&#x201C; here was profound stillness within these doors; interrupted only, and by no means cheeringly, by the loud and not very wise rejoicing of our neighbours all round. The Chalmers people had a dinner party (poor souls), and their Pianoforte pierced somewhat thro&#x2019; our thin walls; the Roncas danced, sang glees, supped (with probably a touch of punch,&#x2014;which who could grudge the poor puddling creatures?):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Chalmers family, 4 Cheyne Row; the Ronca family, no. 6.</note>&#x2014;at length past mid-night all these and all other noises died away; and one&#x2019;s own sad thoughts went <hi rend="italic">whither</hi> you will well guess. For some days there were, so to speak, nothing but drunk people in the street; all manner of mechanics and poor people fitted out with beer; stumbling ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> one; threatening to quarrel occasionally, if one had not walked on, as a mere extraneous accident,&#x2014;as a live sane figure among spectral walpurgis people,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Witches or demons, believed to celebrate on Walpurgis Night, eve of the witches&#x2019; Sabbath, <date when="0000-05-01">1 May</date>.</note> of the alcoholic goblin species. All which is now past; fled like an ugly nightmare; and oxen sheep and camels once more grazing in their places.</p>
<p>I have got on rather better with my work of late,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; today I am come to a <hi rend="italic">boghole</hi> in the road, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am not fit for, in this state of the inner man and outer. But I do sometimes believe myself to be getting into the business; and hope to finish it one day,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> heavy job I mean to undertake at this time of life. An ill-chosen job, and difficult exceedingly, in this country, in this position and humour: but there is no remedy, no help possible, or hope, except in tearing forward, to get done with it, if we can!&#x2014; Our weather is to an extraordinary degree soft, and mild in temperature; not the least suspicion of frost this long while. I have also succeeded moderately in getting my garret made habitable &#x26; even comfortable,&#x2014;the amount of <hi rend="italic">pasting</hi> I have achieved is really great, pasting and caulking and <hi rend="italic">calfentr</hi>ing to an immense <pb id="pg-29-233" n="29:233"/>extent; and my <hi rend="italic">grate</hi> has been out some three times before it could be got right. But now really I am warm enough, can even be too warm; and have such a place for light and for silence as rarely falls to man&#x2019;s lot. If I were only in a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> better health of liver! But that too will perhaps come; or we must even dispense with that.</p>
<p>Yesternight I heard from Jean, and this morning from Mary,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken and Austin.</note> about formal New years points: they are both well, and all is in the usual state, or better, with them;&#x2014;only Jean complains still of that miserable <hi rend="italic">finger:</hi> there is now a <hi rend="italic">sinew</hi> that draws it <hi rend="italic">athwart</hi>, across the palm, towards the little finger, and plagues her a good deal, when the hand is hard worked. Poor creature, I cannot reconcile myself, to that unblessed blockhead of a quack-surgeon by whom she lost her finger on those terms: it is one of the miserablest provoking jobs I have heard of for a long while. Young Jamie, it appears, has not got a place yet; has written to Glen, being very anxious about it, but got no answer for ten days.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken, Jean&#x2019;s son, had been with his parents since <date when="1854-11-00">Nov.</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov. 1854</date></ref>.</note> I wish much the poor lad were suited; but know not how to help in it.</p>

He breaks into lyrical recognition of you in both letters; but I did not fancy you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be other than partly bored by either of them (for there was no particle of news, &#x26; in both were repititions); so they went into the fire.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I got the wristikins yesterday, and wore them when I went out: the Letter was marked &#x201C;Too late,&#x201C; and did not come till afternoon. I found my pretty little wristikins very neat, and comfortable under the cuff; they will serve to keep me warm, in their turn, during the cold days; and often bring me in mind of your kind care of me. I am very grateful for your constant affection to me. I wish you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> send me a new &#x201C;thicker skin&#x201C;! But that is not possible;&#x2014;that would not do either, in all respects.</p>
<p>You must not knit me any Comforter. I got one given me, knit expressly, several years ago,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Lady Ashburton; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511015-JWC-JW-01"><sic>26:205&#x2013;6</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1851-10-15">15 Oct. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> and have never worn it once, not liking wool about the chin, for its <hi rend="italic">fretting</hi> qualities: the thing lies <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, and is like to lie, in the corner of a drawer. I do not need anything more at present; <foreign>&#x201C;nae mair o&#x2019; nocht,&#x201C;</foreign> as poor old Poole was wont to say.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Nor more of nothing&#x201C;; perhaps the old schoolmaster James Pool of Borgue, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330517-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:386</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-05-17">17 May 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Unless indeed you could go some day, and buy me <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of the best and biggest Sponges that are to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> had in Dumfries, and let me pay them by stamps or a Post-Office order? Of the two I have at present for bathing myself, one was a Dumfries one, and visibly a better bargain than its London fellow: and both are getting very weak, and nearly done.&#x2014; But this too is mere <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> on my part, and hatred to go into any <pb id="pg-29-236" n="29:236"/>shop here; nor do I know the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of Sponges by post; nor, in fact, is there the least hurry about it: so don&#x2019;t mind at all, till there come a chance at least. For the rest a couple of pairs of shoe-thongs (<hi rend="italic">Whangs</hi>, like the last double pair you sent,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530219-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:48</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-02-19">19 Feb. 1853</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530304-TC-JCA-01"><sic>62</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-03-04">4 March 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> one pair of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is still to the fore) w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be unwelcome, by a good opportunity. I am getting a pair of old-fashioned <hi rend="italic">latchet</hi> shoes painfully forced into existence for myself, in such a form as not to torment me, if possible. A certain poor <hi rend="italic">little-toe</hi>, almost as unfortunate as your poor forefinger, often raises my private indignation against the distraction of Sutors, in these weeks, and really plagues me a great deal!&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest, I am sadly bilious, weak, and weather is dark and harsh: however, I do crawl on a little with my work; actually in motion, tho&#x2019; at a snail&#x2019;s pace;&#x2014;and that is a consolation for everything!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter; and am very glad to hear you are getting on in a tolerable way. Solitude is not very good, at least entire solitude; but it is sometimes the lesser evil of two: I myself here am as lonely an individual in these days and weeks as could be found in Victoria&#x2019;s dominions; I never get out till nightfall, see oftenest not a face recogniseable by me; read all the evening (poor Jane, <pb id="pg-29-237" n="29:237"/>who is very bilious and feckless, sitting very silent in some analogous employment); and literally see <hi rend="italic">no</hi> stranger (hardly Neuberg with his &#x201C;State-Paper&#x201C; report<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From his work for TC at the State Papers office and British Museum lib.</note> on the Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>, who is very dull moreover), and <hi rend="italic">speak</hi>, or except in the way of monologue can speak, very few words indeed in the course of the day!&#x2014; I do find it very dark and gloomy, and could be infinitely cheered by a genial interchange of thoughts with any suitable human creature: but alas, the &#x201C;suitable,&#x201C; there are none suitable, and indeed one is very hard to &#x201C;suit&#x201C; in certain conditions!&#x2014; At least one gets on with work, a degree better, than by grinning away one&#x2019;s time in nonsense;&#x2014;and that ought to suffice for the present. I hope always there will be a brighter blink of weather coming for us all, by and by; and that we shall look ahead again over God&#x2019;s sky with less of an utterly homeless feeling than is common among us just now. Courage! Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I tried often for a saunter thro&#x2019; the Brompton place;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cemetery where Phoebe was buried.</note> had <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi> there once, and found the gates shut, and repeatedly had given it up on getting out of doors in anticipation of such a thing. However, the day before your Letter came, I had actually been there, and looked at what interests us. I should not have noticed any change of position since you and I were there together; however, it now certainly is in the spot I had marked by the neighbouring monuments. All is sleek, trim and proper there: I ran over the Inscription (of course not with much scrutiny, yet so as <hi rend="italic">to read</hi> it); and I do not think there is the least <hi rend="italic">change</hi> in it. I mean to go the first day I can manage it, and examine expressly that I may be able to give you <hi rend="italic">assurance;</hi> but in the mean time I consider that practically there is next to no doubt, or no doubt at all, about it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s letters to John about the inscription, see <date when="1854-10-00">Oct.</date> and <date when="1854-11-00">Nov. 1854</date>.</note></p>
<p>Jean sent me a nice little pair of <hi rend="italic">wristikins</hi> by way of new-years gift; poor soul, I am sorry about that finger of hers,&#x2014;but she takes it with great <foreign><hi rend="italic">r&#xfc;stigkeit</hi></foreign> [robustness], and is a courageous soul. The knitting of the <hi rend="italic">comforter</hi> has been prohibited: I have got one here, which I have never once worn.&#x2014; I am sorry too about that Boy of Jean&#x2019;s. Can nothing be done to <hi rend="italic">help</hi> him at all towards a place of some kind in Glasgow? I am deeply ignorant of the lie of affairs there. I do not even know Glen&#x2019;s Address; nor whether he is the man that <hi rend="italic">could</hi> help effectually if he were never so zealous?&#x2014;</p>
<p>By all means get rid of those Books. No kind of goods is more worthless, if you do not use them; or is more difficult to keep from coming to loss and damage.

<salute>Dear Tait,</salute>
<p>The Luther Portraits are a decidedly welcome possession to me (as they may well be to any serious intelligent man); and I will not be such a churl as to return them upon you on those terms. By no means. They shall hang on my walls here; in daily sight of me; and often bring your munificent goodness to my mind, among other things they may suggest.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tait&#x2019;s copies of Cranach&#x2019;s portraits; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541020-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1854-10-20">20 Oct. 1854</date></ref>; Helen Allingham listed them in <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date> as on the E wall of the first floor drawing room (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House</hi> 105); they are there still.</note> Let that therefore be a settled matter; and my thankfulness, tho&#x2019; not much said about it, be well assured to you.</p>
<p>If you ever go to Germany again (which we may hope) and bring home a Portrait satisfactory to you of Luther himself, I will expressly ask you for a Photograph of that,&#x2014;indeed Photographs of these two also would be well worth taking, both for your sake and my one, one day or other; but there is no haste about that, while I have the originals here; nor, except Martin&#x2019;s own Photograph, can I, for very shame, solicit you to farther trouble on that subject. I am heartily obliged and gratified; and beg you always to believe so.</p>
<p>Wilson sent me a Letter from Weimar some ten days ago;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson.</note> which I have not got answered. Poor Marshall had lost his son,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Marshall&#x2019;s son, unidentified.</note> for whom, good kindhearted man, I am sorry enough in his affliction: there was nothing else of new at Weimar; Wilson himself apparently contented and well. If you write to him, <pb id="pg-29-239" n="29:239"/>pray explain how inexpressibly busy I am (amid the chaotic dust-whirlwinds; really almost <hi rend="italic">choked</hi> there); &#x26; that that is the reason of my silence.</p>
<p>My Wife is still moving about, and professes to like this incipiency of frost.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly, with many thanks,</salute></closer>

<p>Woolner&#x2019;s Address I have lost; and he has not been here this long time.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>It has been a thousand times a sorrow in my thoughts that I have not seen you all this time; and the worse as I partly had to give myself the blame of it. I got your sumptuous and excellent Gift (<hi rend="italic">Stones of Venice</hi> II and III to add to Vol I);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Stones of Venice</hi>, 3 vols. (<date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>). For his gift of vol. 1, see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510309-TC-JRU-01"><sic>26:43&#x2013;44</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1851-03-09">9 March 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note> and never had the grace to utter one word of acknowledgement (I do suspect and believe) manifold thoughts and emotions to that effect as I necessarily had! Sinner that I am,&#x2014;heavy-laden bewildered sinner; not <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> one, no;&#x2014;whom, in your goodness, and candour of merciful judgement, you cannot but forgive!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The truth is, I have been eclipsed into nearly utter darkness this long while, by Prussian dust and other sore sufferings hard and tender; and have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> <pb id="pg-29-243" n="29:243"/> very little except diligently hold my peace, in hope of better days,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> on some occasions takes a good deal of doing.</p>
<p>If you will really come and see me any evening or day (especially after half-past 3,&#x2014;or otherwise giving <hi rend="italic">warning</hi> before), it will be a chosen mercy to me, I can assure you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote TC from his parents&#x2019; home, Denmark Hill, Camberwell, <date when="1855-01-23">23 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I had some thoughts of making a true <hi rend="italic">foray</hi> upon you this evening&#x2014;having been rendered desperate by Woolners telling me that it was <hi rend="italic">three years</hi> since I had seen you.&#x2014;but this morning it looks so much as if&#x2014;could I once get to Chelsea&#x2014;you might have some difficulty in getting quit of me again till a thaw came&#x2014;that I will not venture&#x2014;. Only I warn you that I really must come &#x26; see you one of these days&#x2014;if you won&#x2019;t come &#x26; see <hi rend="italic">us</hi>.&#x201C;</note> The voice of a sincere human soul, even <hi rend="italic">without</hi> thoughts in it, is like music to me; how much more if there is an opulence of human thoughts and cheery ingenuities and socialities in it!</p>
<p>We have tea every ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (hardly ever out) about half past 7. If I had a horse,&#x2014;nay if I had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a lame foot at present (thanks to the <foreign>genus <hi rend="italic">Sutor</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Citra</hi> <hi rend="italic">crepidam</hi></foreign>,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Shoemaker <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a shoe,&#x201C; a play on &#x201C;<foreign>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</foreign> [let the shoemaker stick to his last]&#x201C;: proverbial, attrib. to Apelles, <date>4th cent. <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date> painter.</note> vile quack <foreign><hi rend="italic">Sutor</hi></foreign> powerless to make a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> shoe!) I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to Denmark Hill myself, in a hurry, and seek you out.&#x2014; Manage to come, speedily, if you will do me a most welcome kindness.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin wrote, <date when="1855-01-23">23 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;People are continually accusing me of borrowing other men&#x2019;s thoughts, &#x26; not confessing the obligation. I don&#x2019;t think there is anything of which I am more utterly incapable than of this meanness&#x2014;but it is very difficult always to know how much one is indebted to other people&#x2014;and it is always most difficult to explain to others the degree in which a stronger mind may guide you&#x2014;without your having at least intentionally&#x2014;borrowed this or the other definite thought. The fact is, it is very possible for two people to hit <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi> on the same thought&#x2014;and I have over and over again been somewhat vexed as well as surprised at finding that what I really <hi rend="italic">had</hi> and <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> I had, worked out for myself, corresponded very closely to things that you had said much better. I entreat you not to think when (if you have ever patience to do so) you glance at anything I write, and when you come as you must sometimes, on bits that looks like bits of yourself spoiled,&#x2014;to think that I have been mean enough to borrow from you knowingly&#x2014;&#x26; without acknowledgement. How much your general influence has told upon me, I know not&#x2014;but I always confess it&#x2014;or rather&#x2014;boast of it, in conversation about you and you will see what&#x2014;considering the way malicious people <hi rend="italic">catch</hi> at such confessions, is certainly a very frank one&#x2014;at the close of the lecture of which I send you a Builder containing a report. I have marked the passage. p 639.&#x201C; The report was of Ruskin&#x2019;s lecture, &#x201C;The General Principles of Colour,&#x201C; <date when="1854-12-09">9 Dec.</date>, third in his &#x201C;Addresses on Decorative Colour,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">The Builder. Illustrated Weekly Magazine, for the Architect, Engineer, Archaeologist, Constructor, &#x26; Artist</hi> 12 (<date when="1846-12-16">16 Dec. 1846</date>): 639. Ruskin, citing <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi>, referred to TC as the writer to whom &#x201C;he (the lecturer) owed more than to any other living writer&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s Works</hi> 12:507).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have received your <hi rend="italic">Life of Etty;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of William Etty, R.A</hi>., 2 vols. (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), had been commissioned by the publisher David Bogue soon after Etty (<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) died.</note> and am surely much obliged by your kind Gift and by the kind sentiments you express towards me. I read, last night, in the Book, with unusual satisfaction: a Book done in a vigorous sympathetic veracious spirit, and promising me the delineation, actual and intelligible, of a man extremely well worth knowing.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1855-01-20">20 Jan.</date>, reviewed the book unfavorably, saying &#x201C;Solemnity seems to be more highly praised by him than simplicity&#x201C;; the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1855-01-27">27 Jan.</date>, thought that it was not well written but that it gave a &#x201C;vivid and life-like impression&#x201C; of Etty&#x2019;s life.</note> Beyond doubt I shall finish steadily what I have begun,&#x2014;and small thanks to me in this instance. Etty&#x2019;s name was, naturally, familiar to me; but his physiognomy of body or mind, and his great merits as painter and man were a mere rumour to me hitherto.</p>
<p>I believe I may congratulate you on accomplishing a good work, of its kind, among your fellow creatures and it is a real favour to me that I have the opportunity of enjoying myself over it, and instructing myself by it</p>
<p><closer><salute>I wish you all good speed in your enterprises; and solicit a continuance of your goodwill towards me.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Grote,</salute>
<p>My Wife says you spoke about <hi rend="italic">Voltaire</hi> last night, and charitably mentioned that you had a good many Books upon the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of him, and otherwise relating to him.</p>
<p>I am greatly in want of such Books in these times,&#x2014;and indeed obliged to <pb id="pg-29-247" n="29:247"/>take my measures for doing with a very <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of such; I could never see any <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> but Condorcet&#x2019;s and &#x201C;M. Mxx&#x2019;s,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean-Antoine-Nicolas de Condorcet, <hi rend="italic">Vie de Voltaire</hi> (Paris, <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>) and M*** [Th&#xE9;ophile Imarigeon Duvernet], <hi rend="italic">La Vie de Voltaire</hi> (Paris, <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>).</note> neither of which is good for almost anything; the 5 or 6,000 <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Voltaire himself are definable as <hi rend="italic">un</hi>edited (notes, if <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, full of mistakes) and often dark as London-fog to the inquiring eye; no Frenchman that I apply to can give me the least account of him (I never saw one who could even tell me why he was called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Voltaire</hi>,&#x201C; what Brothers, Nephews he had &#x26;c):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Voltaire was the pen name of Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Marie Arouet; for TC&#x2019;s explanation of the pseud.; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 13:107. He was the fifth child of his parents. Twin boys (of whom one survived), a girl, and another boy who died young had preceded him.</note> in fact all is involved in indolent disgraceful ignorance on that hand;&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; I have no pretension to dispel or conquer such ignorance, I do, as you perceive, much want any light that can be had towards my own small class of objects with the man. This induces me to write to you, on hint of what you said last night.</p>

<p>Is there no word of your coming back to Town, then; no hope of my ever seeing you again? I did not see Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, tho&#x2019; I tried twice, and he came once down hither while I was out. On Monday last<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1855-02-05">5 Feb.</date></note> I had calculated you were to be here: but no, in the gateway of Bath House<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Piccadilly, the Ashburtons&#x2019; house.</note> I found men in paper-caps, seemingly with paint pots, miscellaneously busy; nobody could predict your coming,&#x2014;uncertain all as the taking of Sebastopol.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The allies first attacked Sebastopol in <date when="1854-10-00">mid-Oct.</date>, expecting an easy victory. Shortly after the first attack, news reached London that the city had been taken, but it was 11 months before it fell.</note> Some day, I suppose, you will come; if once the Ministry<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of Lord Palmerston. Lord Ashburton was to continue as a privy councillor, as he had been from <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>.</note> had come alive again, and the snow were away.</p>
<p>All has been dark with me these many weeks; physically my glass-roof, loaded with snow, sends in only a strange grey light, sufficient for writing by; and on the spiritual side, it is the same or worse. You have escaped many <hi rend="italic">complaints</hi> by my silence! In fact I find nothing else fit for me; the duty of holding my peace is plainer, in present circumstances, than any other. However, I have got a little bit of my Book done: to <hi rend="italic">get done</hi> with it, and fling <hi rend="italic">it</hi> away from me to all eternity, is nearly the only clear hope I in these times have. I seem to see very well that it will never be worth one farthing as a Book; but I, poor soul, shall be rid of the martyrdom of it forevermore; and that will be a blessing worth coveting. Under such auspices I persist; and manifest (I sometimes feel) an obstinacy which is respectable. You know the nature of the beast;&#x2014;and I hope are patient with it! Hope; yet sometimes fear very much too: in my haunted condition, under this grey light, silent as in the heart of a mountain, spectres rise in one&#x2019;s imagination, and all visitants are not of the angelic nature!&#x2014;</p>
<p>That day Lord Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi> called I had gone to a Breakfast of Milnes&#x2019;s:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milnes wrote to TC, <date when="1855-01-26">26 Jan.</date>, from 16 Upper Brook St., to say that the originals of &#x201C;the Bromley letters&#x201C; (Sir George Bromley, <hi rend="italic">A Collection of Original Royal Letters, written by King Charles the First and Second, King James the Second &#x2026; King and Queen of Bohemia &#x2026; Prince Rupert &#x2026; <date when="1619-00-00">1619</date>, to <date when="1665-00-00">1665</date></hi> [<date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>]), which TC had asked about, had been sold at auction in <date when="1808-00-00">1808</date> and were probably irrecoverable. He asked TC to breakfast on Monday, <date when="1855-01-29">29 Jan.</date> In a note on the letter TC wrote: &#x201C;Having found <hi rend="italic">Bromley&#x2019;s Royal Letters</hi> to be full of hopeless Errors on the part of the Editor (&#x2018;Marquis of Lulenbach&#x2019; for &#x2018;Margraf of Culmbach,&#x2019; and a thousand such), I wrote to Milnes requesting him to inform the Bromleys, if he had or could make acquaintance with them, that their Collection of Letters, as printed, was a highly curious Book in its way, but that it had been edited by Ignorance and Darkness, and except the <hi rend="italic">originals</hi> were in existence, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never be legible or intelligible to any creature.

<p>I could have come to The Grange, about the time I went to Milnes, for a ten days of holiday:&#x2014;yet perhaps it was as well not. I am too dark a creature really, and should stay at home in this grey light. Besides the frost is very ugly upon me.

These two excellent innovations, then, increase the yearly expenditure by <hi rend="italic">one pound fourteen and fourpence</hi>.

<p>4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Provisions of all sorts are higher priced than in former years. <hi rend="italic">Four shillings</hi> a week for bread, instead of <hi rend="italic">two shillings and sixpence</hi> makes at the years end a difference of <hi rend="small-caps">Three Pounds Eighteen Shillings</hi> <hi rend="italic">!

(no exorbitant allowance for three people), the difference on that at the years end would be <hi rend="small-caps">Two Pounds Five Shillings And Sixpence</hi>.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Coals</hi>, which had been for some years at twenty one shillings per ton, cost this year <hi rend="italic">twenty six</hi> shillings; last year twenty nine&#x2014;bought judiciously too! If I had had to pay fifty shillings a ton for them, as some housewives had <hi rend="small-caps">To</hi>, god knows what would have become of me! (Passionate cries of &#x201C;question&#x201C;! &#x201C;Question!&#x201C;) We burn, or used to burn (I am afraid they are going faster this winter) <hi rend="italic">12 tons</hi> one year with another. <hi rend="italic">Candles</hi> are rizz.

Bacon is twopence a pound dearer, soap ditto, Potatoes, at the cheapest, a penny a pound instead of three pounds for twopence. We use three pounds of potatoes in two days, neat. Who could <pb id="pg-29-254" n="29:254"/>imagine that, at the years end, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> makes a difference of fifteen shillings and twopence! on ones mere potatoes! Compute all this, and you will find that the difference on <hi rend="italic">provisions</hi> cannot be under <hi rend="small-caps">Twelve Pounds</hi> in the year.</p>

<p>Do you finally understand why the allowance which sufficed formerly no longer suffices? and pity my difficulties instead of being angry at them?</p>
<p>The only thing you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> reproach me with&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if you like</hi>&#x2014; is, that, fifteen months ago, when I found myself, already in debt and everything <hi rend="italic">rising</hi> on me, I did not fall at once to <hi rend="italic">pinching</hi> and <hi rend="italic">muddling</hi> as when we didn&#x2019;t know where the next money was to come from; instead of &#x201C;lashing down&#x201C; at the accustomed rate, nay, expanding into &#x201C;a regular servant.&#x201C; But you are to recollect that when I first complained to you of the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">prices</hi>,&#x2019; (at Addiscombe it was); you said, quite goodnaturedly; &#x201C;Then, you are coming to Bankruptcy are you? not going to be able to <hi rend="italic">go on</hi>, you think? Well, we must come to your assistance, poor <hi rend="italic">Crittur;</hi> you mustn&#x2019;t be made a Bankrupt of!&#x201C;&#x2014; So I kept my mind easy, and <hi rend="italic">retrenched</hi> in nothing; relying on the promised &#x201C;assistance.&#x201C; But when &#x201C;Oh! it was <foreign>lang o&#x2019;coming, lang o&#x2019;coming</foreign>!&#x201C;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Echoing a ballad (untraced).</note> and my arrears taking every quarter a more alarming cipher; what <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I do but put you in mind?

<p>You asked me at last money-row, with &#x201C;withering sarcasm;&#x201C; &#x201C;had I the <hi rend="italic">slightest</hi> idea what amount of money would <hi rend="italic">satisfy me</hi>? Was I wanting <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi> pounds more? or <hi rend="italic">forty</hi>? or thirty? Was there any conceivable sum of money that could put an end to my eternal botheration?&#x201C;&#x2014; I will answer the question as if it had been asked practically, and kindly.</p>
<p>Yes! I have the <hi rend="italic">strongest</hi> idea what amount of money would &#x201C;satisfy&#x201C; me. I have computed it often enough as I lay awake at night; and &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t I wish I might get it?&#x201C;&#x2014;indeed, when I can&#x2019;t sleep now, it is my &#x201C;difficulties&#x201C; I think about, more than my sins; till they become &#x201C;a real mental agony in my own inside!&#x201C;&#x2014; The above-named sum 29&#xa3;, divided into quarterly payments would <hi rend="italic">satisfy</hi> me. (With <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> parsimony about <hi rend="italic">little</hi> things; somewhat less might do.) I engaging my word of Gentlewoman, to <hi rend="italic">give back</hi> at the year&#x2019;s end, whatever portion thereof any diminution of the <hi rend="italic">Demand</hi> on me might enable me to save.</p>
<p>I am not so unpractical, however as to ask for whole 29&#xa3;, pounds, without thought or care where it is to come from. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I have settled all that</hi>&#x201C; (&#x201C;derisive laughter&#x201C; and &#x201C;Hear&#x201C;!)&#x2014;so that <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> pounds only will have to be <hi rend="italic">disbursed</hi> by you, over and above your long-accustomed disbursements (&#x201C;Hear,&#x201C; Hear&#x201C;!)&#x2014; You anticipate perhaps some draft on your waste-paper basket! No, my Lord! It has never been my habit to interfere with your ways of making money, or the rate which you make it at; and if I never did so in <hi rend="italic">early years</hi>, most unlikely I should do it <hi rend="italic">now</hi>!

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Your doctrine in this passage (which I well remember from last year&#x2019;s edition of it)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a new unpbd. piece from Ashburton on political economy, or something relating to <hi rend="italic">The Indian Civil Service. Report to the Rt. Hon. Sir C. Wood</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>), by Macaulay, Lord Ashburton, the Rev. Henry Melvill (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18540"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the Rev. Benjamin Jowett (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15143"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), and the speaker of the House of Commons, John George Shaw Lefevre (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25275"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); it had been pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1854-12-27">27 Dec. 1854</date>, dated <date when="1854-11-00">Nov. 1854</date>. It was mainly concerned that places in the Indian service should be given on merit (decided by public examinations), and with the nature and requirements of the examinations. Under its four heads (mainly academic) it included &#x201C;some attention to financial and commercial science, &#x2026; keeping accounts &#x2026; banking, exchange rates, taxation and the nature of public debt.&#x201C; Yet it by no means asked candidates &#x201C;to subscribe to any article of faith touching any controverted point in the science of political economy,&#x201C; only familiarity with &#x201C;standard works on the subject.&#x201C;</note> is orthodox, and even intensely orthodox, in Political Economy; I find it like wise to be indisputably true, so far as it goes, in the nature of things, and worthy to be called a &#x201C;law of God&#x201C; in its kind. Very necessary, too, that it should be recognised as such;&#x2014;and certainly you express it, and illustrate it, with very great clearness and ingenuity in this place. On the whole, I do not know that I could practically counsel you to make the least change in what you have said and printed here; tho&#x2019; if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> convey to you my complete notion on the subject (as I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>), an <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> paragraph, from your pen, endorsed with your name, might have a good effect among the ignorant ruling classes of mankind, all sitting with folded arms, and appealing to &#x201C;universal laws&#x201C; (in Political Economy and elsewhere),&#x2014;as if gravitation were the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> force in Nature; as if the Bricklayer w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> ever get his House <hi rend="italic">up</hi> by merely allowing gravitation to go its way! Certainly he must not forget it; he must know it well, and be taught it if he is ignorant: but if he do nothing more than rember<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x2014;!&#x2014; He will govern the Colonies as Sir James Stephen <pb id="pg-29-260" n="29:260"/>did;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Stephen. In Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, TC recalled that their friend Lord Monteagle had said &#x201C;&#x2018;He shuts his eyes on you &#x2026; and talks as if he were dictating a Colonial Despatch&#x2019; (most true;&#x2014;&#x2018;teaching you How <hi rend="italic">Not</hi> to do it,&#x2019; as Dickens defined afterwards).&#x201C; He &#x201C;ultimately &#x2026; used to come down hither pretty often on an evening; and we heard a great deal of talk from him, recognisably serious and able, though always in that Colonial-Office style, more or less. Colonial-Office <hi rend="italic">being</hi> an Impotency (as Stephen inarticulately, though he never said or whispered it, well knew)&#x201C; (146).</note> he will fight in the Crimea as our War-Office now does; he will witness Preston strikes,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540127-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-01-27">27 Jan. 1854</date></ref>.</note> French Revolutions, and various other immensely sad phenomena in this world! Chaos never could have become a Cosmos at all on these terms. It seems to me, and has long mournfully seemed, as if the whole mind of the world, and of England especially, were lying buried under hideous nightmare, and doing its &#x201C;Litany to <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">Indolence</hi></foreign>&#x201C; by this sad Gospel according to Martineau Senior and Comp<hi rend="italic">y</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harriet Martineau and Nassau Senior, notoriously strict upholders of the &#x201C;laws&#x201C; of political economy.</note> Human Pity must awaken; human detestation of disorder, and determination to remedy it or die (whatever Martineau and Senior may say);&#x2014;otherwise, I believe, we are all rapidly bound, with M. and S. on the top of us, towards such a Niagara as M. and S. little dream of.</p>
<p>But all this is nothing (I feel) towards the practical question now on hand; and the more of it we have, the farther shall we get from that. I have written on the Margins here and there some words wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may remind you of our discussions we have had: as I said before, it is no <hi rend="italic">change</hi> on what you have written that I could desiderate, but perhaps some <hi rend="italic">addition</hi> to it of a few lines,&#x2014; supposing you to seize (by vast dexterity) what I do mean, then to believe in it, and thirdly to think the addition worth while. Which are 3 provisoes of a rather dubious nature! I have otherwise nothing to say, except in the way of praise, assent, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">imprimatur</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>When are you coming to Town, then? How is my Lady; she does not even tell me how she is! It was a great disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that I missed you altogether when last here.&#x2014; We have an iron time; the Thames tumbling with ice, all nature wearing quite a Siberian aspect. The frost freezes up even my work; and the wheels seem stuck again, fiercely as I struggle. In my whole life I never had so undoable a job; and it will or can be worth <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> when <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. I seem to myself now and then a very lucky son of Adam!&#x2014; Last Sunday there were from 50 to 100,000 human creatures (<hi rend="italic">gents</hi> very many of them) upon the Serpentine;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lake in Hyde Pk.</note> and I had to pick up Nero, and carry him, while incautiously passing that way. <closer><salute>Good be with the Grange and what it holds!&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><hi rend="italic">Mem</hi>. in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letter:</hi></p>
<p>1. If you could say, in what <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the State-Paper Office the Letter lies; what Vol. &#x26;c,&#x2014;in short, how one could <hi rend="italic">find</hi> it if wishing a sight of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cromwell&#x2019;s letter, <date when="1651-12-00">Dec. 1651</date>, a copy of which Waylen had sent TC, about Thomas Fincham; it was in the Composition Papers of the State Paper office; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:268.</note></p>
<p>2. What part of the Letter, or whether any but the signature, is autograph? The <hi rend="italic">spelling</hi>, I suppose, you have modernised, as you went on, in copying it?</p>
<p>3. What is the Specific <hi rend="italic">Address</hi> of the Letter; or has it none (the Address lost) except in some Catalogue or Docketing?</p>
<p>4. Where you find any account, or mention otherwise, of Thomas Fincham, of Oatwell, Isle of Ely?</p>
<p>If you could be so kind as mark these things on a bit of paper; and send it me by post, I should then be <hi rend="italic">master</hi> of this Cromwell Letter, and able to reposit it among its fellows for future use.</p>

The main passage in regard to Robinson is in F&#xF6;rster III. 118 (a Letter of Seckend<hi rend="italic">f</hi> to Eugen, Berlin <date when="1732-11-20">20 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1732</date>), and I gather that Robinson&#x2019;s step must have been taken probably in the previous month,&#x2014;Seckendorf&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">first</hi> answer to Eugen upon it (F&#xF6;rster III.116) being of date &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Copenhagen</hi> <date when="1732-11-04">4 Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1732</date>.&#x201C;&#x2014; During this interval of waiting for permission, I wish you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give a look into Robinson, and see what is to be fished from his Austrian Papers.&#x2014; This is the <hi rend="italic">maddest</hi> part of my Task I have yet come to God help me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>2. Here is a <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letter</hi>, which a Wiltshire &#x201C;Mr Waylen&#x201C; brought me lately;&#x2014;and he has quite neglected to say in what <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of the State-Paper Office it is; in other words, How I am to <hi rend="italic">cite</hi> it, and direct readers to it, if it be ever printed; neither can he now do it, except in the vague, when I apply to him.&#x2014; I send it to you, with his (Waylen&#x2019;s) Letter, marked on the margin where essential: by help of our sleepy friend, or of Mr Lemon if that won&#x2019;t do, you will be able to find the thing wanted; please mark it on the corner of the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letter</hi>,&#x2014;which I will then tumble into its box, and so have done with <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, for one thing.</p>
<p>No more at present. The wind is howling over my glass roof, but cannot get in. This seems to me the coldest of all the days yet;&#x2014;capable, however, of being beaten back by coke and coals, even in this unfavourable post.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter; and for all your goodness to me. Today you must put up with a very small contribution in the way of writing, as I am much hurried and driven; and indeed I give you the top of my morning, being determined not to disappoint myself another day in this small matter.</p>
<p>Here, inclosed is the little account for the Sponges you got me: 12/3 (if I remember, for Jack has the letter) was the shop cost of the articles; the carriage I suppose would be sixpence: if there is any surplus of pence, give it to the most deserving Bairn you have, or divide it into halfpence, and distribute it, beginning with the <hi rend="italic">youngest</hi>, as far as it will go. And so that weighty matter will be settled! The Sponges themselves are the best I ever had; they will inundate me, I may hope, with wholesome cold water, comfortably, every day, for years to come. The use of them at present is distressingly fettered, but does not discontinue. They will <hi rend="italic">freeze</hi> in two hours if left in my dressingroom (which looks to the east and north); wherefore their abiding-place is appointed down stairs in the kitchen, and they are brought up every morning in a state fit for immediate duty when I give the signal out of bed. A cold bath seems rather a severe operation in these grim mornings; and I did try to discontinue it, but found I had better not. I rush out, after bathing, cold as an icicle, and <hi rend="italic">run</hi> (literally) thro&#x2019; a certain round of streets, the quietest and openest I can think of; and return, all thawed except perhaps the little-fingers, much abler for breakfast than at starting. I find however that it is apt to suit the <hi rend="italic">feet</hi> very ill; these latter I occasionally <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> therefore, and give them a small dose of <hi rend="italic">oil</hi> (like cracky <hi rend="italic">boots</hi>), the night before, instead. If you or James are plagued with <hi rend="italic">corns</hi>, attend to this.&#x2014; Our weather is perfectly horrid for severity: a grim iron frost set in at last; and such a quantity of snow fallen (in drifts too) as I have never seen in these parts before.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Algernon Mitford remembered &#x201C;the bitterly cold winter&#x201C; beginning <date when="1855-01-00">Jan. 1855</date>, &#x201C;so cold that many birds and beasts were frozen to death &#x2026; . The earth was like iron. Death and misery everywhere &#x2026; and it was terrible to get the news from the Crimea, where hundreds of our poor, starving, shivering soldiers were in little better plight than the wild creatures at home&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memories</hi> [<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>] 1:94).</note> The streets are well cleaned, however, indeed <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the snow is getting fast carted off into icehouses; but nothing can prevent slipperiness,&#x2014;from which various people have accidents; I none, till this morning, when I fairly fell, deceived by a powdering of snow over a glassy place; but soon gathered my old bones, and ran on as if nothing had happened. Everybody, except idle skaters, is tired of the thing: the skaters enjoy it much; last sunday in Hyde Park, on a sheet of <pb id="pg-29-266" n="29:266"/>water they call the Serpentine (say from your Old Brig to the bottom of the Dock, and perhaps 4 or 6 times as broad), there was such a crowd of people sliding and skating as I never saw in my life: &#x201C;80,000,&#x201C; I heard an <hi rend="italic">in</hi>experienced <hi rend="italic">Snapman</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Snap-woman&#x201C; in Scots was a seller of ginger snaps, and a &#x201C;snapman&#x201C; a gingerbread man; here TC probably means someone selling snacks rather than ginger snaps.</note> guess them at, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have roughly said, somewhere between 50 and 100,000: poor devils, after all! We hope to be relieved by west-wind &#x201C;at the change of the moon,&#x201C; whenever that may be; which I shall be very glad of.</p>
<p>My work is threatening to get into a terrible stagnation again, but I won&#x2019;t allow it,&#x2014;won&#x2019;t! In fact there never was such a job as this I have got in my old days; and I often resolve it shall be the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> I try. But <hi rend="italic">it</hi> shall not beat me, at any rate, if I can help it. There is hope in the <hi rend="italic">obstinacy</hi> of the poor wretch, also in the remorse he feels at seeing his days go by without profit from them!</p>
<p>Jack has a haggling remnant of cold; which, except that it forbids going out at night, does not seem to trouble him at all. I very often go up in the evening, my last daily walk,&#x2014;always, if I can rouse myself to get out before his house is shut. He has been down here once or twice in the day time; cannot come otherwise, and is always rather in haste than otherwise. He is full of &#x201C;business,&#x201C; writing infinitudes of Letters, about Guardianship, Lawyers, Schools &#x26;c;&#x2014;in fact one may foresee a long occupation for him built chiefly on these things. He reads, too; but there is no chance of his taking up <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> again, or any real <hi rend="italic">task</hi>, in present circumstances. For the rest, he is wonderfully hearty; I should say fully as cheerful as I have seen him for years back. I guess he does not think of quitting London for a good while yet.</p>
<p>Your little Jim seems doing well at Glasgow; poor little Tom too:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably reemployed as a clerk. Tom was attending an institution for the deaf and dumb in Glasgow; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541104-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1854-11-04">4 Nov. 1854</date></ref>.</note> bid Jim be <hi rend="italic">patient</hi>, improve his handwriting, improve his mind and <hi rend="italic">capacity</hi> of working &#x26; serving: he will, sure enough, <hi rend="italic">get</hi> better work after he is once really fit for it,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be too soon.&#x2014; But, behold, here is the end of the Paper;&#x2014;the beginning of a sorry miscellany of other things I have to do!

Be patient with your Ecclefechan Warriors!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> This has been a precious job for us, in every way, this of &#x201C;helping our friends the Turks&#x201C;! <closer><salute>I send my kind regards to James.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have this moment got Jamie&#x2019;s Letter; and I answer, before going to any other kind of work, That surely you are very welcome to as many Cartloads as you want, or can get, of the blown-down wood at Craigenputtoch: however, I wish you would go yourself along with your men, both to see that no mischief is done, and also (which is my concern) to ascertain for me what the real state of the Plantations is, and whether there is nothing that I could <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in regard to the matter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Bell, the tenant of Craigenputtoch, had died <date when="1854-09-00">Sept. 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541007-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [ca. <date when="1854-10-07">7 Oct. 1854</date>]</ref>.</note></p>
<p>I am very glad to hear from Jamie that you are all in a tolerable [words missing],&#x2014;<supplied>[ar]</supplied>e yourself recovering, and except it be poor Isabella (who like myself is <hi rend="italic">used</hi> to be an invalid), the rest of you in your average condition. It is not at all a healthy time of the year; and there seems to be more sickness than usual in most places.</p>
<p>We have the grimmest weather; <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> as Russia for a month past;&#x2014; or rather I should say, <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> only for about 2 weeks past, the two weeks before that, being made up of frost <hi rend="italic">with</hi> sleet, snow &#x26;c. At present it is intensely cold; the Thames full of great blocks of ice, but cannot get <hi rend="italic">frozen over</hi> owing to the tide; so the ice goes tumbling about, in huge white masses, the size of a cart of hay, and much of it gets stranded ashore at low-water. I have never seen any such winter for cold in London;&#x2014;all since about the middle of January; for up to that time, except a slight taste of frost, perhaps early in November, the weather had been unnaturally warm. We all wish it were done! The water in my dressing room is habitually mere <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> for this fortnight past; and I have to send down towels sponges &#x26;c to be kept in the kitchen for me. Jane took rather well with it at first; but now it seems to have beaten her; and she threatens to suffer considerably if the cold do not abate.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went with the Doctor to his Lawyers, and then far into the City, about his late Wife&#x2019;s property, and his inheritance of that. He was what the lawyers call &#x201C;administering&#x201C;; and needed somebody for surety,&#x2014; which character I had undertaken yesterday; and the business, after some usual delays, was successfully got done. He is pretty well; has had a kind of <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>, which is now hardly perceptible in any way, except that it keeps him in the house at night during this cold weather. He <hi rend="italic">reads</hi> a great deal of lightish books; and occupies himself about the details of his late Wife&#x2019;s Affairs, children, guardianship &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-268" n="29:268"/><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother: I meant only to write two words, and behold I have written nearly a sheet. My whole days work yet lies ahead of me; as yet I have not even taken a <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>,&#x2014; which latter fact will seem incredible to you!</p>
<p>If you at any time fall in with a couple of bacon hams that you can depend upon as tolerable stuff and <hi rend="italic">perfectly well cured</hi> (in the first place), I will commission you to buy them for us; the difference of price will pay the carriage up, and Annandale ham will be a change from Hampshire &#x26;c. But the indispensable point is, that it be <hi rend="italic">well cured</hi>! What you sent last was perfect in that particular; but it is quite strange and mortifying to me what a quantity of <hi rend="italic">spoiled</hi> bacon one is liable to from Scotland: so unless you are <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> on that head, do not bargain! In fact, do not mind it much, or hardly at all, unless a chance turn up. It is really of no importance. And now I must end this long winded story. <closer><salute>With many affectionate regards and remembrances to one and all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>I got your Packet of Advertisements, thro&#x2019; the Parcels Company, some time ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About a school to be started at Weimar; presumably newer adverts. than those of <date when="1854-05-00">May 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540531-TC-LST-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LST</corr>, <date when="1854-05-31">31 May 1854</date></ref>.</note> and on Tuesday or Wednesday last, your Letter explanatory of these: I am endeavouring to circulate these Documents, in the likely quarters; and if I can do any good with them, I or my Wife, we shall be altogether ready. Your account of the [word illegible] is so life-like and honest, it scarcely needs a voucher; but we are here at all times to give the due testimony, necessary or superfluous, that every word of it may be depended on. For the rest, that seems to be really a likely enough establishment for young English ladies of the opulent middle class: a portion of these Papers is destined for the Manchester region, where one might hope various people would find the offer inviting.</p>
<p>Wilson&#x2019;s Letter, with the tragic tidings,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Wilson&#x2019;s letter reporting the death of Marshall&#x2019;s son; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550115-TC-RST-01">TC to RST, <date when="1855-01-15">15 Jan.</date></ref></note> came duly; and nothing was <hi rend="italic">written</hi> in reply, for a reason you have well guessed. Alas, what can be written or said? Tears are appointed for us, tears withal, in this world,&#x2014;of which there may come some blessing too in the end;&#x2014;and human sorrow, without remorse, cannot well be bitterer than yours may now naturally be! All this must run its road; and there is nothing but Time that can bring any real assuagement; Time, which eats up all things, eats up the poignancy of our intolerable sorrow too,&#x2014;and that is itself a very sad thought, tho&#x2019; a truth and a beneficent <pb id="pg-29-269" n="29:269"/>one. God help us all; God pity us all,&#x2014;for it is a frightful Universe, on some sides of it, this we at present live in. Your poor Boy will not be <hi rend="italic">long</hi> away from you: it is indisputable enough we are all rapidly bound whither he is now gone; and I often look forward with longing to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> reunited, in at least profound <hi rend="italic">peace</hi> forevermore, and freedom from the unworthy wretchednesses of this life, with the loved ones that I had,&#x2014; all joined to me, at least <hi rend="italic">so</hi>. &#x201C;God is Great&#x201C;: I depend wholly on that fact; and will take it as God orders, not complaining with my will.&#x2014; &#x2014; But you must come out, my friend; you must not sit there brooding over the irremediable too long. Work, real work, I find to be the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> remedy of grief; I and all men agree in that experience. Do whatever work you have, however paltry it may seem; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it, then look out for the next, which lies close in the rear of it, and fasten upon that in like humour: the way of healing lies in that direction more than in any other.</p>
<p>For the last year and more I have sat here, in general very solitary, not too joyful by any means, and oftenest extremely futile in my attempts at working; yet sensible always, and acting on that sense, that except in getting forward with my task there is no good possible for me in this world or in another. Ugly work too; ugliest and despicablest, not the work I would have chosen, had much choice been given me! But I do hope to get out of the &#x201C;Brandenburg Sand&#x201C; one day, and rejoice in green Nature again; unless I perish in the interim, which also will be a kind of honourable finish!&#x2014; No more of this, I give your verses this day to Forster of <hi rend="italic">The Examiner</hi>, to do his will with them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> The Papers, a good half of them, are consigned to a well-affected Lady, whose acquaintance in the likely Quarters is much wider than ours.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps Lady Ashburton, or Lady Stanley again.</note> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear M; may God bless you.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I have received your Note, and another on the same subject, this morning. I have written to express my regrets and respects, and decline.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably to stand as rector for Edinburgh univ. where Blackie was prof. of Greek.</note> A similar offer was made, last year;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inviting him to stand as rector for Glasgow univ.; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541216-TC-JNI-01">TC to <sic>JN</sic><corr>JNI</corr>, <date when="1854-12-16">16 Dec. 1854</date></ref>.</note> and, alas, I had to give a similar answer. Small joy to me in any kind of stump-oratory; and what profit could there be, to the <pb id="pg-29-270" n="29:270"/>good young men themselves, in any amount of oratory, tho&#x2019; an Angel Gabriel appeared on the stump to address them!</p>
<p>I am very busy here; and to very little purpose hitherto. I hope to see you again in London soon, since we cannot meet in Edinburgh on such an errand. Poor old Edinburgh; strange old years I had there; and dear old remnants of friends that still remain to me there!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Here is the old rubbish of a Bristol Letter that I spoke of. If any Lord Nugent or other living Christian can take the least interest in it, I pray you let him be at once put in possession of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter was presumably about John Hampden, whose life was written by Lord Nugent; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18441213-TC-LMO-01"><sic>17:264</sic><corr>TC to LMO, <date when="1844-12-23">13 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I am full of gloom and dispiritment about these hideous Balaklava matters,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Owing to blunders caused by imprecise orders from the command and bad relations between officers, the Light Brigade was half destroyed in the famous charge, <date when="1854-10-25">25 Oct. 1854</date>, at the battle of Balaclava. The Russians did not take Balaclava but broke its defenses and had control of the supply route, which added to the British troops&#x2019; difficulties in the winter. Lord Raglan blamed Lord Lucan for the charge; Lucan was recalled and arrived in England, <date when="1855-03-01">1 March</date>. He was refused a court martial, but spoke to the House of Lords, <date when="1855-03-02">2</date>, <date when="1855-03-06">6</date>, <date when="1855-03-09">9</date>, and <date when="1855-03-19">19 March</date>.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I have hardly a moment this morning (just <hi rend="italic">before</hi> beginning work); but I am bound to satisfy you on one small point by saying that the <hi rend="italic">Hams</hi> arrived safe, the day before yesterday (that is, on <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>): they are reported to be of handsome and promising appearance as Hams;&#x2014; I was in hopes there might have a <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> of them been presented me, this morning or yesterday, to make my report upon: but it seems there is a slight delay in the way of that;&#x2014;so I cannot wait for it; but will report <hi rend="italic">arrival</hi> at any rate. My next Letter will be in a condition to say what the quality has proved &#x26;c. In the mean while, please let me know what the Dealer&#x2019;s Account was;&#x2014; the sooner the better, that I may pay you, and terminate the business.</p>
<p>We have had such a winter here as there has not been for nearly half a century: six weeks of frost; very many <hi rend="italic">falls</hi> of snow, and <hi rend="italic">false</hi> thaws of d<hi rend="italic">o:</hi> in fact extremely harsh cold and unpleasant weather. There are now beautiful spring days in general; tho&#x2019; it was but Monday last we had <hi rend="italic">another</hi> frost, and 3 inches or so of <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> snow, quite miserable to behold; which however went away again, in a deluge of &#x201C;warm rain,&#x201C; the very next day almost.&#x2014; Grain and indeed all kindred articles seem to be extremely high; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I privately guess to be occasioned by stoppage of the <hi rend="italic">Russian</hi> Corn we used to get from that Crimea where they are fighting now. As trade also is very dull in most quarters, I conclude the working people have much less money than formerly; and indeed the poorer kinds of them are probably very ill off. <hi rend="italic">Thrift</hi>, or wise self denial of any kind, is entirely unknown among them, in the days of their prosperity.</p>
<p>I am very busy always; but make next to no progress: a poor broken-winded <hi rend="italic">garron</hi> yoked into a Cart far too heavy for it, and <hi rend="italic">speeling</hi> Middlebie Brae with very great difficulty!&#x2014; Whether I shall ever get to the top, I do not know.</p>
<p>Jack, as you know, is still here; and rather like to be, I think. He has got <pb id="pg-29-273" n="29:273"/>Books &#x26;c around him; got the little Sailor Boy<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Watt.</note> home; and appears to take to his quarters. He is little more than a mile<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly 48 Brompton Row, Chelsea, where he lived in <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>.</note> from me: very often, in my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> walk (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an evening or rather a <hi rend="italic">night</hi> one), about 10 o&#x2019;clock, I beat up his quarters; and smoke a pipe with him. He is as quiet, and [words missing] meant or ought. Get Isabella or young Jamie to write me, as soon as possible, the <hi rend="italic">Account</hi> I want;&#x2014;and add some other &#x201C;account,&#x201C; namely, of what you are doing at Scotsbrig, how you all are &#x26;c &#x26;c: of which I seldom hear <hi rend="italic">enough</hi> in late times. Jamie, I suppose, is gone back to Glasgow? Make my kind regards to Isabella; I hope (and indeed believe) the Spring weather will prove beneficial to her; and to the rest of us that have too thin a skin!</p>
<p>I am glad you got a few sticks in the Craigenputtoch Woods. Things seem to be considerably in disorder there again; and I should like very well to have whatever was rational done towards rectifying that. If there is anything <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could contrive for me, and get done, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be most ready and obliged: but I rather think there is <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> (at such a distance &#x26;c as you</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You have taken infinite pains about that Picture of a face so memorable to me:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Photographs of his mother&#x2019;s portrait painted in <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date> (see <ref target="volume-13/ed-13-key_to_references">13:frontispiece</ref>): &#x201C;a poor act of piety I owed to her and to my Brothers &#x26; Sisters&#x201C; (Journal, <date when="1855-04-04">4 April</date>).</note> for which I am piously thankful to you. The Copy you have put into <hi rend="italic">the frame</hi> seems to me on the whole the <hi rend="italic">best;</hi> there are two others, not framed, that partly might have claims along with it; and still another two, which (notable enough) are totally without likeness. The framed one is to be taken as the best. If you would do me 7 other Copies of that,&#x2014;not put on card, I think, or at least not above a &#xBD;oz in weight, for they have to go by post,&#x2014;it would complete your kindness in regard to this matter: a painstaking perfect kindness which I ought not soon to forget, taking all things into account.&#x2014; I have not room for another word today; being greatly hurried.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always, with many thanks,</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Bank-Draught for the price of the Hams, which you paid: many thanks for the trouble you have taken in the business. We have broken into one of the Hams, and are steadily advancing thro&#x2019; it: not a bad article at all, if it hold out, sound to the end, in the matter of <hi rend="italic">curing</hi>, as we hope it will. No defect, or none to speak of, has yet been traceable on that head: but there certainly does prevail, in Scotland at least, a most imperfect method of managing that essential in the bacon line,&#x2014;out of fear of salt, as I conjecture:&#x2014;a good friend from Fife<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s cousin, Walter Welsh, from Auchtertool; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490319-TC-MAC-01"><sic>23:254</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1849-03-19">19 March 1849</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510121-JWC-JW-01"><sic>26:21</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1851-01-21">21 Jan. 1851</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520130-TC-MAC-01"><sic>27:20</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1852-01-30">30 Jan. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> sends us every year a piece of the best bacon that can be fed, and every year it is poisoned by that fatal deficiency: &#x201C;a thing much to be avoided,&#x201C; as old Wull Varie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably &#x201C;Mr Vary [?],&#x201C; a farm laborer at Hoddam Hill; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251215-TC-JAC-01"><sic><sic>4:435</sic><corr>3:435</corr></sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1825-12-15">15 Dec. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> would have said! It is like eating alternately a mouthful of the finest meat and a mouthful of castor-oil: all for carelessness of some slovenly individual (<hi rend="italic">last</hi> hand in the job) and want of an ounce or two of <pb id="pg-29-275" n="29:275"/>salt.&#x2014; This is enough upon that practical topic,&#x2014;hardly a concern of yours at present, I believe.</p>
<p>We are very glad to hear of John&#x2019;s good account of things at Scotsbrig: the <hi rend="italic">draining</hi> and other industry has been of great advantage to you there. Every wise industry a man flings into the glebe of the Old Earth (or indeed anywhere else into God&#x2019;s Creation, for that matter) is likely to be repaid him again.&#x2014; I was also well content to hear you had got the poor old Ecclefechan houses; you, since there was no other to buy them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their mother&#x2019;s houses in Ecclefechan; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540408-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1854-04-08">8 April 1854</date></ref>. Janet Hanning wrote to her nephew, John or Thomas Carlyle, <date when="1854-04-08">8 Apr.</date>: &#x201C;I was a little surprised at my part being sent as I had written to my brother the Dr some time ago desiring him to take my part of the price of the houses as part of the payment of fifty pounds which my husband borrowed before he came to America&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). The loan was not mentioned at the time, <date when="1841-09-00">Sept. 1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410801-TC-AC-01"><sic>13:206</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-08-01">1 Aug. 1841</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410919-TC-JAC-01"><sic>258</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-09-19">19 Sept. 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> Certainly the purchase is <hi rend="italic">cheap</hi>, if any ever was; and one is glad to think the bargain has fallen to one of the family, and our good Father&#x2019;s industry may be inherited by his sons and grandsons.</p>
<p>I saw John yesterday; very well, and running about after Books; after ships for the little Boy who has lately come home to him; after many small things, much in his old way.&#x2014; Our weather here is very fluctuating; moist soft west winds, almost <hi rend="italic">disagreeably</hi> warm; then stormy tempests from the east, followed (as today) by bitter blowing rain. Everything is dear to a degree; and all people are in astonishment, wise or not wise, at the accounts brought forth of our mode of managing &#x201C;war&#x201C; in the Turkish regions. I confess, it is to me a most disgusting aspect of affairs,&#x2014;too like what I have seen to be really the <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> state of matters everywhere;&#x2014;and fills me with sorrow and apprehension when I think of it: not for the Turk war, but for infinitely weightier interests of ours.</p>
<p>However, I must now leave all that; and try to get on with my day&#x2019;s task a little, which does not look very promisingly just now, especially at this rate of proceeding!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your little volume of Poems; of which, for your sake, I had <pb id="pg-29-276" n="29:276"/>already read such portions as turned up for me in the Newspapers, tho&#x2019; otherwise rather shy of that kind of matter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">War Waits</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>); excerpts were pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1855-02-03">3 Feb.</date></note> I wish I could do anything to help towards maturity and real usefulness such a talent as yours. But [words missing] nothing that I, or that any one, can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in that [words missing] matters are: it is to your own truthfulness, [words missing] piety and loyalty of mind, that we must look <supplied>[for a solution of]</supplied> that problem; help is not elsewhere,&#x2014;else [words missing] rious forms, is hindrance mainly!&#x2014;</p>
<p>[Words missing] anything to <hi rend="italic">say</hi> on these sorrow- [words missing] are now passing. To my mind [words missing] fountain of them all is (little as we yet suspect it) precisely excess of &#x201C;saying&#x201C; and talking and palavering,&#x2014;which the English Nation, for a great while past, has grown to consider as the chief function of man, and the substitute for silent hard work in all kinds. I believe the cure of Balaklava,&#x2014;and of the <hi rend="italic">Universal</hi> &#x201C;Balaklava,&#x201C; which that small <hi rend="italic">Crimean</hi> one is but a symbol of,&#x2014;lies far beyond the dominion of <hi rend="italic">Speech:</hi> at any rate my sad ominous thoughts upon it are better to be kept silent than spoken, if they were even speakable.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Enclosed here is a small Picture, which you will not look at without emotion. Alas, alas, many memories attach to it while we continue in this world; and memories are now all we have.&#x2014; I enclose the poor little Piece today, in great haste; having hardly a minute left before going out to walk; your Post just about closing for the week.</p>
<p>I had got a Painter here, an obliging little fellow, of the name of <hi rend="italic">Tait</hi> to take Photographs of my Mother&#x2019;s Portrait;&#x2014;they take a kind of heavy tracery upon glass, by means of which you can do as many photographs as you like: Tait has diligently tried it, taken half a dozen different &#x201C;traceries&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Negatives</hi>, they call them), of which this now sent is one of the best specimens, tho&#x2019; not the <hi rend="italic">preferred</hi> one, or absolutely best (as we reckoned it), from which Tait is to do <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> other Photographs&#x2014;but the Oil-Picture, he complains, is itself <hi rend="italic">dim</hi> and bad, unfavourable for a good result by this method.&#x2014; You need not <hi rend="italic">frame</hi> the one now sent, therefore, or otherwise take much pains about it: for I hope to <pb id="pg-29-277" n="29:277"/>have another, probably somewhat better, to send you expressly before many days. And so this merely comes as a memento in the meanwhile. <hi rend="italic">Two</hi> of the Photographs sent me are entirely <hi rend="italic">unlike;</hi> which is curious, and shews the uncertainty of the art.</p>
<p>I am very busy all this while; unluckily not to much purpose: but I struggle forward what I can, and persist against all the discouragements and the difficulties. If one wait till all these are past, one will wait long.</p>
<p>We are in tolerable health, in our usual grumbling way. Jane, always complaining, never actually fell down in the frost; tho&#x2019; she was pretty nearly beaten, as I could perceive, when the rigour of the business ended. Our weather since is very <hi rend="italic">clashy</hi> and uncertain; but never unendurable like that; now altogether suitable (to the swift walker at least) and pleasant. Jack, whom I saw yesternight; is likewise tolerably well: he has his poor little sailor boy with him; is reading, speculating, and roving about at a great rate Much the same as he used to be, when not so white of head as now. Poor soul, he has an admirable humour intrinsically, after all; and shakes his sufferings away, in a style very superior to some of us.</p>
<p>It is a longer interval than usual since I heard expressly of you: send us some word, an assurance if you can that all is as usual, so soon as possible; that will put us off in the meanwhile.</p>
<p><closer><salute>Give my kind regards to James. Good be with you, dear Jean, and all your house. I am ever and always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I got your Letter this morning; many thanks for the news you send me. I am much concerned in one <hi rend="italic">interesting</hi> matter you allude to:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her pregnancy; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550926-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1855-09-26">26 Sept. 1855</date></ref>.</note> for all sakes take care of yourself, in regard to that! You did not prosper well the last two times;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The children were stillborn.</note> and certainly whatever <hi rend="italic">care</hi> can do ought to be done on this occasion. Rest and composure of mind, so far as there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be attained: these I understand to be the recipes; and of course whatever contributes to health generally must emphatically contribute in such a case. Mere <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi> and prudence will prescribe <pb id="pg-29-278" n="29:278"/>all this to you;&#x2014;and I very earnestly counsel that you be a good <foreign>Bairn</foreign>, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what is so clearly bidden you!&#x2014; I hope that little malison will not go and drown himself again, for one thing (tell him so); and that there will be &#x201C;silence in the ship,&#x201C; and good steady order kept, and no foul weather, till this affair is happily finished.</p>
<p>I am getting on scandalously ill with my Book; but sticking <hi rend="italic">to it</hi>,&#x2014;what other can I do? Our weather is unwholesome again, bitterly cold, tho&#x2019; still and windless in these last days, with <hi rend="italic">occasional</hi> glimpses of hot sun. It very much irritates the skin (I conjecture), and thro&#x2019; it the liver &#x26;c; much obstructing the &#x201C;human mind&#x201C; in its work, if said mind is lodged in a weak body.&#x2014; The Doctor too has got some ailment since I wrote, something of the <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> sort too, but threatening to become <hi rend="italic">surgical</hi> withal, if not taken in time:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had &#x201C;a boil in a bad place&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-29/lt-18550408-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1855-04-08">8 April</date></ref>); see also <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550408-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1855-04-08">8 April</date></ref>.</note> so he stays in the House since Sunday last; and reckons himself to be successfully beating it back. I saw him yesterday; smoking with his back to the chimney jamb; cheerful enough, and giving good account of himself.&#x2014; Nothing else is passing here that is worse than wearisome: the Roebuck Committee, the endless foolish talk (and even <hi rend="italic">levity</hi>) about it &#x26;c &#x26;c. Let them go their way; go thou thine: and steady!</p>
<p>The painter Tait brought me down three of the new Photographs. I choose you the best of them: it will do to be put into a little frame,&#x2014;the Stationers sell such here (gilt-paper mainly, glass and all 1/), or perhaps you may like to have it in a better frame, poor as the mere <hi rend="italic">picture</hi> is: Alas, alas!&#x2014; It makes me very <foreign>wae</foreign> the Picture I have in my bedroom,&#x2014;sad enough to look up to it when I rise and when I go to bed;&#x2014;bu<supplied>[t I]</supplied> would not want it<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., &#x201C;be without it.&#x201C;</note> for any consideration.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Sister, my time is all up again.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I know not if you ever saw our lamented Mother&#x2019;s Portrait, which was done at Dumfries a good many years ago. It hangs in my room ever since; and has been very sad but doubly precious company to me, as you may fancy, ever since the Christmas Day of <date when="1853-12-25">1853</date>!&#x2014; I have got <hi rend="italic">Seven Copies</hi> taken of it (done by the Machine they call <hi rend="italic">Photograph</hi>); and this is the one that falls to your <pb id="pg-29-284" n="29:284"/>share.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Copeland (opp. 216) for a reproduction of the photograph of the painting.</note> I can well believe it will be very sad to you, dear little Sister; but sacred too, and very precious. You can easily get it framed in some modest cheap way; it may lie in the cover, secure from dust, till then.&#x2014; The Birthday &#x201C;<date when="1771-09-30">30 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>&#x201C; was not quite certain: Rood-fair in the year <date when="1771-09-25">1771</date> was <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the &#x201C;25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of September&#x201C;; and whether it was the &#x201C;monday <hi rend="italic">after</hi>&#x201C; or &#x201C;the monday <hi rend="italic">before</hi>&#x201C; (which would be 23<hi rend="italic">d</hi> September), there was diversity of recollection.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1855-04-04">4 April</date>: &#x201C;The <date when="1771-09-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1771</date> was Wednesday; that therefore <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the day of the Roodfair at Dumfries: my dear Mother was born either the Monday <hi rend="italic">after</hi> that or the Monday <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it; i.e. either <date when="1771-09-23">23 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> or <date when="1771-09-23">30</date>,&#x2014;we cannot now tell which, there being a discrepancy in the recollections of what she used to say on that point.&#x2014;&#x201C;</note> I myself, and I think Jemmy, inclined to think &#x201C;After&#x201C;; Jean thought rather the other way: so no <hi rend="italic">date</hi> was put upon the Tombstone;&#x2014;but perhaps you yourself have a better remembrance of what our Mother used to say on that point? Alas, we cannot settle it <hi rend="italic">now;</hi>&#x2014;nor is that the important thing we have lost hold of in the change that has happened to us all! But let us not lament; it is far from our part to lament; let us try rather to bless God for having had such a Mother, and to walk always while in this world as <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would have prayed we might do. Amen, Amen.</p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>There has been nothing wrong among us since the Doctor&#x2019;s sad loss: Jane and I, in particular, have not been worse than usual,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I think it was the severest winter I ever experienced (certainly far the worst I ever saw <hi rend="italic">here</hi>), and has lasted indeed almost up to this time,&#x2014;&#x201C;real <hi rend="italic">Spring</hi> weather&#x201C; being yet hardly a week old with us. Sister Jean, at Dumfries, got a bad <hi rend="italic">whitlow</hi> in one of her fingers; and the thrice unlucky blockhead of a Dr. she got there, <hi rend="italic">cut away</hi> three times over some white substance he saw, which proved to be the <hi rend="italic">sinew</hi> (sorrow on the fool!),&#x2014;so that she has now no use of her (right hand) forefinger, tho&#x2019; otherwise quite recovered again! She has learned to write with the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> finger; and makes no complaint.</p>
<p>The Doctor is here, for some time back; and I think may, likely enough, continue a while; and perhaps draw hither as his main place. He lodges only about a mile off, nearer the Town; so I see him very often, almost every day in fact. He is very quiet, patiently composed; reads Books, writes Letters, runs about,&#x2014;is chiefly occupied hitherto about his late Wife&#x2019;s affairs, and the three Boys (from 12 to 16) whom she left, who are all three staying with him (for a week or two) just now.&#x2014; Jane is pretty well, for <hi rend="italic">her;</hi> &#x26; sends her kind remembrances to &#x201C;little Jenny.&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her da., named after JWC, apparently born <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> or early <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>.</note> I am very busy with work, but making hardly any way in it.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I send you today a little Picture, which will not fail to be interesting to you. You know I got a Portrait taken at Dumfries, some 8 or 9 years ago; I have now had seven copies done from it, of the kind they call <hi rend="italic">Photograph</hi> (a <hi rend="italic">Shadow</hi>, or Likeness caught up by the Sunlight by an apparatus they have); there is a very fair degree of resemblance,&#x2014;enough to recal to us vividly what is gone away not to return;&#x2014;and this is the one that falls to your share out of the Seven. You can have it put into a little frame without difficulty: in the meanwhile you have only to keep it in the Cover now sent, so that no dust get to it.&#x2014; I put <date when="1771-09-30">30 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> as Birthday, tho&#x2019; I remember, that was a little uncertain: &#x201C;roodfair,&#x201C; that year, was <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the <date when="1771-09-25">25<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of the month; and whether it was the Monday <hi rend="italic">after</hi> or the monday <hi rend="italic">before</hi> seemed not capable of perfect settlement: my own faint recollection inclines to say &#x201C;after.&#x201C; And so there it is: the last little service I can do in regard to one so dear; who attends me still daily throughout my life, and will not be forgotten so long as there is any remembrance left me.</p>
<p>The other morning we got news of George Bell of Whitecastle&#x2019;s departure from the world. I had not heard there was anything out of order with him: I fancy he was the Brother of poor Thomas Bell of Craigenputtoch;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Bell died <date when="1855-03-31">31 March</date> at Whitecastles (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1855-04-03">3 Apr.</date>). Thomas Bell had died <date when="1854-09-23">23 Sept. 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18541007-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [ca. <date when="1854-10-07">7 Oct. 1854</date>]</ref>.</note> one of those three brisk young men that rode past us on swift ponies, that day of Miss Corrie&#x2019;s Burial:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nancy Corrie&#x2019;s, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500830-TC-JWC-01"><sic>25:182&#x2013;84</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1850-08-30">30 Aug. 1850</date></corr></ref>.</note> two of them are now dead; gone before us, who are so much older, to their long home. It is a wild tragedy this life of ours; one fate attends us all; and the day or the hour knoweth no man!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 25:13.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Doctor has been rather ailing for a ten days lately,&#x2014;not without apprehension of having some ugly <hi rend="italic">surgeon</hi>-business, like what yours was some <pb id="pg-29-286" n="29:286"/>years ago;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A fistula; James had gone to Edinburgh, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, for surgery; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490919-TC-JAC-01"><sic>24:239</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1849-09-19">19 Sept. 1849</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491009-TC-MAC-01"><sic>266</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1849-10-09">9 Oct. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but the matter has passed slightly for the present, being taken in time; and he hopes he is well out of it; going about as before, &#x201C;without any pain,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; not entirely mended yet. He has looked this good while rather thin and colourless; I design to advise him today to take to a more generous <hi rend="italic">diet</hi>, for one thing. He does not seem in actual pain either of body or mind, runs about among Books, among Parliamentary Committees, News &#x26;c; but he is very grave, and much changed from a few years back,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">mirth</hi> knocked quite out of him, as out of some others of us; not without cause! He has the three little Boys all with him just now: two return to that School directly; the other (for whom a place has now been <hi rend="italic">got</hi>) goes to sea again next month.</p>
<p>Spring has come upon us, on a sudden, at last. For three days past the beautifullest weather, almost too <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> rather than otherwise; and today there is a brisk Northwester blowing, the sun looking out at intervals, and dustclouds inclined to rise.&#x2014; I am quiet in my garret here (really a nice place for writing &#x26;c if I were rightly used to it), and keep <foreign><hi rend="italic">howking</hi></foreign> (a word very expressive of my procedure) at the huge continent of rubbish I have got round me. We consider you to be busy <hi rend="italic">sowing;</hi> hope Isabella and the rest of you are moderately well; and bid you in all ways right cordially Good-speed. some of you should write to us again, as soon as possible. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Today I send you a small mournful Gift; which, I need not doubt, will be very precious to you. You remember perhaps I got a Portrait done, at Dumfries, before you went away, of One who has now left us, and who is forever dear to us all. I have now had a few Copies taken of it; am sending one to each of the <hi rend="italic">Seven</hi> of us who still remain (no other gets a Copy, for there were only seven, &#x201C;seven <hi rend="italic">good</hi> ones,&#x201C; bargained for); and here inclosed is your share. Having one still over, not upon a Card, I put it in; you may give in<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to Tom,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s son. Janet Hanning wrote to her nephew, <date when="1855-04-08">8 April</date>: &#x201C;Your cousin Thomas is quite tired of farming we expect him down here in a few weeks to learn the forwarding business with your Uncle Robert he is to stop with us&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> who used to write to his good Grandmother, and was well loved by her: he will perhaps remember her when we also are all away. The Likeness seems to me rather good. The poor fellow that did the Oil-Picture, who was once a Mill-boy at Glenessland, took to drinking &#x26;c after his success as a Painter at <pb id="pg-29-287" n="29:287"/>Dumfries, and is now dead himself.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Maxwell; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420630-TC-JCA-01"><sic>14:212</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1842-06-30">30 June 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> The Copies are of the kind called <hi rend="italic">Photograph</hi> (done by the sunlight, and a certain apparatus they have): it is easy to take as many Copies as one likes; but I wanted only <hi rend="italic">Seven</hi>.&#x2014; You can keep yours in the Cover where it is, till you get a little frame for it. I have sent one to Jenny by this same mail across the Ocean; and that is the last I have. Enough <hi rend="italic">said</hi> now of that small object, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will give rise to many thoughts in you, very sad but not unblessed, I trust.</p>
<p>It seems a long while since we got any full stock of news from the <hi rend="italic">Bield</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s farm, nr. Brantford, Ontario. Janet gave news in her letter, <date when="1855-04-08">8 April</date>: &#x201C;Your Uncle was here from Bield last week Thomas and Jessie was with him. / We went down on the railway to see the falls of Niagara we all went but your Uncle Robt he was so busy he could not get away. it is fifty miles from here to the falls. It is a most splendid sight&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> in Canada. I think a Letter to Grahame was the last direct thing. We understand you to be toiling along in the old course of labour and exertion; and that you do not at all forget us any more than we you, in our silent multifarious reflexions and anxieties. I grow yearly more silent; <hi rend="italic">write</hi>, in the Letter way, less and less, for a long time back,&#x2014;in fact no Letter at all that has not a clear claim to be written. The swift flight of Time; the inevitable <hi rend="italic">nearness</hi> of the Evening and Night &#x201C;wherein no man can work,&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 9:4.</note> admonishes me continually to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what I can while it is Day. The frivolous noise of men about me is rather an oppression to me than otherwise; and I much prefer my silent upper room here,&#x2014;and go <hi rend="italic">puddling</hi> on, accomplishing little almost nothing (for it is terribly unhandy work I am upon, and no end to the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of it), yet still refusing to give up.&#x2014; If I live, I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> get done with it; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, it is one <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> my dreams that I shall perhaps have a sail to America, and see my true Brother again before all end! Well do I remember always the pair of little brown fists (probably fifty years ago now) which I noticed suddenly interfere in some battle I was fighting on the Ecclefechan street, one summer afternoon,&#x2014;a memorable and pretty little phenomenon to me!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Carlyle while struggling against superior numbers, suddenly became aware that a reinforcement had arrived in the shape of his brother Alick, who &#x2018;with little fists like walnuts rained rapid blows upon the enemy,&#x2019; and helped to turn the tide of battle&#x201C; (A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi> 2:173).</note></p>
<p>The Doctor is here at present; lodges about a mile off (the three Boys, his late Wife&#x2019;s are with him for a week or two just now): I see him almost every night for a little while. He makes no complaint, go<supplied>[es]</supplied> about, busy with Books &#x26;c; and indeed takes his cross fortune, and confused ups and downs, in a very fine and goodnatured way. He has had a little whiff of ailment (surgical and bilious, I believe,&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">boil</hi> in a bad place) this last fortnight; but is now out, and <pb id="pg-29-288" n="29:288"/>stirring as before. Grahame is growing very dim and heavy; perfect health of body, but his memory much gone, poor old man. G. Bell of Whitecastles is dead; his Brother Thomas was gone before: brisk young men whom perhaps you remember.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Dear Brother, this <hi rend="italic">Cover</hi> will stand no more weight. I mean to write again soon. God bless you all.</salute></closer></p>

<p>For my own share I confess I never had, and have now (if it were possible) less than ever, the least hope in &#x201C;Universal Suffrage&#x201C; under any of its modifications: and, if it were not that in certain deadly maladies of the body politic, a burning <hi rend="italic">crisis</hi> may be considered as beneficent, I should much prefer Tzarism itself, or Grand-Turkism itself, to the sheer <hi rend="italic">Anarchy</hi> (as I reckon it sadly to be) which is got by &#x201C;Parliamentary Eloquence,&#x201C; Free Press, and counting of heads. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach</hi>! <hi rend="italic">mein lieber Sulzer, Er kennt nicht diese verdammte Race</hi></foreign>!&#x201C; said Frederick of Prussia once;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ah! my dear Sulzer, you do not know this damned race&#x201C;; Frederick&#x2019;s answer to J. G. Sulzer, who had said that &#x201C;the inborn inclination of men is rather to good than to evil&#x201C;; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:337, 354&#x2013;55.</note> and it is a sad truth he expresses there. In your vast Country,&#x2014;which I have always respected as a huge dark &#x201C;Birth of Providence,&#x201C; the meanings of which are not yet known&#x2014;there is evident, down to this time, one talent in which it has the preeminence, giving it potency far beyond any other Nation: the talent (indispensable to all Nations and all creatures, and inexorably required of them all, under penalties), <hi rend="italic">the talent of obeying</hi>,&#x2014;which is much out of vogue in other quarters just now! And I never doubt, or can doubt, but the want of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will be amerced to the last <pb id="pg-29-289" n="29:289"/>due farthing, sooner or later; and bring about huge bankruptcies, wherever persevered in. Such is my sad creed in these revolutionary times.</p>
<p>In spite of all these discrepancies, it will give me real pleasure if you will call some day when you are in town; nor am I myself without hope of finding out Cholmondeley Lodge<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richmond, where Herzen lived.</note> in some of my walking excursions; and enjoying there once more a little talk with an estimable man of sense, which is always a pleasure to me.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herzen replied in French, <date when="1855-04-14">14 April</date>: &#x201C;It is impossible for me not to say a word or two on the interesting subject touched on in your letter&#x2014;for which I thank you cordially. I have never been an enthusiast of &#x2018;universal suffrage.&#x2019; Universal suffrage &#x2026; can yield absurd results. Socialism sees much farther than making the numerical addition of opinions and subtracting minorities in order to appreciate the arithmetical value of a law. Socialism tends towards the discovery of the most natural laws of organization in the given historical condition so as to realize them. &#x2018;Anarchy&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x2018;the talent of obeying&#x2019;&#x2014;all that demands definition; the vague and indefinite are very dangerous. If &#x2018;Anarchy&#x2019; means arbitrary disorder, the death of social fellowship, and unconformity with reason&#x2014;socialism fights against it more than monarchy does. / The talent of obeying in conformity with our conscience&#x2014;is a virtue. But the talent to fight when one is forced to obey against his conscience&#x2014;is also a virtue. / &#x2026; Without the talent to fight&#x2014;the world would be like Japan. No history, no development. &#x2026; &#x2018;All power comes from God,&#x2019; said Paul the apostle, rebellious Roman citizen, blasphemer at St. Diana of Ephesus, demagogue of the Appian Way, egalitarian [Herzen writes <foreign>&#x2018;ce partagoux:&#x2019;</foreign> divider out of goods / communist / early Christian]&#x2014;who was executed by Caesar, and who rightly did not find enough talent for obedience. / You are too philosophical not to forgive me when I defend my opinions while recognizing the inferiority of my means. / When I am in London I shall profit by coming to see you and presenting my respects to Madame.

<p><salute>Thanks, thanks, dear Lady,</salute> ever good as beautiful; the sight of your handwriting again is a blessing to me,&#x2014;I suspect you do not know how much! Nor need you.</p>
<p>And you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> we will not come to you? What on earth has put that into a head so clear as yours! A certain Gentleman in black must have been very busy lately. The fact is indisputable. I suffer somewhat in <hi rend="italic">cohues</hi> of commonplace <pb id="pg-29-290" n="29:290"/>people, noisy children &#x26;c &#x26;c; and nowhere in Nature are they <hi rend="italic">so</hi> afflictive <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> me as in your Ladyship&#x2019;s presence: but in the absence of these&#x2014;How often must I repeat it? Nay, at last, when no better can be, even <hi rend="italic">with</hi> these&#x2014; For the sight of you, from time to time, is by no means hateful to me; surprising as it may seem!</p>
<p>At any rate the second indisputable fact at present is, we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> come, so soon as asked, for 3 days, four days, one day,&#x2014;any way your orders please to run. Or if &#x201C;we&#x201C; will not do; then &#x201C;I,&#x201C; individually, in a strong pair of shoes, mean to treat myself to a walk out, one of these days,&#x2014;and shall need no orders. The very <hi rend="italic">trees</hi>, I want to see them,&#x2014;and I have no doubt they will be rather glad to see me, I have liked them so long and well!&#x2014; For the rest, give my earnest counsel to Lady Sandwich <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to run away so soon out of the bright spring now that it has come at last: the dirty Town seems to me a mere dogkennel in comparison; who would return thither that could help it? Very bad for <hi rend="italic">bronchitis</hi>, too, and the dust often flying. Be good children, both of you!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If it was Louis Napoleon, so-called Emperor, that made this &#x201C;French Exhibition,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paris Universal Exhibition, opened <date when="1855-05-15">15 May</date>.</note> it shall be another of my griefs against him; which already make a heavy score,&#x2014;taking in Sebastopol, the Thief-Acrobat General-in-chief; the Charlatan that went to put stars in the Holy Places, and gather votes from dirty French Priests&#x2014;pah!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Thief-Acrobat&#x201C;: possibly referring to the sale of the Orl&#xE9;ans family&#x2019;s French estates, <date when="1852-01-00">Jan. 1852</date>, on Napoleon III&#x2019;s orders. There had been disputes throughout the <date>19th century</date> between Orthodox Christians, protected by Russia, and Roman Catholics, protected by France, about rights to the holy places in the Ottoman empire, particularly Roman Catholics&#x2019; access to keys and the right to place a silver star in the Sanctuary of the Nativity. French rights were embodied in treaties with the Ottoman empire, the latest in <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>, but they had been allowed to lapse and had been taken over by the Orthodox Church. It was widely believed that Napoleon III&#x2019;s demand for the reinstatement of French rights in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, before he became emperor, was to gain the support of clerical groups in France. The crisis provoked by Turkey&#x2019;s concession to French demands, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, led directly to the Crimean War. After the harsh winter, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>, when the allies made little progress, the British were eager to renew bombardment of Sebastopol; it began, <date when="1855-04-09">9 April</date>. Napoleon was not in favor of bombardment but believed Sebastopol could be taken only by assault if properly besieged and its overland supply routes blocked. In order to carry out his plan, he proposed going to the Crimea to take charge of operations.</note> I find that a very damnatory symptom in the man. My poor Fritz, scraggy as he was, would have much scorned any such adventure, at his worst pinch. He will never &#x201C;fix&#x201C; himself, except in Chaos, by these methods.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad indeed to hear from you at last, that all is as well as could be <pb id="pg-29-292" n="29:292"/>expected,&#x2014;nothing <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> gone wrong, and a speedy prospect of improvement to that.</p>
<p>The accompanying Packet arrived, I think, on Tuesday; and I now let slip the leash, (first thing I do in the morning, lest interruptions occur afterwards), and it flies towards you. I know not where &#x201C;Rutland Place&#x201C; is, but suppose it to be in the Charlotte Square region;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nearby; in Edinburgh.</note> and am glad to think your Lodging promises well. Remember me very kindly to the obliging Doctor.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Syme (<date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), 2 Rutland Sq.; prof. of clinical surgery, Edinburgh univ., <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; his publications include <hi rend="italic">On Stricture of the Urethra and Fistula in Perineo</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note></p>
<p>We have not seen or heard of Neuberg since the week before you went. If I were not in such haste, I would write an inquiry after him. L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Canning <hi rend="italic">has</hi> at last answered on the Piper matter: all right, and Piper hopes he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be promoted (not in the Mailguard way); at all events, <hi rend="italic">politeness</hi> cannot go farther: so I have well done with it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Charles John Canning (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4554"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), the postmaster-gen., wrote to TC, <date when="1855-04-17">17 April</date>, in answer to TC&#x2019;s letter about his Chelsea postman: &#x201C;I cannot say that I wonder at Piper&#x2019;s disappointment,&#x201C; because a new classification had raised false expectations. &#x201C;The object of the re-adjustment was to abolish the inequalities of duty and pay which had heretofore existed &#x2026; and to open future promotion to all who shall deserve it. &#x2026; I am afraid that I cannot encourage Piper to look to employment as a Mail Guard.&#x201C; Its duties required &#x201C;experience of Railroads&#x201C; not acquired by &#x201C;a Letter Carrier. &#x2026; It has been an arduous work to re-cast an Establishment of Fifteen hundred men, and to fix their relative position. &#x2026; I believe that, upon the whole, it has been done justly.&#x201C; But he did say that Piper&#x2019;s &#x201C;good character may before long entitle him&#x201C; to promotion to letter carrier, third class, and his pay would increase from 23 shillings a week to 25 shillings, &#x201C;with a yearly increase to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>Louis Napoleon has not been shot hitherto; that is the best that can be said.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Napoleon III and Empress Eug&#xE9;nie arrived in London, <date when="1855-04-16">16 April</date>, on a state visit.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We are very glad indeed to hear that you have got done with your operation, so soon, and under such favourable auspices. It was more than could have been expected! I trust all still continues favourable; and that, in short, you will be well out the affair before many days pass.</p>
<p>But you must not be in too much hurry! I should think &#x201C;Wednesday&#x201C; looks an unusually brief date: Syme and you, I will hope and believe, have not forgotten the <hi rend="italic">speed</hi> there is occasionally in &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hastening slowly</hi>&#x201C; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">festinate lente</hi></foreign>)! As indeed I have no doubt you have; which makes me all the gladder at the result.</p>
<p>Our weather here too is fiercely cold: nothing but inhospitable East wind, ever since you went away; East-wind sometimes (as yesterday, Sunday) extremely violent; and, in spite of the bright sun, very cold in exposed quarters. We have got done with our &#x201C;Emperor&#x201C;; thank Heaven, he took himself away again before the week ended: never <hi rend="italic">was</hi> such a blaze of enthusiastic reception &#x26;c (says rumour, which I for my own share cannot confirm or decisively contradict); royal children all weeping when the <foreign><hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi></foreign> [so-called] &#x201C;august pair&#x201C; took themselves away again &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">&#xE0; la bonne heure</hi></foreign> [well and good].</p>
<p>Neuberg, Fitzgerald and Spedding were here last night, to whom added herself Miss Jewsbury: very confusing, uninstructive,&#x2014;much inferior to a Book on Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Wilhelm which I have got here. <hi rend="italic">Thackeray</hi> (stupidest <pb id="pg-29-295" n="29:295"/>Thackeray) <hi rend="italic">on Pitt</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Thackeray, <hi rend="italic">Life of Chatham</hi> (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>).</note> I have got done with; but keep it still here, for certain references.

<p>I sent you by D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle two photographs, one of your distinguished Brother in his <hi rend="italic">beard</hi>, and one of my less distinguished self, without beard, or other unusual ornament.

<salute>Dear Marshall,</salute>
<p>I received, the other night, safe and in due course, the Volume of <hi rend="italic">Sch&#xF6;ning on the Baiern-Krieg</hi> of <date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>, which your gracious mistress, H.R.H. The Grand-Duchess, was pleased to bid you send me;&#x2014;and with a satisfaction which, I need not to say, was quite of the uncommon order. The Book will be very useful to me when (if ever) I get to that Scene of Frederick&#x2019;s history;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:189&#x2013;222.</note> and independently of that, and of all &#x201C;uses,&#x201C; it surely has a good right to be precious to me. I know not how to thank that high Lady for so acceptable, pleasant and gracefully human a mark of her goodness to me; and can only beg you to testify, in whatever way is most respectful and sincere, that I do receive my Gift with all gratitude; and am proud of it,&#x2014;and connect it with the Old <hi rend="italic">Tower of Nassau</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520909-TC-JAC-01"><sic>27:276</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-09-09">9 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520915-TC-JWC-01"><sic>285&#x2013;86</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-15">15 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>; the grand duchess was of the house of Orange-Nassau.</note> (where I once was, with reflexions of my own) in a way that is altogether valuable to me! No more said: let the rest of my loyalty be silent.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am in deep confusion here at present, chiefly with my <hi rend="italic">Fritz</hi>, for I have retired as much as possible from all other things; much intent to deliver myself from that intolerable sorrow: if I do not, it threatens to deliver itself from me, in a way I do not long for. It is by far the ugliest mass of dreary work I ever undertook, and in my old days it comes doubly heavy. It is not that I dislike Fred<hi rend="italic">k;</hi> on the contrary I find him a genuine man after his sort, and much calumniated and misunderstood in this part of the world: but I must say the Prussian History Books and German generally&#x2014; Oh Heaven they often seem to me to excel in real horror, of barrenness and darkness and meanness of intellect and mind, all the Books I ever read before; and F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> II wanders hitherto like a disconsolate ghost among them, a shadow whom I chace vainly over mere worlds of &#x201C;marine-stores&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., lots of jumbled information.</note> (of the Academic type) and endless continents of what I call &#x201C;Prussian sand.&#x201C; I often think he will be <pb id="pg-29-298" n="29:298"/>my death yet; but he shall not, if I can help it. I beg your prayers; you can give me nothing more.</p>
<p>As you may believe well, I took no share in the &#x201C;ovation&#x201C; lately going forward here,&#x2014;if indeed there was any &#x201C;ovation&#x201C; out of the Newspapers, as I rather doubt almost? Rational people, when one happened to meet them, were apt to be cold and silent on the subject, if not even worse than silent; and for my own share I can only say I came driving along Piccadilly about half an hour before the sublime so-called Emperor was expected; and beheld drawn up to receive him two most thin rows (sorrowfully <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>, one-deep, with holes every here and there) of the most scandalous-looking wretches I ever set eyes on before; the very sediment of Creation; pickpockets, shirtless, dirty-shirted mortals, habitually serving the Devil (to judge by the whole air of them): these, and nothing else, <hi rend="italic">were</hi> full certainly drawn up in Piccadilly from St James&#x2019;s St. to Hyde-Park Corner,&#x2014;so as to make even my hard heart sorry;&#x2014;and more I did not see of the &#x201C;ovation,&#x201C; not I, for my part, nor care to see. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Marshall: I send you many regards; and am always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The inclosed Note was brought down to me this morning, directly after yours to myself had arrived. I sent word up, to your landlady, that probably you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be at your post this week again.</p>
<p>I am very glad indeed you have got so well out of your unpleasant business; and safe at good old Scotsbrig, advancing on your way hither. It seems to me I should like very well to drive across with Jamie and you to Gill tomorrow, thro&#x2019; the Spring Morning! But I have got posted at some distance from that; and must be content to walk sentry here where I am, at far less pleasant employment.</p>
<p>The weather is ruinously cold here still; no heat at all except in the Sun.&#x2014; We hear, last night, they have <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> the Siege of Sebastopol;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The French and British command had agreed to a joint expedition to Kertch, E Crimea, to cut off eastern supply routes, but the day after the troops sailed, <date when="1855-05-03">3 May</date>, the expedition was canceled.

Mrs. C. we found sitting alone with a frightful cold in the head, and she started up when we came in and said, &#x2018;Well, it&#x2019;s quite fearful&#x2014;I was at that moment thinking of ye, when the servant said Mr. and Mrs. Edward Twisleton&#x2014;I was thinking if ye had grown treacherous too, like the rest of the world&#x2014;I thought about yer husband, and then I thought of yer clear, black eyes, and I said, &#x201C;is it possible!&#x201C;&#x2019; so we agreed that that was very fearful, indeed, and scolded her, thoroughly,&#x2014;and after making her a visit, E. went up to see Carlyle in his hole at the top of the house, and I waited, part of the time while other people were there, and part of the time with her alone, and I wish I could write out her conversation for you. Her fun is fun beyond any, though it is sometimes rather bitter, and if you could hear the stories about London life &#x2026; , you would think &#x2018;Vanity Fair&#x2019; and Becky Sharp were mild under-statements of the truth.

Nobody has been kinder to me than Mrs. Carlyle &#x2026; ; it seems to me sometime, as if all the love and charity and goodness and unworldliness, in England, were among the heathen, while &#x2018;those who profess and call themselves Christians&#x2019; are hard, and cold, and selfish&#x201C; (Twisleton, <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> 271&#x2013;73).</note></p>

<p>The Undersigned beg respectfully to submit to Lord Palmerston a statement <pb id="pg-29-300" n="29:300"/>of reasons which appear to them to constitute, on behalf of the two aged surviving daughters of Mauritius Lowe therein described, a claim to such small yearly pension as in his Lordship&#x2019;s judgment may consist with other claims and demands for the ensuing year, upon the Fund appropriate to Literature.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Elizabeth Lowe (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>) and Frances Meliora Lucia Lowe (d. <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), das. of Mauritius Lowe (<date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>&#x2013;<date when="1793-00-00">93</date>), painter and friend of Dr. Johnson, were living in poverty at 5 Minerva Pl., Old Kent Rd., Deptford. TC was interested in their plight because of the relationship with Johnson, who had remembered Ann and her brother (possibly also Mauritius, not further identified) also a godchild, in his will. TC and others proposed to petition the govt. for financial help.</note></p>
<p>In Doctor Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s last will is this passage:</p>
<q>&#x201C;I also give and bequeath to my God-children, the son and daughter of Mauritius Lowe, Painter, each of them one hundred pounds of my stock in the Three per Cent Consolidated Annuities, to be disposed of by and at the discretion of my Executors, in the education or settlement in the world of them my said legatees.&#x201C;</q>
<p>The Mauritius Lowe, mentioned here, who was once a man of great promise in his art, favourably known in the Royal Academy and in the world as a man of refined manners and real talent and worth (though probably with something of morbid, or over-sensitive, in his character), died in ten years after Johnson, without fulfilling the high hopes entertained of him. The Godson, or younger Lowe, mentioned in the Will,&#x2014;who at one time (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">13</date>) appears to have held some small appointment in Barbados, creditably to himself, but with loss of health, the crown and consummation of other losses he had met with,&#x2014;is also long since dead. Of these Lowes, and their hopes and struggles, there is now nothing to be said; they are sunk under the horizon; nor can they pretend to have any hold on the world&#x2019;s memory, except what is derived from the Father&#x2019;s intimacy with Johnson; of which, and of Johnson&#x2019;s helpfulness and real esteem and affection for the man, there are still abundant proofs, printed and not printed, besides this of the Will.</p>
<p>But the God-daughter mentioned in the Will has not yet sunk under the horizon. She still survives among us; a highly respectable old person, now in her 78<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year, with all her faculties about her; living, with her younger sister, aged 72, the only other remnant of the family&#x2014;in a house they have long occupied, No. 5, Minerva Place, New-Cross, Deptford,&#x2014;with numerous memorials of Johnson in their possession, which vividly bring home to us, and present us a still living fact, their connection with that great man. They have lived there for many years, in rigorous though not undignified poverty; which now, by some unforseen occurrences, threaten to be come absolute indigence in these their final years.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-301" n="29:301"/>They are gentlewomen in manners; by all evidence persons of uniformly unexceptionable conduct; veracity, sense, ingenious propriety, noticeable in them both, to a superior degree. The elder, especially must have been a graceful lively little woman, something of a beauty, in her young days, and by no means wanting for talent:&#x2014;she still recollects in a dim but ineffaceable manner, the big awful figure of Samuel Johnson, to whom she was carried, shortly before his death, that he might lay his hand on her head, and give her his blessing; her awe and terror very great on the occasion. Both sisters are in perfect possession of their faculties,&#x2014;the younger only is slightly hard of hearing:&#x2014;the elder (on whose head lay Johnson&#x2019;s hand) has still a light step, perfectly erect carriage, and vivacious memory and intellect: the younger, who is of very honest and somewhat sterner features, appears to be the practical intellect of the house; and probably the practical hand, for in their poverty they keep no servant of any kind. They are very poor; but have taken their poverty in a quiet, unaffectedly handsome manner; and have still hope that, in some way or other, intolerable want will not be permitted to overtake them. They have an altogether respectable, or we might say (bringing the past and the present into contact) a touching and venerable air. There, in their little parlour at Deptford, is the fir Desk (capable of being rigorously authenticated as such)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550615-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1855-06-15">15 June</date></ref>.</note> upon which Samuel Johnson wrote the <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary</hi>, the best Dictionary ever written, say some.</p>
<p>It is in behalf of these two women, of Johnson&#x2019;s god-daughter fallen old and indigent, that we venture to solicit from the Government some small public subvention, to screen their last years from the worst misery. It may be urged that there is no public fund appropriated for such objects, and that their case cannot, except in a reflex way, be brought under the head of Literary Pensions: But in a reflex way, it surely can; and we humbly submit withal, that this case of theirs is, in some measure, a peculiar and unique one.</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson is such a literary man as probably will not appear again in England for a very great length of time. His works and his Life, looked at well, have something in them of heroic, which is of value beyond most Literature, and much beyond all money and money&#x2019;s worth, to the Nation which produced him. That same English Dictionary, written on the poor fir Desk above spoken of, under sternly memorable circumstances, is itself, a proud possession to the English Nation; and not in the Philological point of view alone. Such a Dictionary has an <hi rend="italic">Architectonic</hi> quality in it; and, for massive solidity of plan, manful correctness and fidelity of execution,&#x2014;luminous intelligence, rugged honesty and greatness of mind, pervading every part of it, is like no other. This too is a <hi rend="italic">Cathedral of St. Paul&#x2019;s</hi>, after its sort; and stands <pb id="pg-29-302" n="29:302"/>there, for long periods, silently reminding every English soul of much that it is very necessary to remember!</p>
<p>Samuel Johnson himself is far beyond reach of our gratitude: he left no child or representative of any kind, to claim pensions or distinctions from us:&#x2014;and here, by accident, thrown up on the vast sea beach, is something venerably human, with Johnson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> still legible upon it; Johnson, as it were, mutely bequeathing it to us, and to what humanity and loyalty we have for the few years that may still be left. Our humble request, in the name of Literature withal, is, that the English nation will, in some small adequate way, respond to this demand of Johnson&#x2019;s</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have not been idle in the poor Lowe case; tho&#x2019; I have shuddered much to draw up anything in the Memorial way,&#x2014;having indeed no <hi rend="italic">spunk</hi> in me at all for writing anything; and not so much as <hi rend="italic">paper or pen</hi>, that is not more or less intolerable to me, in these bad times. <hi rend="italic">All</hi> a Balaklava, my friend; all a Balaklava;&#x2014; and coming to a horrible reckoning (I apprehend now) before it be much older!</p>
<p>Here however is a thing, off my hands at last, capable of being manufactured into what will perhaps do.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550400-TC-DMLP-01">TC&#x2019;s <sic>draft memorial to Lord P</sic><corr>DMLP</corr>, [late April&#x2013;early May]</ref>.</note>&#x2014; I get varieties of counsel as to whether the matter sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be kept absolutely private <hi rend="italic">till</hi> Palmerston have been applied to, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> should be made public, and blown into some <hi rend="italic">popularity</hi>, as the only sure method of acting on Palmerston. That scrawl shews some trace of wavering between those two opinions, I rather fear. Consider&#x2014;it and them; and then let us meet,&#x2014;Athenaeum, half past 4, any day, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> either meat or drink, for I am far <hi rend="italic">below</hi> all that in the days that now run!&#x2014; If published in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, all these Letters &#x26;c &#x26;c from Boswell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Boswell, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Samuel Johnson</hi> (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>).

<p>Several official people of the Governing classes <hi rend="italic">advise</hi> the Application (with Literary Signatures) to Palmerston,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Later in <date when="1855-05-00">May</date> the memorial, signed by TC, Forster, Macaulay, Tennyson, Disraeli, and others, was presented to Palmerston by Lord Granville (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550630-TC-LA-01">TC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LA</corr>, <date when="1855-06-30">30 June</date></ref>). Palmerston had to refuse a pension from the Civil List because they were ineligible but offered a donation of &#xa3;100, paid to Ann Lowe in <date when="1855-06-00">June</date> from the Royal Bounty. The memorial was pbd. (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1855-11-01">1 Nov.</date>) as part of a letter signed by TC, Dickens, and Forster, asking for subscriptions for an annuity for the sisters; see TC and others to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1855-10-31">31 Oct.</date> (see vol. 30).</note>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; when I ask them, &#x201C;How w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> <pb id="pg-29-303" n="29:303"/>your Lordship <hi rend="italic">bet</hi> as to the result?&#x201C; the answer is not so encouraging.&#x2014; However, I believe I have actually got from the Bishop of Oxford<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Wilberforce.</note> (on merely mentioning the case) an <hi rend="italic">annuity of &#xa3;10</hi> for the joint lives of these two poor women.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>It did often seem to me a long time since I had heard from you or written; but I had the notion always that you stood on the debtor side, and so I always put off my good intentions in that matter from day to day. As I am too apt to do in all matters! It is certain enough to me, a word from you, or to you, will at any time do me evidently <hi rend="italic">good:</hi> nevertheless being so sore &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">hadden doun wi&#x2019; the bubbly</hi></foreign>,&#x201C; as the poor little &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">ganging</hi></foreign> boy&#x201C; said&#x2014;!&#x2014; The truth is, I am generally very weak and low; isolated from most things and persons, in the sad dusty dreary work I am upon. No such job ever fell to my hand before as this, the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> I think of trying in the world. It is a mass of immeasurable confusion; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have needed a man 30 years younger;&#x2014;and I have in general no hope at all of ever doing any good by accomplishing it,&#x2014;no good, no benefit or beauty in it, to myself or others; nothing but the stiff determination <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be beaten with it; and since I am doing it, to do it honestly, if I can do it at all. So I dig and bore,&#x2014;more properly &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">howk</hi></foreign>&#x201C; (that, I often think, is the suitable word),&#x2014;day after day; and my progress is so small, and my heart so dark otherwise, I have really no spirit left to meet my fellow creatures or their daily topics; and find it best, like that memorable man I once heard of from James, to &#x201C;<foreign>work aye maistly in a place by mysel&#x2019;</foreign>!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350128-TC-JCA-01"><sic>8:21</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1835-01-28">28 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; However, you need not <pb id="pg-29-304" n="29:304"/>think me <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than I am either: the fact is, no <hi rend="italic">labour</hi> is a joyful thing,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:11.</note> but a grievous; and truly when I compute, except it be labour unsuccessful (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, possibly may succeed some day!), I ought to confess there is nothing very deadly or peculiar to complain of!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Yesternight Jack came in to us again, by surprise, for we had heard no announcement of him, no news for above a week. He reckons he is as good as cured again, and has got thro&#x2019; everything well. Certainly he looks decidedly better; was full of talk, and seemed in good spirits:&#x2014;his little Boy, who was here too, is to sail in a couple of days, and seemed very cheerful also. Of course we had an ample account of the <hi rend="italic">Day at Gill</hi>, and of all manner of Annandale matters. I hope the poor fellow will not have any farther concern with these sad <hi rend="italic">surgical</hi> affairs at any rate. He has a great stock of hopeful buoyancy in him; and is of far sunnier temper than some others of us known to me!</p>
<p>Your little James must not grow impatient about the want of briskness in trade: there is little outlook of improvement in that for some good while; and it extends everywhere; and I fear still worse things (sometimes) than want of trade. In fact one sometimes feels as if the poor Nation altogether were going to <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> over, and fall upon its face, with its nose in the gutter, to drown there in two inches of dirty water! There never was such a scene in my time as the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Britain now presents Their Turk war, into wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all the world went voluntarily galloping (like a herd of loose <foreign><hi rend="italic">nowt</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;really with little more sense in their heads) may come to cost us all very dear I resolutely hold my tongue; but my private sorrow and gloom over the prospect that seems to be opening, is considerable. Is the end <hi rend="italic">come</hi>, then, altogether, which I have long been prophesying as inevitable? I will not quite believe that: but, near or not so near, said <hi rend="italic">end</hi> seems to me too fatally certain; and I compute often with a kind of terror, what kind of preparation the people are in for it.</p>
<p>Today (at this hour) I am due for a consultation about a certain poor old woman,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Lowe.</note> age 78 and fallen very indigent, who was actually <hi rend="italic">God-daughter</hi> of Dr Samuel Johnson; and remembers, from her 7th year, being carried to the <hi rend="italic">Awful</hi> &#x201C;Doctor,&#x201C; that he might lay his hand on her, and bless her. We are to try and get some fraction of public help for the poor old gentlewoman;&#x2014;it is <hi rend="italic">I</hi> that am to try; and truly I had no need of the job just now.</p>
<p>But there&#x2014;there actually goes the clock, and I am 2 minutes <hi rend="italic">too late</hi>,&#x2014;sad to say, as a fact!</p>
<p>You got the <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> this (Monday) morning?&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jean. Take care of yourself; commend me to James.&#x2014; I remain ever</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Bishop,</salute>
<p>I had taken it into my head, as the poor old Miss Lowe had already a &#xa3;10 pension from some royal fund or other, it might be from <hi rend="italic">yours;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was from the Royal or &#x201C;Queen&#x2019;s&#x201C; Bounty.</note> and that her delay to write or answer might originate from some entanglement thence arising. I wrote to her in consequence (shewing how to unravel, and pull straight, said entanglement, if it existed); and appear to have added oil to the fire that was already acting on the poor old soul,&#x2014;on the score of her <hi rend="italic">royal <pb id="pg-29-306" n="29:306"/>Academy</hi> interests! Her Letter is very confused; and not interpretable to me except on guess. One comfortable thing is clear: your Secretary has already <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> her &#xa3;10 (unless I misread), and at least there is no question as to the &#x201C;Queen&#x2019;s Bounty&#x201C; henceforth:&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [Alas]!</p>
<p>I enclose her letter, to certify so much. Some parts of it are not to be understood without the Paper, now put under another cover, with her Address on it;&#x2014;which latter please close and forward; burning the other parts of this despatch. And accept again my hearty thanks and congratulations on this small matter, now that it is finished.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Do not bother yourself with socks for me just now: I have not the least need of them;&#x2014;alas, I often with emotion look upon the stock I have, from a Hand that was never weary of doing good to me, and will now never do me more kindness,&#x2014;I could sit and <foreign><hi rend="italic">greet</hi></foreign> at the thought of it; but do not! I have my Mother&#x2019;s Picture (one of those little Photographs) hung on the wall of my Garret here; and there is no end or bottom to the reflexions it gives me.&#x2014; Stockings enough she has left me, I think, to serve all my life. When I do run short it is always to you that I intend to apply,&#x2014;knit socks of abundant length in the feet, soft wool, thickspun, and Shetland-grey colour:&#x2014;but I am supplied almost to superfluity at present.</p>
<p>Your Jamie&#x2019;s Letter is very good: ingenious, <foreign><hi rend="italic">knacky</hi></foreign>, practical, an &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Aitken</hi> Letter&#x201C;; and done in a very fair hand too. Let him stand to his tackle, and there is no fear he will do well enough. If poor Anne<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s da.</note> be really wronged in regard to those &#x201C;Milesia&#x201C; trespasses in spelling, let her merely laugh at it;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Milesians&#x201C; is a word sometimes used of the Irish, but <hi rend="italic">Milesian Fables</hi>, or similar tales, were witty but obscene short stories (no longer extant) compiled by Aristides of Miletus, <date>200 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date></note> if <hi rend="italic">not</hi> wronged altogether, let her improve into perfection! That is the way to get amends.</p>
<p>Jack has got his Boy shipped yesterday, in comfortable circumstances; he came hither in the evening; smoked and talked: I left him at his own door, Nero and I intending a farther walk, thro&#x2019; the fine fresh Summer night&#x2014; We are got out of the East winds now;&#x2014;deluges of rain rattling on my window <pb id="pg-29-307" n="29:307"/>here (attended with thunder), the second hearty plunge we have had. In a little while it will be <hi rend="italic">too hot</hi> for me; one is hardly ever <hi rend="italic">right;</hi> no getting to that point, at least no keeping at it!&#x2014; Jack speaks of getting up &#x201C;to Scotsbrig&#x201C; this summer, with the Boys for a time;&#x2014;mentioned it last night for the first time. I made no answer: do not you speak of it at all; for perhaps it may be only a passing dream. He <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, whenever he thinks proper, set up and support any kind of house he might like: but if he do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like, what has any of us to say? I conclude he will employ himself, poor good soul, with these Boys, with signing law-papers, correspondences, &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;and go pretty much without farther work, and with a mind satisfied to call that &#x201C;work,&#x201C; for a good while to come. He looks decidedly better in health; has got a whiff of sore-throat, which seems to be abating, or almost gone, and describes himself as doing well in the other medical or surgical respect.</p>
<p>As for me, it is sure enough I should like right well to get into the green sunny Summer out of this sorry element: but as the impious Cockney says, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you wish you may get it?&#x2019; I find no prospect hitherto of such a thing: I can at least avoid being <foreign><hi rend="italic">brashed</hi></foreign> by railway travelling; and may stay where I am till something definite turn up,&#x2014;or till I either end my work or it end me. Steady, steady! If I could get my wretched work <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, I would not complain after all. Why should I? The poor blockheads that sit on quack &#x201C;thrones,&#x201C; and do and speak dishonesties under pain of being kicked to the Devil (a little <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> than their doom is), how can any reasonable mortal think <hi rend="italic">these</hi> better off! When the spirit rebels ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this as <hi rend="italic">unworthy</hi> work for one&#x2019;s final period of life, I often think of the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> thing I saw my brave Father doing in this world; building, in a bitterly cold <date when="0000-03-00">march</date> day, against Andrew Caruthers,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Andrew Carruthers, mason, Ecclefechan, see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370423-TC-AC-01"><sic>9:196</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1837-04-23">23 April 1837</date></corr></ref>; or Carruthers of Limekilns, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270203-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:183</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-02-03">3 Feb. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note> at the upper part of that <hi rend="italic">Byer</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Byre: cow house.</note> wall at Scotsbrig;&#x2014;doing <hi rend="italic">it</hi> faithfully, and making no complaint about what it was. &#x201C;A man of <hi rend="italic">better</hi> natural powers than thou!&#x201C; I say to myself; and am reduced to peace on that score, and even to shame.</p>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Last Sunday, Clough was here; and we were speaking about you (much to your discredit, you need not doubt), and how stingy in the way of Letters you were grown;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clough wrote to Emerson, <date when="1855-05-07">7 May</date>: &#x201C;I travelled five town miles yesterday to see Carlyle, and found him busy over Frederick in his high attic, among genealogies and maps&#x2014;he was very well-tempered and placable and I think did not grumble about anyone unless it might be yourself for your sins as correspondent&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Clough</hi> 2:501). The last letter that TC had from Emerson was <date when="1854-03-11">11 March 1854</date>.</note> when, next morning, your Letter itself made its appearance.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1855-04-17">17 April</date>, from Concord, Mass.</note> Thanks, thanks. You know not in the least, I perceive, nor can be made to understand at all, how indispensable your Letters are to me. How you are, and have for a long time been, the one of all the sons of Adam who, I felt, completely understood what I was saying; and answered with a truly <hi rend="italic">human</hi> voice,&#x2014;inexpressibly consolatory to a poor man, in his lonesome pilgrimage, towards the evening of the day! So many voices are not human; but more or less bovine, porcine, canine; and one&#x2019;s soul dies away in sorrow in the sound of them, and is reduced to a dialogue with the &#x201C;Silences,&#x201C; which is of a very abstruse nature!&#x2014; Well, whether you write to me or not, I reserve to myself the privilege of writing to you, so long as we both continue in this world! As the beneficent Presences vanish from me, one after the other, those that remain are the more precious, and I will not part with them, not with the chief of them, beyond all.</p>
<p>This last year has been a grimmer lonelier one with me than any I can recollect for a long time. I did not go to the Country at all in summer or winter; refused even my Christmas at The Grange with the Ashburtons,&#x2014;it was too sad an anniversary for me;&#x2014;I have sat here in my garret, wriggling and wrestling on the worst terms with a Task that I cannot do, that generally seems to me not worth doing, and yet <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. These are truly the terms. I never had such a business in my life before. Frederick himself is a pretty little man to me, veracious, courageous, invincible in his small sphere; but he does not rise into the empyrean regions, or kindle my heart round him at all; and his history, upon which there are waggon loads of dull bad books, is the most dislocated, unmanageably incoherent, altogether dusty, barren and beggarly production of the modern Muses, as given hitherto. No man of <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> ever saw him with eyes, except twice Mirabeau,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:287&#x2013;89.</note> for half an hour each time. And the wretched Books have no <hi rend="italic">indexes</hi>, no precision of detail; and I <pb id="pg-29-309" n="29:309"/>am far away from Berlin &#x26; the seat of information;&#x2014;and, in brief, shall be beaten miserably with this unwise enterprise in my old days; <hi rend="italic">and</hi> (in fine) will consent to be so, and get thro&#x2019; it if I can before I die. This of obstinacy is the one quality I still shew; all my other qualities (hope, among them) often seem to have pretty much taken leave of me; but it is necessary to hold by this last. Pray for me; I will complain no more at present. General Washington gained the freedom of America chiefly by this respectable quality I talk of; nor can a History of F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> be written, in Chelsea in the year <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>, except as <hi rend="italic">against</hi> hope, and by planting yourself upon it in an extremely dogged manner.</p>
<p>We are all woolgathering here, with wide eyes and astonished minds, at a singular rate, since you heard last from me! &#x201C;Balaklava,&#x201C; I can perceive, is likely to be a substantive in the English language henceforth: it in truth expressses compendiously what an earnest mind will experience everywhere in English life; if his soul rise at all above cotton and scrip, a man has to pronounce it all a <hi rend="italic">Balaklava</hi> these many years. A Balaklava now <hi rend="italic">yielding</hi>, under the pressure of rains and unexpected transit of heavy waggons; champing itself down into more mud-gulphs,&#x2014;towards the bottomless Pool, if some flooring be not found. To me it is not intrinsically a new phenomenon, only an extremely hideous one. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Altum Silentium</hi></foreign> [profound silence],<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 10:63.</note> what else can I reply to it at present? The Turk War, undertaken under pressure of the mere mobility,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., the mob.</note> seemed to me an enterprise worthy of Bedlam from the first; and this method of carrying it on, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any general, or with a mere sash and cocked-hat for one, is of the same block of stuff. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign>! Is not Anarchy, and parliamentary eloquence instead of work, continued for half a century everywhere, a beautiful piece of business? We are in alliance with Louis Napoleon (a gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who has shewn only <hi rend="italic">housebreaker</hi> qualities hitherto, and is required now to shew heroic ones, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> go to the Devil); and, under Marichal Saint-Arnaud (who was once a dancing-master in this city, and continued a <hi rend="italic">thief</hi> in all cities), a commander of the Playactor-Pirate description, resembling a <hi rend="italic">General</hi> as Alex<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dumas does Dante Alighieri,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marshal Jacques-Achille Leroy de St. Arnaud (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>), French commanding officer, had d. <date when="1854-09-00">Sept. 1854</date>. Alexandre Dumas (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>), French novelist.</note>&#x2014;we have got into a very strange problem indeed!&#x2014; But there is something almost grand in the stubborn thickside patience and persistence of this English People; and I do not question but they will work themselves thro&#x2019; in one fashion or another; nay probably get a great deal of benefit out of this astonishing slap on the nose to their selfcomplacency before all the world. They have not <hi rend="italic">done</hi> yet, I calculate, by any manner of means: they are, however, admonished, in an ignominious and convincing manner, amid the laughter of nations, that they <pb id="pg-29-310" n="29:310"/>are altogether on the wrong road this great while (200 years, as I have been calculating often),<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Since Cromwell&#x2019;s time.</note>&#x2014;and I shudder to think of the plunging and struggle they will have to get into the approximately right one again. Pray for them also, poor stupid overfed heavyladen souls!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Before my paper quite end, I must in my own name, and that of a select company of others, inquire rigorously of R. W. E. why he does not <hi rend="italic">give</hi> us that little Book on England he has promised so long?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi>, partly based on his visit to England and Scotland, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-00-00">48</date>, was pbd. <date when="1856-08-00">Aug. 1856</date>.</note> I am very serious in saying, I myself want much to see it;&#x2014;and that I can see no reason why we all should not, without delay. Bring it out, I say, and print it, <foreign><hi rend="italic">tale quale</hi></foreign> [however you can]. You will never get it in the least like what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wish it, clearly no! But I venture to warrant, it is good enough,&#x2014;far too good for the readers that are to get it. Such a pack of blockheads, and disloyal and bewildered unfortunates who know not their right hand from their left, as fill me with astonish<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, and are more and more forfeiting all respect from me. Publish the Book, I say; let us have it and so have done!&#x2014; <foreign>Adieu</foreign> my dear friend for this time. I had a thousand things more to write, but have wasted my sheet, and must end. I will take another before long, whatever you do. In my lonely thoughts you are never long absent: <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Valete</hi></foreign> [farewell] all of you at Concord!</salute></closer></p>

<p>As to Palmerston, I had the vague notion that somebody ought to go to him personally on the business, and if possible get a Yes, or even a No, out of him without waste of time: this would be a great aid to us; but I suppose, is not easy to achieve,&#x2014; perhaps not possible or suitable?</p>

<salute>Sir</salute>
<p>I wish success to your enterprise on the Copyright question.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his article in <hi rend="italic">Graham&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550508-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1855-05-08">8 May</date></ref>), Janvier proposed forming an International Copyright Club to collect facts and give information about &#x201C;book prices, sales, and royalties.&#x201C; He believed that publishing without paying authors was theft.</note> In the interest of human justice, and of common logic, if on no other, it seems to me, desirable.</p>
<p>Whether real Literature can ever be supported by Copyright; and whether imag<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Literature deserves support, or the reverse, I leave as questions,&#x2014;and shall not ask whether we agree upon them or not. But to forbid the Writer of a Book, what is ardently conceded (secured by treadmills, gibbets, judges fiscals, to tipstaffs and an elaborate apparatus) to the maker of a Besom, the liberty of fairly asking the world what it means to do with him, the liberty of selling his manufactures unplundered, in the public market at what he can get for it, appears to me one of the most unadulterated solecisms now current, and incapable of being supported by any arg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> which is not on the face of it lamentable to behold.</p>
<p>Among the sons of Adam protected in their rights of property, there is no one who has or can have such a right of property in any object as the Writer, or even the Scribbler, of a Book has in said Book. Writing or scribbling, that Book belongs to him as nothing else does.&#x2014; Belongs as the Universe does to the Maker, not as Field A or Field B does to Jack &#x26; Tom, who did not <hi rend="italic">make</hi>, or call into, existence, said fields at all, but have merely obtained poss<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of them (very temporary poss<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) by the consent of neighbours for the time <pb id="pg-29-312" n="29:312"/>being. Being an enemy to solecisms, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a slight comfort to me to see that solecism, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a conspicuous one, choked; that, for one.</p>
<p>Mr Carey&#x2019;s similitude of the big &#x201C;flowergarden&#x201C; from which the Author<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Dickens&#x201C; crossed out. Janvier quotes from H. C. Carey, <hi rend="italic">Letters on International Copyright</hi> (Philadelphia, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>) that in <hi rend="italic">Bleak House</hi> (<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>) Dickens, &#x201C;a most careful observer of men and things,&#x201C; had collected a large number of facts &#x201C;that he has dressed up in different forms,&#x201C; like &#x201C;a man who has entered a garden and collected a variety of the most beautiful flowers&#x201C; (175). For Dickens&#x2019;s reply about &#x201C;the powers and purposes of Fiction,&#x201C; see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 7:404&#x2013;5.</note> makes a bouquet, big &#x201C;store of bricks&#x201C; from which the Author builds a house, halts fatally in one leg (if not in both); and indeed collapses altogether if examined. The fatal halt is this. No author <hi rend="italic">takes away</hi> the least &#x201C;flower,&#x201C; or fraction of a &#x201C;brick,&#x201C; by making his boquet<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> (well or ill) from Mr Careys flowergarden, or his house from Mr Carey&#x2019;s brick store:&#x2014;supposing him to have added nothing whatever, is there not precisely the same stock left, for others to do better with, as before he appeared there? Precisely the same; by hypothesis (his work being <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>), no change whatever, not a daisy shifted from its place, not the chip of a slate more or less. So that, as I said, the &#x201C;boundless flowergarden,&#x201C; &#x201C;boundless brickstore,&#x201C; is not a similitude that represents the object; but halts fatally (in one leg of it), and in fact falls flat,&#x2014;requesting to be carried out on any shutter or wheelbarrow there may be. By the way, as to the other leg of similitude, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to ask Mr C<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Where he supposes those flowers, bricks &#x26;c all came from; and whether it has not fallen within his experience as an extensive Publisher, to see such a thing as a &#x201C;brick&#x201C; that was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> there before? Phenomena of that kind, it is said, become rarer and rarer. If they altogether <hi rend="italic">cease</hi>,&#x2014;then it is merely in the interest of human fair play, and to get sophisms of a conspicuously untenable char<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and similitudes that fall flat, well wheeled out of the ring, that I argue on this matter.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janvier also quoted Carey&#x2019;s opinion that American book prices would be higher if royalties were paid to British authors. Carey had opposed an international copyright treaty signed by the British minister in Washington, D.C., and the American secretary of state, <date when="1853-02-17">17 Feb. 1853</date>, but unratified by the U.S. Senate in the face of American publishers&#x2019; opposition (see J. J. Barnes, <hi rend="italic">Authors, Publishers and Politicians</hi> [<date when="1974-00-00">1974</date>] 241&#x2013;62).</note></p>
<p>Sir, it is a serious enough matter this of Literature, and of Printed Thought, or even Printed Talk. Literature and what is to become of it, and of the world that lives amidst it, and sees its interests high and low getting more and more entirely embarked upon it, and Literature becoming Church and Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and Opera-house all united, is one of the gravest, both to America and to Europe. Rather too grave! But till these collapsed similitudes &#x26;c are well wheeled out, there is no discussing of it gravely. <closer><salute>I have the honour to be, Your &#x26;c</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>Miss Burdett Coutts, an opulent and beneficent Lady, who has heard of your situation, sends me (thro&#x2019; Mr Dickens who has the honour of her acquaintance) the enclosed Twenty Pounds for your behoof.</p>
<p>It seemed to be expected I was to pay the money perhaps by instalments; keeping part of it as a reserve &#x26;c for you: but from what judgement I can form of you and your affairs, it seems to me best to pay it wholly down at once. As I now do;&#x2014;and only request, by return of post, under the cover here inclosed, an acknowledgement that it has come safe.</p>
<p>I have not the honour to be acquainted with Lady Palmerston; nor can I promise anything to you which depends upon her Ladyship: but if any opportunity did offer, you need not doubt I should be ready to make use of it for your advantage.</p>

<p>My gratitude to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> last night was unspeakable! as was my distraction with all these unusual men&#x2014;under the circumstances.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>There is clearly nothing to be made of that <hi rend="italic">Grampus</hi> Wake:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Henry Wake, whom both TC and Ruskin knew.</note> the leather jerkin of George Fox has buttoned him up from the sight of Sun and Moon.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC often mentions George Fox&#x2019;s simple leather dress; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420108-TC-MAC-01"><sic>14:9</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1842-01-08">8 Jan. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-22/lt-184708019-TC-RMM-01"><sic>22:39</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1847-08-19">19 Aug. 1847</date></corr></ref>. Wake was a Quaker.</note> We (that is, you) fairly offered him human help, if he would have had it.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to hear of your coughing and continued sickliness. Be patient, quiet;&#x2014;this is a monition to you to take more time! My impression generally has been that you go too fast; in many senses, this;&#x2014;and that you will have to learn the other side of the business too,&#x2014;what infinite profit there occasionally is in sitting absolutely down (were it even in a desperate mood, on hest of inexorable necessity), and <hi rend="italic">doing nothing</hi>. This is very true; and I hope you will learn to believe it:&#x2014;at all events, act upon it at present, on that; and be <hi rend="italic">loyal</hi> to the idle Summer Air, till that have set you on your feet again.</p>
<p>Some afternoon, were you once home, you must come out hither, and take me to your place;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denmark Hill.</note> I will wander about with you till night; and not fail to make my way <hi rend="italic">back</hi> on my own resources. That, I suppose, might answer? To myself it would be a pleasant half-holiday; a pause in the sandy wilderness on reaching some convenient stopping-place. Keep it in your eye.</p>
<p>My Prussian affairs are as bad almost as <hi rend="italic">Balaklava;</hi> and indeed resemble that notable Enterprise of the Turk War in several respects,&#x2014;in this especially, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had no business at all to concern myself in such an adventure, with such associates; and that a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> result to it does not seem (for most part) so much as possible! &#x201C;The longer you look at it,&#x201C; as Sir John Burgoyne says, &#x201C;the less you see your way thro&#x2019; it.&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.

He was recalled in <date when="1855-02-00">Feb.</date>, arriving in London in <date when="1855-04-00">mid-April</date>. He gave evidence to Roebuck&#x2019;s commission of enquiry, <date when="1855-05-01">1 May</date>, where he faced hostile questioning about supplies to the troops at Sebastopol. He defended himself by criticizing inefficient military institutions, particularly the commissariat (<hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi>, IX, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>, 2:325&#x2013;48; <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1855-05-02">2 May</date>).

It is not because I wish any one spared, but our army is held up in such a ridiculous light to the world. If it is to be granted that abuses will be cured by the publicity, and that they can only be cured in that way, then I should approve; but I doubt both statements. What fun it would be if they were to call for all letters from C<supplied>[ampbell]</supplied>. and Colonel S<supplied>[terling]</supplied>. to the Chief of the Staff, to the Adjutant-General, and to the Commandant, which relate to the state of affairs at Balaklava!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Some years ago you were so good as favour me with the Copy of a <hi rend="italic">Cromwell Letter</hi> which you possess; which probably you have seen in the printed state since then.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460306-TC-DL-01"><sic>20:137</sic><corr>TC to DL, <date when="1846-03-06">6 March 1846</date></corr></ref>; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:354 cites text as from Beamont&#x2019;s copy.</note></p>
<p>Last night a friend, who is much a student of Cromwell and his affairs, sends me the inclosed little &#x201C;Report&#x201C; upon an error he discovers in your Letter;&#x2014;&#x201C;horse&#x201C; where &#x201C;foot&#x201C; should be, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi></foreign>. There is no doubt about the error, a palpable mistake: but the question now remains Did Cromwell, <pb id="pg-29-319" n="29:319"/>in the hurry of writing, fall into that slip of the pen, or was it his Copyist whom I had to follow?</p>
<p>If you will have the goodness to read that little &#x201C;Report&#x201C; here inclosed, it will put you completely in possession of the matter; and then if you would be so kind as look Whether your <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi>. of the <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> corresponds with what I have printed,&#x2014;and also whether your <hi rend="italic">Ms</hi> is certainly an <hi rend="italic">original</hi>, or is perhaps itself some kind of copy? Your answer will enable me at once to put this very small matter on its true footing,&#x2014;a thing worth doing in regard to <hi rend="small-caps">Any Matter</hi> one has charge of, especially to a matter where Oliver Cromwell is concerned</p>
<p>Please to return me the little Enclosure sent herewith, when you favour me with a word of answer.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute> This is the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> of one or two Missives about almost nothing, which our poor old God-daughter sends me in these days.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Lowe wrote, <date when="1855-05-20">20 May</date>, that the time had come for her to petition the queen for the property of her cousin, Miss Maria Serena Lowe (d. <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, aged 93). She said she had papers to prove that her father and Miss Lowe were the adopted children of Lord Southwell and the property had been given to her &#x201C;by the Woman in the house.&#x201C; She told TC &#x201C;any day you may appoint I will come to you.&#x201C; Samuel Johnson told Boswell that Mauritius Lowe, Ann&#x2019;s father, was the illegitimate son of Thomas, 2nd Baron Southwell (d. <date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>) (<hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi> 3:380).</note> Her &#x201C;Lincolnshire Property&#x201C; (endless monies, &#xa3;100,000 almost) has gone to the Crown,&#x2014;has gone entirely to <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi> (as I strove to assure the poor old Dame); and assiduous Foresight is struggling hard against evil outlooks! I in general answer <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, or as little as possible; have not, above all, given any knowledge about the grand Palmerston project in that quarter.&#x2014; Nor are you to do anything with this Letter,&#x2014;except merely to burn it, when you have sufficiently feasted your eyes with it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ay de mi</hi></foreign>!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On the whole, however, I wish we had an answer from Palmerston;&#x2014;I own also to a kind of surmise (along with Dickens) that we shall have to make the thing <hi rend="italic">public</hi> before he will effectually stir in it. Please keep this in mind too.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, if Henry<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rawlins, Forster&#x2019;s servant.</note> will draw me out a legible copy of the thing,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-29-320" n="29:320"/>with a sure <hi rend="italic">List</hi> of the Signatures, very legible,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The memorial that had been sent to Palmerston. The copy in FC lists the signatories (with their addresses) in the order they were eventually published but with numbers before them, presumably indicating the order in which the original had been signed: &#x201C;17 Henry Hallam &#x2026; / 19 James Stephen &#x2026; (will subscribe) / 16 S.

<p>God help us all, dear Forster;&#x2014;or what amounts to the same, Let each &#x201C;set a stout heart to a steep hill&#x201C; (as the Scotch say), stout in <hi rend="italic">proportion</hi> to the steepness for each; and that will do.

The association&#x2019;s aims were &#x201C;to put an end to those influences which at present burden every department of the Government with incapable officers and screen them from personal responsibility, and to secure the recognition of the principles of fit men in fit places, promotion by merit, a free career open to talent, and the application to all departments &#x2026; of principles of common sense &#x2026; essential to avert failure and ensure success&#x201C; (Administrative Reform Assoc., <hi rend="italic">A Statement of the Objects of the Association with a List of Subscribers</hi> [<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>]).</note> and <hi rend="italic">Reform</hi> movement in general and in universal from Balaklava &#x26; Downing Street to Cheyne Row and this garret, go better than we hope!</p>

<salute>Dear Helps,</salute>
<p>I may safely say I have read both the Fragments, especially the big one, with real pleasure and approval. &#x201C;Remarks&#x201C; I have none, perhaps a stroke on the margin here and there which really does not pretend to be anything: but this record of my <hi rend="italic">experience</hi> as your reader may be worth giving, and encourage your weary steps thro&#x2019; that great Black wilderness where you have been journeying so long.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helps had sent sections of <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Conquest in America</hi>, vol. 1, to various friends for comments; he replied, <date when="1855-06-03">3 June</date>, from Vernon Hill: &#x201C;if you do not recalcitrate, I shall have another portion sent to you, when it is ready. It is easier for you to read it in this way; and then I shall have your remarks in the margin. All that you have made are good and serviceable. &#x2026; Craik has been considering it; also James Doyle, the brother of Dick, who is a very intelligent fellow and a sound historian. Amongst us, we shall be able to make out the thing rightly, before the book comes to a second edition if it ever does.&#x201C; George Lillie Craik (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6586"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:292</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>), prof. of English lit. and history, Queen&#x2019;s Coll., Belfast; Richard Doyle (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1883-00-00">83</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8005"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), artist and caricaturist, and James W.

<p>It is a fact then that these pieces, especially the bigger, make capital readings, are are<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> likely to suit all kinds of classes, in that respect, who have any <hi rend="italic">naivety</hi> of heart, whether much intellect or little,&#x2014;for your writing will suit both kinds; which is a rare quality in writing.

<p>Your fearless diligence, long-continued patient labour, and determination everywhere to spare no cost in getting to the actual truth so far as possible: these qualities obtain &#x26; merit a still more emphatic suffrage from me. They <pb id="pg-29-323" n="29:323"/>greatly distinguish your book and you,&#x2014;alas that it should be so,&#x2014;in this unfortunate epoch of the world.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have just seen a Letter from Palmerston&#x2019;s Secretary<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not further identified.</note> about those poor Lowes: his Lordship decides that there is no specific fund &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;that, in short, he will give the poor women &#xa3;100 once for all, and have done with him.</p>
<p>Probably Lord Gra<supplied>[n]</supplied>ville<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> will write to you to the same effect shortly: the Letter I speak of, from the Secretary, was addressed to Lord Stanley of Alderley (whom the good Lady Stanley had urged to speak upon the business); that donation of &#xa3;100 is all we shall get from the Premier.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Granville had forwarded the Lowe memorial (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550400-TC-DMLP-01">TC&#x2019;s <sic>draft memorial to Lord P</sic><corr>DMLP</corr>, [<date when="1855-04-00">late April</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-05-00">early May</date>]</ref>) to Palmerston, late May; Palmerston replied, <date when="1855-06-08">8 June</date>, that the case &#x201C;can scarcely be considered&#x201C; under the rules of the Civil List pensions, but that he was recommending a grant of &#xa3;100 &#x201C;from the Royal Bounty Fund&#x201C; (FC).</note> Lady Stanley (who brought the Letter an hour ago) has partly promised me to speak to <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> Palmerston for a Pension of &#xa3;10 annually for the younger of the Lowes;&#x2014;this was a suggestion by the elder of the two, which I rejected some <pb id="pg-29-324" n="29:324"/>time ago, but take up for want of better:&#x2014;it seems the Premier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi> has some small public fund which she can dispose of in small doles of that kind; and the elder Lowe has already a &#xa3;10 annually from the same source.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Royal Bounty, another Civil List fund.</note> Lady Stanley will ask on the first opportunity: but whether there is a vacancy, and then whether there is a will, are questions;&#x2014;and in brief this &#xa3;100 is all that we can count upon. Even with the &#xa3;10 annually, much more without it (as seems likelier), I consider it rather an ineffectual result; clearly <hi rend="italic">in</hi>adequate by itself, and necessitating some appeal to the world <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of Downing Street.</p>
<p>How that is to be set about, you and Dickens know far better than I. Wide publicity and no delay, seem to be the rules. It seems beyond doubt, if the Public were once stirred up, the Public would give abundantly. I do not think the old Dames will much mind the <hi rend="italic">noise</hi>. No censure should be thrown on Palmerston,&#x2014;least of all while the <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> P<hi rend="italic">n</hi> has not yet said no to us! But on the whole a few touches about the Literary Pension Fund<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC means the Civil List Pension Fund, not the Royal Literary Fund.</note> might not be amiss: really if it be not Alfred Tennyson alone, I remember or know nobody of the least real worth to <hi rend="italic">Literature</hi> who ever got six-pence from it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson had a Civil List pension; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451005-JWC-TC-01"><sic>20:13</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-10-05">5 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> Which is a sad thing, if a true one!</p>
<p>Well, do your best and wisest, dear Forster;&#x2014;ask Dickens and he will help! <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your goodness; you are very good and helpful, as you always were.</p>
<p>If Lady Palmerston could be induced to bestow an annuity of &#xa3;20 on these two poor old women, this (with the &#xa3;100 from the Premier) would enable us to <hi rend="italic">dispense</hi> with going into the Newspapers at all; which would be to me a much more agreeable method than raising such a noise as there otherwise will be, even with a far richer money result.&#x2014; If her Ladyship can only give &#xa3;10 to the Younger Lowe, we will take that and be thankful; tho&#x2019; I fear that will not suffice to put the matter on any reasonable final footing.</p>
<p>I seriously consider this a <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> investment for National Charity; and in regard to Literature itself, and &#x201C;encouragement of Literature,&#x201C; I hardly know <pb id="pg-29-325" n="29:325"/>what portion of the annual &#xa3;1200<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The annual amount available for new Civil List pensions, for which the Lowe sisters were ineligible.</note> (if that is the sum) has been better laid out up to this time, for doing a bit of real respect to real &#x201C;Literature.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Pray do what you can; I know you will; and hope the aged Goddaughter of Samuel Johnson may be saved from absolute want by the English Nation, without bursts of Newspaper balderdash being needed in such a cause!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope to call again soon, or otherwise hear good news</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came at the right time; and an answer has been due for some days, but alas is not likely to be paid unless I <hi rend="italic">break in</hi> upon the swift current of things that whirls me continually along here! I take time by the forelock; and write this morning, the first thing I do,&#x2014;lest you think something has something has<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> gone wrong with me, if I keep silence.</p>
<p>There has been nothing in the least <hi rend="italic">new</hi> in my history lately,&#x2014;unless it be a rather <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> degree of <hi rend="italic">biliousness</hi>, sleeplessness &#x26;c &#x26;c, produced probably in part by the change of temperature in the weather. I try to mind that as little as possible. A little bodily strength would be very valuable,&#x2014;if one could get it! But one cannot; one has to go on with what there is on hand. Bodily strength or no strength, it will be highly expedient for a man to get along with the Task he has, for Time is on the wing whatever his Task may be!&#x2014; I do not get on <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than before; I am plodding along, as in dark subterannean<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> passages and &#x201C;vallies of the colour of lead&#x201C;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A play on &#x201C;valley of the shadow of death&#x201C;; Pss. 23:4.</note> some day or other I may chance to get done, and emerge into daylight again.</p>
<p>The Summer has come at last: yesterday was a day of blazing heat; all night too we had to sit with a <hi rend="italic">through-draft</hi>, and the temperature was near 80&#xB0; towards midnight. Early this morning however there has been a fierce shower, which has tempered us again. I often wish I were in the country, especially at the Sea-side; but it is a vain dream,&#x2014;human creatures all wanting to be where they are not;&#x2014;there is no outlook in the least steady that way; indeed nothing fixed any way.

Books, calls, Letter-writing, <hi rend="italic">Law</hi> business (of the Boys&#x2019;s), these seem to be his occupations: he seems perfectly tranquil, cheerful; and is now, I think, in good health.&#x2014; That was one very right thing he did, that of the &#xa3;100 Draught. I did not hear of the situation, till I found it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> helped in that natural and easy manner.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained.</note> I am very glad withal to hear of that purchase; the hand of the diligent maketh <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 10:4.</note>&#x2014;not <hi rend="italic">rich</hi> in the Hudson billiard-table style<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., make temporarily rich by gambling, like George Hudson.</note> (God forbid!),&#x2014;but in a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> way; which it is pleasant to think of and see.&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Jack borrowed the Fraser 3 days ago, but is to bring it back tonight.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Miss Bacon</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I am very glad you have got done with your Book, and are secure of an American Publisher on reasonable terms.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She wrote to Emerson, <date when="1855-03-12">12 March</date>, asking him to renew his search, begun in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>, for an American publisher of her book on Shakespeare. Emerson apparently replied, saying that he would do so. He wrote TC, <date when="1855-04-17">17 April</date>: &#x201C;Miss Bacon sends me word again &#x26; again of your goodness. Against hope &#x26; sight she must be making a remarkable book. I have a letter from her, a few days ago, written in perfect assurance of success!&#x201C; In <date when="1855-06-00">June</date> she heard from Emerson that the Boston publishers, Phillips, Sampson &#x26; Co., who had rejected her work, were now interested. See V. C. Hopkins, <hi rend="italic">Prodigal Puritan: A Life of Delia Bacon</hi> (Cambridge, Mass., <date when="1959-00-00">1959</date>) 188&#x2013;89.</note> These are two great points; and we ought to be very thankful for these.</p>
<p>As to an English Publisher, in the present posture of affairs,&#x2014;at least as to getting any pecuniary profit out of an English Publisher,&#x2014;I confess I foresee <pb id="pg-29-328" n="29:328"/> difficulty, and (in my bilious mood) am not without misgivings. This too, however, is part of the problem; this too you must resolutely attempt, and solve to the extent possible.</p>
<p>Of our Publishers here Longman &#x26; Co. (Paternoster Row) are probably the <hi rend="italic">richest;</hi> perfectly respectable men, who publish a great many Books, but have not to my knowledge excelled their contemporaries in detecting <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> in <hi rend="italic">MSS</hi>. Murray (Albemarle Street) is also a great Publisher, <hi rend="italic">son</hi> of the Murray you used to hear of; I find him often connected with scientific, didactic &#x201C;Serials,&#x201C; as they are called; Travellers&#x2019; Handbooks, railway readings, and the like. Chapman (Chapman &#x26; Hall, 193 Piccadilly), he and Parker are the only two Publishers I have even a slight acquaintance with, who seem likely for you.&#x2014; On the whole, all, or very nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, our English Publishers will, if they undertake, behave with perfect (shopkeeper) accuracy to you in fulfilment of their bargain; but beyond the high shopkeeper spirit I do not know any of them that rises very decisively. I have, in late years, had less and less to do with and all of them; they will <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> that Paper that I have written by way of testimony&#x2014;or at least believe it <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than they would most men&#x2019;s writing (knowing the nature of the beast, that he does not <hi rend="italic">lie</hi> if he can help it); but that is really pretty much all I can do; that and Emerson&#x2019;s letter (with some <hi rend="italic">formal</hi> Note of Introduction by anybody acquainted with a Publisher) will pretty much put the man in possession of the case, and enable him to decide with his eyes <hi rend="italic">open;</hi> which is all we can reasonably want of the poor man. As to the formal &#x201C;Notes of Introduction,&#x201C; except in the cases of Parker and Chapman, it seems to be probable you are acquainted with persons who can do that more appropriately than I,&#x2014;though certainly I too can do it, after a sort, and will cheerfully if you find it needful.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bacon soon applied first to Murray and Parker, who declined, then Chapman &#x26; Hall, <date when="1855-07-04">4 July</date>, who refused in <date when="1855-09-00">Sept.</date> (<hi rend="italic">Prodigal Puritan</hi> 189, 191).</note></p>
<p>In conclusion, I will wish you <hi rend="italic">well through</hi> this final unpleasant part of the business; and shall be very anxious to hear how you get along in it.</p>
<p>I have been sunk in bottomless &#x201C;vortexes of Prussian dust&#x201C; these many months, my very senses almost choked out of me with that and other manifold confusions,&#x2014;bodily health too in general by no means <hi rend="italic">above</hi> par. Hardly once have I been in any direction as far as your street,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was at 12 Spring St., Sussex Gdns.</note>&#x2014;and never once <hi rend="italic">there</hi> (as is too plain!) though my wife has been often urging. She is in distress about an umbrella of yours which was left here; I could have <hi rend="italic">found</hi> your street and house with the eye, but the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> of it I could not communicate to the most urgent Helpmate, having forgotten the name!</p>
<p>The sooner you come down, through the fine Summer weather, and see my wife and self again, it will be the better, on several accounts. Except Sunday <pb id="pg-29-329" n="29:329"/>she is not certain to be at home <hi rend="italic">after</hi> 1 <hi rend="small-caps">p.m.</hi>; but in the evening almost always, or <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that time in the early day.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Believe me always, Dear Miss Bacon, Yours sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[Enclosure.]</p>
<p>Miss Delia Bacon, an American lady, of much worth and earnestness of mind, has devoted a great deal of serious study to Shakspere; and believes herself to have made a singular and important discovery in regard to the history or origin of his works. To perfect this discovery, she came over to England about two years ago, introduced and recommended by some of the best people in America; and here she has been ever since, working in the most earnest unwearied manner to demonstrate her idea as to Shakspere&#x2019;s works; and has now completed, after much care and labour, what she had to say on that subject.</p>
<p>An American Publisher has engaged the volume for America; and Miss B., whose residence gives her copyright here, wishes to find a Publisher for England.</p>
<p>I have not myself examined or seen Miss B.&#x2019;s present MS.; but I can freely bear witness in general that she writes in a clear, elegant, ingenious and highly readable manner; that she is a person of definite ideas, of conscientious veracity in thought as well as word, and that probably no Book written among us during these two years has been more seriously elaborated, and in all ways made the best of, than this of hers.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Thanks again for the trouble you take:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About the Lowes.</note> I wish we all had done with this business; and hope we shall soon.</p>
<p>Dickens&#x2019;s idea is well worth attention. Certainly if the thing can be done by private help, it will be much better that the big public be kept quite apart; &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of <hi rend="italic">noise</hi>,&#x201C; which is the rule in all cases, will be especially welcome in this, and I will vote strongly for it, if <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will suffice. But that is the question; and in reference to that there are two considerations that occur to me, which seem to be of the nature of preliminary points.</p>
<p>First, <hi rend="italic">is</hi> there any person, or small number of persons, who would be ready to furnish the sum necessary, and to whom one could with a clear mind <pb id="pg-29-331" n="29:331"/>recommend such an act of beneficence? If we get <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> from Lady Palmerston (as seems too possible) there will be needed, to make all right (as I compute), an annuity of about &#xa3;20 (beyond what we have) for the <hi rend="italic">longest</hi> of Two Lives (78 and 72):&#x2014;if there is any bountiful noble human soul who will at once undertake to pay that annual sum, and execute some Deed, so as to make it a finished thing, and let <hi rend="italic">us</hi> wash our hands of it? There is the question. I myself had an offer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably from Lady Ashburton.</note> proceeding as I well knew from real munificence of mind, to do some such feat,&#x2014;at an earlier stage of this business, before we applied to Palmerston at all, and when the required annuity was larger than now:&#x2014;but alas there was no <hi rend="italic">Deed</hi> spoken of along with it; and I foresaw a painful dunning operation every year; guessed too that my own visible urgencies might in some manner have interfered with the spontaneity of thing: on the whole found good to postpone it, or decline it except as a do-no-better (why should we say &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">pis-aller</hi></foreign>&#x201C; [makeshift], tho&#x2019; in alliance with the French Emperor so-called?). For the rest, my own powers of private begging are at this moment as good as <hi rend="italic">zero:</hi> I am so close in my garret here, and in so grim and sick a humour, I really could do nothing in that way; or only an insignificance, and with a disproportion between <hi rend="italic">cry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wool</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Much cry, little wool&#x201C;; proverbial.</note> that is frightful to contemplate! Let Dickens then question himself; for it will turn all on that, on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> capabilities and how he judges of them.</p>
<p>Secondly it appears to me there is among the better part of the English people such a respect for their grand <hi rend="italic">orthodox</hi> and heroic Johnson, that if the case of these Lowes and their relation to him were fairly made known to them,&#x2014;if the Palmerston Memorial (with such additions as you could soon make) with the Names attached to it, were conspicuously published in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and this <hi rend="italic">Codicil</hi>, &#x201C;Her Majesty&#x2019;s Government is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> able (tho&#x2019; it has tried) to save these poor creatures from the Workhouse: will you, O English Nation do it?&#x201C;&#x2014;the English Nation surely would not fail to come down with its dust to the due extent. Only name a receiving Committee (Dickens, yourself &#x26;c) out of those who have signed the memorial, I somehow feel confident there would be subscriptions in abundance. Or do you think it is doubtful whether we should get enough, if never so conspicuously produced in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>? I somehow feel certain of the contrary;&#x2014;but know withal that I have no business to feel certain about it, or even to guess as well as some others could.</p>
<p>But thirdly, here is another strong consideration. Could not we, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> this had <hi rend="italic">failed</hi> (if that should be the lot of it), go with still more confidence to the Single Person and say &#x201C;The Nation will not do this thing (to the astonishment of our minds), will not you, O noble Individual?&#x201C;&#x2014;I perceive the &#x201C;Small <pb id="pg-29-332" n="29:332"/>Number of Persons&#x201C; fall out, in this latter emergency; and that (as Dickens feels) we cannot so well ask <hi rend="italic">them after</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> has failed; but I think we can still <hi rend="italic">better</hi> ask the Noble Individual after that Catastrophe. These are all the thoughts I have on the matter;&#x2014;these and a wish to have soon done with it; being at present an extremely stiff-jointed and otherwise heavy-laden individual. In fact, if it had not been for an obliging fellow called Forster, who took the whole thing on his back for me, I know not what would have become of me with it!</p>
<p>I saw Lady Stanley yesterday; but there is yet no certainty whatever about the <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi>-Palmerston subvention, nor it seems is there to be for several days to come. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Within</hi> next week,&#x201C; was all the definiteness I could arrive at.&#x2014; On the other hand, Lady Stanley and her Daughter (Countess of Airly, an <hi rend="italic">airy</hi> young Beauty) felt &#x201C;confident they could raise 100 guineas by way of raffle,&#x201C; for that old <hi rend="italic">Desk</hi> the Dictionary was written upon;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Blanche, countess of Airlie. Ann Lowe claimed to possess the desk on which Johnson wrote his dictionary, but there is no evidence that this was the one he used; see <hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 7:614n.</note> and they seemed to rejoice much in the prospect of such an adventure;&#x2014;which however I earnestly petitioned against, till after the Palmerston response was complete,&#x2014;at the soonest. Oh Heaven, what a quantity of cry, and what a quantity of wool!&#x2014; Truly if Dickens knows a &#x201C;Single Person&#x201C; (as the Commonwealth Politicians used to say) who is ready to do it in the handsome spontaneous way, that will be infinitely better! But let him consider and you, Whether we ought not in any case to try the Nation first? My faculty, after the Nation has said No, is far from <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> (so far as I estimate at present), but till the Nation has been tried, I am, as above said, good for nothing in the begging way.</p>
<p>Let me subjoin here the Exact State of the Lowe Finance, that Dickens and you may have the business wholly before you:</p>
<p>Two old Misses Lowe, 78 and 71, have no kind of servant, and ought to have one, old <hi rend="italic">women</hi> as they are, not to say Gentlewomen. They have farther,</p>
<p>1. Their little Dwellinghouse their own (I know not what <hi rend="italic">rates</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c upon it)</p>
<p>2. &#xa3;21 annually in &#x201C;the Long Annuities&#x201C; (punctually paid at a certain day, but <hi rend="italic">ceasing altogether 7 years hence</hi>.)</p>
<p>3. 20 from the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Chalon <hi rend="italic">Painter</hi> sources.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Alfred Edward Chalon (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5036"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and his brother John James (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5037"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), both painters.</note></p>
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">10</hi> from the &#x201C;Queen&#x2019;s Bounty&#x201C; (the <hi rend="italic">elder</hi> has &#xa3;10, and this &#xa3;51 is what Lady Palmerston is now asked to give the younger sister likewise.</p>
<p>bro&#x2019; over! 51</p>
<p>B<hi rend="italic">p</hi> of Oxford has got 10/&#xa3;61 a year for them, from some other fund, and paid one year of it.</p>
<p>They have therefore at present &#xa3;61 annually; certain, for the next seven <pb id="pg-29-333" n="29:333"/>years, and <hi rend="italic">gettable</hi>, tho&#x2019; all <hi rend="italic">got</hi> in &#xa3;10 portions, apparently with a good deal of haggling to the poor old Goddaughter who is Chancellor of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Exchequer, poor old soul.&#x2014; In ready money they will have &#xa3;100 from Palmerston; have got within the last three months 10 + 20 = &#xa3;30, as we are aware; and I did not hear from them that they were in any debt. I should guess from the rigour and seclusion traceable in the physiognomy of their house, they were of a humour to suffer much rather than borrow; and that probably they had little or no debt.&#x2014; &#x201C;Had not bought any clothes for some years,&#x201C; said they. This is the complete conspectus of their finances.</p>
<p>It appears to me, if they had about &#xa3;20 annually <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, and this ready money to renew their stock of clothes, and set them up again, we might so leave them with a kind of safe conscience; hardly well upon less. The &#xa3;21 &#x201C;failing after 7 years&#x201C; is rather an ugly point;&#x2014;unpleasant to be advancing gradually upon famine, even tho&#x2019; you never do reach it;&#x2014;but we cannot well mend that, so far as I see: let them keep their <hi rend="italic">Desk</hi>, to be &#x201C;raffled for&#x201C; in that contingency; let them also have the privilege of applying to us three, or any of us still extant when it happens: that will pacify their imaginations, and make the best job we can of that gap in the wall. I know not how much ready money would be needed to produce a &#xa3;20 annuity; nor whether, if we had to gather it in a sum, we ought to lay it out in that way, the Actuary genus being so very greedy in its habits,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I suppose there would be no help? But, in fine, it seems to me unless Lady Palmerston will give the required annuity, or Dickens knows some other who will (and will in a way to satisfy <hi rend="italic">him</hi>), we shall really have to try the Public; and shall not get our conscience cleared of the business on any other terms. Till about the end of next week, Lady Palmerston&#x2019;s decision is waited for: after which, unless Dickens have help, I should say, we cannot too soon go ahead in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the thought of it, I confess, makes me rather shudder.</p>
<p>And this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> at last all, dear Forster. I beg a million of pardons; but what can I do except, lamed as I am at present, cry for help? If Dickens and you will do whatever <hi rend="italic">you two like</hi> in the matter, I shall be most grateful. Lady P<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> decision you shall instantly have, when it comes; and then&#x2014; Your own course will have become clear in the interim. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Forster. If you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> come and see me&#x2014; But, alas, can you? God help us all!&#x2014; Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Pity me with my paper; I have no other paper that my iron pen will write upon: may the Devil reward (once more) that gentleman, &#x201C;of the cheap and nasty order,&#x201C; who set about improving paper 30 years ago.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I enclose the little slip of <hi rend="italic">Museum Library</hi> Questions, such as it is,&#x2014;having no time to elaborate it better. See what you can do with it, without too much trouble.&#x2014; I have spent the whole day, looking in vain thro&#x2019; that unspeakable Preuss&#x2019;s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi> for a Poem of F.&#x2019;s (half prose half verse <hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi> rather) about that Excursion of his to Strasburg in <date when="1740-08-00">August 1740</date>;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:331&#x2013;40.</note>&#x2014;and for my life I cannot find it! There is no use in execrating and obtesting: I must do without the thing (till it tumble up again), and try to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> my sanity. But the methodic virtues of my friends Preuss &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> are sure of a lifelong memory with one poor individual.</p>

<p><title><hi rend="italic">Questions for H</hi>n <hi rend="italic">Preuss</hi></title></p>
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Arnold&#x2019;s Mill:</hi> Does the Mill still exist?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC apparently found no answer as he also asked, &#x201C;was it at work to this day?&#x201C; in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:42.</note> <hi rend="italic">Segebusch&#x2019;s</hi> Book<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eduard Ferdinand Sengebusch, <hi rend="italic">Historisch-rechtliche W&#xfc;rdigung der Einmischung Friedrichs des Grossen in die bekannte Rechtessache des M&#xfc;llers Arnold</hi> (Altona, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:244 where TC also spells Sengebusch&#x2019;s name wrongly.</note> is in the Museum here; but it is worth little,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I own still to a tendency towards his side of the question. Among all the Judges, Advocates, Reporters &#x26;c &#x26;c was there ever clear evidence got upon this fundamental point of points, Whether Arnold did actually lose water by the Fishpond, or did not lose any but got it all <hi rend="italic">filtered back</hi> to him? I cannot anywhere find that such evidence was ever <hi rend="italic">sought</hi>. It seems to me the soul of the whole Inquiry; the Yes or No as to Friedrich&#x2019;s conduct in that affair.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The answer remains obscure; for the lawsuit about loss of water, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 19:222&#x2013;46.</note></p>
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Voltaire&#x2019;s last residence in Berlin:</hi> a great many points continue obstinately dark upon that affair; and, in French Books, I perceive, there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> no knowledge, <pb id="pg-29-335" n="29:335"/>and none need be sought (of course).&#x2014; Are there any German accounts of it, that could be purchased or borrowed, or at least indicated? In particular, any <hi rend="italic">account of the Hirsch Trial;</hi> Voltaire&#x2019;s Lawsuit with his Jew, about those <foreign><hi rend="italic">Steuerscheine</hi></foreign> and the Pledged Diamonds?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign><hi rend="italic">Steuerscheine</hi></foreign> were Saxon exchange bills payable in gold to <foreign>bona fide</foreign> Prussians, but only as discounted bills to others; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:191.

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your <hi rend="italic">Voltairiana:</hi> I will look at <hi rend="italic">Luchet</hi> (who is a very foolish creature):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Pierre Louis La Roche du Maine, marquess of Luchet, <hi rend="italic">Histoire litt&#xE9;raire de Monsieur de Voltaire</hi> (Cassel, <date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>).

Alas, there was never any accurate man concerned in that enterprise; and the French Editions of <hi rend="italic">Voltaire</hi> are all a very blind matter.</p>
<p>It strikes me <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could perhaps find me that <hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi> (by F. himself) of the Strasburg Excursion?

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>I have just now despatched the Note about the Treasury &#xa3;100 to my old women; which will gladden their poor old hearts so far.</p>
<p>Last night, at your fine Party (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was the pleasantest I have been at, this long time, and very good really!), I spoke a word to Lord Stanley about the <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> Palmerston part of that Lowe business. He, I regret to say, gave me very little hope;&#x2014;but then he is an unbelieving man; and his bark, too, I have sometimes noticed, is worse than his bite!</p>
<p>Certainly <hi rend="italic">your</hi> prognosis of Lady P<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was much more favourable; and it still seems to me her Ladyship will perhaps herself complete this poor business. The Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> having touched it at all, will it not be far better for the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it, without foreign help? Sixpence being the sum wanted, why should an opulent person <hi rend="italic">give</hi> fourpence and stop there!</p>
<p>I shall regret excessively to go into <hi rend="italic">the Times</hi> with this business; but one cannot quit it with a safe conscience in that <hi rend="italic">half-done</hi> state.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster sent TC a &#x201C;fresh copy of the Memorial,&#x201C; <date when="1855-06-23">23 June</date>. He was waiting to hear Lady Palmerston&#x2019;s answer before he would &#x201C;proceed in the matter of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>,&#x201C; but asked TC to give the Memorial to Robert Lowe, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> leader writer, &#x201C;&#x26; beseech his interest in it.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>I know you will, if you can, still speak a good word to the Lady Palmerston, and I hope will still succeed: at any rate, please let me know now <hi rend="italic">as soon as possible</hi> what the issue <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be.</p>
<p>And your Petitioner will ever pray,&#x2014;and not bother you any farther for some time! God knows I have work enough of my own in this garret without going out to Deptford<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where the Lowe sisters lived.</note> to seek more. But this is a true thing, in the old Psalm of David (Scotch metre),</p>
<lg><l>&#x201C;Blessed is he that wisely doth</l>
<l>The poor man&#x2019;s case consider;</l>
<l>For when the time of trouble is,</l>
<l>The Lord will him deli&#x201C;ver!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Metrical Psalm, 41:1.</note>&#x2014;</l></lg>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Lady Stanley; it is the duty of human creatures (especially female d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>) to be good as well as beautiful,&#x2014;is it not?</p>

<salute>Dear Jean</salute>
<p>You asked me about a man called Bayne, one day, who had been writing upon me: since that Bayne has sent me his Book, with the enclosed Note; to both of which I make you very welcome. The Book is gone, off by our Postman, hours ago; and here before quitting my garret, I send you the Letter too, in the chance you may get some kind of entertainment out of the affair. Bayne I guess to be some young Edinburgh Preacher (or the like), with great heart, and probably as yet little <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> on board: I do not dislike him, only judge he may have a good deal of <hi rend="italic">wind</hi> just now upon his stomach;&#x2014;and that if he had written <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been still wiser for him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Bayne (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896-00-00">96</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1775"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), editor, biographer and misc. writer; M.A., <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, Aberdeen; son (and grandson) of a Church of Scotland minister of Fodderty, Ross-shire, he had begun theology at New Coll., Edinburgh, but asthma and bronchial problems had made preaching impossible. Jean may have seen something he wrote in the Glasgow <hi rend="italic">Commonwealth</hi> (begun <date when="1853-10-00">Oct. 1853</date>), which he edited for a short time. <hi rend="italic">The Christian Life, Social and Individual</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>) contained references to TC throughout; he wrote in the preface that TC&#x2019;s influence on his style and thought was &#x201C;as powerful as my mind was capable of receiving: yet my dissent from his opinions is thorough and total&#x201C;; without the &#x201C;rectification&#x201C; of Christianity, TC&#x2019;s views &#x201C;must be pernicious,&#x201C; but that they &#x201C;convey important lessons&#x201C; to Christians and the church. Since no one better has done it, he is trying to put into the &#x201C;streams that flow from the fountain &#x2026; a branch from the Christian vine&#x201C; (v). After Hugh Miller&#x2019;s death, he edited <hi rend="italic">The Witness</hi>,<date when="1856-12-00">Dec. 1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-12-00">62</date>, and later wrote <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters of Hugh Miller</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Lessons from my Masters, Carlyle, Tennyson and Ruskin</hi> (<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>).</note> Silence ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all this; and burn his Letter, poor fellow. I answered in a kind manner; but evaded (with dextrous politeness) to make an acquaintance just now!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Burn</hi> the Letter.</p>
<p>Thanks for your purpose about the Bathing quarters&#x2014;I am thinking, since yesterday, whether it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be possible to crouch in, under absolute secrecy, for a three weeks, about the Gill at Mary&#x2019;s! I suppose one could have a chance to get sleep there, to be pretty entirely let alone. Farm produce, milk and meal, are the grand diet my soul longs for at this time.

<p>I doubt, you think me very careless; but that is not it.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>You may believe me I am very sorry; I had not the least idea what the Affair was, the other morning, else a message of that kind would have met a very different reception indeed! But I have constantly very bad health, still a great deal of confused business, with strength not now on the <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> for doing it; and am obliged to shrink into the remotest nook with my day&#x2019;s task, and <pb id="pg-29-342" n="29:342"/>carefully avoid all agitations whatever. For which reason, too, I have to deny myself the distinguished honour you are good enough to offer in so handsome a way; and cannot gratify my feelings by waiting on you on the 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, even to return thanks personally for such kindness.</p>
<p>That here and there a serious fellow citizen recognises Cromwell thro&#x2019; the long ugly toils I had with that Great Englishman, is surely some reward to one, if one needed any reward in such a matter. I will accept your testimony as a gratifying thing; and as a monition withal To<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> hold on while the daylight yet lasts, in a similar course.</p>
<p>I should like very well to see your Merchant-Tailors Hall;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Threadneedle St.; it had portraits of many notables.</note> and propose to look in (probably with my Wife), some time when we are in the City, if you can favour us with a Ticket, at your convenience.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks for the distinguished honour done me, and begging the continuance of such friendly sentiments, I have the honour to be, Sir,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I have just heard from the old Miss Lowe that she has <hi rend="italic">got</hi> her &#xa3;100, from &#x201C;Wainwright at the Treasury&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably John Wainewright, taxing master in chancery, of 3 Hyde Park Pl. W.</note> on inquiring of Lord Stanley, I had got to understand that there would be an <hi rend="italic">Order</hi> (naturally) left there; had instructed Miss Lowe accordingly; and this is the result.&#x2014; The Letter, with its strange handwriting and <hi rend="italic">tenor</hi>, jumping about like a Kangaroo, shall be duly sent; but in the meanwhile I despatch it, as a fillip or memento, to Lady Stanley, from whom I can get no answer ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Lady Palmerston,&#x2014;and who indeed evidently has none, nor can get any, from the latter Ladyship.&#x2014; I have not seen Lowe (of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Lowe.</note> or anybody; but I have a kind of hope this poor straggling affair will come all right in the end,&#x2014;if we have patience with it.</p>
<p>Here appended is an Excerpt from one of those Books you left for my study here. It is really a clever thing: but there are 4 points in it that remain <hi rend="italic">dark:</hi> do you know anybody that could with ease put them in a luminous condition? <pb id="pg-29-343" n="29:343"/>Some Dennis Le Merchent, some Jesse,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Denis Le Marchant (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">1874</date>; <ref target="volume-29/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16422"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), historical writer and chief clerk to the House of Commons, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; John H.

The excerpt is unexplained.</note> some I know not whom?&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t bother much about it: I will manage one way or other (if I adopt the thing at all, in the long run) to make out what is needful.</p>
<p>On second thoughts, I will detain this altogether for 24 hours; tagraggery enough besets the <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >When the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> was finally prepared for the press.</note> of my poor Forster apart from this! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>; bear a hand; and &#x201C;Steady!&#x201C; as the drill-serjeants say. Yours ever&#x2014;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>
<ps><p><hi rend="italic">Friday morning</hi>. No news,&#x2014;except that we are all a day older:&#x2014;let us hope there is also a <hi rend="italic">day&#x2019;s work</hi> more got flung behind us. Forward, therefore; and again &#x201C;Steady!&#x201C;</p>

<p>The Wife when consulted says Thursday or Wednesday;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit Denmark Hill.</note> let it therefore be Wednesday or Thursday, at your discretion, next week.</p>
<p>Of the times &#x26;c I say nothing; only put down, by way of guidepost, on my side of the Border, the following facts:</p>
<p>1. Work ceases with me about 3&#xBD; in the afternoon; so that if left till towards that time, an adventure does not cost me anything,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I am willing to spend, too, on a good adventure,</p>
<p>2. I taste no food between breakfast and dinner; dine, with convenience (provided it be with simplicity, on something like a mutton chop), at any hour between 5&#xBD; and 7&#xBD;</p>
<p>3. We should like to be home not later than 11; and are capable of shifting easily in that particular.</p>
<p>Arrange all these things as seems good on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> side of the Border; and please send us a line to say how they are settled,&#x2014;I mean what the hour of your appearance <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Signature cut away.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Hunt,</salute>
<p>I remember your once mentioning to me, many years ago, the pleasant little fact &#x201C;that Voltaire lodged in Maiden Lane,&#x201C; while in England, about <date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1728-00-00">28</date>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 14:184. Voltaire lived in England, <date when="1726-00-00">1726</date> until <date when="1728-11-00">Nov. 1728</date>, probably returning to France where he remained in hiding until <date when="1729-03-00">March 1729</date>. Some of his letters, <date when="1727-12-00">Dec. 1727</date> to <date when="1728-01-00">Jan. 1728</date>, are written from the White Wig, Maiden Lane, Covent Garden.</note>&#x2014; If you chance to remember, or conveniently discover, in which Book you read this, I will ask you to tell me Chapter and verse. Also whether you know anything about an &#x201C;Edward Fawkener&#x201C; (had been a Turkey Merchant, it would seem), from whose house at &#x201C;Wandsworth&#x201C; several of Voltaire&#x2019;s Letters are dated in that period? Is he the same who became Sir Edw<hi rend="italic">d</hi> F<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and Duke of Cumberland&#x2019;s secretary, do you guess?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Everard Fawkener (<date when="1684-00-00">1684</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>), wealthy silk and cloth merchant and classical scholar who had met Voltaire in Paris; later knighted and appointed British Ambassador to Constantinople in <date when="1735-00-00">1735</date>; private secretary to the Duke of Cumberland, <date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>; present at the battle of Fontenoy, <date when="1745-05-11">11 May</date>, when the French beat the British. From <date when="1726-07-00">July 1726</date> Voltaire spent much of his time at Fawkener&#x2019;s home in Wandsworth and dedicated <hi rend="italic">Za&#xEF;re</hi> (Paris, <date when="1733-00-00">1733</date>) to Fawkener; they remained friends until his death.</note> Not otherwise an important person.&#x2014; Bolingbroke&#x2019;s house was in the Battersea region, I have understood, but never knew exactly where:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry St. John, viscount Bolingbroke (<date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>), had settled at Dawley, near Uxbridge in <date when="1725-00-00">1725</date>, and did not return to the family home, Battersea Manor House, until <date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>, two years after his father&#x2019;s death. There is no evidence that Voltaire ever stayed with Bolingbroke, even though he told friends that they could write to him at Bolingbroke&#x2019;s London house. He wrote to a friend, <date when="1726-10-26">26 Oct. 1726</date>, that in <date when="1726-07-00">July</date> when he was alone and ill the Bolingbrokes were in the country and Fawkener rescued him.</note> allusions are made to it in some of Voltaire&#x2019;s Letters, but there is nothing dated from it, that has become conspicuous to the readers of Voltaire. Indeed &#x201C;Darkness visible&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Milton, <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:61 and Pope, <hi rend="italic">The Dunciad</hi> 4:3.</note> is mainly the attendant of said readers, during that English period;&#x2014;and one would, on any subject, rather have light, if it be attainable!</p>
<p>Pray do not mind this question, if it is like to give you trouble. To me it is far from important, really not worth any trouble from you, to speak of;&#x2014;and perhaps is asked as much with the view of bringing an old questioner to your memory, as with any other!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>Have you no thought of coming home, then? You are much wanted here, by many persons and for many reasons. We must pray for <hi rend="italic">hot weather</hi> in Paris; I suppose there will be nothing else that can act upon you. May the weather grow furnace-hot, then, and awaken all the evil odours. Is it not a shame to think of The Grange and its green woods, in these parching brick wildernesses; or of poor Addiscombe, and what used to be there, in such times? The whole world is like an Opera-air on your Piano: beautifullest <hi rend="italic">possibilities</hi> of music, ending all in mere <hi rend="italic">non</hi>sense, little useful to afflicted human nature.</p>
<p>As for me I have not wanted for thoughts about you and other things; but they are thoughts that avail nothing. It is plain you have gone away and left me,&#x2014;indeed, had left me <hi rend="italic">before</hi> you went away: for reasons which appeared satisfactory abundantly,&#x2014;alas, alas! Also that I can do no work, or in six days not the work of one; so weak am I fallen; and push fruitlessly, waggon sunk to the axle-tree in dismal &#x201C;Brandenburg sand.&#x201C; One day, you will pity me, when you have well understood!&#x2014; Seriously I have been utterly <hi rend="italic">bankrupt</hi> in soul, this long while; sleep worse and worse;&#x2014;and often think of gathering myself together, and cowering off to some obscure hut on the seashore, or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cave</hi> where the winds howl to the waves&#x2019; dashing roar,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;Had I a cave&#x201C; 1&#x2013;2.</note> which would perhaps be suitabler.&#x2014; In fact, I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> reach &#x201C;the nadir,&#x201C; one of these days, I often think; and then we shall see whether there is not some upward tendency possible again?</p>
<p>Of people here, or their doings, I can tell you nothing; for I see nobody, or the minimum of &#x201C;bodies,&#x201C; fly out of the way wherever it is possible; and generally, in my imagination, consider the world a ruined dog kennel, with Palmerston and the suitable parties at the head of it,&#x2014;with which I have no concern, except in this garret here, for a short while longer.</p>
<p>The Johnson&#x2019;s God-daughter affair has not gone a good road, chiefly perhaps for want of you on the scene. A sublime little Memorial was drawn up, signed by about twenty of the weightiest literary gent<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> presented to Palmerston by L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Granville, then urged upon him by Lord Stanley: Palmerston, in about a month, gave &#xa3;100 &#x201C;Donation,&#x201C; and there rested. <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi> Palmerston, who was thought to have public funds wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might have supplemented this lame conclusion,&#x2014;was polite to a degree when applied to (by Lady Stanley) but gives no answer for the last 4 or 5 weeks, which at length we understand <pb id="pg-29-346" n="29:346"/>to mean &#x201C;Go to the&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster wrote, <date when="1855-06-23">23 June</date>, about going to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> with an appeal: &#x201C;The only practical thing to settle beforehand will be the names (not more than 2 or 3) to receive subscriptions and a banker, if an honest &#x26; safe individual of that Species may be found.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; I had no need of all that bother in addition. Dickens is certain &#x201C;Miss Coutts will give the annual &#xa3;20 still wanted&#x201C;; and I too know a Better who was equally munificent at an earlier stage,&#x2014;to whom I will still apply in extremity.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton.</note> But I wish you had been here; I wish you were here,&#x2014;I wish a million things, and can get none of them! I mean to write soon again <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. <closer><salute>God bless you ever.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute> The following Document, and the proposal or appeal now grounded on it, require to be made known to the British Public; for which object we, as the course is, apply to the <hi rend="italic">Editor of the Times</hi>. About two months ago there was presented to Lord P<hi rend="italic">n</hi> as Head of her M<hi rend="italic">y&#x2019;s</hi> Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a Memorial, on behalf of a certain aged Miss Lowe and her Sister; which will sufficiently explain itself, and who the Miss Lowes are to those who read it here:</p>
<p><pb id="pg-29-347" n="29:347"/>The undersigned beg resp &#x26;c &#x26;c (insert the <hi rend="italic">Memorial</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the text of Memorial to be inserted, see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550400-TC-DMLP-01"><sic>TC&#x2019;s draft to Lord P, [late April&#x2013;early May]</sic><corr>TC to DMLP, [<date when="1855-04-00">late April</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-05-00">early May</date>]</corr></ref>.</note> with the Signatures &#x26;c)&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Deanery St Pauls</p>
<p>To this Memorial his Lordship made answer, with great courtesy and with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> undue delay, that the Fund set apart for&#x2014;&#x2014;(t.o.)&#x2014;that the fund set apart for encourage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of literature could not be meddled with for a Pension to the God-daughter of Johnson; but that in consider<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the circ<hi rend="italic">s</hi>, his Lordship from some other fund made her a Donation of &#xa3;100. Which sum has accordingly been paid to Miss Lowe: a very welcome Gift and Help: all that the Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> can do in this matter; and unfortunately only about the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> part of what it is indispensable to get done.</p>
<p>An additional Annuity of at least &#xa3;20: we find taking all things at their minimum, the case of these venerable old persons cannot &#x26; must not be dropt with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> something equivalent to that.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC crossed out this paragraph on Forster&#x2019;s clean copy, and suggested the new paragraph which was then included in the version published in the <hi rend="italic">Times:</hi> &#x201C;It was still hoped that the last resource of an appeal to the public might be avoided; that there might be other Government helps, minute charitable funds, adequate to this small emergency; And new endeavours were accordingly made in that direction, and new expectations entertained: but these likewise have all proved ineffectual; and the resulting fact now is, That there is still needed something like an annuity of Thirty Pounds for the joint lives of these two good persons; that (t.o.) that, strictly computing what pittances certain and precarious they already have, and what they still want, there [their] case cannot be left on lower terms. That is to say, about &#xa3;400, to purchase such an annuity, are still needed for them / If the thing &#x26;c.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>If the thing is half as English as we suppose it to be, a small pecuniary result of that kind is not doubtful when once the application is made. At all events as the English<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC first wrote the more accurate &#x201C;Brit<hi rend="italic">h</hi> [British],&#x201C; but crossed it out, presumably to be consistent with the use of &#x201C;English&#x201C; elsewhere and with reference to Johnson&#x2019;s Englishness.</note> Gov<hi rend="italic">t</hi> is not able to do this thing, we are now bound to apprise the English Nat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of it; and ask the English Nation in its miscellaneous Capacity, Are you able to do it?&#x2014; Messrs Coutts Bankers will receive subscriptions from such as feel that this is a valid call upon English beneficence; and we have too much reverence for Samuel Johnson and for the pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> gen<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of his countrymen to use any soliciting or ignoble pressure on the occasion. So as the requisite amount has come in, the subscription will cease: of which due notice will be given. <closer><salute>We are Sir &#x26;c</salute></closer></p>
