<p>The letters in this volume cover the thirteen-month period from <date when="1860-10-00">October 1860</date> to <date when="1861-10-00">October 1861</date>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This volume includes 196 letters, of which TC wrote 129 and JWC 67.</note> In somber moments both JWC and TC frequently lament that they are entering their twilight years and withdrawing from life, but the epistolary evidence collected here suggests that they continue to engage in the social hubbub of their times with animated perspicacity. Invariably, they are able to shake off claustrophobic bouts of self-pity by observing and recording their impressions of the world around them. JWC curses TC for his nearly inhuman devotion to his history of Frederick the Great, while TC feebly pledges to &#x201C;finish my Slavery &#x2026; and rest &#x2026; for the remainder of my time! &#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601106-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1860-11-06">6 Nov. 1860</date></ref>). Yet the fruitful aspect of this perversely deadlocked relationship is that it inspires them to seek freedom through the act of writing, the readiest means by which they can gratify their mutual desire to release their imaginative energies from the emotionally cramped surroundings of 5 Cheyne Row. It is the written word that enables them to channel their frustrations toward constructive purposes.</p>
<p>In her letters JWC bewails the fleeting quality of experience as she seeks to preserve tangible mementos of her vanishing past. News of the sale of beloved Sunny Bank, the home of the Donaldson sisters, where she spent &#x201C;the gladdest, loveliest time in my life,&#x201C; brings her closer to William Dods, the last living link to &#x201C;deathly silent Haddington&#x201C;: &#x201C;Should I not draw nearer to you, and hold you faster, as the night closes in on my early Life, and one after another of my early companions disappear in the darkness!&#x201C; Curiously anticipating the wistful narrator of Marcel Proust&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">&#xc0; la recherche du temps perdu</hi> (Paris, <date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>&#x2013;<date when="1927-00-00">27</date>), she asks Dods for &#x201C;a hawthorn seedling,&#x201C; the smell of which she identifies with the golden days &#x201C;when I went about &#x2018;at my own sweet will&#x2019; jumping over ditches&#x2014;or into them!&#x201C; The memory quickly fades as the preoccupations of the present intervene. She is disgusted by the efforts of the &#x201C;Craven Hill Donaldsons&#x201C; to secure their share of the property, and resents the &#x201C;sacred relicks&#x201C; being desecrated &#x201C;by [their] covetous hands and eyes.&#x201C; Tormented by influenza and still seething from the miscommunication that had forced her to interrupt her holiday in Cheshire and rush back to Cheyne Row to prepare the house for TC, JWC cannot resist an allusion to her husband, that &#x201C;wretch of a man&#x201C; who did not come home &#x201C;till three or four weeks later&#x201C; and who had &#x201C;never intended sailing from Thurso to London <pb id="pg-37-xiv" n="37:xiv"/>direct; and considered I ought to have known that by instinct!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601006-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [<date when="1860-10-06">6? Oct. 1860</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>A more serious loss, the death of her prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;e Kate Ross (previously Sterling) on <date when="1860-11-27">27 November 1860</date>, prompts reflections on mortality that echo Alfred Tennyson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>). Writing to Kate&#x2019;s younger sister Julia Sterling, JWC dispenses with the etiquette of mourning and conjures up a vivid impression of her final glimpse of Kate and &#x201C;her <hi rend="italic">living</hi> face,&#x2014;as it looked when we parted at Brighton,&#x2014;wasted, and wan, and wistful; but with all the old love and truth shining out of it! all the old heroic spirit in it!&#x201C; Eschewing the &#x201C;so-called consolations, which some people would &#x2018;feel it their duty&#x2019; to offer you, and have the face to offer you,&#x201C; JWC pledges to sustain her anguish as a mark of true love for her young friend: &#x201C;It has often struck me as the saddest part of our poor human bereavements, that the pain which so identifies itself with the Love, and which feels at first so infinite and eternal, gets blunted, whether we will or no, and finally effaced, by the mere friction of the Hours!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601203-JWC-JMS-01">JWC to <sic>JS</sic><corr>JMS</corr>, [<date when="1860-12-03">3 Dec. 1860</date>]</ref>). As Tennyson had defiantly declared, &#x201C;Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drown&#x2019;d, &#x2F; Let darkness keep her raven gloss&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi> 1:9&#x2013;10).</p>
<p>Some &#x201C;consolation&#x201C; is available to JWC through the presence of her two maids, the &#x201C;restored&#x201C; Charlotte Southam and the newcomer Sarah Piggott, who complement each other perfectly &#x201C;in a world where perfection is not to be looked for!&#x201C; For JWC, their youthful presence strikes a welcome note of camaraderie and frivolity amid the moribund atmosphere of the house: &#x201C;[I]f the work &#x2026; does not get done with as much order and method as under the tall Charlotte; it is done with more <hi rend="italic">thoroughness</hi> and infinitely more heartiness and pleasantness.&#x201C; In a revealing comparison she adds, &#x201C;It is a curious establishment with something of the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> and character of a <hi rend="italic">nursery!</hi> Charlotte not nineteen till next <date when="1861-03-00">March</date> and Sarah seventeen last week! And they keep up an incessant chirping and chattering and laughing&#x2014;and as both have remarkably sweet voices it is rather pleasant to hear&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601208-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, <date when="1860-12-08">8 Dec. 1860</date></ref>). JWC&#x2019;s winter confinement no longer seems quite so oppressive. Through these lively companions, she glimpses images of her own cherished adolescence. In <date when="1861-01-00">January</date> she delights in reporting the scene from her garden window, from where she watches the sudden outbreak of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">both girls, playing at snowballs!</hi>&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-1861011-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [<date when="1861-01-01">1 Jan. 1861</date>]</ref>). Perhaps wisely, TC refrains from commenting on this melodious new arrangement.</p>
<p>He deeply sympathizes with JWC&#x2019;s predicament and frets constantly about her health, but he barely comprehends the extent of her disillusionment. In a letter to Lady Louisa Ashburton in <date when="1861-02-00">February</date>, JWC lays bare the numbingly monotonous environment in Chelsea: &#x201C;[N]othing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be more dull&#x2014;not to say dismal,&#x2014;than the life we lead! And if it were only <hi rend="italic">dull!</hi> but there is an amount of worry, to temper the dullness, which begets many floating notions <pb id="pg-37-xv" n="37:xv"/>of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">suicide!</hi> If I weren&#x2019;t so very sorry for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C with the &#x2018;time out of joint&#x2019; for him &#x2026; I think I should go quite &#x2018;to smithers&#x2019; with sorrow for&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">myself!</hi>&#x201C; There continues to be no relief from the omnipresent paralysis created by TC&#x2019;s Prussian millstone. Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s invitation to the Carlyles for a visit to the Grange over Easter painfully reminds JWC of the futility of escape: &#x201C;It <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be a good Easter Monday if one spent it at the Grange! But the Grange now looks to me much like the garden of Eden after one had eaten the Apple! fenced round by Cherubims with flaming swords&#x2014;till the day of deliverance arrive when the <hi rend="italic">last &#x2018;proof&#x2019;</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (the pity that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was ever born!) shall have been sent to press&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610223-JWC-LA-01">JWC to Lady A, [<date when="1861-02-23">23 Feb. 1861</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, occasional shafts of outside light did manage to penetrate her inner gloom. She warmly welcomes the inquiries of the novelist Margaret Oliphant, who is preparing to publish a biography of Edward Irving. Describing herself as &#x201C;a practical woman,&#x201C; JWC urges Oliphant to speak with other friends of Irving, including Thomas Erskine, John Carlyle, and Irving&#x2019;s brother-in-law Robert Dickson (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601212-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, [<date when="1860-12-12">12 Dec. 1860</date>]</ref>). When Oliphant tells JWC in <date when="1861-04-00">April</date> that she intends to move from Edinburgh to London, JWC responds with a salty denunciation of the Scottish capital. In language that would have shocked Irving and may have surprised her correspondent, JWC scornfully dismisses Edinburgh as a backwater of provincialism and religious bigotry: &#x201C;I could stand the dulness there; but I can&#x2019;t stand its narrowness, its paltriness, its prejudicedness, its self-conceit, and above all its religious cant. &#x2026; I never feel so well disposed towards London, so thankful to it for the real comfort and furtherance of being <hi rend="italic">well let alone,</hi> as after a course of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Free-Churchism&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610429-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, [<date when="1861-04-29">29 April 1861</date>]</ref>). Such outspokenness impressed and intrigued Oliphant, and must have led her to hope that JWC would be equally forthright in her recollections of Irving.</p>
<p>Oliphant could not have been disappointed, for JWC cooperates to a degree, at once reveling in the authority attributed to her as a confidante of Irving and in the opportunity to share her memories of a very private and delicate subject with another woman. The past could liberate, as well as oppress her. In her coy attempts to deflect Oliphant&#x2019;s questions about her relations with Irving, she conveys a vertiginous sense of emotional and even erotic excitement: &#x201C;It is mildly and modestly that you ask for these &#x2018;details,&#x2019; But nevertheless&#x2014;the effect produced on my Imagination is that of&#x2014;a loaded pistol at my breast. &#x2026; I lose all presence of mind! When trying to recollect things thus <hi rend="italic">to</hi> <hi rend="italic">order</hi> &#x2026; the blood gets into my head; my heart falls to beating; my memory becomes blank. &#x2026; If you were here&#x2014;beside me&#x2014;I dare say I might give you some of the details you want. &#x2026; But to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> them down&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">to</hi> <hi rend="italic">order</hi>&#x2014;all in a row &#x2026; Oh my Dear! I can&#x2019;t indeed! the thought makes me like to <hi rend="italic">scream!</hi>&#x2014;and makes me <hi rend="italic">tingle</hi> from head to foot!&#x201C; She then promises to provide Oliphant with a letter &#x201C;written soon after [Irving] had <pb id="pg-37-xvi" n="37:xvi"/>renewed his acquaintance with me&#x2014;as a grown girl and <hi rend="italic">before</hi> <hi rend="italic">he</hi> <hi rend="italic">had</hi>&#x2014;!&#x201C; JWC rather bravely discusses the decision with TC, who persuades her not to delete the word &#x201C;lovely&#x201C; from the phrase, &#x201C;my dear and lovely pupil.&#x201C; He approves of her choice, discreetly overlooking Irving&#x2019;s slightly florid closing wish in the letter to have JWC as a &#x201C;dear companion through eternity&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610429-JWC-MO-01">JWC to MO, [<date when="1861-04-29">29 April 1861</date>]</ref>, and Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Irving</hi> 1:134&#x2013;36).</p>
<p>A more exotic and dangerous new friend of JWC&#x2019;s is Charlotte Cushman (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), the renowned American actress who had sometimes played men&#x2019;s parts such as Hamlet or Romeo and who was known for forming strongly romantic attachments to younger women, including Geraldine Jewsbury. JWC had known of Cushman since the <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>s, but she had refused to meet her, in spite of Jewsbury&#x2019;s encouragement. When they at last come together in <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>, Cushman writes to her niece, on <date when="1861-09-07">7 September 1861</date>, that Jane is &#x201C;a person whom I have longed for 12 years to know&#x2014;Mrs Carlyle wife of Thomas Carlyle. We were near meeting many years ago, but a Miss Jewsbury was then so injudicious in her praise of me, that Mrs Carlyle took a true womanly antagonism to me &#x26; would not know me&#x201C; (CC to Emma Crow Cushman, <date when="1861-09-07">7 Sept. 1861</date>; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610906-JWC-CCU-01">JWC to <sic>CC</sic><corr>CCU</corr>, [<date when="1861-09-06">6 Sept. 1861</date>]</ref>, and Fielding and Sorensen xxvi). JWC and Cushman were brought together by Sarah Dilberoglue (formerly Anderton), actor and feminist, whose husband Stauros had long been a friend of Geraldine Jewsbury and JWC. Their first meeting is intense, immediate, and dramatic. Soon after JWC writes provocatively, &#x201C;I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> wish to see you; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> wish to hear from you; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love you; (you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that; why make me <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it?) And, further I mean, deliberately and imperatively, that we Two should be friends for the rest of our lives. &#x2026; Set yourself against it <hi rend="italic">if you can</hi>!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610906-JWC-CC-01">JWC to <sic>CC</sic><corr>CCU</corr> [<date when="1861-09-06">6 Sept. 1861</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>This was unusually electric language, even by the standards of JWC&#x2019;s correspondence with Jewsbury, Lady Louisa Ashburton, and Margaret Oliphant, and Cushman can perhaps be forgiven for interpreting JWC&#x2019;s belief in &#x201C;Spiritual Magnetism&#x201C; as a veiled form of animal magnetism, or mesmerism as it was then currently known (see also Fielding and Sorensen xxvii). To her niece she exults that JWC &#x201C;has come to have the wish to know me better&#x2014;well dear, she came&#x2014;she saw &#x26; I conquered! &#x2026; I wish you my darling could have seen this unhandsome, clever, keen, witty, scathing Scotchwoman come entirely down from her proud Eminence to sit at Aunties side&#x2014;with her hand seeking hers &#x26; occasionally giving it a nervous clutch&#x2014;as though she had found warmth and nature there&#x201C; (CC to Emma Crow Cushman, <date when="1861-09-07">7 Sept. <sic>1860</sic><corr>1861</corr></date>; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610906-JWC-CCU-01">JWC to <sic>CC</sic><corr>CCU</corr>, [<date when="1861-09-06">6 Sept. <sic>1860</sic><corr>1861</corr></date>]</ref>). For her part, JWC soon back-pedals from these initial effusions, and begins to distance herself from Cushman when the latter expresses more intimate feelings. Was JWC striving to repress persistent lesbian inclinations? It is more likely that she was frightened of straying too far from the familiar patterns of domesticity, which she so <pb id="pg-37-xvii" n="37:xvii"/>often derided, but which simultaneously provided her with a precarious illusion of security and routine in an otherwise increasingly fragmented, isolated, and lonely existence.</p>
<p>Similarly, TC himself clings to the work that he repeatedly denigrates. He wallows in the challenges inherent to writing the third volume of Frederick, and he concedes to John Forster that &#x201C;I am too sensible what the nature of the journey is, and what the strength of the animal&#x2019;s legs, not to feel in a most down-trodden mood, and to &#x2018;join trembling&#x2019; with any &#x2018;mirth&#x2019; I may have!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-186010007-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1860-10-007">7 Oct. 1860</date></ref>). He also confesses to Lady Sandwich that &#x201C;sometimes I think, &#x2018;In 7 or 8 months more, why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it not be all over; and nothing but going in grass, with the shoes off, ever after!&#x2019;&#x2014; This is too sanguine a computation&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610406-TC-LS-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, <date when="1861-04-06">6 April 1861</date></ref>). In <date when="1861-08-00">August</date> he had reported to Forster, &#x201C;No man, not the weariest of the Greeks before Troy, ever was so weary of a Task wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has fairly broken my heart&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610817-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1861-08-17">17 Aug. 1861</date></ref>). But TC&#x2019;s exile is far less remote than he pretends. Mentally and physically, he remains in good health. JWC confides to Alexander Gilchrist that &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle is become so enamoured of the retirement he enjoys&#x2014;beside the water-barrel, under that ten shillingsworth of calico&#x2014;that I don&#x2019;t think a farm-house even within a stone cast of <hi rend="italic">the sea</hi> &#x2026; would tempt his imagination!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610731-JWC-AGI-01">JWC to <sic>AG</sic><corr>AGI</corr>, <date when="1861-07-31">31 July 1861</date></ref>). TC continues to enjoy the idea of himself as a being cut off from humanity, and he never tires of trying to elicit sympathy from those who are privileged to move &#x201C;among the living.&#x201C; Still, he is too honest and scrupulous a historian to apply such self-serving distinctions to his own labors. On the contrary, he realizes that the only history worth writing is that which absorbs the controversies of the present in the recreation of the past.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, therefore, TC had to be immersed in his own time to fathom the environment of Prussia in the eighteenth century. Few reviewers of the early <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> volumes grasped the topical aspect of TC&#x2019;s great epic, or the wider repercussions of the question that he posed in the opening &#x201C;Proem&#x201C;: &#x201C;What part of that exploded Past, the ruins and dust of which still darken all the air, will continually gravitate back to us; be reshaped, transformed, readapted, that so, in new figures, under new conditions, it may enrich and nourish us again?&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:16). Apparently, Emerson alone understood the paramount importance of the present in TC&#x2019;s vision of the past. In a lecture he delivered in Boston in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>, for example, he astutely refers to the <hi rend="italic">History of Frederick the Great</hi> as &#x201C;a book holding so many memorable and heroic facts &#x2026; with a range, too, of thought and wisdom, so large, so colloquially elastic, that we not so much read a stereotype page as we see the eyes of the writer looking into ours &#x2026; stereoscoping every figure that passes, and every hill, river, wood, hummock and pebble in the long perspective, with its wonderful mnemonics, whereby great and insignificant men are ineffaceably marked and medalled in the memory by what they were, had <pb id="pg-37-xviii" n="37:xviii"/>and did&#x201C; (&#x201C;Art and Criticism,&#x201C; R. W. Emerson, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> ed. E. W. Emerson [Boston, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>] 12:298&#x2013;99). This conception is generated by TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;stereoscopic &#x201C; judgment of the present, which discloses the major social, political, and philosophical conflicts of Frederick&#x2019;s era as they are &#x201C;reshaped, transformed, [and] readapted&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:16) in mysterious and unpredictable ways, with unknown consequences and possibilities.</p>
<p>Contrary to the image that he likes to project, in these letters it is evident that TC continues to be a pivotal figure in the &#x201C;condition of England&#x201C; debate. For him the dominance of liberal ideology and laissez-faire economics stand as enduring signs of the moral and spiritual bankruptcy of Victorian society. His opposition to &#x201C;political economy&#x201C; was reinforced by his study of Frederick the Great&#x2019;s policies. The Prussian king had been hostile to the notion of &#x201C;unlimited Competition&#x201C;: &#x201C;Probably in the world there was never less of a Free-Trader! Constraint, regulation, encouragement, discouragement, reward, punishment; these he never doubted were the method&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:307). TC vigorously influenced and championed Ruskin&#x2019;s attack against contemporary economic theory in essays that the latter published in the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> beginning in <date when="1860-08-00">August 1860</date>, later collected in <hi rend="italic">Unto This Last</hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>). Ruskin&#x2019;s denunciation of &#x201C;political economy&#x201C; provoked a flood of abuse and vituperation, and the publisher George Smith and the editor W. M. Thackeray were eventually forced to stop publication of the series after the fourth installment, &#x201C;Ad Valorem,&#x201C; in <date when="1860-11-00">November</date>. TC is overjoyed by the outcry, and relieved &#x201C;to find myself henceforth in a minority of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> at any rate!&#x201C; After receiving an advance copy of &#x201C;Ad Valorem,&#x201C; he congratulates Ruskin for disrupting the digestion of the respectable classes: &#x201C;You go down thro&#x2019; those unfortunate Dismal-Science people, like a Treble-x of Senna, Glauber and Aloes; like a fit of British Cholera,&#x2014;threatening to be fatal! I have read your Paper with exhilaration, exultation, often with laughter, with &#x2018;Bravissimo!&#x2019; Such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads on the same day, will do a great deal of good&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601029-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1860-10-29">29 Oct. 1860</date></ref>).</p>
<p>TC is particularly pleased by the nimble manner in which Ruskin had disputed the arguments of John Stuart Mill in <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>). In &#x201C;Ad Valorem&#x201C; Ruskin ironically praises Mill for contradicting the cardinal tenet of economic liberalism: &#x201C;He deserves honour among economists by inadvertently disclaiming the principles which he states, and tacitly introducing the moral considerations with which he declares his science has no connection&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s</hi> <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:79). TC savors this swipe at the Utilitarian thinker and his acolytes: &#x201C;The Dismal-Science people will object that their science expressly <hi rend="italic">abstracts</hi> itself from moralities, from &#x26;c &#x26;c: but what you say, and show, is incontrovertibly true, That no &#x2018;Science&#x2019; worthy of men (and not worthier of dogs or of devils) has a right to call itself &#x2018;Political Economy.&#x2019;&#x201C; Less satisfied with the Christian slant of Ruskin&#x2019;s argument in the conclusion <pb id="pg-37-xix" n="37:xix"/>of the essay, &#x201C;[G]o thou forth weeping, bearing precious seed, until the time come, and the kingdom, when Christ&#x2019;s gift of bread, and bequest of peace, shall be &#x2018;Unto this last as unto thee&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s</hi> <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 17:114), TC cautions his friend and disciple: &#x201C;On y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last page, and never till then, I pause slightly, not too sorrowfully, and appeal to a time coming. Noble is the spirit there &#x2026; but alas it is not Philanthropisms that will do then,&#x2014;it is Rhadamanthisms&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18601029-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1860-10-29">29 Oct. 1860</date></ref>). Haunted by the &#x201C;long perspective,&#x201C; TC apparently sees no salvation in the altruistic message of Jesus.</p>
<p>His antipathy to &#x201C;mammon-worship&#x201C; reached a vitriolic crescendo in <date when="1861-06-00">June 1861</date>, soon after Lionel Nathan de Rothschild (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24160"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), banker, philanthropist, first Jewish member of the House of Commons, and Liberal M.P. for the City of London, began to build a house at 148 Piccadilly. TC entertains Dickens with an anti-Semitic pantomime on the subject. The novelist, evidently amused, describes the episode in a letter to the actor William Macready: &#x201C;Carlyle has greatly intensified his aversion to Jews, and is greatly enraged by beholding the gradual rise of a Mansion that Rothschild is building next the Duke of Wellington&#x2019;s. He was with us the other day, representing your old friend King John as an enlightened Sovereign in respect of drawing the teeth of Jews, to make them shed their money; and was comforting himself with an imaginary picture of Rothschild haled to the Court of Queen Victoria, and having several double teeth drawn&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">DL</hi> 9:425). David Alec Wilson, who paraphrases the contents of this letter accurately in his biography of TC, seeks to soften the remarks by reporting TC&#x2019;s response to the inquiry of &#x201C;Sancho-Panza-Froude&#x201C; to determine &#x201C;whether Rothschild was objectionable personally or as a Jew.&#x201C; Notes Wilson, &#x201C;The reply was reassuring,&#x2014;it was neither the man nor the Jew, it was only the too profitable financeering that was loathsome&#x201C; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:430). Twenty-first century readers might not find such an explanation so &#x201C;reassuring&#x201C;&#x2014;TC himself would live to regret such casual and cruel prejudice following the death of his loyal Jewish friend and secretary Joseph Neuberg in <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>&#x2013;but the depth of his opposition to the economic orthodoxies of his age cannot be doubted.</p>
<p>In these months TC discovers another potent condemnation of the &#x201C;Dismal-Science&#x201C; in Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Conduct of Life</hi> (Boston, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>). In a letter to the poet and essayist, he is expansive in his praise: &#x201C;I read it a great while ago, mostly in sheets, and again read it in the finely printed form,&#x2014;I can tell you, if you do not already guess, with a satisfaction given me by the Books of no other living mortal. I predicted to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> English Bookseller a great sale even, reckoning it the best of all your Books.&#x201C; Emerson is as scathing as Ruskin about a &#x201C;political economy&#x201C; that confuses ethics with wealth: &#x201C;The subject of economy mixes itself with morals, inasmuch as it is a peremptory point of virtue that a man&#x2019;s independence be secured. &#x2026; A man in debt is so far a slave, and Wall Street thinks it is easy for a <hi rend="italic">millionaire</hi> to be a man of his <pb id="pg-37-xx" n="37:xx"/>word &#x2026; but that in failing circumstances no man can be relied on to keep his integrity.&#x201C; TC recognizes a less sentimental Emerson in such passages as this: &#x201C;You have grown older, more pungent, piercing;&#x2014;I never read from you before such lightning-gleams of meaning as are to be found here.&#x201C; TC is especially impressed by the conclusion, with its conviction that &#x201C;[t]here is no chance and no anarchy in the universe. All is system and gradation.&#x201C; In the &#x201C;leave-it-alone&#x201C; industrial democracy, the &#x201C;mad crowd drives hither and thither, now furiously commanding this thing to be done, now that.&#x201C; The man who pledges to act for himself is at a loss, &#x201C;when, by and by, for an instant, the air clears and the cloud lifts a little, there are the gods still sitting around him &#x2026; they alone with him&#x201C; (R. W. Emerson, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> ed. E. W. Emerson [Boston, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>], 6:90&#x2013;91, 325). For TC, this &#x201C;finale&#x201C; is a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Fiat Lux</hi>&#x201C; of revelation (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610129-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1861-01-29">29 Jan. 1861</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Typically, TC at first feigns a lack of interest in the outbreak of the American Civil War, yet as the tragedy unfolds, he is gripped by its progress. He informs his New York friend and stockbroker Charles Butler&#x2014;TC had no difficulty in reconciling his contempt for the &#x201C;Dismal-Science&#x201C; with his quite lucrative investments in American railway bonds&#x2014;that &#x201C;[t]o my own poor private tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the controversy is pretty insane on both sides, (&#x2019;Big-indian <hi rend="italic">versus</hi> Little-Indian,&#x2019; when I look at it well); and only the <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> is momentous&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610121-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1861-01-21">21 Jan. 1861</date></ref>). He does not elaborate the distinction, possibly out of deference to Butler, a Unionist sympathizer and an abolitionist. But TC was never an outright apologist for the Confederacy, notwithstanding his notorious slurs against &#x201C;Quashee&#x201C; in &#x201C;The Negro Question&#x201C; (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), and his equivocal support of slavery. The real &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">issue</hi>&#x201C; underlying the American conflict would prove to be inseparable from the great theme that he had outlined in the &#x201C;Proem&#x201C; to <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>: the fate of true &#x201C;Kingship&#x201C; and government in the aftermath of the French Revolution. It was the iconoclastic Prussian king who had precipitated the &#x201C;formidable Explosion, and Suicide of his Century.&#x201C; He is unique for being &#x201C;the last of the Kings; &#x2026; he ushers-in the French Revolution, and closes an Epoch of World-History&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:6). Unwittingly, according to TC, Frederick had cleared the ground for &#x201C;Democracy,&#x201C; a necessary transition from &#x201C;Sham Kingship&#x201C; to just rule, but one that contained the elements of its own destruction, as the great American drama was in the process of demonstrating.</p>
<p>For TC, neither the North, with its commitment to what he identifies as &#x201C;laissez-faire&#x201C; and democratic individualism, nor the South, with its allegiance to a slave-owning feudal aristocracy, represented the future. Though its larger significance in relation to &#x201C;World-History&#x201C; was still unknowable, the American Civil War was nonetheless a startling proof of the perpetual nowness of history. The densely textured battlefield dispatches of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent W. H. Russell (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1907-00-00">1907</date>), which shifted the editorial bias of <pb id="pg-37-xxi" n="37:xxi"/>the paper as well as popular opinion in favor of the South, played powerfully on TC&#x2019;s own imagination. Russell&#x2019;s description of the Confederate rout of the Union Army at Bull Run on <date when="1861-07-22">22 July 1861</date> moved him especially: &#x201C;The Yankee fight sung by Homeric Russell is superb in the Annals of War!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610809-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-08-09">9 Aug. 1861</date></ref>). To Joseph Neuberg TC exclaims, &#x201C;Nothing in military annals equals that of Bull&#x2019;s Run&#x2014;except indeed it were the Taking of Fort Sumter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> ought to be memorable as that of Troy! On the whole, I believe many persons are ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> opening their eyes to the real <hi rend="italic">Beschaffenheit</hi> [condition] not of Yankeeland alone, but of England &#x26; all lands; and we shall see alterations&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610817-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1861-08-17">17 Aug. 1861</date></ref>).</p>
<p>Inevitably, these potential &#x201C;alterations&#x201C; coalesce in TC&#x2019;s mind with scenes in <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great.</hi> He announces to his brother John A. Carlyle in <date when="1861-03-00">March</date> that &#x201C;I am fairly <hi rend="italic">into</hi> Book XV (halfway or more); Robson Printer is nearly thro&#x2019; Book XIII,&#x2014;chasing me along;&#x2014;and if I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> hold out 6 months farther at this rate! But I dare not promise anything. I am become &#x2018;a crazy vehicle&#x2019; in comparison; and <hi rend="italic">shake</hi> at the roads still ahead&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610327-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-03-27">27 March 1861</date></ref>). By <date when="1861-07-00">July</date> he has finished the third volume, which marks the end of the second Silesian war and the peace of Dresden in <date when="1745-12-00">December 1745</date>. At this juncture in the history, TC pauses to consider Prussia under the leadership of Frederick. The key test of nationhood has been passed: &#x201C;&#x2018;Are you able to defend yourselves, then; and to hang together coherent, against the whole world and its incoherences and rages?&#x2019; A question which has to be asked of Nations, before they can be recognised as such. &#x2026; Question which this Nation &#x2026; under this King, it answered to the satisfaction of gods and men. &#x201C; In surviving, Prussia has staked a claim to being the nation of &#x201C;Teutschland,&#x201C; a claim that &#x201C;Teutschland may be perhaps now, in our day, beginning to recognise; with hope, with astonishment&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:196, 197). The interweaving of past and present persists throughout TC&#x2019;s narrative, in &#x201C;spasm after spasm&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610817-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1861-08-17">17 Aug. 1861</date></ref>), luminously showing the impact of his own time on the plot and the style of his history.</p>
<p>In moments when he was able to free his mind from his bondage to <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great,</hi> TC exhibits a compassionate and charitable side to his character that he often took pains to conceal in public. He tirelessly seeks to help and to encourage his brother John, &#x201C;spending the winter in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>;&#x2014;has still no hearth of his own, but lives in lodgings, shifting about&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610228-TC-JCHA-01">TC to <sic>JCH</sic><corr>JCHA</corr>, <date when="1861-02-28">28 Feb. 1861</date></ref>). He also praises the work John had done to prepare the manuscript of David Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A History of Scotish Poetry</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), and urges him to take up his earlier plan to translate Dante, &#x201C;a subject on wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you have no peer in Britain, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has a real and lasting utility!&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18611221-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-12-21">21 Dec. 1861</date></ref>). TC had previously offered financial help to his brother Alexander in Canada, to help his son Tom purchase a farm (see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600413-TC-JF-01"><sic>36:95</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1860-04-13">13 April 1860</date></corr></ref>). In spring <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>, Alexander accepts, and TC asks John to manage the affair. He <pb id="pg-37-xxii" n="37:xxii"/>sends him a check for &#xa3;250&#x2014;duly noted in TC&#x2019;s checkbook stubs held by the National Library of Scotland&#x2014;and advises him &#x201C;to choose <hi rend="italic">what</hi> sum of mine (the whole or the part of that &#xa3;250); but <hi rend="italic">send</hi> at once what you judge right; and whatever you send I will be good for&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-186106004-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-06-004">4 June 1861</date></ref>). TC rarely refused any request for help, no matter how irritating and time-consuming. On <date when="1861-04-15">15 April</date> he sends &#xa3;5 to Samuel Langley, an &#x201C;Indig<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Litr man&#x201C; and part-time clerk at the British Museum &#x201C;for the real requirements of yourself and parents&#x201C; with the admonition that &#x201C;you are totally mistaken ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> my feelings to you; and may at once cease to distress yourself on that score&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-18610415-TC-SLA-01">TC to <sic>[SL]</sic><corr>[SLA]</corr>, <date when="1861-04-15">15 April 1861</date></ref>).</p>
<p>For a man who claimed to abhor and to avoid newspapers, TC was well informed about the events of the day. The death of Inspector James Braidwood (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), superintendent of the London fire brigade, in a conflagration that broke out in warehouses packed with inflammable materials in Southwark on <date when="1861-06-22">22 June</date>, provokes an outpouring of grief. In a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> TC praises this popular expression of sympathy, &#x201C;of deeper sort than usual. &#x2026; It is a beautiful emotion, and apparently a perfectly just one, and well bestowed.&#x201C; Braidwood&#x2019;s family, TC suspects, &#x201C;is not left in wealthy circumstances.&#x201C; He recommends the formation of a &#x201C;Braidwood Testimonial,&#x201C; and promises that &#x201C;if it be acted on, will, with great satisfaction, give my mite among other people; but must, for good reasons, say further, that this [is] all I can do in the matter &#x2026; and that, in particular, I cannot answer any letters on the subject.&#x201C; A committee is established and a public subscription is launched, but subsequent payouts by the fire office and Braidwood&#x2019;s own personal property render these efforts redundant. But TC&#x2019;s letter brings into sharp focus his own inestimable gift to his age&#x2014;his ability to arouse ordinary people to recognize and to acknowledge &#x201C;singular worth,&#x201C; and to honor those &#x201C;[t]horoughly skilled in his function, nobly valiant in it, and faithful to it&#x2014;faithful to the death&#x201C; (<ref target="volume-37/lt-lt-18610630-TC-EOT-01">TC to <sic>Editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi></sic><corr>EOT</corr>, <date when="1861-06-30">30 June 1861</date></ref>).</p>

Neuberg is in poor health; the current proofs are finished at last (<date when="1861-05-13">13</date>). TC declines an invitation from Sir George Sinclair to revisit Caithness, and another to a Mansion House dinner, but rides out to visit Ruskin in fine weather (<date when="1861-05-14">14</date>). He thanks his sister Jean for a parcel from Scotland (<date when="1861-05-19">19</date>).</p>

TC arranges with his brother John to send their nephew Tom in Canada a gift of money (<date when="1861-06-04">4</date>). Matilda and Margaret arrive as the new servants in Cheyne Row. Mrs. Johnston of Grange dies. TC reports a great fire in Tooley Street to his brother John (<date when="1861-06-24">24</date>) and writes to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> in support of an appeal for the superintendent of the fire brigade, James Braidwood (<date when="1861-06-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1861-07-00">July</date>.</hi> Servant Matilda suddenly goes into hospital with a tumor (<date when="1861-07-03">3</date>); JWC visits her almost daily.

Larkin is still helping TC; Neuberg is too ill, though he visits TC and takes him for a drive (<date when="1861-07-07">7</date>). Proofs of vol. 3 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> are completed, after much labor; TC still thinks all will be finished &#x201C;this time twelvemonth&#x201C; (<date when="1861-07-09">9</date>). TC works in the open air during good summer weather, but remains very irritable indoors; asks John A. Carlyle to send him a supply of biscuits from Edinburgh (<date when="1861-07-20">20</date>). He declines an invitation <pb id="pg-37-xxxvi" n="37:xxxvi"/>to lunch from Lady Sandwich (<date when="1861-07-23">23</date>) and thanks Richard Trench, dean of Westminster, for his mother&#x2019;s account of her travels in Germany (<date when="1861-07-24">24</date>).

Ramsgate turns out to be noisy, though JWC feels in better health. Woolner visits and tells TC of Sydney Herbert&#x2019;s death (<date when="1861-08-06">6</date>). TC writes to the Custom House requesting that they release a copy of the German translation of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (<date when="1861-08-08">8</date>), and works with Larkin on maps for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (<date when="1861-08-09">9</date>).

The Carlyles prepare to go to Sunninghill with Lady Sandwich for a holiday. JWC tells Mary Russell she would have preferred to go to Scotland on her own, but TC, &#x201C;much more like a spoiled Baby than <hi rend="italic">other men,</hi>&#x201C; needs her in London all the time (<date when="1861-08-27">27</date>). Lord Ashburton writes from Blair Atholl.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1861-09-00">September</date>.</hi> Fritz the horse is injured, so TC gives up riding temporarily (<date when="1861-09-06">6</date>).

JWC writes to William Dods, offering to go to London for the day to meet him (<date when="1861-09-16">16</date>), and enjoys country quiet. TC rides in Windsor Park, but is restless and irritable until they return to Chelsea (<date when="1861-09-23">23</date>).</p>

In spite of a chest cold, TC accepts an invitation to dinner with John James Ruskin (<date when="1861-10-29">29</date>). He tells his brother John of his low spirits: &#x201C;Oh if I were but done!&#x201C; (<date when="1861-10-30">30</date>).</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got both your Notes, the second of them last night: I intended at any rate to write today,&#x2014;not sooner, being unwilling to bother you with my paltry little confusions attendant on <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-incipiency here (on kindling the smithy-fire again, and setting <hi rend="italic">Smith</hi> and hammers in working order) till once the process were completed.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have been twice upon the Horse &#x201C;Fritz&#x201C;; find him in excellent case, very much improved by the &#x201C;clover&#x201C; and other good usage he has had;&#x2014;and am obliged to you, beyond what I will say at present, for the great quantity of trouble you have taken off me, and laid upon yourself, in regard to Fritz and his interests! He has not been in such health, I believe, these four years past. We will now altogether (much to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> joy) give up the enterprise of breaking him to harness;&#x2014;enough if, by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">hand</hi>ling his <hi rend="italic">hoofs</hi>&#x201C; (as the Irish say), he will carry his poor owner, at any kind of pace, thro&#x2019; the Prussian Adventure, which also bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Fritz,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Frederick,</hi> in the common speech of men: don&#x2019;t we wish we may see that!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550511-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:307</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-05-11">11 May 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> Many thanks to you at any rate.</p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>I was honoured with your Letter and Request, some time ago, while in Scotland; and since my return home, have read the Emerson <hi rend="italic">Proofsheets</hi> you were kind enough to send.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Elder &#x26; Co. wrote, <date when="1860-09-13">13 Sept.</date>, asking TC &#x201C;if it would consist with your engagements to oblige us with a short preface, or introduction&#x201C; to the English edn. of Emerson&#x2019;s forth-coming book <hi rend="italic">The Conduct of Life</hi> and enclosing some proof sheets (MS: NLS 607.562).</note> By wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter I prognosticate that this will be perhaps the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> of all the good Books Mr Emerson has yet given to the world.</p>
<p>The question of writing a Preface to it I have often turned over in my mind. The temptation is great;&#x2014;and alone of existing men, Emerson c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tempt me at all, in existing circumstances. Had not I written a Preface once already;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote a preface to the first English edn. of Emerson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, pbd. by James Fraser, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410625-TC-RWE-01"><sic>13:163</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1841-06-25">25 June 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> were not I so overwhelmingly busy, in these months, with affairs of my own! The result of my deliberations is, I must by no means undertake to do it. The Book, I persuade myself, will on its own strength go into the Libraries of all thinking Englishmen: and as to your Edit<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> all that could be done for it (certifying, namely, that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is the real Edition, not stolen, not bungled in the printing),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the reasons that the publisher wanted TC to write the preface was to prove that theirs was the authorized edn.: &#x201C;From the publication of the edition the author will derive a pecuniary advantage, and we are therefore desirous of its having a distinctive character which may cause it to be preferred to any other English reprint.&#x201C;</note> you can yourselves do, directly and indirectly.</p>

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Milnes</salute>
<p>I dont know the particular gossip to which you allude. I have not read Varnhagen&#x2019;s correspondence;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl Varnhagen von Ense, <hi rend="italic">Briefe an eine Freundin. Aus den Jahren <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date> bis <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date></hi> (Hamburg, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>). <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review,</hi> <date when="1860-08-25">25 Aug.</date>, criticized strongly the anon. ed., Amalie B&#xF6;lte (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1891-00-00">91</date>; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430520-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:177&#x2013;78</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-05-20">20 May 1843</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470715-JWC-HW-01"><sic>22:17</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1847-07-15">15 July 1847</date></corr></ref>), for publishing confidential letters written to her by Varnhagen von Ense (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>) between <date when="1853-00-00">1844</date> and <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, when she was closely acquainted with both JWC and TC (see <ref target="volume-22/ed-22-introduction">22:<sic>x&#x2014;xi</sic><corr>introduction</corr></ref>). The reviewer commented that B&#xF6;lte &#x201C;appears to have been living in Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s family, and to have sedulously hived up, for the amusement of her old friend at Berlin, both the gossip and the opinions of the circle in which she lived. Varnhagen replied with the freedom of a man who does not write with the fear of the printing-press before his eyes, and the young lady, as soon as he is dead, sets to work to publish his letters. Thus censures from his pen on people yet alive, which he himself would evidently have rather died than print, are given without scruple to the world.&#x201C; The reviewer observed about Milnes: &#x201C;Varnhagen writes to his young lady friend [<date when="1850-04-26">26 April 1850</date>] some worldly-wise advice, which she has not been coy enough to sup-press:&#x2014;&#x2018;I hope the acquaintance with Mr. Milnes is now made, and to the satisfaction of both sides. Such threads easily spin themselves farther, and lead to other ties. My best wishes thereto!&#x2019;&#x201C; The reviewer also commented on Varnhagen&#x2019;s attitude to TC: &#x201C;As long as [he] sticks to his hero-worship, Varnhagen&#x2019;s admiration for him knows no bounds. &#x2026; But when Carlyle publishes a pamphlet recommending greater severity to prisoners, this, being a backsliding from humanity-worship, stamps him as an apostate; and from that time forward Varnhagen thinks very little of Carlyle.&#x201C;</note> having no patience to spare from domestic purposes, and being deeply impressed with an idea that I should find it Twaddle! For it has always been <hi rend="italic">born in</hi> on me that Varnhagen was a vain finical, pasteboard-and-varish sort of make-believe Man.</p>
<p>But <hi rend="italic">this &#x201C;Freundin&#x201C;</hi> who exhibits &#x201C;a particular dislike to Miss Wynn&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn, whom B&#xF6;lte disliked because of her intimacy with JWC (see <date when="1844-03-16">16 March 1844</date>; Varnhagen von Ense, <hi rend="italic">Briefe</hi> 88). Shortly after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Briefe</hi>, Wynn wrote, <date when="1860-06-23">23 June</date>, to Varnhagen&#x2019;s niece Ludmilla Assing (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>; see <ref target="volume-33/lt-18580630-TC-JWC-01"><sic>33:267</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-06-30">30 June 1858</date></corr></ref>): &#x201C;I was about to write to tell you how exceedingly charmed I was with the B&#xF6;lte Letters.&#x2014; A great breach of confidence I must always think their publication, but the letters themselves are most beautiful. &#x2026; On the other hand the allusion to the Carlyles it is shameful to <hi rend="italic">publish,</hi> because it will annoy <hi rend="italic">them</hi> and do no good.&#x2014; Your uncle said nothing but what was kind in itself, but all his remarks show that Miss B&#xF6;lte was in the habit of living intimately with them &#x2026; and sending off daily reports of what they said, and did, and of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> singularities and odd opinions,&#x2014;which we should call neither more, nor less, than a <hi rend="italic">Household Spy.</hi>&#x201C; She wrote again to Assing, <date when="1860-08-28">28 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Mrs. C. had not seen Miss B&#xF6;lte&#x2019;s book and did not intend to do so.

The second Note (of yesterday) was especially opportune; as I had concluded that the <hi rend="italic">Book-Parcel</hi> must have misgone, and had, just a few hours before, directed the Bookseller to stir up some Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Agent or other to look after it and at once expedite it by the Thurso Steamer. I was very glad it had come;&#x2014;and now it is a fact you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do me another little favour in regard to it, and if you are magnanimous you will: it is to tell me punctually to a penny what the carriage from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> cost you, that I may pay the same in stamps: the strict order was, &#x201C;Frank all the way&#x201C;; but the Bookseller <pb id="pg-37-13" n="37:13"/>has told me he could not farther than Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi>&#x2014;and there is no doubt the thing is not done, as it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> properly have been. Be magnan<hi rend="italic">s</hi> to that length now if you can!</p>
<p>I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not write from Chelsea till I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> report myself re-anchored here, and things adjusted about me into the route they are to follow. Wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> with all my endeavouring, has hardly yet taken effect,&#x2014;certain of the elements (state of one&#x2019;s nervous-system for example, and <hi rend="italic">decline</hi> hitherto of sleeping talent) not being under one&#x2019;s control altogether. I came home, Saturday gone a fortnight;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC arrived home <date when="1860-09-22">22 Sept.</date></note> and have been deliberately doing my best and wisest ever since; success not yet declared as you see, but alone <hi rend="italic">possible</hi> by steadily persisting in that style. I found my Wife extremely weak, still under the skirts [of] Influenza; but she has steadily mended ever since, and is now at least as well as when I left her: there is one fine thing to be recognised. I have also, after various troublesome adjustments, fairly set my Printer going again; at a leisurely pace; they [must] not catch me if I can help it. Here is one leaf of a Proofsheet; take that lest you get no more. I am not to be called in ill health, not [exactly] yet: but at Thurso itself I believe I slep[t by] virtue (call it <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> if you like) of <hi rend="italic">bile</hi> and liver,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter is now presenting [its ac]count ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, and I must pay. Cour[age! I] have got my Horse again last week; strong [as an] elephant; and find him very beneficial. We will h[ope;] we will <hi rend="italic">try!</hi>&#x2014; Adieu dear Sir; I have not a [mo]ment&#x2019;s time, never have. To the Lady Camilla &#x26; Miss Sincl[air] my grateful homage; upon you all, my blessing. <closer><salute>Yours always</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear James,</salute>
<p>Your Two French Volumes of Anecdotes came punctually to hand; I was gratified by that mark of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> attention;&#x2014;and write a hasty word, lest the Dr may have omitted to inform you.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601007-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-10-07">7 Oct.</date></ref></note> One of the Volumes is a <hi rend="italic">duplicate;</hi> but of that too I will make some use by and by. Thanks for your unwearied kindness to me,&#x2014;yours, and everybody&#x2019;s in my dear old native circle!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have recommenced printing; am dreadfully busy, and likely to be, for many, many long months to come, if I can but hold out. That is now the important condition,&#x2014;for in truth I am a good deal fallen into disrepair; not so <hi rend="italic">weathertight,</hi> by any means, as I used to be half a century ago; and specially <pb id="pg-37-14" n="37:14"/>quite worn down with this present long sad business!

<p>My Horse is in fine order; and does me evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> good. All along hitherto I have continued ticklish <hi rend="italic">as to sleep,</hi> a little, not very much;&#x2014;I am trying my very best in regard to that matter, and hope always to get it well settled again;&#x2014;after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all might go well, and the grand operat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> conclude handsomely in its time. Let us hope, let us hope.&#x2014; Your Aunt is grown considerably better since I returned. All else goes on, as it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do; rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> (Printing and all) than one could expect.</p>
<p>We have had near a fortnight of a &#x201C;St Martin&#x2019;s Summer,&#x201C; bright hard weather, alway bright, and often very cold;&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seems now breaking down into the <hi rend="italic"><date when="0000-11-00">November</date></hi> type again; tho&#x2019;, as your and everybody&#x2019;s Harvest, is now, I trust, <hi rend="italic">over,</hi> weather is a less import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> matter.&#x2014; I must not <hi rend="italic">steal</hi> any more time!

I have got my smithy fire kindled again, and there is sound of the hammer once more audible. I have sunk silent, humiliated, endeavouring to be quietly, wisely, not foolishly, diligent with all the strength left to me. &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019; is not the most pious of my heroes; but the work awakens in me either piety or else despair. Why have I not a more pious labour to end with? perhaps not to be able to end. But one must not quarrel with one&#x2019;s kind of labour. To do it is the thing requisite. My horse is potent for riding, and one of the loyallest quadrupeds. That perhaps is the finest item in the horoscope.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to be reminded of you in this glad and victorious way; and return you many thanks for your welcome Gift. Last night I read the new Poem;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patmore&#x2019;s poem <hi rend="italic">Faithful for Ever</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), pbd. early <date when="1860-10-00">Oct.</date> He had sent TC the previous two poems in <hi rend="italic">The Angel in the House</hi> series, <hi rend="italic">The Betrothal</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Espousals</hi> (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>); see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550118-TC-CP-01"><sic>29:239</sic><corr>TC to CP, <date when="1855-01-18">18 Jan. 1855</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560731-TC-CP-01"><sic>31:145</sic><corr>TC to CP, <date when="1856-07-31">31 July 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> I can truly say, with a great deal of pleasure;&#x2014;and, as you know my aversion to that form of composition when <hi rend="italic">not</hi> inexorably necessary, and with what horror I avoid the things commonly entitled &#x201C;Poems,&#x201C; you may fairly take to yourself a very considerable credit out of that fact alone! The question whether it had not been better that a man of your powers had trained himself to <hi rend="italic">prose,</hi> as exquisitely as you have to verse, and stood by the rigorous <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> as the gods have unalterably made it, instead of floating, in this light beautiful way, rods and miles above it; the question whether, even in verse itself, with this admirable power of execution, you should not now take some more robust class of subjects, &#x26; close the <hi rend="italic">Troubadour</hi> Enterprise as well finished; these and other questions are still open with me (and I hint them to you, at a venture, and because you are no common object to me nor to the world&#x2019;s interests in this time): but the above truth is beyond question with me, That I spent such an ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> over y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Book as I have not had for a long time from any other. Refinement of feeling, purity, tenderness, mild magnanimity,&#x2014;seasoned too with a dash of fine humour, and with plenty of discernment, acuteness, picturesqueness:&#x2014;these are a pretty element, and an unusual, to pass one&#x2019;s even<hi rend="italic">g</hi> in! I admire the cleverness with wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you have made a few touches tell your story; the style is wrought to the highest pitch (in this age of slovenliness), and fills a fellow-workman with respect; keeps itself unshackled, too, and with wonderful dramatic aptitude fits the several characters each with his proper dialect. In short there is a great deal of talent in the Work; the execution of it nearly perfect; and the sentiments and doctrines set forth in it generally excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and noble:&#x2014;what a pity they went <hi rend="italic">soaring</hi> miles above the rugged contradictory facts instead of standing amid them, toilsomely constraining <hi rend="italic">them</hi> into melody! <closer><salute>Good be with you always.</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>The Box arrived last night, &#x201C;all right&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>
&#x2014;almost <hi rend="italic">too</hi> right, for it was such a <hi rend="italic">strong</hi> box, and so <hi rend="italic">emphatically</hi> nailed, that for the first half hour it was doubtful for the maid and myself if we should ever succeed in getting into it! But &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">perseverance</hi>&#x201C; (as the copy line has it) <hi rend="italic">overcomes all difficulties</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial; cf.

What a nice little cheese! and so unexpected! Catch <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever failing to exceed ones expectations. The eggs were a success this time&#x2014;only two absolutely wasted&#x2014;a few more (not many) were broken, or cracked but quite capable of being boiled. And very well timed they are these eggs! for just that morning &#x201C;the Boy,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who supplies us with new laid eggs, had called empty-handed to say his hens had &#x201C;left off&#x201C;&#x2014; The meal is excellent I had some porridge of it to supper. (I have had porridge to supper ever since I returned to dining at two oclock). As for the butter <hi rend="italic">it</hi> also <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> first rate; but having put pickle<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC salted the butter so that it would keep longer.</note> to it this morning (&#x201C;with my own hands&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, a phrase of Edward Irving&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311100-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>6:44</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1831-11-12">12 Nov. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> notwithstanding my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> maids) I tied it up and set it aside till it should have a touch of frost. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> was the right thing to do, was it not? Many thanks Mary dear&#x2014;</p>
<p>The things from Dumfries are also all right; but I will write to tell Jane<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken.</note> about them tomorrow. What a thing! to have to send to Dumfries for drawers in such a place as London! Miss Dunwoodie<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Marion Dinwiddie (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), hosier, living at 131 High St., Dumfries.</note> should feel elated!</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C doesn&#x2019;t seem to have benefited from his long sojourn by the seaside so much as I had hoped, and at first thought. He still goes on waking up several times in the night&#x2014;when he bolts up and smokes, and sometimes <pb id="pg-37-17" n="37:17"/>takes a cold bath!&#x2014;and all that is very dismal for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;to whom waking betwixt lying down and getting up is a novelty. For me my own wakings up some twenty or thirty times every night of my life, for years and years back, are nothing compared with hearing <hi rend="italic">him</hi> jump out of bed overhead, once or sometimes twice during a night. Before he went to Thurso that sound overhead used to set my heart a-thumping to such a degree that I couldn&#x2019;t get another wink of sleep&#x2014;and I was on the brink of a nervous fever when he left.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor loving soul!&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:63).</note> Now that my nerves have had <hi rend="italic">a rest,</hi> and that I am more &#x201C;used to it&#x201C;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460328-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>20:153</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1846-03-28">28 March 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;I get to sleep again when I hear all quiet.&#x2014; But god knows how long I may be <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> that! And when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has broken sleep, and I no sleep at all; it is sad work here I assure you!</p>
<p>You will have heard of my setting up a second servant, and think perhaps that I must be more comfortable now, with two people to work and run for us&#x2014; But I would much rather have made less working and less running <hi rend="small-caps">do</hi>; and kept to my accustomed <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Servant. I have never felt the house my own since my Maid-of-all-Work was converted into a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Cook</hi>&#x201C; and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Housemaid</hi>&#x201C;; and don&#x2019;t feel as if I should <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> get used to the <hi rend="italic">improvement.</hi> It is just as if one had taken <hi rend="italic">Lodgers</hi> into one&#x2019;s lower story, often in the dead of night, when lying awake, I am seized with a wild desire to clear the house of these newcomers, and take back my <hi rend="italic">one</hi> little Charlotte!&#x2014;who is still hanging on at her Mothers, in a wild hope that one or other of them, or both, may break down, and <hi rend="italic">she</hi> be reinstated in her place!</p>
<p>Poor little Charlotte! If I had foreseen how miserable she was to be at leaving us, I couldn&#x2019;t have found in my heart to put her away&#x2014;tho&#x2019; she <hi rend="italic">was</hi> so heedless and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thro other</hi>&#x201C;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC glossed &#x201C;thro&#x2019; other&#x201C; (Scots for muddled) with &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Durcheinander</hi> [muddled] (German) as an adjective&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 3:63); see also <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380830-JWC-TC-01"><sic>10:158</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1838-08-30">30 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note>!&#x2014; With a grain of method she could have done all the two do&#x2014;as well or better than <hi rend="italic">they</hi> do it! she was so <hi rend="italic">clever</hi> and <hi rend="italic">willing.</hi></p>
<p>The new tall Charlotte (the <hi rend="italic">cook</hi>) said to me one day after &#x201C;little Charlotte&#x201C; had been here, &#x201C;What a fool that girl is Maam! I said to her today you seem to like being here; and says she, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">of course I do,</hi> I look upon this as my home&#x201C;&#x2014; But says I, you are a nice looking healthy girl, you will easily get another place, if you try.&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh, says she, I know <hi rend="italic">that&#x2014;</hi>I may get plenty of <hi rend="italic">places</hi> but I shall never get another <hi rend="italic">home</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; What a poor spirit the girl has!

<p><salute>Now, dearest Mary,</salute> suppose you were to write me a letter? It is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> turn. But perhaps, and very likely, you think any letters this good while back haven&#x2019;t deserved to be counted,&#x2014;have been so hurried and unsatisfactory, that you are only nominally in my debt. I am somewhat of that opinion myself! But what could I do you see? A nice long comfortable letter couldn&#x2019;t proceed out of a hurried and unsatisfactory state of mind&#x2014;and what with illnesses&#x2014;one on the back of another&#x2014;and worries all in a heap&#x2014;I should have been more than mortal to have preserved my equanimity thro the last three or four months!</p>
<p>The illnesses I needn&#x2019;t go back upon&#x2014; But the worries, since I am putting them forward as an excuse still need a little explanation. I told you, I believe, that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C had got into the not-sleeping line, and was all out of sorts for some time before he went off to Thurso&#x2014;but I dare say I would not go much into the effects of all that on myself&#x2014;for when I am very anxious about anything I dont like putting my anxiety into words till I can do it in the past tense&#x2014; However, what with the actual disturbance, of his roaming about the house in the night time, describing his sensations with his accustomed exaggerative <hi rend="italic">eloquence;</hi> and the mental disturbance, which my anxiety about him, and my excitable Imagination together caused me; I got <hi rend="italic">so</hi> sleepless and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> nervous as I never was in my life before! and but for his departure, and the news of his immediate improvement in sleep and spirits I must have ended <pb id="pg-37-19" n="37:19"/>in brain fever. My Doctor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alfred Barnes.</note> expected nothing less for me. And during this wretched time, a change of servants had to be transacted! Had I foreseen it&#x2014;(the time) I would have kept on with poor little Charlotte, for tho&#x2019; she was <hi rend="italic">needing</hi> to be put under some <hi rend="italic">stricter</hi> superintendence than mine, still she was and is warmly attached to us&#x2014;and loving kindness at such a time was to have been kept near me, tho accompanied with ever such <hi rend="italic">muddle!</hi> But things were going on as usual when I gave her warning and engaged a (so called) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Treasure</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Jane.&#x201C;</note> in her stead, and also a girl<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Piggott was 16.</note>&#x2014;who was to come on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s return&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Treasure</hi> being 71 years old, and requiring to be supplied with a pair of <hi rend="italic">young legs.</hi> Well my Dear the Treasure, for whom I was remodeling my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">establishment,</hi>&#x201C; turned out&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">Treasures</hi> are too apt to do&#x2014;an arrant old Humbug! Couldn&#x2019;t speak a word of <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t even <hi rend="italic">cook</hi>&#x2014;and finished off by stealing eight bottles of ale! A great comfort for poor Charlotte! who came and nursed me, and cooked all my food when I was too ill to take care of myself. I was weak enough to <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> to take <hi rend="italic">her</hi> back&#x2014;but not weak enough to do it!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">She,</hi> who couldn&#x2019;t rule <hi rend="italic">herself,</hi> would have made a sad mess of ruling a girl nearly her own age!&#x2014;so I had to engage a <hi rend="italic">middle aged</hi> servant<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tall Charlotte&#x201C; was 34.</note> to be <hi rend="italic">head</hi> to the girl. Both of whom were installed on my return from Alderley, and the old Treasure dismissed with <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a blessing.</p>
<p>That was <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the things I had to hurry home for&#x2014;</p>
<p>So now I am mistress of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> servants, and ready to hang myself! Seriously the change is nearly intolerable to me, tho both these women are <hi rend="italic">good</hi> servants,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">as servants go</hi>&#x2014; But the <hi rend="italic">twoness!</hi> The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">much ado about nothing</hi>&#x201C;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:159</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> I hate and cannot use myself to!

<p>I have read your letter with real sympathy. I can but too well conceive the sorrow and uncertainty in which you have to struggle till these vital matters be settled.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macrae wrote: &#x201C;I was a young student at the time, struggling with doubts and difficulties, from amidst which I wrote to Carlyle, as to one who might throw light into the darkness. His reply will have its interest and practical value to many, as it had to me&#x201C; (&#x201C;Thomas Carlyle and His Gospel&#x201C; 11).</note> My wish to help you need not be doubted; but, alas! there is literally as good as nothing to be done. This is one of the numerous cases in which the patient must be his own physician. To no other of mortals is the case wholly known (even if this were all) except to him.</p>
<p>Luther said long ago&#x2014;&#x2018;It is neither safe nor prudent to do ought against Conscience&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Luther&#x2019;s concluding remark in his speech to the Diet of Worms, <date when="1521-00-00">1521</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:135.</note>&#x2014;a motto you abundantly recognise as valid everywhere, especially where things sacred are the question. Of this I need not remind my present correspondent. On the other hand, may not I perhaps say withal that there is a morbid punctiliousness of conscience, which should not be indulged upon details, the heart of the matter being once settled and out of peril. Strict silence will remedy many details; and for silence there is no end of demand upon us in any kind of life which we will lead wisely! I cannot advise as to your Divinity studies and profession; indeed I cannot; no man can understand another in regard to such a thing; no man&#x2019;s practice can be a rule to another.</p>
<p>Something&#x2014;by no means the whole, yet something, and that very considerable&#x2014;will depend on the question, &#x2018;What other outlooks of a life have you, should you quit theology?&#x2019; If there lay open to you an honest unspeaking profession, or course of commended industry, I should almost say at once, &#x2018;Quit this speaking one.&#x2019; Speech is wholesome to very few in these times, to perhaps fewer than ever before! If on the contrary you have nothing at all of definite elsewhere? The prospect of drifting into &#x2018;literature&#x2019; and living by &#x2018;the <pb id="pg-37-22" n="37:22"/>Press&#x2019; ought to be very horrible to you, and, I can well assert, is apt to be more perilous to moral well-being than any Church that is not wholly a false one!</p>
<p>You will, of course, do nothing rashly; take long, earnest, frequent, and oftenest silent counsel with your own mind&#x2014;perhaps still for months and years to come. Be valiant to adopt the wise course, whether flesh or blood repugn or not; in the end, if you be faithful, I can promise you a good deliverance. &#x2026;</p>

Chapuys is responding to a request from Granvelle for personal details about Thomas Cromwell: &#x201C;Master Cromwell &#x2026; is the son of a poor blacksmith, who lived in a small village four miles from this place, and is buried in a common grave in the parish churchyard. His uncle, the father of a cousin whom he has since enriched, was cook to the late Archbishop of Canterbury. The said Cromwell, in his youth, was an ill-conditioned scapegrace. For some offence he was thrown into prison, and was obliged afterwards to leave the country. He went to Flanders, and thence to Rome and other places in Italy. Returning after a time to England, he married the daughter of a wool-comber, and lived in his father-in-law&#x2019;s house, carrying on the business.

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>You go down thro&#x2019; those unfortunate Dismal-Science<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s derogatory term for political economy; see &#x201C;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&#x201C; (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:354).</note> people, like a Treble-x of Senna, Glauber and Aloes;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Popular purgatives.</note> like a fit of British Cholera,&#x2014;threatening to be fatal! I have read your Paper<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin had sent TC an advance copy of &#x201C;Ad Valorem,&#x201C; the fourth of his essays being pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine.</hi> They were collected as <hi rend="italic">Unto This Last</hi> (<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>).</note> with exhilaration, exultation, often with laughter, with &#x201C;Bravissimo!&#x201C;&#x2014; Such a thing flung suddenly into half a million dull British heads on the same day, will do a great deal of good.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Very few people agreed with TC; Ruskin&#x2019;s essays were greeted with such hostility that the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> refused to publish any more. In the preface to <hi rend="italic">Munera Pulveris</hi> (<date when="1872-00-00">1872</date>), Ruskin&#x2019;s second series of essays on political economy, he wrote: &#x201C;The editor of the Magazine [Thackeray] was my friend, and ventured the insertion of the three first essays; but the outcry against them became then too strong for any editor to endure, and he wrote to me, with great discomfort to himself, and many apologies to me, that the Magazine must only admit one Economical Essay more&#x201C; (xxii). The hostile comments included one from the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review,</hi> <date when="1860-11-10">10 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;the way in which [Ruskin] writes of the relations of the rich and poor is worse than ridiculous. It is positively wicked, for it can produce amongst the poor nothing else than bitter and causeless hatred&#x201C; (583). Ruskin was personally devastated by the harsh response to his essays. He wrote to Charles Eliot Norton, <date when="1860-11-04">4 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I am resting now, and find myself in a general state of collapse. I hate the sight of pen and paper, and can&#x2019;t write so much as a note without an effort. I don&#x2019;t think about anything, and feel consequently like Nothing,&#x2014;my chief sense of existence lately having been in thinking or trying to think. &#x2026; When I begin to think at all, I get into states of disgust and fury at the way the mob is going on (meaning by mob, chiefly Dukes, Crown Princes, and such like persons) that I choke&#x201C; (Cook, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Ruskin</hi> 2:10).</note></p>
<p>I marvel, in parts, at the lynx-eyed sharpness of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> logic, at the <hi rend="italic">pincer</hi>-grip (red-hot pincers) you take of certain bloated cheeks and blown-up bellies:&#x2014;more power to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> elbow (tho&#x2019; it is cruel in the extreme)! If you chose to stand <pb id="pg-37-30" n="37:30"/>to that kind of work for the next 7 years, and work out there a result like what you have done in Painting: yes, there were a &#x201C;something to do,&#x201C;&#x2014;not easily measurable in importance to these sunk ages.&#x2014; Meantime my joy is great to find myself henceforth in a minority of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> at any rate!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Dismal-Science people will object that their science expressly <hi rend="italic">abstracts</hi> itself from moralities, from &#x26;c &#x26;c: but what you say, and show, is incontrovertibly true, That no &#x201C;Science&#x201C; worthy of men (and not worthier of dogs or of devils) has a right to call itself &#x201C;Political Economy,&#x201C; or can exist at all except mainly as a fetid nuisance and public poison, on <hi rend="italic">other</hi> terms than those you now shadow out to it for the first time.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of Ruskin&#x2019;s chief targets in the essay was John Stuart Mill; Ruskin argued that the word &#x201C;value,&#x201C; which Mill saw as &#x201C;a relative term&#x201C; (Mill, <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy</hi> [<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>] 1:584), subject to laws of supply and demand and devoid of morality, derived from the same root as &#x201C;valour,&#x201C; defined by Ruskin as strength in life: &#x201C;a truly valuable &#x2026; thing &#x2026; which leads to life with its whole strength. &#x2026; The value of a thing, therefore, is independent of opinion, and of quantity. &#x2026; For ever it avails, or avails not&#x201C; (Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Unto This Last</hi> [<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>] 118&#x2013;19). Without mentioning Mill by name, TC apparently welcomed Ruskin&#x2019;s attacks on Mill&#x2019;s ideas; having shared many ideas in the <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s, such as Saint-Simonianism (see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601024-JWC-LAI-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LAI</corr>, <date when="1860-10-24">24 Oct.</date></ref>), Mill and TC were increasingly out of sympathy with each other.</note></p>
<p>On y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last page, and never till then, I pause slightly, not too sorrowfully, and appeal to a time coming. Noble is the spirit there too, my friend; but alas it is not Philanthropisms that will do then,&#x2014;it is Rhadamanthisms (I sorrowfully see) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are yet at a very great distance!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin argued that while many in the world continue to suffer poverty and deprivation, &#x201C;luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant; the cruelest man living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfold&#x201C;; he appealed to man&#x2019;s compassion for his fellow man. TC had a greater faith in the stern lawgiver epitomized by Rhadamanthus, than in what he saw as misguided philanthropy; see &#x201C;Model Prisons&#x201C; (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>), <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:48&#x2013;86.

Job 3:17.</note></p>
<p>Any how, it was a monstrous impiety on the part of these Craven Hill Donaldsons, to put such a slight on the Life-long affection of their dead aunts for me and mine! Not that I would have had them <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> the pictures to themselves, who cared nothing about them; but it would have been so easy to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> them away! knowing, as they did, several people at Haddington who would have been pleased to have them. my illigitimate Cousin,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Amelia (&#x201C;Jackie&#x201C;) Welsh.</note> for example&#x2014;to look no higher!&#x2014; It was the idea of making a shilling or two by exposing the things for sale that I find so revolting&#x2014;worse even than taking possession of the shawl and brooch.</p>
<p>The course to be adopted with such people is to avoid and forget them. Which course I was pursuing without hindrance; when two or three weeks ago, there arrived a note from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George Donaldson,<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emma, wife of George Hay Donaldson and sister-in-law of Eliza Donaldson.</note> and two days after <pb id="pg-37-34" n="37:34"/>Miss Eliza called with a &#x201C;cousin&#x201C;;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cousin not further identified.</note> and in spite of a standing order that I was always to be &#x201C;not at home&#x201C; for the Miss Donaldsons; they were admitted, not being known by sight to the new girl<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah.</note> who opened the door. I had not moral courage enough to send them away, after they were established in the drawingroom; so I compromised the matter, by going to them with bonnet and shawl on, and treating Miss Eliza (who was decked out in the brightest <hi rend="italic">colours!</hi>) with marked coldness.&#x2014; The sister-in-law&#x2019;s note I laid aside at the time, to show your wife.&#x2014; Bear in mind that I had seen this woman just <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> in my life; that she knows nothing whatever, <hi rend="italic">from</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">me</hi>, of my relations with the Ashburtons; and that her &#x201C;friend M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Shetky&#x201C;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, unless possibly &#x201C;Shetky&#x201C; is a mistake for Mrs. Shickle, of 37 Queen&#x2019;s Gardens, Bayswater, close to the Donaldsons&#x2019; home.</note> was a <hi rend="italic">name</hi> to which I couldnt possibly attach any idea, hearing it for the first time in my life!&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Cool!</hi> dont you think?

I could hardly keep from quoting in my answer to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Donaldson, the opening sentence of a charity Sermon once preached by Sidney Smith &#x201C;Benevolence is a sentiment common to Human Nature!

<p>Some of the plants look alive; two of them give no sign&#x2014;but I am told there is no telling what will live or what die till Spring comes round.</p>
<p>If you are busy; write quite briefly, or make your wife write. I know a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> is not always in the humour to write letters, nor has he always leisure for it. And I am more <hi rend="italic">considerate</hi> than you perhaps think.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The day before yesterday, your Letter of <date when="1860-10-16">October 16</date>, with the Forty-nine Pounds in it, and nothing but good news, came to hand; and was right welcome, as a finis to considerable anxieties (lest something had befallen <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> for the rest of the matter was evidently safe sooner or later) which was annoying me from day to day. What has become of the former letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC expected to hear from Butler in <date when="1860-08-00">Aug.</date>, when his half-yearly interest was due; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600228-TC-CBU-01"><sic>36:79</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1860-02-28">28 Feb.</date></corr></ref></note> I cannot guess; nor is it now of the least moment.</p>
<p>By way of avoiding similar accidents, and ridding my poor mind of money-concerns, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are eminently unfit for me at the present junction of affairs, I have instructed Mr Robert Adamson,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote the next day; see <ref target="volume-37/18601105-TC-RA-01">TC to RA, <date when="1860-11-05">5 Nov.</date></ref></note> of Dumfries N.B (a very punctual good man, Banker and Lawyer, who manages all other such things for me) to put himself into communication with you, and to receive (thro&#x2019; safe and ever-flowing channels wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he and his British Linen Company Bank people no doubt have) these half-yearly interests for me, and lock them in their place, direct, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> interference of mine. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a notable relief to me, and will save you also from a small trouble wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you have never grudged. I have sent Mr Adamson the Original Document (big yellow star of a thing) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you not long since conveyed to me:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The certificate of purchase for $5,000 worth of railway bonds, which Butler had sent TC in <date when="1860-02-00">Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600228-TC-CBU-01"><sic>36:79</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1860-02-28">28 Feb.</date></corr></ref></note> this he now holds in keeping, &#x201C;master of the situation&#x201C;; and a Letter and Answer between you two, I calculate, will be all that is now needed to wash my inexperienced hands of it for the time coming.</p>
<p>From you personally I shall expect, as heretofore, a little Bulletin once in the six months or so, while we continue both in this world; but our Letters henceforth will need to contain nothing except friendly greetings and the little stock of news we may have amassed from time to time. This (considering what your Correspondent is, in the Ledger depart<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) will be a real improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to both of us.</p>
<p>I have also instructed Mr Adamson to send you (on hearing thus will receive it and <hi rend="italic">how</hi>) another Thousand Pounds for investment either in that same stock or in any other wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you may think good, on my behalf;&#x2014;and, I need not doubt, you will be so obliging as exercise again for me your Official judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> on this small matter, and settle it to the best advantage. My own judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> about it may be considered as a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> or nearly so, and yours as a <hi rend="italic">maximum;</hi> <pb id="pg-37-36" n="37:36"/>I will therefore leave it wholly in your hands;&#x2014;Papers &#x26;c all to be sent to Adamson, and I to hear nothing about it, except finally that it is properly &#x201C;fixed&#x201C; (in the English and in the New-English sense), and intends to pay its interest with quiet punctuality thro&#x2019; Adamson, and give us no farther trouble.&#x2014; Do all this, Dear Sir, in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> old helpful way; and I shall feel that I am once more not a little obliged to you.</p>
<p>My case here at present is none of the joyfullest,&#x2014;up to the chin, at all hours, in Prussian rubbish, and for the last year especially often thinking I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never get out, but that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> verily be the death of me! For indeed the old Tabernacle repugns ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such treatment:&#x2014;nevertheless I am at pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a little better; <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> my unblessed Book; and do hope, perhaps in ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a year, to get done with it, and come out still alive!</p>
<p>My wife is also very perceptibly better better,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated on turn of page.</note> so far as we are yet gone this winter; let us hope, let us hope, in this &#x201C;Place of Hope&#x201C;!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note> <closer><salute>With many real regards from both of us,&#x2014; Yours, dear Sir, always</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Inclosed here, lying in one of those Yellow Covers, is a Draught for Forty-nine Pounds (&#xa3;49..0..0), which please negociate for me&#x2014;and put to acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as usual.</p>

Wall Street New York&#x201C;) stating that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are my Representative in the matter, and that you will straightway write to him, and settle how the monies are to [be]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> remitted. The Three Documents will then be all on one footing, safe in <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hand; and I shall need no farther trouble with <hi rend="italic">them,</hi> I hope, except merely the Bank-Clerk&#x2019;s Announcement from time to time that the interests come duly in. Please write <pb id="pg-37-37" n="37:37"/>to New York accordingly, and settle all that for me,&#x2014;as well as something more wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am now to tell you of.</p>
<p>By the same Letter I have written to Mr Butler, requesting that he will invest <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Thousand Pounds (transmitting you the Documents, the management &#x26;c &#x26;c); and bidding him expect the money from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> whenever he writes for it. Please therefore to write to him upon this point also; and to take from my Account with you the Thousand Pounds (&#xa3;1,000..0..0) and send it to Mr Butler for investment as above.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler enclosed the semiannual interest on TC&#x2019;s American investments to Adamson, <date when="1861-02-5">5 Feb. 1861</date>, and wrote: &#x201C;Mr. Carlyle &#x2026; had requested you to make a further remittance to me of 1000&#xa3; Stg for his benefit. &#x2026; I have not received any such remittance and if any has been made it has &#x2026; miscarried&#x201C; (Kimball 290); see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610121-TC-CBU-01">TC to <sic>CB</sic><corr>CBU</corr>, <date when="1861-01-21">21 Jan. 1861</date></ref>.</note> If this is not sufficient Authority (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope it is) for your sending off said money, I will sign and return anything you send to me to that effect. &#x2014; &#x2014; But, if I have made my meaning perfectly intelligible to you, I could like very much to have no (or next to no) writing farther to do on the subject,&#x2014;being, as you perhaps know, so overwhelmingly occupied with other very different things.</p>
<p>I register this Letter; request you to Acknowledge it; and to gather up into due business form the things I have written, and with your old punctuality and kindness to perform the same. If I could hear at last, &#x201C;They <hi rend="italic">are</hi> all duly done,&#x201C; and next to nothing at all in the interim, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the agreeablest way.</p>
<p>My Brother wrote to me ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> settle<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of Craigenputtock,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle who generally spelled Craigenputtoch with a final &#x201C;k.&#x201C;</note> as you were kind enough to request! It shall, the instant I am free to think ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> such things, be put on some <hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> footing: in the mean time we understand that in case both of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> were to be called away with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> farther writing or settling, Craigenp<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go to the one <hi rend="italic">son</hi> of the late Robert Welsh:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had inherited Craigenputtoch from her father, John Welsh; Robert was the only surviving son of JWC&#x2019;s paternal uncle Robert Welsh.</note>
 is not that so? If that is so, that seems to us,&#x2014;at least till we get the young man inquired into, or hear something <hi rend="italic">against</hi> him,&#x2014;a condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> in wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the matter may be safely left till we get a little leisure.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> your 3 successive little Notes; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were very welcome to me, and for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am very much obliged. (The last Note had either <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> its Stamp, or never had one,&#x2014;this let me mention too, as <hi rend="italic">nota-bene</hi>).</p>
<p>I am very glad to learn that you are taking to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lodging,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At 67 Hanover St., Edinburgh, where John A. Carlyle had been lodging since at least <date when="1858-03-00">March 1858</date>.</note> and gradually becoming superior to the noises&#x2014; In a certain state of health they become entirely indiff<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> sometimes a kind of <hi rend="italic">help</hi> to sleep (as, no doubt, you well know), tho&#x2019; in other cases they are such an annoyance and even torment! Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> seems to me always, I know not why, a more natural place for you than London; I mean a pleasanter, as to lodgings &#x26;c.</p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Having, what is very rare with me, five odd minutes (literally almost no more), I set down for you a word of intelligence, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I know will be welcome. Your Note came; thanks for it: you will not be hard with me for returns till the <hi rend="italic">times</hi> become a little less stringent, I know! You are all of you very good to me.</p>
<p>We have terribly fierce weather here; loud totally <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> wind from the North-East, temperature on the edge of frost. This is not kindly for poor Jane; nor is it for me, tho&#x2019; I care less ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> weather. I am happy to tell you, nevertheless, we are still in a tolerable way, both of us; Jane <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> a good deal better than I have seen her do, in sad seasons now past; I too, nothing like so wretched as I was on that head for the first month here,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; unluckily again last night, I <hi rend="italic">slipped stays</hi> (owing to accid<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of various kinds), and had strictly speaking no sleep at all, tho&#x2019; I lay quiet in a kind of dog-sleep for most part, and did not madly rove about in the dark and cold as sometimes. I don&#x2019;t feel much worse today; and will, of course, do my utmost to get into trim again tonight. Our Printing rolls on, keeping me like a cock on a spit; but it is infinitely comfortable to see pieces of the accursed stuff actually dropping off from me, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to blister my poor skin they again while Time is; this is my chief or one solace in the days that now run, and a precious one <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is. If my nervous-system (especially my poor modicum of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>) will but hold out, I shall finish my Slavery, not dishonourably, after all;&#x2014;and rest (Oh how I mean to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>) for the remainder of my time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The snow-boots I have got well lined with flannel,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591113-TC-JCA-01"><sic>36:7</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1859-11-13">13 Nov. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> the <hi rend="italic">uppers</hi> of them lengthened a bit which were very scanty, the buttons shifted; and I <hi rend="italic">ride</hi> with them (fine &#x26; <hi rend="italic">handy</hi> for that object) in the <hi rend="italic">less</hi> cold days.

&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is again sensible, tho&#x2019; very slightly. Three Nightshirts, my thickest, are of your making; and these I have set apart for <hi rend="italic">exclusive</hi> use, since this weather came.&#x2014; Thanks to you all, blessings to you all: here <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the hour come, &#x26; more.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your ever affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;Tho&#x2019; accidentally in very bad fettle today, and with <hi rend="italic">time</hi> quite gone to a few minutes, I send you half a word.</p>
<p>In general I am doing <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than a month ago; and have hopes ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> finishing my sad Problem one day. The Printer goes leisurely, but never stops; he has now <hi rend="italic">finished</hi> fairly to p. 160,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is perhaps not the 8<hi rend="italic">th</hi> part of the whole:&#x2014;the one comfort possible, and it is really an invaluable one, is to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the ugly mass <hi rend="italic">diminishing;</hi> to think, &#x201C;I have done with <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to all eternity!&#x201C;&#x2014;were the &#x201C;you&#x201C; only a few pages of print.&#x2014; I sleep still rather badly; but not by any means <hi rend="italic">so</hi> badly as for a month after my return. In short you may fancy me puddling and <hi rend="italic">pluistering</hi> along, on painful enough terms, but need not bother your imaginat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> with fears ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, more than usual. I have still probably a bit of strength in me; fit to hold out for the months ahead, tough as they are like to be.</p>
<p>The house is visibly more trim and comfortably kept since we had two servants: Jane keeps tolerably well, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great point. My horse is vigorous beyond wont, the weather very cold, but dry, sometimes clear, and good for the season we have reached. Last night (owing to urgency of the friendly Forster) we went to dine with him (no avoiding it,&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the chief cause of my ill fettle; some <hi rend="italic">burbles</hi> of Neuberg&#x2019;s &#x201C;revisal of Book XII,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bk. 12 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note> revisal worse than nothing, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have wasted my time, are another!)

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>When you said &#x201C;Friday&#x201C; to me this afternoon, I had a kind of misgiving; and before getting to the bottom of the stairs, it had become clear to me <hi rend="italic">that I was already engaged for Friday,</hi>&#x2014; Two Literary Persons coming to tea with me (one of them a lion, John Ruffini,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Giovanni Domenico Ruffini (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), formerly a member of Mazzini&#x2019;s Young Italy movement; he lived in England, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, and had been particularly fond of JWC; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410300-JWC-MSC-01"><sic>13:67&#x2013;68</sic><corr>JWC to MSC, <date when="1841-03-25">25 March 1841</date></corr></ref>.

<p><hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the adventure destined to me, then, for &#x201C;Friday night&#x201C;;&#x2014;by no means so agreeable a one, as that other you proposed! You may pity me, if you like:&#x2014;nobody can escape his fate</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been answered before now: but, alas, you know how I am bothered;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1860-11-22">22 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;I am always glad to have a letter from you, but I by no means expect you to answer every one I write to you, pestered as you are with other work.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and indeed there is generally almost nothing that I can tell you, if it be not how my health stands. That I ought to do, especially if the bulletin is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unfavourable,&#x2014;as is the case in this present instance.</p>
<p>The inclosed Letter came last night late (from some Merchant, I think, who had sent it to Chapman, there being no Address on it but &#x201C;London&#x201C;):&#x2014;it is from &#x201C;Dushtie&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal had first visited the Carlyles in <date when="1835-12-00">Dec. 1835</date> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351224-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:277</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1835-12-24">24 Dec. 1835</date></corr></ref>) and again in <date when="1851-06-00">June 1851</date> (see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18510617-TC-JAC-01"><sic>26:91&#x2013;92</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1851-06-17">17 June 1851</date></corr></ref>). &#x201C;Dushtie&#x201C; was possibly a mispronunciation of d&#x2019;Eichthal&#x2019;s name by the Carlyles&#x2019; servant at the time, Anne Cook (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351019-TC-JWC-01"><sic>8:228</sic>TC to JWC, <date when="1835-10-19">19 Oct. 1835</date></ref>). Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal was the cousin of Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal, who had introduced the Carlyles to Saint-Simonianism; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601024-JWC-LAI-01">JWC to <sic>Lady A</sic><corr>LAI</corr>, <date when="1860-10-24">24 Oct.</date></ref> John A.

John wrote out the German words in pencil on the letter and in neat writing on a separate piece of paper.</note> you might stick it into the first Envelope that is coming, for my use. At any rate pray write a word to M&#xfc;nchen on my behoof and your own;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal continued: &#x201C;Pray tell me, Dear Sir, where is Dr Carlyle your brother &#x26; shall we never see him again here? Pray tell him all our comp<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> &#x26; that I should so like to hear from him?&#x201C; John A. Carlyle wrote to TC, <date when="1860-11-22">22 Nov.</date>, that he sent d&#x2019;Eichthal &#x201C;a brief letter by this day&#x2019;s post, knowing that it will be a comfort to him.&#x201C;</note> and make my due compliments &#x26;c there; adding, if you like, what my address is: the old place wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Dushtie knew.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles d&#x2019;Eichthal had visited the Carlyles in Cheyne Row but perhaps had not realized that they still lived at the same address.</note></p>
<p>I was glad to hear anything definite of poor Dr Irving&#x2019;s Son, whom I remember as a lad, but had never heard the ulterior of;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is probably referring to David Irving&#x2019;s eldest son, Robert, now dead. TC knew Irving in the <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>s and early <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>s when he was librarian of the Advocates Lib., Edinburgh. John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1860-11-22">22 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Mr Constable called after your letter came, &#x26; from him I learnt that only the youngest of Dr Irving&#x2019;s sons, named James, is now living&#x2014;youngest by the second marriage. He is at Allahabad, is rather more than thirty years of age, was married to a Miss Fraser about six years ago, &#x26; is a Surgeon by profession.

John A. Carlyle explained in his preface: &#x201C;As to the Editorship, since no one else was ready to undertake it, I consented&#x2014;chiefly from love of the subject and respect for the memory of the Author&#x2014;to superintend the last proofsheets, and very speedily got more deeply entangled in the business&#x201C; (v).</note> you speak of; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is likely to be of use in that department. The qualities you recognise in it are much what I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have expected: the hard gritty Doctor was a solid man; whose information was apt to be good, where he pretended to have any. Now that I remember, I will ask you to give Laing<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Laing wrote a memorial preface to <hi rend="italic">The History of Scotish Poetry</hi>.</note> my compliments; he too is a man of some worth in his province. We got a Book (one of the many Books, I think it is Boswell&#x2019;s) on <hi rend="italic">The Douglas Cause,</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Boswell, <hi rend="italic">The Essence of the Douglas Cause</hi> (<date when="1767-00-00">1767</date>).</note> not long since; and were reading it: I wonder if the <hi rend="italic">Signet Library</hi><note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Signet Library, founded <date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>, is owned by the Society of Writers to her Majesty&#x2019;s Signet, the professional body of Scottish solicitors; Laing was its librarian from <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> until his death in <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>.</note> (sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> one survive, and have liberty to read for amusement!) has got <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the Books on that <hi rend="italic">Douglas Cause?</hi> This of Boswell&#x2019;s, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is merely the spoken opinions of all the Judges leaves one quite in doubt as to the Yes or No of Spurious Birth.

In opposition to the wishes of her brother, Archibald Douglas (ca. <date when="1694-00-00">1694</date>&#x2013;<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7873"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d marquess and 1st duke of Douglas, Lady Jane Douglas (<date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>; <ref target="volume-36/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7905"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), m., <date when="1746-00-00">1746</date>, Col. John Steuart of Grandtully (<date when="1687-00-00">1687</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>), and fled to the Continent with him; in <date when="1748-00-00">1748</date> she gave birth to twin sons, Archibald James Edward (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>) and Sholto Thomas (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>). Almost immediately rumors began to circulate that she was not the children&#x2019;s mother and that the babies had been acquired so they could stand as heirs to the Douglas estates. Her brother refused to see her or to give her any money, so she appealed to George II, who granted her an annual pension of &#xa3;300. Meanwhile Steuart had been incarcerated in the King&#x2019;s Bench prison for debt. After the duke&#x2019;s death, his nephew Archibald&#x2019;s claim to the Douglas estates was contested on behalf of James George Hamilton (<date when="1755-00-00">1755</date>&#x2013;<date when="1769-00-00">69</date>), 7th duke of Hamilton, the closest male heir, who inherited the Douglas title. The case went before the Scottish Law courts, <date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>&#x2013;<date when="1767-00-00">67</date>, resulting in a decision against Archibald; he subsequently appealed to the House of Lords, and the decision was reversed in <date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>, Archibald being declared the rightful heir to the Douglas estates.</note> <pb id="pg-37-46" n="37:46"/>and have left with me the notion of looking into &#x201C; the 1200 Quarto pages&#x201C; of Evidence, some day when I can lay hold of that Publication, and have <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for such a recreation,&#x2014;alas!<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<p>Our printing goes on here, and my writing, and puddling and jumbling with intent to write (one of the horriblest operat<hi rend="italic">ns</hi> ever known): we do not stop; but our rate is very slow.

If my sleeping talent, or some other indispensable one, do not quite desert me, I do count on holding on till finis; and seldom fall into the desperate view of things.

<salute>1000 thanks dear Mr. Woolner!</salute>
<p>I can&#x2019;t make up my mind yet which of the Photographs I like best. The little one is the most characteristic; exactly the attitude in which you stand on our hearthrug! But the larger one will be best for hanging on a wall. So I mean to frame both, the little one alongside of Kate Stanley. I will ask the immortal Mr. Tait,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Tait, painter and photographer.</note> the first time I can get up the steam to go to his house, if he have an unspoiled copy of Lady A.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Lady Louisa Ashburton.</note> I was vexed, after promising you one, to have none better than <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to give you. I am sorry for your cat&#x2019;s Influenza (It is a clear case of Influenza!) but it would have been worse if she had given way to passion, as her mother has just done, and done no end of mischief in attempting a great crime! For several days there had been <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in her eyes when raised to my canary,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kate Stanley had given JWC a canary when she left Alderley after visiting in <date when="1860-08-00">August</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600830-JWC-LST-01"><sic>36:214&#x2013;15</sic><corr>JWC to LST, <date when="1860-08-30">30 Aug.</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600905-JWC-KST-01"><sic>225</sic><corr>JWC to KST, <date when="1860-09-05">5 Sept.</date></corr></ref></note> which filled my heart with alarm. I sent express for a carpenter, and had the cage attached to the drawing-room ceiling, with an elaborate apparatus of chain and pulley and weight. &#x201C;M<hi rend="small-caps">ost expensive</hi>!&#x201C; (as my Scotch servant exclaimed with clasped hands over a Picture of the <hi rend="italic">Virgin and Child</hi> in the National Gallery!)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; phrase of Helen Mitchell, servant at Cheyne Row <date when="1837-12-00">Dec. 1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-11-00">Nov. 1846</date> and <date when="1848-10-00">Oct. 1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-02-00">Feb. 1849</date>.

JWC also quoted Helen as approving &#x201C;a Lady in black with a baby in her lap&#x201C; (13:102). There were at least nine paintings of the Virgin and Child in the National Gallery in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; Helen possibly saw one acquired that year, <hi rend="italic">The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and Other Saints</hi> by Francesco Francia (<date when="1450-00-00">1450</date>&#x2013;ca. <date when="1517-00-00">1517</date>), which shows the baby on Mary&#x2019;s lap, reaching toward Saint Anne, who is dressed in black.</note> and there had it swung for two days, to <pb id="pg-37-48" n="37:48"/>Mr. C.&#x2019;s intense disgust, who regards thy pet as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the most inanely chimerical of all</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;the cat meanwhile spending all its spare time in gazing up at the bird with eyes aflame! But it was safe <hi rend="italic">now</hi>&#x2014;I thought! and went out for a walk. On my return Charlotte met me with &#x201C;Oh! whatever <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you think the cat has gone and done?&#x201C; &#x201C;Eaten my canary?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;No, <hi rend="italic">far worse!</hi>&#x2014;pulled down the cage and the weight, and broke the chain and upset the little table and broken everything on it!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;And not eaten the canary?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh, I suppose the dreadful crash she made frightened <hi rend="italic">herself;</hi> for I met <hi rend="italic">her</hi> running down stairs as I ran up&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the cage was on the floor, and the door open and the canary in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a way!&#x201C; You never saw such a scene of devastation. The carpet was covered with fragments of a pretty terra cotta basket given me by Lady Airlie&#x2014;and fragments of the glass which covered it, and with the earth and ferns that had been growing in it and with birdseed, and bits of brass chain, and I can&#x2019;t tell what all! That is what one gets by breeding up a cat!&#x2014; She had rushed right out at the back door and didn&#x2019;t show her face for twenty-four hours after!&#x2014; And now I don&#x2019;t know where the poor bird will be safe.

<salute>Dear Miss Smith,</salute>
<p>The pleasant surprise of your letter and book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Smith wrote, <date when="1860-11-17">17 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Having taken the liberty of dedicating my Poems which are just Published to you I thought I ought to send you a copy and have accordingly done so by the post which brings this.&#x201C; Smith&#x2019;s book was pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Poems by M.S.</hi> (<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>).</note> was enhanced for me by a coincidence really very curious! Only a few minutes before the postman<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Bullock.</note> left them, I had said to my husband as we sat at breakfast: &#x201C;I wonder what Miss Smith is about? I have heard nothing from her since I saw her in Carlisle more than two years ago!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had written about the possibility of meeting in Carlisle<corr>,</corr> <date when="1858-08-00">Aug. 1858</date> (<ref target="volume-34/lt-18580819-JWC-MS-01"><sic>34:149</sic><corr>JWC to MS, <date when="1858-08-19">19 Aug.

Was that <hi rend="italic">chance?</hi> or <hi rend="italic">magnetism?</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s experience of &#x201C;magnetism,&#x201C; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441213-JWC-JWE-01"><sic>18:283&#x2013;85</sic><corr>JWC to JWE, <date when="1844-12-13">13 Dec. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> or <hi rend="italic">what?</hi> Anyhow, it was something out of the jog-trot routine of one&#x2019;s life, and very acceptable! especially in this, &#x201C;the gloomy month of <date when="0000-11-00">November</date>, when the people of England hang and drown themselves,&#x201C; (according to the French novelist!).</p>

<p>I have delayed writing from day to day in the wish to have &#x201C;some reasonably good leisure&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490707-JWC-TC-01"><sic>24:104</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1849-07-07">7 July 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;that I might first read the book, and write a long letter.

<p><salute>My dear kind Julia</salute>&#x2014;There is not a minute of my life just now that Katie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kate Ross, Julia Sterling&#x2019;s sister, had d. <date when="1860-11-27">27 Nov.</date> at Bournemouth. Her husband, Alexander Ross, wrote to JWC, <date when="1860-11-28">28 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;From no heart will deeper sympathy be yielded than from yours, in this hour of black desolation. You loved and were loved by her, as You well know. That glimpse we had of You in Brighton was a bit of genuine sunshine, of which my darling often spoke with thankfulness. &#x2F; We came down here exactly a fortnight ago, yesterday. Katy recovered, wonderfully, from the fatigues of the journey. She got out twice, and was cheered by the warmth, brightness and beauty of the weather and place. My hope, seemingly well-founded, was, that here her long failing strength would come back to her. But it was not to be. On Thursday last She was seized with a sudden prostration of the small amount of energy that still remained. She appeared, however, to rally a little from this attack. But it was only in appearance, and, yesterday about half past 12 in the afternoon, my brave and beautiful one fell asleep. The End was marvellously peaceful. There was not a sigh, not a sign of unrest.&#x201C;</note> is out of my head. Her face seems to float between me and every thing I set myself to try and do, or say, or think of! her <hi rend="italic">living</hi> face,&#x2014;as it looked when we parted at Brighton,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had visited Kate Ross in early <date when="1860-07-00">July</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600704-TC-JAC-01"><sic>36:144</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1860-07-04">4 July</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600705-JWC-CSO-01"><sic>145</sic><corr>JWC to CSO, <date when="1860-07-05">5 July</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;wasted, and wan, and wistful; but with all the old love and truth shining out of it! all the old heroic spirit in it! But the more I see and feel her near me, the less I am disposed to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> about her; Words&#x2014;the strongest one can seek out of one&#x2019;s heart&#x2014;fall so flat and trivial!&#x2014;a mere mockery of the thoughts and feelings one would express by them.&#x2014; As you too have experienced!</p>
<p>As for the so-called <hi rend="italic">consolations,</hi> which some people would &#x201C;feel it their duty&#x201C; to offer you, and have the face to offer you; I hate the very sound of them! People, who can so much as dream of <hi rend="italic">consoling</hi> under a loss like this, have never known a great grief; for the very first lesson real grief teaches, is that &#x201C;the heart knoweth its own bitterness and the stranger intermeddleth not therewith&#x201C;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 14:10.</note>&#x2014; Even I, who loved Katie as much as any one unless those of her own blood, and her Husband, <hi rend="italic">could possibly</hi> love her, even I should feel it an impertinence to suggest to you and him any ground of comfort in this heavy calamity.</p>
<p>For myself I feel in no haste to be comforted! It has often struck me as the saddest part of our poor human bereavements, that the pain which so identifies itself with the Love, and which feels at first so infinite and eternal, gets blunted, whether we will or no, and finally effaced, by the mere friction of the <pb id="pg-37-52" n="37:52"/>Hours! It may take longer or shorter to do it, but if one live long enough it will be done!</p>
<p>I want very much to see you. I feel as if it were a message from Katie I had to give you&#x2014; Some things she said to me about you at Brighton, to which her death has now given a certain sacredness and authority&#x2014;so that they look to my imagination almost a message to you from her, beyond the grave; tho&#x2019; she did not mean them to be repeated at the time.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I was just about sending off for that <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Autobiography,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle (<date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>&#x2013;<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4692"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of the Rev. Dr Alexander Carlyle, Minister of Inveresk, Containing Memorials of the Men and Events of His Time,</hi> ed. John H. Burton (Edinburgh, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>). Inveresk village is about 6 mi. (9.5 km.) SE of Edinburgh.</note> when your Note came, beneficently announcing that there was a Copy under way for me as Gift. The Copy itself arrived last night; and I have spent all my leisure time since in reading at it. I am surely very much obliged, in more senses than one; &#x26; must heartily return you thanks for such remembrance of me. Indeed it is beyond dispute the whole world, more especially the Scotish, is your debtor: to secure such a Work (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> might have been burnt by accident any time these four-score years) from the risk of destruction, and print it in a genuine form, was and will long continue a truly meritorious piece of labour. Thanks, in the name of all Scochmen;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> in my own name very specially. I had heard of this Piece, as an unattainable <hi rend="italic">desideratum,</hi> from boyish days upwards; and now, after half a century, live to sit reading it, much at my ease,&#x2014;with more entertainment than any Book has given me for a very long while back.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-53" n="37:53"/>The Narrative is charmingly simple, vigorous, distinct;&#x2014;the man has a great deal of sharp sense in him; a well-balanced, stout, solid man; very fit for this function, and does <hi rend="italic">it</hi> admirably, since he had no other. Long life to the &#x201C;Jupiter Carlyle&#x201C; of Inveresk!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burton quoted Sir Walter Scott&#x2019;s comment on Alexander Carlyle: &#x201C;the grandest demigod I ever saw was Dr Carlyle, minister of Musselburgh, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Jupiter Carlyle,</hi> from having sat more than once for the king of gods and men to Gavin Hamilton&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 567). Burton thought it an apocryphal story, and there is no record of Alexander Carlyle ever having been painted by Gavin Hamilton (<date when="1723-00-00">1723</date>&#x2013;<date when="1798-00-00">98</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12066"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish neoclassical painter.

<p>I find there is little doubt I may claim to belong to him in remote cousinry,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I never heard of him in my old circles in that capacity. His birth-parish (Cummertrees,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Carlyle&#x2019;s father, William Carlyle (<date when="1690-00-00">1690</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">1765</date>), was minister of Cummer-trees until <date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>.</note> <hi rend="italic">Tre,</hi> or Town, of the <hi rend="italic">Kymric,</hi> stretching over from <hi rend="italic">Cumberland,</hi> in patches, thus far) is contiguous to mine; that &#x201C;Laird of Bridekirk&#x201C; (a most flagrant, thunderous old fellow, whose renown is not yet dead in those parts,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; his Brandy-bottle Spouse&#x2019;s is)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adam Carlyle (d. <date when="1734-00-00">1734</date>), laird of Bridekirk, a descendant of the Lords Carlyle of Torthorwald.

She was a very large and powerful virago, about forty years of age, and received us with much kindness and hospitality; for the brandy-bottle&#x2014;a Scotch pint&#x2014;made its appearance immediately, and we were obliged to take our <hi rend="italic">morning,</hi> as they called it, which was indeed the universal fashion of the country at that time. This lady &#x2026; was said to be able to empty one of those large bottles of brandy &#x2026; at a sitting&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 23&#x2013;24); the wife is not further identified.</note> used to have my grandfather,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1722-00-00">1722</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>).</note> still a young man, much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> him, as pet and &#x201C;cousin&#x201C; (of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I heard enough in my boyhood),&#x2014;not much to the profit of grandfather&#x2019;s affairs, as I have understood:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 17&#x2013;18.</note> and then that Carlyle of Brackenthwaite;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle of Brakenwhate (<date when="1647-00-00">1647</date>&#x2013;<date when="1736-00-00">1736</date>); Alexander Carlyle described him as &#x201C;an old gentleman, a cousin of my father&#x2019;s &#x2026; who had been an officer in James II&#x2019;s time, and threw up his commission at the Revolution rather than take the oaths. He was a little fresh-looking old man of eighty-six, very lively in conversation, and particularly fond of my father&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 25); James II of England and Wales and VII of Scotland (<date when="1633-00-00">1633</date>&#x2013;<date when="1701-00-00">1701</date>), reigned <date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688-00-00">88</date>.</note> that d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of Limekilns<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1743-11-00">Nov. 1743</date> Alexander Carlyle went to study in Glasgow; soon after arriving &#x201C;[I] went to the dancing assembly with some of my new acquaintance, and was there introduced to a married lady who claimed kindred with me, her mother&#x2019;s name being Carlyle, of the Limekiln family&#x201C; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 71&#x2013;72); not further identified.</note>&#x2014; In short, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> tell a long story ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> all that; and perhaps shall, some day when we meet.</p>

TC gave his brother a copy of the poems: <hi rend="italic">The Works of James the First, King of Scotland</hi> (Perth, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), based on Tytler&#x02019;s <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date> edn., containing &#x0201C;The King&#x02019;s Quair,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Peblis to the Play,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Christ&#x02019;s Kirk on the Green,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Remarks on the Scots Language,&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Dissertation on Scottish Music.&#x0201D; TC inscribed it: &#x0201C;To Dr Carlyle (from his Brother, &#x0002F; T.

This was possibly the copy that Alexander Gilchrist gave TC, <date when="1860-01-01">1 Jan. 1860</date>; Gilchrist noted in his diary: &#x0201C;Talk fell on the two Scottish books that I left for Carlyle on New Year&#x02019;s Day: &#x02018;James the First&#x02019;s Poems&#x02019; and &#x02018;Pennycuick&#x02019;s Poem&#x02019;; pleased with both, especially with James the First&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Christ&#x02019;s Kirk on the Green,</hi> which was on the model of Chaucer&#x0201D; (Gilchrist 82).

<salute>Dearest Maggie</salute>
<p>Having made no sign of myself for the last month; you may be fancying I have succumbed to the general doom; seeing that it has been &#x201C;the gloomy month of <date when="0000-11-00">November</date>, in which the People of England hang and drown themselves&#x201C;!&#x2014; But I am neither hanged nor drowned <hi rend="italic">yet;</hi> (in virtue perhaps of being born in <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>) only, all my energies having been needed to stave off Suicide; I had none left for letterwriting. It is now <date when="1860-12-00">December</date>, and the suicidal mania should have passed off; but I can&#x2019;t see much difference between <hi rend="italic">this</hi> <date when="1860-12-00">December</date> and the gloomiest <date when="0000-11-00">November</date> on record! the fog and the mud and the liquid soot (called <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> in the language of flattery) have not abated. And the blood in ones veins feels as thick and dirty!&#x2014; But shame of my silence must serve instead of inspiration, impossible under the circumstances! and you, dear good little Soul, as you are, will not be critical!</p>
<p>In the first place you will be glad to hear I am &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">about,</hi>&#x201C; anyhow. Except for one week that I had to lie on the sofa on my back with <hi rend="italic">Neuralgia,</hi> (differing in nothing so far as I can see from the old fashioned &#x201C;Rheum<hi rend="italic">atiz</hi>&#x201C;) I have not been <hi rend="italic">laid up</hi> since you heard of me.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner wrote to Emily Tennyson, <date when="1860-12-09">9 Dec.</date>, &#x201C;I forget if I told you in my last note how remarkably well Mrs. Carlyle is this year, and generally she is laid up an invalid the whole winter&#x201C; (Woolner 203).</note> and I have had a great fret taken off me, in the removal of that vulgar conceited woman,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tall&#x201C; Charlotte.</note> and the restoration of little Charlotte. Upon my word; I havn&#x2019;t been as near what they call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">happy</hi>&#x201C; for many a day; as in the first flush of little Charlotte! She looked so bursting with ecstasy as she ran up and down the house, <hi rend="italic">taking possession,</hi> as it were of her old work&#x2014;and as she showed in the visitors, (not <hi rend="italic">her</hi> business; but she <hi rend="italic">would</hi> open the door to them all, the first time; to show herself; and receive their congratulations) that it was impossible not to share in her delighted excitement!</p>
<p>Most of the people shook hands with her!, and all of them said they were &#x201C;glad to see her back!&#x2014; I had trusted that she would, <hi rend="italic">in time, humanize</hi> the <pb id="pg-37-59" n="37:59"/>other girl. and that the two would be good friends when the other girl got over the prejudices, the woman who had left had inspired her with! But it needed no time at all! Sarah was humanized, and the two sworn friends in the first half hour!! In the first half hour Sarah had confided to Charlotte that if I hadn&#x2019;t given the tall Charlotte warning, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> (Sarah) would have given <hi rend="italic">me</hi> warning. She disliked &#x201C;tall Charlotte&#x201C; so much!</p>
<p>It is now three weeks since the new order of things; mistress and maid have subsided out of the emotional state, into the normal one; but are still very glad over one another; and if the work of the house does not get done with as much order and method as under the tall Charlotte; it is done with more <hi rend="italic">thoroughness</hi> and infinitely more heartiness and pleasantness.  and the &#x201C;bread-puddings&#x201C; are first rate! Sarah&#x2019;s tidiness and method are just what was wanted to correct little Charlotte&#x2019;s born tendency to <hi rend="italic">muddle;</hi> while little Charlottes willingness and affectionateness warm up Sarah&#x2019;s drier more selfish nature. It is a curious establishment with something of the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> and character of a <hi rend="italic">nursery!</hi> Charlotte not nineteen till next <date when="1861-03-00">March</date> and Sarah seventeen last week! And they keep up an incessant chirping and chattering and laughing&#x2014;and as both have remarkably sweet voices it is rather pleasant to hear! The <hi rend="italic">twoness</hi> is no nuisance to me <hi rend="italic">now.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601022-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1860-10-22">[22?] Oct.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; As neither of them can awake of themselves, I dont know what I should have done about <hi rend="small-caps">that</hi>:hadn&#x2019;t Charlotte&#x2019;s friends come to the rescue! an old man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Godby (b. ca. <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>).</note> who lodges with Charlottes &#x201C;Mother&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">aunt</hi>)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Southam.</note> raps on the kitchen window till he wakes them every morning at <hi rend="italic">six</hi> (!) on his way to his work, and Charlotte&#x2019;s &#x201C;Father&#x201C; (uncle)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Southam.</note> raps again on the window before seven, to make sure the first summons had been attended to!!&#x2014;to say nothing of an <hi rend="small-caps">alarm</hi> which runs down at six, at their very bed-head, and <hi rend="italic">never</hi> is heard by either of these fortunate girls!&#x2014; So I dare say we shall get on as well as possible&#x2014;in a world where perfection is not to be looked for!</p>
<p>I shall be glad to hear that <hi rend="italic">your</hi> domesticities are in as flourishing a state!</p>
<p>I hope we shall go to the Grange by and by, and make a longer visit than last year.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles had stayed with the Ashburtons at their country home in Hampshire the previous winter, <date when="1860-01-05">5</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-01-13">13 Jan. 1860</date>.</note> It is such a good break in the long dreary Chelsea winter! and stirs up ones stagnant spirits, and rubs up ones manners!

She remembers having a lady at tea and complaining of pains in her legs, and tho she continued <hi rend="italic">up</hi> after that, and wrote various letters &#x201C;to be delivered in case of her death&#x201C; she recollected nothing of these letters till they were shown her, nor of anything else, till, weeks after she had been so far convalescent as to be removed from her bed to a sofa!</p>

<p>My dear beautiful Kate Sterling (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ross) was buried last week at Bournemouth where she had been taken for the winter. I had long been hopeless of her recovery but did not think the end so near and that I should never see her sweet face again.

    <salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant</salute>
    <p>First and foremost let me give you a hearty kiss! Never mind about our having met only once<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">They met in London during summer <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date> before TC left for Thurso. Oliphant had called on TC to ask if he could give her information about Edward Irving for the biography she was writing. He said that his wife would be of more help, and a day or two later JWC called on her. Oliphant wrote: &#x0201C;I &#x02026; found in a homely little brougham a lady with bright eyes and very hollow cheeks, who &#x02026; asked me to come and drive with her that we might talk about Irving. &#x02026; She must have been over sixty at this time, but she was one of those women whom one never thinks of calling old; her hair was black without a grey hair in it &#x02026; her features and aspect very keen, perhaps a little alarming.&#x0201D; Oliphant was reminded of her own mother, Margaret Wilson: &#x0201C;not outwardly &#x02026; but in her wonderful talk, the power of narration which I never heard equalled except in my mother, the flashes of keen wit and sarcasm, occasionally even a little sharpness, and always the modifying sense of humour under all&#x0201D; (Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 97&#x02013;98). Oliphant had already written &#x0201C;Edward Irving&#x0201D; for <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> 84 (<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>): 567&#x02013;86; <hi rend="italic">The Life of Edward Irving</hi> was pbd. by Blackwood (Edinburgh, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), 2 vols.</note> &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">here down</hi>&#x0201D; (as Mazzini translates <hi rend="italic">qu&#x000E0; gi&#x000F9;</hi>);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430809-JWC-TC-01">

   : &#x0201C;[T]he story is very interesting, and the interest deepens as the story proceeds. &#x02026; There is a quiet tragic power in the picture of the lonely house, the joyless fireside, the unloving household, which is better than anything we remember by the same author.&#x0201D;</note> which I like best of all your Books for perhaps no better reason than this same; that it is come to me from yourself, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">all to myself,</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss">Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581030-JWC-MR-01">

    <p>Meanwhile I would suggest to you three men to be spoken with, who could tell more about Edward Irving than almost any other of his acquaintance yet alive&#x02014; The first is Thomas Erskine (of Linlathan). The second M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dickson (Edwards Brother-in-law)<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss">Robert Dickson (b. <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>), provost of Annan <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x02013;<date when="1823-00-00">23</date>, m. to Janet Irving (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>?&#x02013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note> the third my own Brother in law D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle,<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss">According to Oliphant, it was John A. Carlyle who had first suggested that she approach TC: &#x0201C;One of my people whom I went to see on this subject was Dr Carlyle, whom I found surrounded with huge books. &#x02026; My recollection of him is of a small, rather spruce man, not at all like his great brother. (Mrs Carlyle used to say of Dr John that he was one of the people who seemed to have been born in creaking shoes.) It must have been he who told me to go and see Carlyle himself who could tell me a great deal more than he could about Irving&#x0201D; (Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> 96). JWC wrote &#x0201C;J Carlyle)&#x0201D; in the bottom lefthand corner of the envelope.</note> whose address I will enclose. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> is intimate with the other two, one of whom (M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Erskine) is residing in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for the winter. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dickson lives at Glasgow I believe&#x02014; D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle will go with you to Thomas Erskine or arrange a meeting for you. Thomas Erskine is a very dear friend of my own, and an angel of a man, well worth knowing on his own account.</p>
    <p>And now I must conclude rather in haste&#x02014; Since I began this letter I have had a note to tell me that the youngest child<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss">Binnie Godby, Mary and Frederick Godby&#x02019;s youngest child, d. <date when="1860-12-13">13 Dec.</date>, age six.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has just come to hand. Take a word of reply (<hi rend="italic">downstairs</hi> here, with the table all to myself, and a bright fire burning, amid the silence of the outer sleet and snow): a short word is better than none.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-68" n="37:68"/>This frost of ours has lasted now to the fourth day; very disagreeable; difficult to do with by weak creatures, like us. Jane, a close prisoner, has fallen a little into cold; but keeps up her heart. I am off my horse these 3 days,&#x2014;sleep again a kind of problem (woe&#x2019;s me!)&#x2014;but I am taking measures for <hi rend="italic">roughened feet:</hi> with my horse under me, I shall be again as before. Printing is slow, slow; but it never ceases; inch by inch we shall get the hill of difficulty,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John Bunyan, <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi>.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is like to kill us, <hi rend="italic">eaten away;</hi> and be alive again for our remaining years.</p>
<p>I have just been writing to John, from whom also I had a Letter today. I mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Autobiography</hi> to him, of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he has a copy: if it be doing nothing, perhaps he may send it you. If not I have a copy quite, done with so far as I myself am concerned, but unluckily gone out on loan for a while: be patient a bit, and you shall have that, if still unsupplied. The bit you have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> is one of the best; but it is all worth reading more or less. I used to hear of him and it when a boy in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> but did [not]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted by TC.</note> know he was so expressly Annandale before</p>
<p>I shall be right glad to hear of your getting that eligible House;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the &#x201C;large and commodious dwelling house in capital repair, containing Dining Room, Drawing Room, Parlour, Four Bedrooms &#x2026; Orchard, Kitchen Garden, Vinery and small Garden attached&#x201C; advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Advertiser,</hi> <date when="1860-12-04">4 Dec.</date>; otherwise unidentified.</note> the acc<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you give of it is quite tempting to my own taste. If a loan of a little money w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> forward you at all, tell me at once;&#x2014;but I but I<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Words repeated on turn of page.</note> doubt it will not.</p>
<p>We saw James lately, and expect on Sunday night to see him again. He looks <hi rend="italic">douce</hi> and <hi rend="italic">snod,</hi> a likely young article in his way; and seemed in fair health of body as well as mind, tho&#x2019; with less of florid colour than the Country gives. I think he is really doing very well, poor fellow. The Pipes<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s son James had helped organize the delivery of pipes to Henry Taylor.</note> have come all right.</p>
<p>I have still some Printer work to do, not very much; then I have a walk to take (in spite of the sleet); and it is striking ten. Good night, therefore; I intend to write again before many days.

<salute>My dearest Julia</salute>
<p>I am very anxious to hear how you are. I had hoped that Edward&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her brother Edward Sterling.</note> would perhaps come today and tell me. But for several days back I have seen nobody to ask. And I cannot go myself to Russell Square, as I meant to do; having fallen ill the day after Edward was here, and been a Prisoner ever since.</p>
<p>Even if you are <hi rend="italic">much</hi> better as I pray god may be the case, I dont want you to answer <hi rend="italic">yourself,</hi> but if you would ask Hester<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her sister Hester Sterling.</note> to write me two lines, it would be a great favour.</p>
<p>I would have written to Edward instead, only that his number in Sloan Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Sterling lived at 104 Sloane St.</note> has quite gone out of my head, and I dont like sending a note for him to South Place, never knowing what unexpected results may follow from any step of mine in the direction of that fateful locality!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their uncle, Anthony Sterling, lived at 3 South Pl., Knightsbridge; his wife, Charlotte, suffered from insanity.

<salute>Darling!</salute>
<p>What a bright, good thought of yours, to write me a Xmas letter! Bless your little Heart and all it cares for!</p>
<p>I think there must have been spiritual magnetism at work; more or less. For <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had been wanting to write to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> for a good while back; to tell you a &#x2018;Tale of Horror&#x2019; about the Canary!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/18601122-JWC-TW-01">JWC to TW, [<date when="1860-11-22">22 Nov.</date>]</ref>.</note> and should have anticipated your letter; but that the end of the year brings me always such a heap of letters to be written <hi rend="italic">in the Course of Nature,</hi> and little parcels to be made up for old friends <supplied>[in]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> the North, which (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> the friends but the parcels) have come, by length of habit to be a sort of moral necessity. Then these duties (such as they are) have this year had to be &#x201C;pursued under difficulties&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520723-JWC-TC-01"><sic>27:179</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1852-07-23">23 July 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;a severe cold; involving confinement to the house. For the first touch of frost as usual knocked me over&#x2014;like a nine-pin!</p>
<p>I am pretty well thro&#x2019; my Labours of&#x2014;what shall I say? <hi rend="italic">Love?</hi> (Well I suppose so!) now however. Besides all the letters and parcels already sent; I have <hi rend="italic">three</hi> long letters already written for Newyears morning, and some half dozen Books made ready for the Post! That is what I call &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">taking time by the forelock,</hi>&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> a rule of conduct strongly impress on me at an early age by the Frontispiece to one of my Story-Books.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> It represented (or meant to represent) an excited Boy, crossing <hi rend="italic">the page</hi> with long strides, and pulling after him, by a tuft of hair on the forehead (the rest of the head being bald as an ivory ball), a lean ill conditioned looking old Man (<hi rend="italic">Time</hi>); while the Boys other hand carried, (<hi rend="italic">with ostentation</hi>) a sealed letter.</p>
<p>But you are thinking all the while; &#x201C;what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> it about the Canary?&#x2014; Has <hi rend="italic">the Cat</hi>&#x2014;?&#x201C;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Eaten it;</hi> you would ask; and the question is by no means an irrelevant one!&#x2014; No&#x2014;my Dear! your Canary is not quite eaten; but I am bound to say; no other Canary past, present, or to come, ever had such an affair with a Cat, and came out of it <hi rend="italic">without being eaten.</hi> Nor could this one, unless <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Guardian Angel, or mine, or the Canary&#x2019;s own had worked a miracle on its behalf!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-72" n="37:72"/>The Cat had taken to <hi rend="italic">studying</hi> the Bird, at its first elevation, with a degree of interest that made one&#x2019;s blood run cold! so I had sent for the Carpenter,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Mr. Parsons or Joseph Morgan; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600808-JWC-JN-01"><sic>36:165</sic><corr>JWC to JN, <date when="1860-08-08">8 Aug.</date></corr></ref></note> and made him suspend the cage from the Drawing-room ceiling with a pully and brass chain. That done, I had no misgivings about leaving the Two alone together; having no idea what a Cat, under the influence of strong desire was <hi rend="italic">up to!</hi> Returning from my walk one forenoon I was met at the door by Charlotte in the wildest excitement! &#x201C;Oh! she said, <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> do you think the Cat has gone and done?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Eaten my Canary&#x201C;? I answered, with calm desperation,&#x2014;&#x201C;N<hi rend="small-caps">o</hi>! <hi rend="small-caps">far worse</hi>&#x201C;! &#x201C;She must have sprung off the little table on to the cage, and dragged it down, for the chain is lying in a hundred pieces! and the table is tilted over, and broken in two! and oh! Lady Airlie&#x2019;s basket is broken to shivers! and the <hi rend="italic">ferns all about!</hi> and the glass cover is broken to shivers! and every thing is all over the carpet&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;And the Bird safe?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well yes&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the cage door was wide open, she hadn&#x2019;t staid to eat it! The noise of the <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> and everything falling must have frightened herself; for I met <hi rend="italic">her</hi> rushing down the stairs, as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> ran up at the row&#x201C;!</p>
<p>What a mess when I entered the Drawing room! for &#x201C;the Row&#x201C; had just come off, and nothing was cleared away yet; the cage on its side still, on the floor; the table in two separate pieces; the carpet strewn with earth, and ferns, and bird seed, and water, and fragments of earthen ware, glass, brass-chain &#x26;c &#x26;c! and amidst all the Bird hopping about rather grave, but otherwise &#x201C;as well as could be expected.&#x201C; I was very sorry about my ferns; for they too were a sort of live pets, and had been given me when I was confined, spring gone a year, by Lady Airlie.</p>
<p>The Cat probably <hi rend="italic">had</hi> not only frightened herself, but hurt herself, in the general crash of doom she had unexpectedly created. For she had rushed right out at the back door, and never showed herself for 24 hours after, tho a most domestic cat in general,</p>
<p>Relying (Ah too much) on the analogy between feline fools and human ones, I hoped Experience would have taught this individual fool wisdom! So did not at once send the Canary out of the House; seeing that the Cat herself could not be put away&#x2014;for both practical and sentimental reasons. on the practical hand, We are never catless for a single week but hosts of very little mice troop in to us, out of the drains. Not only does this Cat keep us free of the mice, but she is cleanly, and moral, and honest&#x2014;except under the temptation of a live Bird. Then, on the sentimental hand; was she not loved by my little Dog,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nero, put down on <date when="1860-02-01">1 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600202-JWC-ABB-01"><sic>36:55&#x2013;56</sic><corr>JWC to ABB, <date when="1860-02-02">2 Feb.</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600206-JWC-RST-01"><sic>60&#x2013;61</sic><corr>JWC to RST, <date when="1860-02-06">6 Feb.</date></corr></ref></note> as tho&#x2019; she had been his own Sister or wedded Wife? stirring him up to games of romps in his old age, and the chief delight of his old age! For <hi rend="italic">his</hi> dear little sake, I couldnt put her away!</p>
<p>So a second time I sent for the carpenter; and had the cage fixed up against <pb id="pg-37-73" n="37:73"/>the window shutter at the very top&#x2014;the brass chains of the present day, being it seems (as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C says) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">like every thing else,</hi> an article that the man who made them ought to have been hanged for&#x201C;!</p>
<p>The cat pretending to take no further notice of the Bird, I thought she had made up her mind that attempts on its life were not only perilous but hopeless, but one night while I was saying something to Charlotte, She suddenly Sprang at <hi rend="italic">one perpendicular leap</hi> to the cage and hung on to it with her claws!! I couldnt have believed in such a leap if I hadn&#x2019;t seen it! I flung my sofa cushions at her, and screamed, and frightened her into dropping down. But I kept the poor Bird under lock and key, after that, till I found her a safer home.</p>
<p>Miss Farrers<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annie Louisa Farrer.</note> Bird had escaped out of the window one day, and its pretty cage was swinging empty, so I sent the poor thing there, where it is now enjoying a life without shocks! I was very sorry to part with the Bird but should have been far sorrier to have it <hi rend="italic">eaten.</hi></p>
<p>The Downshire Story is equal to the &#x201C;Six-black-crows&#x201C; story.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> I was like to cry about it while I was believing it. It seemed such a fatality that a kindhearted simple, straightforward man like Lord Downshire, should be always happening to kill somebody!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first published account of Arthur Hill, 4th marquis of Downshire, and the Downshire story appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Guardian,</hi> <date when="1860-12-21">21 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;[I]t has been the matter of constant comment in all the clubs and West-end houses for the last few days that London may soon look forward to the strange and solemn sight of the trial of a British peer by his brother peers in Westminster Hall. &#x2F; The Marquis of D &#x2014;&#x2019;s yacht, now at Naples, has been the scene of one of those tragedies of real life which we are apt to think, in these dead-level days, lie far away from the region of real life, in the domain exclusively appropriated by the dramatist and the tale writer. The Marquis had been for some time cruising with some members of his family, including a youthful daughter, Lady Alice &#x2014;. The yacht was commanded by a half-pay Lieutenant of the Royal Navy. The Marquis coming on board unexpectedly, from an excursion on shore, if I am rightly informed, found his captain at the feet of his daughter, kissing her hand. The indignant father&#x2014;a man of Herculean strength-seized the offender, and let it be hoped, intending only to tear him away from his unseemly place and action, flung him over the bulwark of the yacht into the sea, when he went down at once, in spite&#x2014;add some of the versions of the story&#x2014;both of the Marquis&#x2019;s and his sailors&#x2019; efforts to save him.&#x201C; On <date when="1860-12-28">28 Dec.</date>, two days after the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> had dismissed the story as being &#x201C;without foundation,&#x201C; the <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi>&#x2019;s &#x201C;Private Correspondent&#x201C; wrote: &#x201C;If it should turn out, as suggested by the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> that the report has originated in a misunderstanding of the figurative expression &#x2018;thrown overboard,&#x2019; the matter deserves to be remembered as a capital illustration of the magnifying, transmuting, and &#x2018;circumstantialising&#x2019; power of rumour. &#x2026; &#x2F; Probably readier credence might be given to the report, not only from the fact of the Marquis being a man of quick and hot temperament and extraordinary strength, but from his having been engaged while at Eton in a memorable boxing match, which resulted in the death of his antagonist.&#x201C;</note> And poor Lady Alice<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Alice Maria Hill&#x2019;s visit to Cheyne Row in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>, see <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570300-JWC-MR-01"><sic>32:104</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1857-03-15">15 March 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> was too young and pretty to be thought of without emotion as having occasioned a murder.</p>

<p>I dont think anyone, even M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, could be disinclined towards worked Slippers&#x2014;provided the Lady who worked them was young and charming.

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton</salute>
<p>A Lady<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> called for me yesterday who had just had a letter from Miss Emily Baring;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sister.</note> and she told me that &#x201C;the Grange Baby&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Florence Baring.</note> had been &#x201C;excessively ill,&#x201C; and given you all &#x201C;a dreadful fright.&#x201C;&#x2014; Beyond this, I could extract nothing of certain; neither as to the nature of dear wee Baby&#x2019;s illness, nor as to the extent of her recovery from it.</p>
<p>Now, you will admit that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">had been excessively ill</hi>&#x201C; is not exactly news to rest satisfied with; especially when a fortnights confinement to the house with a bad cold has lowered one&#x2019;s spirits generally, and given a morbid action to one&#x2019;s Imagination!</p>
<p>So, at the risk of troubling you,&#x2014;I must beg for two lines, just to tell us how Baby <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> at the <hi rend="italic">present</hi> time; I would not have you write yourself, unless most perfectly convenient; but only to direct some one in the House to do so.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, went up to Lady Sandwich yesterday and asked <hi rend="italic">Her.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">she</hi> knew no more than had been told ourselves; that the Baby <hi rend="italic">had been</hi> very ill. She <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> It was now better, but had no <hi rend="italic">authentic</hi> intelligence to that effect, and was going to write herself to ask.</p>
<p>So you see I could not get at the real state of the case without troubling you. You will forgive me?</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle too wished me to write. He &#x201C;wouldn&#x2019;t for the world that any harm should come to that <hi rend="italic">little atom of a Creature!</hi> It was quite a <hi rend="italic">peculiar bit Child!</hi> and quite a <hi rend="italic">precious</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">commodity</hi> for Lord Ashburton&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I wont go into other matters&#x2014;for if the Child be still in the least ailing, all other matters would be indifferent&#x2014;tiresome to you&#x2014;I know!&#x2014;</p>
<p>So with the heartiest good wishes of &#x201C;the Season&#x201C; and all seasons, for you and yours, I remain dear Lady Ashburton &#x2F;<closer><salute> Yours faithfully &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>Jane W Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Dearest Mary</salute></p>
<p>If there were no other use in a letter from me just now, it will serve the purpose of removing any apprehensions you may have, as to the frost having <pb id="pg-37-78" n="37:78"/>put an end to my life! &#x201C;Did you <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;No I <hi rend="italic">never!</hi>&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:210</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-11-01">1 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;felt such cold! But then, there being no question for me of ever crossing the threshold, and my time thrown altogether on my hands (my visitors being mostly away, keeping their Xmas at Country-Houses, or, like myself, shut up with colds at home, or too busy with &#x201C;the festivities of the Season&#x201C; to get as far as Chelsea; and my <hi rend="italic">two</hi> maids leaving me nothing earthly to do in the business of <hi rend="italic">the House</hi>) I have time, enough and to spare, for adopting all possible measures to keep myself warm. To see the fires I keep up in the Drawing room and my bed room; an <hi rend="italic">untopographical</hi> Observer might suppose we lived within a mile of a coal-pit; instead of paying 28 shillings a cart-load for coals! then I wear <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my flannel petticoates <hi rend="italic">at once!</hi> and am having two new ones made out of a pair of Scotch Blankets! And Lady Sandwich has sent me a seal-fur pelisse<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably one of Lady Harriet Ashburton&#x2019;s; Lady Sandwich wrote to JWC, <date when="1860-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;Here is a souvenir from the Tomb, which you will wear for <hi rend="italic">her sake</hi>&#x2014;I think you will find it comfortable particularly when Mr C. &#x2018;Writer of Books&#x2019;&#x2014;opens the window behind your back &#x26; under the Blind!&#x201C;</note> (a luxury I had long sighed for, but, costing 20 guineas, it had seemed hopeless!) and a Greek Merchant<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stavros Dilberoglue.</note> has sent me the softest grey indian shawl. And if <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> cant warm me I lie down under my coverlid of racoon skins!&#x2014; (My Dear! if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are perishing; act upon my idea of the Scotch blankets! no flannel comes near them in point of warmth).</p>
<p>My D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> told me, in addition to all this outward covering, to drink &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">at least,</hi> three glasses of wine a day!&#x201C;&#x2014; But I generally shirk the third. and the cough and faceache which I had the first week of the frost, is gone this week, at any rate.</p>

The fact is, he is awfully <hi rend="italic">strong,</hi> and his strokes <hi rend="italic">tell</hi>, as he doesn&#x2019;t expect! But if you knew what a <hi rend="italic">simple, good</hi> man he is; you wouldn&#x2019;t wonder that I felt sorrier for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> than the skipper who after all had no business to be &#x201C;kneeling&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">there</hi> surely! and the little Darling Daughter! that her young life should be clouded at the outset with such a scandal! I made all sorts of miserable reflections about them all. And the story all the while a complete fabrication&#x2014;equal to the proverbial story of the &#x201C;six black crows&#x201C;!</p>
<p>I have been told how it arose and who set it a-going. A young Lady-friend of Lady Alice&#x2019;s who was yachting with them in the Mediterranian wrote home to her Brother here, amongst other news, that &#x201C;Earl&#x201C; (a gentleman also of the Party) had been making such a fool of himself, looking so <hi rend="italic">spooney</hi> (the young-Lady dialect of the present day is wonderful!)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Oxford English Dictionary</hi> lists the first use of &#x201C;spooney,&#x201C; meaning sentimentally or foolishly amorous, as <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>.</note> at my Lady (the Marchioness); that my Lord got quite weary of him, and, in his off-hand way <hi rend="italic">threw him over</hi> at Civitta Vecchia.&#x201C;&#x2014; This repeated amplified itself into &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">threw him overboard</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and with further repetition the <hi rend="italic">Dramatis Personae</hi> in the &#x201C;Spooney&#x201C;-business were changed from Lady Downshire and Major Earl, into Lady Alice (seventeen) and the Skipper (a rough, worthy sailor upwards of sixty!). In this form the story was told to Azelio (the Sardinian Ambassador) who, to give himself importance, said &#x201C;Oh yes! it had been officially communicated to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> from Naples,&#x201C; And the man he said it to, being secretary of legation,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Edmund Hammond; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601228-JWC-KST-01">JWC to <sic>KS</sic><corr>KST</corr>, [<date when="1860-12-28">28 Dec.</date>]</ref>.</note> made an <hi rend="italic">official despatch</hi> of the story to Lord Cowley at Paris!!! Then it flew like wildfire, and people couldnt <hi rend="italic">help</hi> believing it! and of course all sorts of details were added&#x2014;that Lady Alice was &#x201C;struggling and screaming&#x201C;&#x2014;that Lord D &#x201C;wouldn&#x2019;t let a boat be lowered, to pick the man up&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. One knows how a story gathers like a snowball!&#x2014; They went the length of stating that Lord D was being brought home to be tried by the Peers&#x2014;&#x201C;the offence having been committed on the High Seas&#x201C;!!!&#x2014; The talk <hi rend="italic">now</hi> is all of Prosecutions of certain Newspapers and certain people&#x2014; But I shouldn&#x2019;t wonder if it all end in Lord Downshire giving somebody a good <hi rend="italic">thrashing!</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The marquis of Downshire issued a denial in the Irish <hi rend="italic">Newry Telegraph,</hi> reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1861-01-18">18 Jan. 1861</date>: &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">statement</hi> of what <hi rend="italic">is said</hi> to have occurred on board my yacht &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">is false,</hi> and totally devoid of a vestige of foundation. &#x2026; [I]f I catch this scoundrel, I will throw <hi rend="italic">him</hi> overboard.&#x201C;</note></p>

<p><salute>&#x201C;Nice Woman!&#x201C;&#x2014;How are you?</salute>&#x2014; I mean to be your &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">First Foot</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;your and his&#x2014;(William Dods&#x2019;s)&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">First Foot!</hi>&#x2014; And you couldn&#x2019;t have a better, believe me; I am so <hi rend="italic">lucky</hi>&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">others!</hi></p>
<p>But besides this whim of being your First Foot; something stirs me to write you a letter, as another year is just passing &#x201C;to the greater number&#x201C;!&#x2014; Not the same &#x2018;something&#x2019; (let us hope)&#x2014;the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">quelque chose plus fort que moi</hi> [something stronger than me] that makes such a figure on French criminal trials, as sole cause and &#x201C;Extenuating Circumstance&#x201C; of the worst atrocities!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In 19th-century France a plea of &#x201C;crime of passion&#x201C; was regarded as a valid excuse.</note>&#x2014;but an altogether different fibre of the Magnetism of the Universe, running thro&#x2019; prettier places than Criminal Courts!</p>
<p>Oh my Dear! isn&#x2019;t it <hi rend="italic">Cold?!</hi> In spite of having on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my flannel petticoats at <pb id="pg-37-81" n="37:81"/>once!

And in spite of taking <hi rend="italic">three</hi> glasses of wine a-day (by order of my Doctor) I feel from morning till night and from night till morning like a living lump of ice! and then, while so many &#x201C;poor Gardners&#x201C; are bawling about the streets that they are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">froze out,</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-09/lt-18361229-TC-JCA-01"><sic>9:110</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1836-12-29">29 Dec. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am decidedly &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">froze</hi>&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">in!</hi> The first touch of frost set me off coughing, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> I have to be what is called &#x201C;very careful,&#x201C; and keep the house till a warmer time comes.</p>
<p>Ach! and I am the same woman&#x2014;at least I suppose I am&#x2014;who used to delight in fighting with snow-balls and skating on the Tyne!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >River Tyne, running through Haddington.</note> Who would get up in the Dark of a Winter morning, and, with our groom (James Roberton),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Robertson, servant and groom of JWC&#x2019;s father; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><sic>24:166 and 169</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> carrying a stable lantern and besom, trot off surreptitiously to the <hi rend="italic">Lang Kram,</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lang Kram, a wide stretch of the Tyne beside the Nungate Bridge.</note> and get a space cleared of the snow that had fallen over night, and have some skating &#x201C;all by myself&#x201C; before breakfast.</p>

But he had now and then a&#x2014;what shall I say?&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">diabolic</hi> inspiration, your Uncle John! and certainly he had one that morning and acted on it! For in turning the figure of 8 he suddenly jerked his &#x201C;tails&#x201C; out my clutch, and down I clashed on one side, like a ninepin! Ugh! I think I feel it <hi rend="italic">now!&#x2014;</hi> I had to go my ways home ignominiously with a black eye! and wouldn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> to John Wilkie for weeks after! That is the sort of things that come into one&#x2019;s head, when one sits down to meditate a moment, beside another mile-stone in ones life&#x2014; It isn&#x2019;t over the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> miles that ones mind runs; but away to the far, far back ones!&#x2014; God bless them!</p>

And at last we had arrived at the gist of the Composition. &#x201C;Would I kindly tell her which was the best likeness of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle and where it was to be procured? or, if I had any ever so little one, that I would <hi rend="italic">give</hi> her, she <hi rend="italic">could have it mounted herself</hi> (could she?) and would be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> much obliged!&#x201C; Now &#x201C;Did you <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;?&#x2014;&#x201C;No I <hi rend="italic">never</hi>&#x2014;!&#x201C;&#x2014; The cunning impudence of the Creature!&#x2014; She knows that I have heard &#x201C;something to her disadvantage,&#x201C; suspects it may be about leaving the portraits <hi rend="italic">for sale,</hi> and takes this plan of begging a new portrait, to mollify me for <hi rend="italic">selling</hi> the others!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601006-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [<date when="1860-10-07">6</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-10-07">7?

And when Eliza Donaldson &#x201C;called&#x201C; soon after she must have seen that I was intentionally repelling.</p>
<p>I hesitated whether to answer Miss Jane&#x2019;s letter in three lines; to the effect that &#x201C;the best Likeness of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x201C; was the one left for sale at Sunny Bank. And as <hi rend="italic">it</hi> had never been in the Shops, and, I had no copy of it for her; her wish to &#x201C;add M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to her Collection&#x201C; (one of her expressions) would have to remain ungratified for the present&#x2014; Whether to answer <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> or to make absolutely <hi rend="italic">no</hi> answer at all.

Cicero, <hi rend="italic">In Catilinam</hi> 1:21.</note></p>
<p>What a long yarn about Jane Donaldson! I might have found something more worth your thinking about on a new years morning!

<p>If you have read in the newspapers a startling Tale of the Marquis of Downshire having found the Master of his Yacht kneeling at the side of his young Daughter Lady Alice Hill, and taking him by the neck and flinging him into the sea, and so there was an end of <hi rend="italic">Him!</hi> you neednt be wasting either horror or sympathy on it: for it is a story of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">six-black-Crows</hi>&#x201C; sort, founded on next to nothing! All London has been ringing with it for the last fortnight; and I was at the crying about it! For I know these people, and couldnt bear to think of that kind hearted, simple, strait forward Lord Downshire being tried for manslaughter, and beautiful little Lady Alice breaking her little heart. As for the drowned man, I had never seen <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> and what business had he to be kneeling <hi rend="italic">there</hi> of all places in the world! Besides <hi rend="italic">his</hi> troubles were over&#x2014;and those of the others to come! So my sorrow was all for the Downshires. who are <hi rend="italic">good</hi> people&#x2014;if they had chanced to kill even <hi rend="italic">several</hi> men among them!</p>
<p>But the story began to be contradicted and then came a Lady<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who told me all how it arose. A girl who was yachting with the Downshires, wrote home to her friends amongst other news, that a certain Major Earl who had been also of the Party had been &#x201C;getting so <hi rend="italic">spooney</hi> towards my Lady (the Marchioness) and making such a fool of himself, that my Lord had finally <pb id="pg-37-84" n="37:84"/>wearied of it, and <hi rend="italic">thrown him over</hi> at Civitta Vecchia.&#x201C; This repeated amplified, itself into &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">thrown him overboard,</hi>&#x201C; then the <hi rend="italic">Dramatis personae</hi> in the lovemaking were changed from the Marchioness and the Major, into Lady Alice (aged seventeen) and the Skipper (a rough worthy old sailor upwards of sixty) Then the remodeled report being mentioned to the Marquis Azelio (Sardinian Ambassador) he, liking to be better informed of everything than his neighbours said &#x2018;Oh yes he had had the news communicated to <hi rend="italic">him officially</hi> from Naples&#x2014;&#x2019; and the man he said it to, a member of Legation, made an official despatch of it to Lord Cowley at Paris!! and so it spread like wild fire over all London and Paris, with ever new additions, such as that Lady Alice was struggling and screaming, that Lord Downshire wouldnt let a boat be lowered to pick the man up &#x26;c &#x26;c. And I suppose we havent heard the last of it yet. They talk of prosecutions of newspapers and of Individuals And Lord Downshire being the terribly <hi rend="italic">strong,</hi> impulsive man he is, will surely give <hi rend="italic">somebody</hi> a thrashing! It is very hard on the family to have been made the subject of such calumnies, for they are more simple in their ways and more attached to one-another, than any <hi rend="italic">great</hi> people I ever saw!</p>
<p>Mercy what a letter for length! But a newyears day letter <hi rend="italic">should</hi> be long should it not?</p>
<p>I will stop now however&#x2014;with love to your husband and the best of goodwishes to you both</p>

<p><salute>&#x201C;a good new year&#x201C; to you dear Lady.</salute> &#x201C;and many of them&#x201C;! and a good&#x2014;a perfectly exquisite new year to Baby! <hi rend="italic">The only Child in the World!</hi> Or, what comes to the same thing, the only Child that ever touched my Heart, or kindled my Imagination, or was distinguishable for me from other Children <hi rend="italic">of the Period!</hi> I have often wondered that Babies didn&#x2019;t (so far as one knows) get <hi rend="italic">mixed,</hi> and misappropriated! that Mothers and nurses seemed able to tell their own particular Baby from the general flood of Babies! It must be <hi rend="italic">by the</hi> <pb id="pg-37-85" n="37:85"/><hi rend="small-caps">clothes</hi> (I thought) or some private mark, such as Gentlemen put inside their hats! for, in point of fact, the little creatures were all alike as peas! and equally uninteresting!&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">now!</hi>&#x2014;were all the Babies in Middlesex and Hampshire collected in one place; <hi rend="italic">in puris naturalibus</hi> [stark naked] (if you can imagine anything so shocking!); and I should be asked to point out &#x201C;The Grange Baby&#x201C; among them all; I venture to modestly affirm, that as soon as my eye found her, I should say; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">that is she!</hi> The Darling&#x201C;!</p>
<p>Mercy! what a thing it would have been, had she been spillt, thro&#x2019; sheer stupidity and carelessness! I am afraid <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should have pitched that nurse <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the Lake; by way of curing her fancy for wandering by it in winter evenings, with <hi rend="italic">the only Baby in the World</hi> in her arms!</p>
<p>Now that is a nurse whom <hi rend="italic">D</hi>r <hi rend="italic">Francia</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Jos&#xE9; Gaspar Rodr&#xed;guez de Francia y Velasco (<date when="1766-00-00">1766</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>), dictator of Paraguay; see Carlyle, &#x201C;Dr. Francia,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:261&#x2013;321.</note> would have ordered to be &#x201C;walked three times beneath the gallows! with intimation, that if she didn&#x2019;t mind what she was about, she should certainly be <hi rend="italic">hanged!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; and such fact about her transmitted by M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to Posterity with the plaintive Commentary! &#x201C;alas! that there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Francia among us at the present day!&#x201C;</p>
<p>But oh dear! dear! I mustn&#x2019;t be chattering; or I shall miss the post, and along with it the honour and pleasure of offering you my best wishes (such as they are) on new years morning!</p>
<p>I have had so many letters to write in the last week, and so many little parcels to make up for friends in the North, which (the letters and parcels) have by length of habit come to be a sort of moral necessities; that I am run to a minute for time.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would be right glad to go to the grange on the <date when="1861-01-14">14<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> or when you please&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if</hi> only he could go on correcting his proofs there. But he &#x201C;never <hi rend="italic">could</hi> work at the grange <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014;he says. I suggested that you, being as good as the angels, would let him breakfast in his own room, and keep himself <hi rend="italic">au secret</hi> there till two oclock (as they let him do at Thurso); and the answer to that was&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes!&#x2014;if it could be arranged in that way; I should like nothing better.&#x201C;&#x2014; as you were so amiable as grant him &#x201C;a window to get out at in the middle of the night,&#x201C; I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> you will permit him this new indulgence also. and then I see no other obstacle to our being with you on the 14<hi rend="italic">th</hi> or when you like&#x2014;to stay a whole fortnight&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">that</hi> does not frig[h]ten you. Oh I shall be so glad! God bless <hi rend="italic">you</hi> Baby! I am coming to Play with you,</p>

<salute>My dear Jane,</salute>
<p>In settling my affairs, moral and material, at the years end; I made a note, to write to <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> and I wish I had done it a day or two ago, as it would then have come with better grace, than <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> when I have got something to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> thanks for. But I miscalculated the time it would take me to write all those letters which I have accustomed myself to write, for years and years back, to my relations, and old Haddington friends, &#x26;c, so that they (the letters) have come by length of habit to be a sort of moral necessities; or&#x2014;Providence was particular[l]y adverse this year in sending interruptions&#x2014;for yesterday found me within <hi rend="italic">four</hi> of the end of my list! and meanwhile came your wonderful looking package! which excited my curiosity extremely! it was so long before I could disentangle the intricate cordage, and what I <hi rend="italic">saw</hi> in the process was so <hi rend="italic">light,</hi> and yet it was so <hi rend="italic">heavy</hi> to <hi rend="italic">lift!</hi> while there peeped out at one end what I took for a bunch of <hi rend="italic">Lavender,</hi> which smelt exactly like salt fish! All these contradictions were pleasantly explained when the coverlid got itself unfolded, and the heavy jam-pot and lump of Salmon were brought to light!</p>
<p>The coverlid was soon spread on the sofa of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s study where he takes a half hour&#x2019;s sleep, every day now, betwixt returning from his ride and eating his dinner, and he hanseled it by taking a sound sleep under it last night. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have had, for years, a great racoon-fur rug on my drawing-room sofa, which I have lain under so much, that it has got to feel much like an <hi rend="italic">own</hi> second <hi rend="italic">skin!</hi> So I can afford to let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> keep this one of yours on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sofa, which will be doing it all the honour in my power; The cranberries I will keep &#x201C;all to myself&#x201C;&#x2014;as for the Salmon; coming under the Category of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">questi</hi>onable <hi rend="italic">Dainties</hi>&#x201C; I think I shall make a present of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Larkin;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Larkin.</note> who has been very civil to your James.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean&#x2019;s son James Aitken, who lodged in Islington near Larkin; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581224-TC-JCA-01"><sic>34:252</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1858-12-24">24 Dec. 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> And thank you for all!</p>
<p>James was here one evening not very long since, and I asked him, during two minutes we were <hi rend="italic">tete a tete,</hi> if he had made acquaintance with any girl. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Girl?</hi>&#x201C; he repeated, in an uncomprehending, questioning, rather terrified way! &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Yes! Girl! dont you know what</hi> a <hi rend="small-caps">girl</hi> <hi rend="italic">is</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Oh yes! I know</hi> said he gravely; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">but I dont understand what you mean</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Why,</hi> I <hi rend="italic">mean; have you at these Parties where you tell me, you were, made acquaintance with any girl</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">No</hi>!&#x2014;&#x201C; (quite decidedly)&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Were you all</hi> men <hi rend="italic">then? Were there no women there? no girls.</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Oh yes!</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">plenty</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Then, did you not speak to <pb id="pg-37-87" n="37:87"/>any of them</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Oh yes! I spoke to some</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Then, why say you hadn&#x2019;t made acquaintance with any girl?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Oh because</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">because</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">I thought you meant</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="small-caps">particularly</hi>&#x201C;!&#x2014; &#x201C;Meant what, <hi rend="italic">particularly?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The</hi> &#x2014; &#x2014; <hi rend="italic">the girl!</hi>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">I thought you meant; had I seen any particular girl?</hi>&#x2014;&#x201C; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Of course I did and your answer was no.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Well <hi rend="italic">but I meant I had seen none</hi> in <hi rend="small-caps">particular</hi>!!&#x201C;&#x2014; I burst out laughing at this point. He waited till I was done, and then asked me <hi rend="italic">had I any girl in my eye?</hi> I think he was relieved when I assured him, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">no</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;that I had very little acquaintance with girls&#x2014; I tell you what it is; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> James won&#x2019;t fall in love <hi rend="italic">now,</hi> till he is turned forty, and then he will have a mad, grand passion for an&#x2014;Actress! or a <hi rend="italic">fast</hi> Widow! tell him I said so! and if I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> happen to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">know a Girl</hi>&#x201C;; I should never dream of trying it on him!</p>
<p>I havn&#x2019;t crossed the threshold for three weeks; but the <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> which knocked me down the first day of the Frost was only severe for the first week&#x2014;and now my cough and rheumatism are quite gone&#x2014;and I stay in the house merely for precaution. That D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> has been a great blessing to me! So many illnesses have been <hi rend="italic">nipped in the bud</hi> by being cared for <hi rend="italic">in time.</hi> since I got into the way of having myself cared for.</p>
<p>For the rest; I am not so impatient, and disspir[i]ted this time, as confinement to the house used to make me! much of my contentment being due I think to my two Girls, who are extremely kind and attentive to me, and carry on the affairs of the House quite satisfactorily without my superintendence. You know that I dismissed the vulgar, self sufficient, selfish Brute of a cook<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Tall&#x201C; Charlotte; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601117-JWC-ETW-01">JWC to <sic>ET</sic><corr>ETW</corr>, [<date when="1860-11-17">17 Nov. 1860</date>]</ref>.</note> that I got in M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s absence, and took back dear little Charlotte, whom I had never ceased to miss and who had never ceased to pine for her lost place?</p>
<p>The Present Combination answers capitally. Sarah&#x2019;s tidiness and punctuality are correcting insensibly Charlotte&#x2019;s natural turn for <hi rend="italic">muddle,</hi> while Charlotte&#x2019;s warm heartedness and head-over-heels <hi rend="italic">willing</hi>ness have quite warmed up Sarah&#x2019;s colder more formal nature. My &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">establishment</hi>&#x2019; is a great amusement to my visitors, and even to myself&#x2014;Charlotte <hi rend="italic">nineteen,</hi> Sarah <hi rend="italic">seventeen;</hi> such <hi rend="italic">children</hi> in everything except their <hi rend="italic">work,</hi> which could&#x2019;nt be done better by the fullest-grown women! But they make sport of their work&#x2014;for themselves,&#x2014;and are so ridiculously <hi rend="italic">happy;</hi> that it often makes me laugh to look to them!</p>
<p>For example Charlotte went into the garden the other day to shovel the snow off the walk&#x2014;I looked from my bed room window, rather sorry for her, to see how she was getting on; and there were <hi rend="italic">both girls, playing at snow balls!!</hi>&#x2014;amidst little shouts of laughter! when my bell rang after, both flew to answer it; all white with snow, and radiant with delight!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-88" n="37:88"/>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is to dine with Lady Sandwich today&#x2014; I am sorry I had to decline&#x2014;for it is dullish, dining all alone on newyears day!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your little Note (welcome always, tho&#x2019; short); and cordial return of the wishes you send us at this Season and at all seasons.</p>
<p>We are perhaps doing more tolerably than you suppose.

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>This is only two lines to announce the safe arrival of the eggs and hens; and to thank you for them, with all the warmth possible, in the present temperature, which is freezing the very blood at my heart I think! It has got quite <pb id="pg-37-90" n="37:90"/>beyond producing the customary results of frost in me; coughing, blowing my nose and all that sort of thing. The other day without the least earthly assignable reason, but the cold I was exposed to; I suddenly started off <hi rend="italic">retching!!</hi> and retched (you remember of old my violent manner of exercising that natural function?)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-32/lt-18570305-TC-JCA-01"><sic>32:96</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1857-03-05">5 March 1857</date></corr></ref>.</note> from five in the afternoon till two in the morning, with only brief pauses! When the fit was over, nothing followed; except the weariness and <hi rend="italic">torn-in-pieces-ness,</hi> natural to such violent exertions. And <hi rend="italic">that</hi> makes me still very good for nothing, and even less able to hold my own against the frost than I was before. Then we have the prospect of going to the Grange next week<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They went to The Grange <date when="1861-01-15">15 Jan.</date></note>&#x2014;not an exhilerating one&#x2014;under the circumstances&#x2014;; and I have my finery to look up, and put in order; and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C wants <hi rend="italic">two</hi> new stocks made and a smoking cap! <hi rend="italic">made!&#x2014;</hi> Heaven bless the man!&#x2014;as if there were none in the shops! but as for the smoking-cap! <hi rend="italic">Don&#x2019;t he wish he may get it!</hi> It will be much, I think, if I wash and new line his old one!</p>
<p>&#x201C;Altogether&#x201C; I feel very bothered; and (as <hi rend="italic">the Doctor</hi> says) &#x201C;dont see my way!&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>The frost, tho&#x2019; not quite unwholesome to me, yet joining with the Prussian dust-vortexes in a <hi rend="italic">frozen</hi> state, and no egress till the sun is setting (when we have any sun);&#x2014;all this, with total seclusion from my fellow creatures, is really <hi rend="italic">congealing</hi> to the mind as well as to the body. I hope to thaw &#x26; resuscitate (in the spiritual part of me) a little at The Grange. There was talk of &#x201C;work&#x201C; there, and arrang<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> by My Lady for that charitable end:&#x2014;well, surely: and yet, alas, except correcting Proofsheets, or the like, I have small practical hope that way; and (especially if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are riding) will take my Fortnight in fresh air and human society instead.</p>
<p>Pray tell me if I must bring my own Horse (must or may; yes or no is all one to me); or if you have not idle horses enough and to spare in this frost?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-91" n="37:91"/>Also whether I may not, at any rate, send you an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> effective plan for <hi rend="italic">rough-shoeing;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I got from Whitworth of the <hi rend="italic">Great gun:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Whitworth had been commissioned by the government during the Crimean War to design machinery for rifle making; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551119-TC-JAC-01"><sic>30:119</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-11-19">19 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> here is specimen shoe &#x26;c with letter of directions,&#x2014;if you care at all. The plan is easy: two screw <hi rend="italic">holes</hi> one in the heel of each shoe; 8 holes in all; the holes are plugged up (carefully) while in stable; 8 little <hi rend="italic">steel nails</hi> are screwed into them when you go out to ride. I ride so daily, &#x26; find it perfect while the nails continue sharp. You get <hi rend="italic">new</hi> ones about once a week. The one difficulty is to get the groom to be punctual in <hi rend="italic">un</hi>screwing them when you return home.</p>

    <p>For nothing of an &#x0201C;impedimental&#x0201D; sort (as Henry Taylor would say) has arisen <hi rend="italic">here;</hi> and we look forward to being with you (and Baby of the World)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">The Ashburtons&#x02019; da., Mary Florence Baring.</note> on the appointed day&#x02014;if only we &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">be spared</hi>&#x0201D;!</p>
    <p>and such pains I have been taking all this while to insure being <hi rend="italic">spared,</hi> as far as it depends on oneself!</p>
    <p>I even refused myself the gratification of going with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to dine at Lady Sandwich&#x02019;s on New-years day; for fear of bringing back my cold, so that the 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi> might find <hi rend="italic">me</hi> unfit for travelling, And I had my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x02019;s leave to go&#x02014;with certain precautions!&#x02014; He has an extravagant idea, my D<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> of the agony of mind it must be to a female patient to be denied what he calls &#x0201C;a little sociality.&#x0201D; So he &#x0201C;really thought I might risk dining out on new-years-day; provided I ordered a wax candle to be burnt in the carriage for half an hour before getting into it&#x02014;and kept it burning all the way!&#x0201D; I tell you this invention, (on the authority of a clever, quite matter-of-fact man) in case you may have some occasion to turn it to account&#x02014;not for yourself, who seem perfectly inaccessible to <hi rend="italic">Colds</hi> but for some less happily constituted friend.&#x02014; As for me; I confess, such a style of <hi rend="italic">driving</hi>&#x02014;boxed in along with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> wax candle! <pb id="pg-37-92" n="37:92" />

<salute>Dear Hannay,</salute>
<p>You are, of course, highly welcome to dedicate your new volume<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hannay&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Essays from &#x201C;The Quarterly Review&#x201C;</hi> (<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>) was dedicated &#x201C;with cordial esteem and affection&#x201C; to TC.</note> to me, since you will do me that honour.</p>
<p>I heard of the <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi> Editorship<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hannay ed. the conservative newspaper <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Courant</hi> <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>.</note> and was privately glad, on your account, to think that you had got into those duller and safer waters, out of the wild Scyllas &#x26; Charybdises that go jumbling at such a rate in these latitudes of ours. London has its charms, especially for one still young; but it is not of improving character, in a real or serious sense, rather the reverse I should say (as <hi rend="italic">vain</hi> and inane tumult always is); and certainly there is no mode of existence known to me in the world, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I could <hi rend="italic">less</hi> recommend to a human creature than that of the Literary Fraternity here floating about, in the tempestuous &#x201C;mother of dead dogs,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590409-TC-RWE-01"><sic>35:68</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1859-04-09">9 April 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> at this epoch of its history!&#x2014; The necessity of a solid income is itself an immense matter. You will still find Books, intelligent studious people, and abundance of other resources in Edin<hi rend="italic">gh;</hi> at lowest you can be silent, faithfully do your own daily work; and with whatever energy is given you improve <hi rend="italic">yourself</hi> in real wisdom and insight to the pitch intended by Nature in making you!</p>
<p>I send you all measure of good wishes; and hope to see you again, in prosperous condition, some day when this horrible load, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has crushed me down into the bowels of Chaos these many years, is at length off my shoulders, and I am again alive among the living.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We got out hither yesterday (Tuesday) as preappointed: the journey out was not uncomfortable, perfectly warm by aid of good wrapping and art, the sun shining as we came along, and what seemed strange but is common in <hi rend="italic">chalk</hi> countries, all the brooks still unfrozen;&#x2014;it seems they gush out from a great depth, copious and a good many degrees above frost, so that they can run 10 or 20 miles before being coolled into ice. There was, and is, such an East-wind, on our stepping out, as for virulence of cold I have seldom seen. The Ashburton Carriage being an open one (the Lady here is Highland and patronises cold), poor Jane durst not look at it; so we got a close one, and only sent the luggage in the other. I left my Horse; Farie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), nonpracticing barrister of independent means, known to the Carlyles since <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600727-TC-RF-01"><sic>36:152</sic><corr>TC to RF, <date when="1860-07-27">27 July 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> to ride it now and then; I am to try one of specimens here, roughshod according to the custom of Hampshire Smiths. Half-past 2 this day: I have got one of the warmest coats in the world; but this will be a severe trial to it. I bathed, <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> soon after 8 this morning; and had a vigorous walk, <hi rend="italic">considering,</hi> before breakfast.

But we are to <hi rend="italic">try;</hi> we shall see, we shall see!&#x2014;</p>

<dateline>The GrangeFriday [<date when="1861-01-18">18 January 1861</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dear Charlotte</salute>
<p>Luckily I didn&#x2019;t give way to a too confident gladness, when I felt <hi rend="italic">little keys</hi> thro&#x2019; the paper of your note; or I should have been ready to dash my brains out against the wall, on inspecting them, and recognising <hi rend="italic">one</hi> as the key of an old padlock! and the other as a key found on the streets! the only thing I ever <hi rend="italic">found,</hi> to the best of my recollection, except once a solitary ha&#x2019;penny, in Cook&#x2019;s Grounds!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cook&#x2019;s Grounds, an area of open ground near what is now Glebe Place, between King&#x2019;s Rd. and Cheyne Row.</note></p>
<p>But never mind! I dare say I put the right key away in some place where you couldnt be expected to find it. And in the meantime the worst difficulties of my mistake are obviated for me&#x2014;by the help of friends. There was nothing in the desk absolutely indispensable for my comfort, except the white gloves and my sewing materials (needle-book reels of cotton &#x26;c)&#x2014;my pearl necklace and bracelets are in the locked desk; but one <hi rend="italic">can exist</hi> without these!&#x2014; And, but for my absurd <hi rend="italic">pride,</hi> I neednt have been put about at all&#x2014;having only to state my difficulties to Miss Emily Baring, or to Lady Ashburton, and immediately Lady&#x2019;s Maids were despatched to my room with more white gloves, and reels, and needles, than I should use in a year!! Writing paper and envelopes are <hi rend="italic">always</hi> at the command of the visitors to any extent&#x2014;so it is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all right</hi>&#x201C; in the matter of the missing key&#x2014; But it is anything but <hi rend="italic">all right</hi> in the matter of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle! He has his headache very bad&#x2014;and talked seriously of going home the very first day after we came, and again he told Lady A last night that he must go home on Saturday (tomorrow) but would leave <hi rend="italic">me</hi> here. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I set my face against&#x2014;he might go if he would, but if he went, I <pb id="pg-37-98" n="37:98"/>would certainly go too&#x2014;and so, tho&#x2019; very angry at what he calls <hi rend="italic">my perversity,</hi> he is meaning to try to stay a little longer. but I have small <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> we shall make out the <hi rend="italic">fortnight!</hi> and shouldnt wonder if he went tomorrow after all! However you dont need to make any preparations for our arrival unless you have had it officially intimated to you&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">only</hi>&#x2014;take care to be in the way. that if he do start off all on a sudden, he mayn&#x2019;t be put in a rage at the end of his journey by finding nobody to get him some dinner, or what he needs.</p>
<p>As for the cleaning&#x2014;dont have more than <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing in hands at atime&#x2014;and then you can&#x2019;t be found in any <hi rend="italic">irremediable</hi> muddle come when we may!</p>
<p>I have been very well since I came here&#x2014;and walk out every day&#x2014; The House is full of company as usual<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to TC, the company consisted only of Kingsley, Venables, and Miss Baring; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610116-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-01-16">16 Jan.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;and they are people I like, most of them. The Baby is a perfect Darling&#x2014;but has <hi rend="italic">her own appartments</hi> in a distant part of the House&#x2014;so one has to make a long solemn journey to get a kiss of her!</p>
<p>Lady A. is kindness&#x2019;s Self!&#x2014;really twenty angels melted into one couldn&#x2019;t make up a kinder more loveable creature&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope you are both good girls, and that I shall find you well and well doing when I come home.</p>
<p>Poor old Sambo the first Lady&#x2019;s pet dog<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Harriet Ashburton&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560815-TC-LA-01"><sic>31:176</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1856-08-15">15 Aug. 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> is grown so feeble and spiritless! he reminds me so of little Nero! tho&#x2019; a big dog&#x2014;and when he sets up long wailing howls, I fancy he is waiting for his old Mistress&#x2014;and can hardly keep from bursting out crying&#x2014;what nonsense!</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Ashburton,</salute>
<p>By this post, I send you the Pamphlet of Formey on <hi rend="italic">Keith,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Discourse on the Death of Marshal Keith</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>) by Jean Henri Samuel Formey (<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1797-00-00">97</date>), prof. of philosophy, and sec. of the Berlin Academy. The French original had been pbd. as <hi rend="italic">&#xc9;loges de Mm. les mar&#xE9;chaux de Schwerin et Keith</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>). James Francis Edward Keith (<date when="1696-00-00">1696</date>&#x2013;<date when="1758-00-00">1758</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15267"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Prussian field marshal; see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580923-TC-JWC-01"><sic>34:195</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1858-09-23">23 Sept. 1858</date></corr></ref>. TC had the pamphlet (including his marginal notes) bound in half calf with full red morocco case (HCC). He wrote on the title-page: &#x201C;The Lady Ashburton: T.C. (Chelsea, <date when="1861-01-07">jan 7 1861</date>)&#x201C;; see <ref target="volume-37/18610130-TC-JAC-01">TC to [JAC], [ca. <date when="1861-01-30">30 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> which I had the honour to recommend, the other evening. Formey (a Berlin Frenchman, Ex-Preacher, Secretary to their &#x201C;Royal Society&#x201C; &#x26;c) was no great things of a Writer; but he was a respectable industrious creature in his kind; and this is by much the best Piece I know of his. Every word of what he says of Keith is <hi rend="italic">true</hi> withal;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Formey wrote: &#x201C;[Keith&#x2019;s] demeanour was like that of a respectable father of a family, which challenged reverence, but, much more strongly challenged love; his constitution was remarkably vigorous, till weakened by the incredible fatigues which he underwent; yet the vigour of his spirit far surpassed that of his body. &#x2026; But that which ought to render his memory forever precious is, that he was a hero extremely humane; never omitting to do any thing in his power, that might soften and alleviate the calamities of war, lessen the number of its miseries, and, in some measure, relieve those whom it had rendered wretched&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Discourse</hi> 42&#x2013;44). TC described Keith as &#x201C;A man of Scotch type; the broad accent, with its sagacities, veracities, with its steadfastly fixed moderation, and its sly twinkles of defensive humour, is still audible to us through the foreign wrappages. Not given to talk, unless there is something to be said; but well capable of it then. Friedrich, the more he knows him, likes him the better&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:323&#x2013;24).</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is an important recommendation! I hope it will deserve a reading from a Kinswoman<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Louisa Ashburton was related to Keith by marriage; see <ref target="volume-37/18610130-TC-JAC-01">TC to [JAC], [ca. <date when="1861-01-30">30 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note> of that distinguished man.</p>
<p>I am still sorry and ashamed of my sad <hi rend="italic">fiasco</hi> of a visit; but there was no help! Had I held out one other day, or at the utmost two, Lord A. w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have put me on a <hi rend="italic">long</hi>-legged Horse, swift as the wind, and there had been an improvement in circumstances otherwise desperate. I am about recovered, <pb id="pg-37-101" n="37:101"/>chiefly by galloping about; and work is going on again, at the old sad rate of speed. I wish my Wife had been persuadable to stay where she was doing so well: the poor soul has done nothing but pine ever since, and has only begun yesterday to come round a little.</p>
<p>If it please Heaven I will see The Grange again, under better omens,&#x2014;fresh weather, at least plenty of riding, for one item;&#x2014;if I break down in the Summer, you shall bring me to Addiscombe<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; farm and estate near Croydon.</note> too. But on the whole there will come no good of me till I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with this unutterable Job,&#x2014;at which I labour with diminishing strength, sadly, in the one hope of getting free of it, and saving my poor life, what of it may remain.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to Baby, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Papa</hi> if he behave himself,</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I believe you heard that we went to The Grange on the theory of a &#x201C;Fortnight of Country&#x201C;; and John<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle.</note> tells me he has sent you my little Note, intimating that it proved a down-break; and that we are now here, again on supportable terms  That is essentially all the news I have; but I supposed you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like it from my own hand. Poor Jane was doing decidedly well at The Grange, and I wish she w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have consented to continue; she has been below par ever since we returned, and is not yet up to the old mark even, tho&#x2019; again recovering her sleep, and on the mending hand. I myself was rather unwell when we set out; and am certainly not <hi rend="italic">mended</hi> by the adventure; but hope I am getting up to the old poor level again, <hi rend="italic">below</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it is not good for me to be.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>The sight of my handwriting will, I know, be welcome again. Tho&#x2019; I literally do not write the smallest Note once in a month, or converse with anything but Prussian Nightmares of a hideous, and with my Horse (who is human in comparison), and with my poor Wife (who is altogether human, and heroically cheerful to me, in her poor weak state),&#x2014;I must use the five minutes, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> have fallen to me today, in acknowledge<hi rend="italic">t, due</hi> by all laws terrestrial and celestrial, of the last Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Conduct of Life,</hi> pbd. <date when="1860-12-00">Dec. 1860</date>.</note> that has come from you.</p>
<p>I read it a great while ago, mostly in sheets,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Smith, Elder &#x26; Co., Emerson&#x2019;s British publisher, had sent TC proof sheets of the work autumn <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; see <ref target="volume-37/18601007-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-10-07">7 Oct. 1860</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601008-TC-SEC-01">TC to <sic>S, E &#x26; Co.</sic><corr>SEC</corr>, <date when="1860-10-08">8 Oct. 1860</date></ref>.</note> and again read it in the finely printed form,&#x2014;I can tell you, if you do not already guess, with a satisfaction given me by the Books of no other living mortal. I predicted to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> English Bookseller a great sale even, reckoning it the best of all your Books. What the sale was or is I nowhere learned; but the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of my prophecy remains like the rocks, and will remain. Indeed, except from my Brother John, I have heard no criticism that had much rationality,&#x2014;some of them incredibly irrational (if that matter had not altogether become a barking of dogs among us);&#x2014;but I always believe there are in the mute state a great number of thinking English souls, who can recognise a Thinker, and a Sayer, of perennially human type, and welcome him as the rarest of miracles, in &#x201C;such a spread of knowledge&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A common phrase, though attrib. to TC by Slater (<hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 533); also used by John Stuart Mill in a letter to TC, <date when="1832-07-17">17 July 1832</date> (Francis E.

<name>T. Carlyle</name><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson replied, <date when="1861-04-16">16 April</date>, thanking TC &#x201C;for the cordial note which brought me joy many weeks ago.

We have settled it in America, as I doubt not it is settled in England, that &#x2018;Frederick&#x2019; is a history which a beneficent Providence is not very likely to interrupt.

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C arrived at home soberly at <hi rend="italic">a quarter before nine</hi> (!) on Sunday night, and declared himself so benefited by the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">human</hi> afternoon&#x201C; he had spent, that I fondly hoped he would be induced to try the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">human</hi>&#x2019; dodge again, next Saturday.

<p>Since &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">it</hi>&#x201C; is only to be &#x201C;put off a <hi rend="italic">little</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;I needn&#x2019;t be tying down M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Forster<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Ann Forster.</note> with an appointment to luncheon, but will &#x201C;carry out&#x201C; my original purpose of taking my chance of finding her at home some morning&#x2014;for merely a little conversation.</p>

<p>I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> it was <hi rend="italic">I</hi> who wrote last; and in that belief, with the spirit proper to a native of a Commercial Country, I have been resting on my oars till I should get your answer. But today, while thinking of you and wondering why you didnt write, it suddenly came to my mind that in my last letter I had engaged <pb id="pg-37-108" n="37:108"/>to write again from <hi rend="italic">The Grange.</hi> Did I?&#x2014; I am not <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> whether or no!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her New Year letter, JWC did not promise to write; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601230-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1860-12-30">30 Dec. 1860</date>]</ref>.</note> I have the worst memory of all the women I know; for not only do I forget utterly particulars of quite recent date,&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">remember</hi> particulars of no date at all! that is to say imagine to remember <hi rend="italic">minutely</hi> things that never happened&#x2014;never were!!

<p>Perhaps they are merely unfortunate people with memories like <hi rend="italic">mine!</hi>&#x2014; But no matter about that just now. I was going to say that whether I did or didn&#x2019;t engage to write again the mere doubt is sufficient basis to write upon, <hi rend="italic">instanter;</hi></p>
<p>And it wasn&#x2019;t much of a <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> in me not writing from the Grange: as you will admit when I tell you that we staid at the Grange only <hi rend="italic">four days!!</hi>&#x2014; Alas Yes!

<p>It was such a relief, on arriving at Marrochettis<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Carlo Marochetti (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18085"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Italian sculptor, living in London since <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, at 34 Onslow Sq.</note> yesterday; out of temper and out of breath, to find that you had not come, and&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">gone! That</hi> was what I half expected; to be told, that her Ladyship had been gone a quarter of an hour! All the World and its wife took a notion of driving down to Chelsea yesterday, and doing the civil thing by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle; and the result was that, altho I tied on my bonnet <hi rend="italic">in the street,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ran</hi> all the way, I didn&#x2019;t reach Marrochetti&#x2019;s till a quarter after four. He came to the door himself, and told me you would still come, with a calm certitude of belief which quite imposed on me, and persuaded me into an easy chair from which he displaced his Cat. &#x201C;Do me the favour to sit down here <hi rend="italic">at once;</hi> because if you dont, there is to be feared, my Cat will again take possession of this chair!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-111" n="37:111"/>The Chair commanded the best view of your Busts.

Anyhow, the lower part of the face, especially, seemed to me utterly without expression or likeness&#x2014; And I had the audacity to tell Marrochetti so!

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I suppose this will get to you a few hours sooner, if despatched today; at any rate I hasten to tell you that I am up to my old mark again, nearly or altogether, and that you may dismiss your friendly anxieties for the present. <pb id="pg-37-115" n="37:115"/>Nay perhaps I shall gather a little <hi rend="italic">more</hi> strength as the spring goes on,&#x2014;who knows? This I take to have been a kind of biliary crisis, in solution of the frost. At any rate it seems past. I had a better sleep last night than had been vouchsafed me for six months past. My ears still ring, continually; but there is nothing in my head; the old load of jumbling <hi rend="italic">quicksilver</hi> (a very bad phasis) has been absent for a long time. Every day I contrive to have a little snatch of sleep (at least I lie down absolutely motionless for half an hour) <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> after riding, and <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner: this, I sometimes think, is perhaps the root of all the traceable improve<hi rend="italic">t</hi> since <date when="1860-10-00">Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> last.&#x2014; Jane too is moderately well; sees talking friends &#x26;c; takes two drives weekly in brougham, besides inferior vehiculations.&#x2014; Did I ever tell you our <hi rend="italic">little</hi> Charlotte was here again, this long while back. A big Charlotte we had got, &#x201C;Perfection Charlotte&#x201C; as the Missus called her, did not satisfy at all; so the little one was got in her stead,&#x2014;full of penitence, of good resolution; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she has kept well: a very nice little Lassie, full of sense, attach<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and dexterity; whom it is a pleasure to see by one, in comparison. The other maid<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Piggott.</note> too (<hi rend="italic">junior</hi> in rank &#x26; years, tho&#x2019; taller by inches) does well: so that the House is visibly in trimmer case than it was wont to be. A thing well worth purchasing, since it was purchasable.</p>
<p>Jane went to the Oxford-Street Tavern; found the Landlord a young civil decent-looking man, the place itself very rough-looking, gin and tobacco main elements. What she c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> understand of the Landlord&#x2019;s Narrative was precisely what you know,&#x2014;capped always at intervals with &#x201C;All right now, Ma&#x2019;am; he&#x2019;s all right now!&#x201C; Nothing <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be made of him, but fling the bridle on his neck. Jane asserts always, and has asserted, he is a little mad even in the normal state.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle had written to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1860-03-19">19 March 1860</date>: &#x201C;It is a sad thing to be born with such deep-rooted tendencies to lunacy as he inherits from his father&#x201C;; he continued: &#x201C;you will easily conceive how I am bound to silence in regard to that tendency to insanity&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note></p>
<p>You say nothing, this good while, of <hi rend="italic">Christ&#x2019;s Kirk.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601204-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-12-04">4 Dec. 1860</date></ref>.</note> Perhaps have given it up? <hi rend="italic">Not</hi> the worst plan, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess.

I think I did and must have sent it away by somebody. In a dimmer form, the question rises, Was it not perhaps by you? Nobody so likely to do me a good-natured action in the way of absorbing Law-rubbish!&#x2014; In fine, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you have this old <hi rend="italic">Codex,</hi> or c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> borrow it anywhere among y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> learned Law acquaintanceship, for a few weeks,&#x2014;it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do me a real service; and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be returned punctually, with no wish except never to see it again.</p>
<p>Do what you can in this matter. My hurry is extreme, but I hope the thing is intelligible to a perspicacious mind.</p>

But I am sorry to give, upon both the Whiskey and the Brandy, an altogether different report.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written a check, <date when="1860-12-08">8 Dec. 1860</date>, to Hutchison &#x26; Co., Leith: &#x201C;for Brandy Wine Whisky) &#xa3;18..5..0&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note></p>
<p>About the Whiskey, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> indeed I shall never drink more of, for my own share, but which is in small quantity and can easily be given away to persons here who are not so critical in that matter, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have troubled you at all,&#x2014;nor do I wish you to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything further about it. But the Brandy is more important to me.</p>
<p>My employment of that liquor is principally what may be called <hi rend="italic">medicinal;</hi> and for this I find this present sort very unfit hitherto. A glass of it, made into punch before bedtime, regularly gives me a headache (as the inferior kinds of alcohol are always sure to do);&#x2014;and, in short, by various symptoms, I am driven upon the conclusion that this is not genuine <hi rend="italic">grape</hi> Brandy, but a &#x201C;Cognac&#x201C; done by some <hi rend="italic">refiner</hi> in that part of the world from <hi rend="italic">Corn</hi>-alcohol, perhaps of native Scottish production! This, I have<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS ends here.</note></p>

<salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
<p>You are surely very civil; and I am much obliged by the liberal permission you give me.</p>
<p>I have had the Bottles carefully packed; 31 of Brandy, 9 of Whiskey: and have, two days ago, despatched them to your Address, &#x201C;per Edinburgh Steamer,&#x201C;&#x2014;I could not say by <hi rend="italic">what</hi> &#x201C;Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Steamer&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Steamers left for Edinburgh &#x201C;every Wednesday and Saturday, at 10 morning&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1861-02-23">23 Feb.</date>). TC is writing on Sat.</note> but here inclosed is the Carrier&#x2019;s Receipt, just handed in to me;&#x2014;and I suppose they will arrive by the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Steamer that sails after that, and doubt not they will be safely delivered.</p>
<p>As to the <hi rend="italic">Whiskey,</hi> we will give that up altogether, for the present;&#x2014;and ask you to <hi rend="italic">change</hi> these 9 Bottles into right <hi rend="italic">Brandy,</hi> so far as they will go. That will simplify y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Problem a little.</p>
<p>And furthermore, with regard to the <hi rend="italic">Brandy</hi> I had only to say, That you are not tied up as to <hi rend="italic">price;</hi> that I only request you to be strict (and if possible, <hi rend="italic">certain</hi>) as to <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi>ness;&#x2014;return me as many Bottles of indubitably <hi rend="italic">genuine as</hi> all these Bottles (31 + 9) of spurious or suspected will pay for; and I shall be well content. In my present state of health and occupation, it is far more import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for me that the Brandy be <hi rend="italic">right</hi> than that it be <hi rend="italic">cheap,</hi>&#x2014;very much mo[re]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters in square brackets from here to end indicate where MS is worn.</note> so indeed. And I am informed, it is ju[st] now extremely difficult to get Brandy that has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> bee[n] doctored, more or less, with that inferior stuff of the <hi rend="italic">Scotch</hi> Distilleries,&#x2014;shame to Cognac and them! But I have no doubt you will carefully do your b[est] for me.</p>

<p>You can&#x2019;t imagine how your letter perplexed me! almost terrified me! till I came to <hi rend="italic">the solution,</hi> of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Stewart-Mackenzie, widow of Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s brother George.</note> being the writer of it! The date and the signature left no doubt as to the letter being from <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;how on earth then <pb id="pg-37-128" n="37:128"/>came the hand-writing to be so different from any writing of yours I had seen before? It never occurred to me that some one else might be writing for you; only, that you must have tired of your former hand-writing, and taken up this new one!! an <hi rend="italic">inconstancy of taste</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">faculty of changing</hi> which made me wretched to think of as revealing itself in <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> really heartily wretched for the moment! You mayn&#x2019;t see at first what business it was of mine or anybodys how often you changed your handwriting;&#x2014;but you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> see it on reflection; that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> of most serious interest to me, and to every one that loves you dearly, whether you were capable of such a caprice as throwing over all at once your own beautiful hand-writing, come to be a part of yourself, as it were, and whether you were capable of changing such <hi rend="italic">part of yourself</hi> with such frightful dexterity and completeness! a moments thought will show you all the serious bearings of such a supposition!</p>
<p>For the rest, I should have liked to hug M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mackenzie, with or without her leave, when I found it was she who had written! The relief was so immediate and so great! and at the same time, I went &#x201C;on the knees of my heart&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Rev.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>On friday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> coming in from my ride, Wife still out, I found y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Card on the table; a welcome, if also sad, and almost pathetic greeting for me! So very kind of you to venture out hither, to us first of all. And I had been ill, really quite below par (sleepless &#x26;c &#x26;c) and unable to call, for ten days before; and was just meaning to call next day,&#x2014;and you were off. And you had such a day for travelling, too; I think it was the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> one could have picked out of this bad month, for such a purpose!&#x2014; Pray have the goodness (and that is practically my whole errand at present) to tell me how you stood it; an assurance that you are not hurt, that you are <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> in your old Home-House<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich had presumably just left London for Hinchinbrook House.</note> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very welcome to me at this moment.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-130" n="37:130"/>As to myself I have no news whatever, except those already told, and scarcely permissible to tell, that these subterranean <hi rend="italic">borings</hi> of mine are of dismal nature,&#x2014;too heavy for the poor old <hi rend="italic">barrowman,</hi> so long excluded from daylight and friendly sights;&#x2014;and that he ought to have a care lest there be <hi rend="italic">wreck</hi> of barrow &#x26; him, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are becoming &#x201C;crazy vehicles&#x201C; both of them!

With or without leisure, I had determined to send it today (Friday, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is our American Post-day):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letters for Canada were dispatched by &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">British Mail Steam Packets</hi>&#x201C; from Liverpool every Sat.

<p>Many thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind attentions and good offices. I have sealed up the first Bottle of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> exquisite Cognac, much more have left this second one under the wax; and have set them safe aside,&#x2014;that the house, in case of real emergency, may never be with<hi rend="italic">t Brandy that can be depended on.</hi> Meanwhile, the Leith people,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Messrs.

<p>I am heavily enough pressed down by those sad Prussian burdens; but perhaps not quite so heavily as once: sometimes I think, &#x201C;In 7 or 8 months more, why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> it not be all over; and nothing but going in grass, with the shoes off, ever after!&#x201C;&#x2014; This is too sanguine a computation.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute>&#x2014;If I wrote to you once for every twenty times I think of you, you would get a great many Letters! But in these overloaded times you know how it stands with me: I have not, literally for years, written any Note that I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help; so completely occupied is every moment of my availableday,&#x2014;struggle of labour during the few hours possible for that (for &#x201C;the tightest old quarry-boy in the whole How-Rig,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a saying of TC&#x2019;s father; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350719-TC-MAC-01"><sic>8:181</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1835-07-19">19 July 1835</date></corr></ref>; there was a quarry at Howrig, near Carlisle, early 19th century.</note> you know, gets tired at last, and good for little!)&#x2014;and then the <hi rend="italic">resting,</hi> the &#x26;c &#x26;c; not to mention the incessant botherations from people I have no business with, whom in this roaring element I cannot in the least brush perfectly away, let me try as I will! Let me stop short in this grievous detail; let me tell you rather that, within the last few months, I have made some new arrangements (particularly, to try for a little sleep <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dinner, just after my ride; to be very <hi rend="italic">regular,</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c); that I think I am perceptibly <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> not tormented ab<hi rend="italic">t sleep,</hi> as I lately was; that I <pb id="pg-37-145" n="37:145"/>am steadily working along, &#x201C;faint tho&#x2019; pursuing&#x201C;;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Judg. 8:4.</note>&#x2014;and that in 8 or 9 months more, if I can hold out at this rate (of which there is prospect), I hope to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with the unutterable job, and to wash my hands of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> forever, and belong to myself &#x26; my dear ones again! Let us hope, let us hope!&#x2014;</p>
<p>For a good few weeks past it has been on my mind that I ought to write to <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> upon one particular point (what I once said to you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Tom &#x26; his settlement in life);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had offered to send Alexander&#x2019;s son Tom &#x201C;a &#xa3;200 or so,&#x201C; <date when="1860-04-00">April 1860</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600413-TC-AC-01"><sic>36:95</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1860-04-13">13 April 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> &#x201C;time&#x201C; for a practical word or two on that head (if I plucked up courage!)&#x2014;and that I must and would do it. Above a month ago, I requested John to write something to that effect; but whether he ever yet did it, I have not learned;&#x2014;and so, in brief, I now, after all that haggling, do it myself.</p>
<p>You are to understand, then, that I am, was, and shall be, <hi rend="italic">practically</hi> quite in earnest ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that sum of money (&#xa3;250, I think[)]&#x2014;that the sum is properly <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> for Tom, whenever you like to demand it. And, if anything happen to me <hi rend="italic">before</hi> it be paid, I wish you to present this to those who stand for me; in proof (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it is) of my <hi rend="italic">owing</hi> you that sum, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> any <hi rend="italic">other</hi> affair be gone into ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> what once belonged to me.&#x2014; Now pray understand this, dear Brother; and be ready to act upon it, now or afterwards, at the moment you see fit:&#x2014;I shall be easier in my mind knowing henceforth that you do understand it.&#x2014; Something was said in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last Letter, to Jack I think, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> setting up of Tom, as a thing you were vaguely contemplating: it was but a word; but I never forgot it,&#x2014;and always meant and wished, since then, to write you what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> now at last on paper! If you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> want the money at once, and cared to make a Brantford or Hamilton <hi rend="italic">Banker</hi> draw on me, for your behoof, to the above amount, his Draught sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be honoured, and you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get the money by return of post;&#x2014;at any time, this will hold. And if, not being in such readiness or hurry, you warned <hi rend="italic">me</hi> direct that the thing was coming ready, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> spend a Couple of hours on it some day, and get you the due <hi rend="italic">Paper</hi> ready, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> need only endorsing &#x26; presenting on your part. And now we will be silent ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the matter (you need not even <hi rend="italic">answer</hi> till y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> time come); everything, I hope, being now clear.</p>
<p>Jane is tolerably well; <hi rend="italic">better,</hi> she too, than usual. Our <date when="1861-03-00">march</date> has been the <hi rend="italic">wettest</hi> &#x26; warmest I can recollect. No <hi rend="italic">seed-time</hi> anywhere, I doubt, till now, when the wind has stuck itself north-east. A bad harvest our last; probably a bad one <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> too, after such a start. Kindred all well, by last acc<hi rend="italic">ts,</hi> a few days ago. Jack still in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> &#x201C;in lodgings&#x201C;;&#x2014;Lodgings still, but not in bad spirits in the least.&#x2014; Adieu, dear Brother; my blessing be on you all. <closer><salute>Your affectionate</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry I delayed writing; but the truth is I never have one moment to myself; and have not for years written any Note except on absolute compulsion. Least of all, of course, when the terms to use are not at once apparent.</p>
<p>Your speculat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Water-Cure and Rifle-drill seemed to me, and seems entirely chimerical. None of <hi rend="italic">us</hi> can help our health, except by simply working within limits, not beyond them, using good regimen every way, and taking plenty of air and exercise. To all this, Hydropathy, or Medical Science (I believe) in any form, much more rifle-drilling &#x26;c &#x26;c are quite extraneous.</p>

<salute>Monsieur&#x2014;</salute>
<p>How are you?&#x2014;And your &#x201C;nice wife&#x201C;?<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Dods.</note>&#x2014;and your regard for <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> what of <hi rend="italic">that?</hi>&#x2014; I want to know more than can be told in violets;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 4.1.</note> so <hi rend="italic">do</hi> be so good as write me a real letter; or make your wife write me one. In a correspondence between you and me, there is this advantage on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> side; that whereas you, living in the old place, leading the old life, must abound in topics having either a direct or an associate interest for me; I at the other end of the kingdom, living with People whom you don&#x2019;t know, occupied with things you don&#x2019;t care about must write always under a discouraging uncertainty whether I am interesting you or boring you; so soon as I quit the common ground of old memories and feelings&#x2014; And if I kept wholly to <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> God knows if it wouldn&#x2019;t become as tiresome a topic as any other! The things one likes to <pb id="pg-37-149" n="37:149"/>preserve in Lavender (real or metaphorical) should be kept <hi rend="italic">closely shut up;</hi> or the lavender fragrance will soon go out of them!</p>
<p>And so, let me tell you about the Sunny Bank plants.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601006-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [<date when="1860-10-07">6</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-10-07">7?

<p>Well; the Fuschia and the Laburnum are dead&#x2014;vanished&#x2014;annihilated! And the little fir-tree can scarce be called alive. I have twice had a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> to it; but it seems to be one of those cases of occult malady where Science is powerless, and the only hope lies in a happy chance. But the Hawthorn has stood its ground thro&#x2019; the hard winter, and has now a little tuft of bright green leaves, and I begin to have wild hopes of its <hi rend="italic">flowering</hi> someday, and bringing &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">airs</hi>&#x201C; from Long Ago!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520910-JWC-JRS-01"><sic>27:279</sic><corr>JWC to JRS, <date when="1852-09-10">10 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; There is something else (which has lost its identity) still,&#x2014;also in a promising way; tho&#x2019; it as yet has put forth no leaf to know it by. Before quitting this remarkably innocent &#x201C;Head of method,&#x201C; I will just add, that the two little Barberries are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">regular bricks</hi>&#x201C; (in the polite London dialect) and are putting out little purple leaves every day; which I take note of thro&#x2019; the large magnifying glass M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C keeps for looking at Maps!</p>
<p>I wish I could say as much for myself&#x2014;that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> were giving any such decided sign of vitality! But alas!

This was the chain of Cause and Effect between the breaking of the saucer and my calling at the Dunlops!&#x2014; For the rest; I found them in apparently affluent circumstances.

Let us all <hi rend="italic">be thankful.</hi></p>
<p>You must take more care of yourself: my notion is, you do not yet know (as I am fast learning to do) what the meaning of &#x201C;Sixty&#x201C; is. A very earnest meaning; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will have itself attended to,&#x2014;under penalties.</p>

<p>But it wasn&#x2019;t my opinion of Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> you asked me for, it was for &#x201C;details&#x201C; about Edward Irving. And to tell the Gods Truth, I have written the above not out of any grudge against the poor old Place, but just to stave off a minute longer the business in hand. It is mildly and modestly that you ask for these &#x201C;details,&#x201C; But nevertheless&#x2014;the effect produced on my Imagination is that of&#x2014;a loaded pistol at my breast and the words &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">details</hi> or your Life&#x201C;!! I lose all presence of mind!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oliphant wrote: &#x201C;I was greatly disturbed to think I had troubled you by my inquiries.

<p>If you were here&#x2014;beside me&#x2014;I dare say I might give you some of the details you want&#x2014;your questions would suggest them&#x2014;or they would suggest themselves in the natural course of conversation. But to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> them down&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">to order</hi>&#x2014;all in a row&#x2014;with &#x201C;the reciprocity all on one side&#x201C;&#x2014;the idea of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to be printed</hi>&#x201C; lowering over me&#x2014; Oh my Dear! I can&#x2019;t indeed! the thought makes me like to <hi rend="italic">scream!</hi>&#x2014;and makes me <hi rend="italic">tingle</hi> from head to foot!</p>
<p>But look here! I will direct you to a person from whom I have no doubt you could elicit many details very interesting of their kind. There is an old servant<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid.</note> of my Mothers&#x2014; &#x2014;<hi rend="italic">your own sort of old servant</hi>&#x2014;to whom the name of <pb id="pg-37-157" n="37:157"/>Edward Irving is a dear household name, and who will tell you all she recollects about him&#x2014;if I bid her do so. Independently of Edward Irving this old Betty is a woman to make whose acquaintance will do you good&#x2014; There is now no woman on Earth whom I love so dearly&#x2014;or who so dearly loves me.</p>
<p>Her address is</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Braid &#x2F; Stenhouse &#x2F; Greenend &#x2F; Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>If you are not a great walker, your way to go would be to get into the Dalkeith coach in Princes Street. Greenend is a village about three miles from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> thro&#x2019; which the Dalkeith Coach runs. Stenhouse<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dalkeith, town about 6 mi. (9.5 km.) SE of Edinburgh; Greenend, a village in Liberton parish; the Braids lived nearby in Upper Stenhouse.</note> is <hi rend="italic">two</hi> or <hi rend="italic">three</hi> cottages in a row close to Greenend&#x2014;three minutes walk off&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Braid&#x2014;my Betty&#x2014;(&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Betty</hi>&#x201C; she calls herself) lives there with her Husband, and a poor paralytic sufferer, her only son<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander and George Braid. Oliphant reported, <date when="1861-05-07">7 May</date>, her visit to Betty Braid: &#x201C;I found her very bright and kind, lighting up at the sound of your name, with her little house full of cottage comforts and refinements, and wonderfully still and quiet.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Besides Her, I could introduce you to a favourite pupil of Edward Irvings&#x2014;A certain William Dods&#x2014;agent for the Commercial Bank at Haddington. He is often in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;and if you liked to see him, you have only to write and make an appointment with him, in my name&#x2014; I will warn him of the possibility&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest: I send you <hi rend="italic">one</hi> letter that may be printed<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Edward Irving to JBW, <date when="1822-02-9">9 Feb. 1822</date>; see Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Irving</hi> &#x2014;36; Irving had enclosed the letter to TC for forwarding; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220213-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:39</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1822-02-13">13 Feb. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; It is an extremely characteristic letter, and contains nothing <hi rend="italic">fatal</hi>&#x2014; It was written soon after he had renewed his acquaintance with me as a grown girl&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">before he had</hi>&#x2014; !&#x2014; I have just <hi rend="italic">one</hi> other letter of his spared unburnt&#x2014;and a sonnet! and I will <hi rend="italic">show</hi> you these when you come but mustnt send <hi rend="italic">them</hi> out of my hands&#x2014;</p>
<p>I showed M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle the letter inclosed, in case of his finding any objection to its publication. and he agreed with me that it is very characteristic&#x2014;and that there was no reason why it might not be published&#x2014;with the suppression perhaps of one passage&#x2014; &#x2014; I dont mean the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Lovely</hi>&#x201C; i had indeed drawn my pencil thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C said &#x2018;no&#x2019;&#x2014;&#x201C;the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Lovely</hi>&#x2019; must be let stand; <hi rend="italic">for the letter wouldn&#x2019;t be the least like a letter</hi> of Irvings without it&#x201C;!! but &#x201C;if I <hi rend="italic">didnt like the epithet</hi> for myself <hi rend="italic">now</hi>&#x2014;I could make you omit the <hi rend="italic">name</hi>&#x2014;put merely my then Initial Miss W&#x2014;&#x201C;</p>
<p>What both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and I think should be left out are the two lines about the &#x201C;antique cast&#x201C; of his head.&#x2014;which those who didnt know him might find ridiculously vain.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The phrase and surrounding lines were omitted. Strangely, neither Carlyle objected to the inclusion of the sentence &#x201C;Were I established in the love and obedience of Him, I should rise toweringly aloft into the regions of a very noble and sublime character, and so would my highly-gifted pupil, to retain whose friendship shall be a consolation to my life: to have her fellowship in divine ambitions would make her my dear companion through eternity&#x201C; (Oliphant, <hi rend="italic">Irving</hi> 1:135).</note> He <hi rend="italic">was</hi> vain&#x2014;there is no denying it!&#x2014;but it was a vanity <pb id="pg-37-158" n="37:158"/>proceeding out of what was best and most loveable in him, His childlike simplicity and desire to be <hi rend="italic">loved</hi>&#x2014;even to the &#x201C;cast of his head&#x201C;&#x2014;his crystal transparency of character, letting every little weakness show thro it as frankly as his noblest qualities&#x2014;and above all&#x2014;out of his loyal, his divine trust in the absolute Truth and sincerity, and in the generous sympathy and good will of all who made friendly advances towards him. Still as those who only read about him now might find more of sheer vanity than of beautiful trust in those words I have marked off&#x2014;it would hardly be just towards him to put them in print. Dont you think so?&#x2014;</p>
<p>You ask about an excursion he made with me &#x201C;thro&#x2019; the west country.&#x2019; Alas no! he made it not <hi rend="italic">with</hi> me but <hi rend="italic">after</hi> me!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly summer <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>; JWC and her mother were in Nithsdale (see Hansons, <hi rend="italic">NE</hi> 31&#x2013;32), and Irving was also in the area during mid-<date when="1820-00-00">Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200805-TC-JOFE-01"><sic>1:269</sic><corr>TC to JOFE, <date when="1820-08-05">5 Aug. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> It was a laughable affair at the time&#x2014;very sad to think of now&#x2014; I will tell you all about it when you come, or if I go north this summer as is not impossible.</p>

<p>Now you needn&#x2019;t be either flattering or frightening yourself that I am about to write you <hi rend="italic">another</hi> letter &#x201C;out of my head,&#x201C; just on the back of having <hi rend="italic">not</hi> received a letter out of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> head! Your wife&#x2019;s letter I was glad at and duly grateful; and have entered it in my mental Ledger to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> credit. But I have no faith in vicarious good works; so don&#x2019;t feel to owe <hi rend="italic">you</hi> a letter just at present, nor indeed to owe you anything in particular; For, the help with my problems and the loan of the cotton stockings I consider handsomely cleared off by my remembrance of these benefits thro&#x2019; so many mortal years!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dods helped the young Jane Baillie Welsh with her algebra problems at school and lent her his white cotton stockings; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18591209-JWC-MR-01"><sic>36:22</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1859-12-09">9 Dec. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> No&#x2014;this time I write at the instance of a sort of moral necessity&#x2014;in fact, on a matter of business. (at least in the woman-sense of that word).</p>
 <p>You have heard of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant, &#x201C;the celebrated novelist&#x201C;? never mind if you havn&#x2019;t! for it wouldn&#x2019;t be any particular shame to you. &#x201C;Celebrated Novelists&#x201C; are thick as blackberries at the present day. Probably you have read her <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Book, anyhow, for I sent it to your Wife for newyears day?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The House on the Moor</hi> (<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>); see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18601230-JWC-JAD-01">JWC to <sic>JD</sic><corr>JAD</corr>, [<sic>ca. <date when="1860-12-27">27 Dec. 1860</date></sic><corr><date when="1860-12-30">30</date> or <date when="1860-12-31">31 Dec. 1860</date></corr>]</ref>.</note></p>
<p>Well! this M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant has had sorrow enough, thro&#x2019; family losses;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the previous seven years, Oliphant&#x2019;s parents, her husband, and two of their children had died.</note> and finds it dreadfully irksome to cobble together Fictions, with her heart full of sad truths; and a Book of Edward Irving&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; one of Irving&#x2019;s several books, which were mostly on religious subjects.</note> having fallen in her way, and &#x201C;taken great hold of her&#x201C;, (as certain Books and certain people <hi rend="italic">do</hi> take hold of one, <hi rend="italic">sometimes</hi>) the idea came in her head to write (since she must write <hi rend="italic">something;</hi> for her own and her childrens bread) a <hi rend="italic">Life of Edward Irving;</hi> of whom, be it understood, she knew absolutely nothing except the Book she had chanced to read!!</p>
<p>Her first steps in informing herself for the task conducted her to <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> for the rest an entire stranger! and were I as fond as Major Davidson of lecturingon&#x2014;&#x201C;the Rifles&#x201C;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610415-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, [ca. <date when="1861-04-15">15 April</date>]</ref>.</note> here would have been a fine opportunity! as in all <hi rend="italic">my</hi> reminiscences of Edward Irving, <hi rend="italic">Myself</hi> plays a distinguished part! But I have either less egotism than the dear Major, or more wit to hide it! and so those &#x201C;details&#x201C; about Edward Irving, which my own memory could supply, have been either wholly refused or given on condition they shouldn&#x2019;t be <hi rend="italic">printed.</hi></p>
<p>At the same time this M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Oliphant interests me; and for all reasons I wish well to the &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Life</hi>&#x2019;<hi rend="italic">;</hi> and would gladly help her with it, in any way short of&#x2014; <pb id="pg-37-160" n="37:160"/>lecturing on <hi rend="italic">The Rifle!</hi>&#x2014; And so; I have given her introduction to such persons known to me, and still living, as could throw any light for her on Edward Irving&#x2019;s character and fortune  In making out my first list of these, it didnt occur to me to mention yourself. It was only two days ago that in answering a new letter of questions from the Lady, I gave her <hi rend="italic">your</hi> name and address; as Edward Irvings cleverest Pupil at Haddington, and so, likely to have kept a grateful and affectionate remembrance of him. I told her, moreover, that as you went often to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (where she is, for the present) I was sure a meeting might be arranged between you if she wished it; and that I would bespeak your attention for any proposal she might make you.</p>
<p>This then is my present business; to bespeak your polite attention and some fraction of your valuable time, for this Lady, if she should address herself to you. Which will depend I suppose on how far she has got in the <hi rend="italic">Life.</hi></p>

<p>Before going out for my &#x201C;midnight walk of contemplation&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:372).</note> (literally a daily or rather nightly fact here), I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write you a word,&#x2014;as I have long been intending to do! You can have no idea how I am tied up and tumbled about; and have, in very fact, for long periods, no hard opportunity of even five minutes to myself. All day long it is a slaving and a puddling (such work as I never was at before), then instantly a riding till I am dead weary; then a try for <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> (often successful, in a quietish place I have contrived; a cape, a rug, and your quilt covering the body of me, an old wide-awake <hi rend="italic">lightly</hi> my head, and all made perfectly <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>); out of this, perhaps towards 7 p.m., I am roused to eat my bit of dinner; after wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> there is weariness, languor, and if I try the least writing <hi rend="italic">headache,</hi> till tea, after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> things are to be <hi rend="italic">read</hi> (now &#x26; then a blockhead stumbling in to hinder me altogether); in short, in a trice, it is 11 o&#x2019;clock, and I am ordered out to the streets (very poor at <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> mostly, the thing a heavy task &#x26; necessity to me); then a tumbler of hot milk, a pipe of &#x2019;bacco; and, if I am wise, <hi rend="italic">off</hi> to bed again,&#x2014;to sleep if I can; and recommence the same dull round next day! One day I shall get out of it; God knows I am very weary of it; weary, weary!&#x2014; And, just at present, for 10 days past and perhaps 4 or 5 to come, I am in a welter of <hi rend="italic">bad Proofsheets</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is like to drive me desperate! No more of it. I struggle on with my best ability, &#x201C;faint yet pursuing&#x201C;; and cannot hope to get free till after a good long while.</p>

Walter W.

The ink is darker than TC&#x2019;s usual ink of this time. Other identical versions of the letter exist at Columbia Univ., Duke Univ., Univ. of Manchester Inst. of Science and Technology, and in private hands. One is possibly the original, the others having been reproduced from it for J. M. Moir to use in various applications; other copies may also exist.</sourceNote><head>

<p>I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr J. M. Moir,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Macrae Moir (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>), journalist; b. and educ. in Scotland, he had moved to London <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; for TC&#x2019;s previous recommendations, see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531013-TC-WM-01"><sic>28:289</sic><corr>TC to WM, <date when="1853-10-13">13 Oct. 1853</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540117-TC-TB-01"><sic>29:23</sic><corr>TC to TB, <date when="1854-01-17">17 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>. He was ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Times,</hi> <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>, the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated News of the World,</hi> <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>, and the <hi rend="italic">People&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>, and wrote extensively for provincial dailies. Moir became sec. of the Scottish Corporation, a charitable inst. for impoverished Scots in London, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>.

A man, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess, capable of much labour, and of doing it in a faithful, energetic and efficient manner. Of his private habits, and and<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> modes of working and living I have heard nothing that was not favourable.

If Carlyle&#x2019;s candidate got the post, he can have enjoyed it only for the last year of the paper&#x2019;s existence&#x201C; (Blackie 121). Possibly the <hi rend="italic">Scottish Guardian</hi> (Glasgow, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-12-00">Dec. 1861</date>), as Blackie suggests, otherwise unidentified; it was not necessarily a Scottish paper, since Moir lived in London.</note> of solid basis and solid aims I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> consider him a man of superior likelihood.</p>

<p>How provoking that you should be out of the way when your little Margaret<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Sullivan who came to work at Cheyne Row in early <date when="1861-06-00">June</date>.</note> is hearing of &#x201C;something to her advantage&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phrase from newspaper advertisements.</note>&#x2014;which needs your presence to bring it to a bearing!</p>
<p>I should like to take her to <hi rend="italic">myself,</hi> to make a cook of her; if only I were as well satisfied on some points, as I am pleased with her bright kindly looks. and you alone whose knowledge of her I could trust, are gone nobody knows where, doing nobody knows what; the only thing stated for certain about you being, that you are not expected in Mount Street<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cooke lodged at 47 Mount St.</note> for yet two weeks.</p>
<p>You will infer that my &#x201C;establishment&#x201C; is in a state of crisis, from this renewed idea of taking Margaret, and if I have spoken to you about Charlotte of late months (I forget whether I have) you will not be much surprised. The short and long of it is, a Devil seems to have got into that girl, and I am parting with her&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">This</hi> time for good. The end has been hastened by my poor white Sarah having fallen into a state of ill health that necessitates her going into the country, to her Parents, to be nursed  She has been ill &#x201C;for five months&#x201C; it seems! and concealed it from me&#x2014;but told them of it &#x201C;at home,&#x201C; and they have written to bid her return. I am excessively sorry. for a most perfect little servant, and better conducted girl in every way I never had in my house&#x2014; And the only thing I ever missed in her viz: <hi rend="italic">sensibility,</hi> has come out unexpectedly strong on this occasion of having to give up her place. Sarah having to be replaced then; I could not with any prospect of a good result put another <hi rend="italic">young</hi> girl <hi rend="italic">beside Charlotte</hi>&#x2014;as it isn&#x2019;t to be believed young girls as impassive to bad example as Sarah are so common that I should have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> in succession! And the end of my <hi rend="italic">considerings</hi> has been a final explanation with Charlotte and decision that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> should go also.</p>
<p>The very day this <hi rend="italic">came off,</hi> Geraldine happened to tell me she had &#x201C;called at Mount Street,&#x201C; and that Margaret had told her she was finally determined to get &#x201C;out of that,&#x201C; and wanted a place.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Geraldine Jewsbury wrote to Walter Mantell, <date when="1861-06-24">24 June</date>: &#x201C;You will be glad &#x26; Ellen will rejoice to hear that Margaret is at Cheyne Row safe &#x26; sound&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it required as much trouble to get her away from 47 Mount Street as it did of old to rescue a Princess from enchantment&#x2014;the old woman was very unwilling to lose her&#x2014;&#x26; <hi rend="italic">wailed</hi> extremely&#x2014;Mrs Carlyle gives a good report of her&#x2014;she likes her&#x2014;&#x26; says she has not had such a <hi rend="italic">cleaner</hi> since she left Scotland but of course Margaret wants <hi rend="italic">training</hi> to good company manners&#x201C; (MS: Mantell). Ellen Sullivan was Margaret&#x2019;s sister, currently in Mantell&#x2019;s service. The &#x201C;old woman&#x201C; of 47 Mount St. was Rebecca Pullen (b. ca. <date when="1799-00-00">1799</date>); Margaret was the only servant according to the <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> census; in addition to Cooke, there were three other boarders, a prof. of singing, a governess, and an actress.</note> I remembered the agreeable impression <pb id="pg-37-164" n="37:164"/>the girls looks made on me the day I took up the pipes. and again wondered as I had wondered then &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">could</hi> she <hi rend="italic">cook</hi> any at all? or could she so much as <hi rend="italic">learn?</hi> and I went up today to ask. She told me she could &#x201C;broil chops fry fish, boil fish, and make <hi rend="italic">a sort</hi> of bread puddings&#x201C;&#x2014; Now that aint much, especially for people who hardly ever eat fish! Still it is a point to start from, more hopeful than total ignorance&#x2014;and more than Charlotte knew when I began with <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">If</hi> she has a head to <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> is the question.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Two days ago I tried to write, but made little out; tonight, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> anything else come, I will throw you a word off.</p>
<p>I am still overhead in bad Proofs; bad, tho&#x2019; not &#x201C;horrible&#x201C;: we are approaching the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of Vol iii; it is now 3 weeks since I have got a word <hi rend="italic">written</hi> for Vol iv; and there is but little <hi rend="italic">start</hi> gained there hitherto. I feel as if it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be peremptorily necessary to call halt again at the end of Vol iii, for a couple of months, till I gathered breath. But I have not yet formally spoken of it to Robson. It will depend. I am heartily wearied to the ground; I scarcely think as difficult a job c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be set one as this 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> vol has been,&#x2014;thro&#x2019; every line and fibre of it: ah me! But it is very much <hi rend="italic">better</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not indeed saying much) than I ever tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been made. And <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will not come on me again; thank Heaven! My sleeping is not very bad; yet rather baddish lately; &#x26; within a day or two I begin again to feel something of the old <hi rend="italic">head;</hi>&#x2014;very little of it yet (perhaps not <hi rend="italic">it</hi> at all); but if it start me awake again? I will try to take care it shall not. On the whole, Vol iv will be <hi rend="italic">easier;</hi>&#x2014;I shall end it too (God willing), and then lie down.&#x2014; Chorley<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Rutter Chorley.</note> (to <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> the thing is perfectly <pb id="pg-37-165" n="37:165"/>&#x201C;easy&#x201C;) ardently counsels persistence <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t pause! Ch<hi rend="italic">y</hi> is of small use on the Proofs this time; occupies himself on <hi rend="italic">commas;</hi>&#x2014;chiefly, of late, in protesting against the word &#x201C;rendezvous&#x201C; used as a verb,&#x2014;to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I find no objection, and usually let it stand. Neuberg, who is not very well, and is interested in his own Translator work, gives me no great help either,&#x2014;very swift and very <hi rend="italic">slim</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the sense of &#x201C;scanty.&#x201C;</note> in anything he gets of mine:&#x2014;poor soul, he has stood long true; and his fat members begin to droop at last, no wonder! After all, the whole turns, and must any way have turned, on my standing true to myself. Courage!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have grim N.E. weather; not wholesome, I suppose, tho&#x2019; the temperature suits me better than heat. Since last night the west wind is making a rally (won&#x2019;t prevail yet, I guess), and we have stagnancy of atmosphere, with rain enough to be muddy. The Town is very full; but to me is mostly quite a stranger. One call or two in the week (on <hi rend="italic">foot</hi>-day), and that is enough. Are you for Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> or have you planned at all, for the summer? I suppose you have done with <hi rend="italic">Press-correcting</hi> (a gratuity to Widow Irving,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Irving (see <ref target="volume-37/18610203-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-02-03">3 Feb.</date></ref>), widow of David Irving; John A. Carlyle was editing Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Scotish Poetry</hi> (see <ref target="volume-37/18601119-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-11-19">19 Nov. 1860</date></ref>) and was presumably working on its proofsheets.</note> as I have construed it)? That poor little Fife Lady<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Oliphant, who had been based in Elie, Fife, summer <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>, when she first met the Carlyles and whose mother&#x2019;s family came from Fife.</note> will do no good with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> subject, I doubt.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Last night, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midnight, I got, at the long last, <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of my Proofsheet Slough of Despond,&#x2014;really better than, at one time, seemed even possible;&#x2014;and am <pb id="pg-37-166" n="37:166"/>(unless <hi rend="italic">new</hi> frights arrive tonight again) once more a writing man. Vol iii is actually coming to its end: not what it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be, by any means; but far nearer that than I could have expected. The indescribable, unfathomable and illimitable <hi rend="italic">chaos</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it once was, being known only to myself, I can expect no recognition from other people of the job I have had with it: but that is no matter; if it be <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> and done honestly according to my means, that is a very great blessing to me, and that needs no &#x201C;recognising&#x201C; except where it will not fail of such! Vol iv, I think I said, can hardly be anything like so difficult:&#x2014;but, unluckily, there is very little of it on paper in any form yet! There is no doubt I have a tough wrestle still ahead in that quarter before getting quite out!&#x2014; &#x2014;I have not yet laid any fixed plans: but the general intention is, to stand by the <hi rend="italic">bench</hi> and <hi rend="italic">toolbox,</hi> if standing can at all be. Thurso invites me cordially again, &#x26; to come off directly; but that will no do for this season, or for any that I can fix.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had visited Sir George Sinclair at Thurso Castle, <date when="1861-08-04">4 Aug.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-09-07">7 Sept. 1860</date>; he did not visit Thurso again; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600905-TC-JWC-01"><sic>36:228</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1860-09-05">5 Sept. 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> I have just ans<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the good Sir George (after five weeks of waiting), that I am not to voyage this year. Annandale itself looks dreary, till I can visit it with the millstone <hi rend="italic">off</hi> my neck. I think vaguely of a two months at Brighton or somewhere on the Coast (furnished house &#x26;c), with Chelsea and Books accessible: there to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in the fine solitude. Brighton <hi rend="italic">sea</hi> &#x26;c were excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> last year, c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I have but secured a quiet sleeping-place.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles visited Brighton 3 to <date when="1860-07-09">9 July 1860</date>; for TC&#x2019;s complaints about his lack of sleep there, see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600705-JWC-CSO-01"><sic>36:145</sic><corr>JWC to CSO, <date when="1860-07-05">5 July 1860</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600724-TC-SGS-01"><sic>150</sic><corr>TC to SGS, <date when="1860-07-24">24 July 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> That surely must be attainable, there or in some similar place.

<p>I got y<hi rend="italic">r Saturday Review,</hi> a very high-sniffing stickish Article, but better worth reading than any rival it has. I send it to Scotsbrig today.

Had there been <hi rend="italic">one</hi> made right, other <hi rend="italic">3</hi> need not have been made at all in this instance! I have not tried the socks; but they give every promise; &#x26; will be put upon their mettle, so soon as I have <hi rend="italic">time</hi> to shift into <hi rend="italic">summer clothing.</hi> The piece of butter, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been in constant requisition ever since it arrived, and is not yet finished, fairly excels any Middlesex specimen we have had; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a singular credit to it, considering that our grass must be 3 weeks ahead of yours. Thanks for all these bits of good things.</p>
<p>I am toiling along on the old terms; rather better, not rather worse: half of the job, and certainly the worst half, is as good as altogether off my hands: that is to say, Vol iii is nearly thro&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">press</hi> itself; and I am daily writing at Vol iv and <hi rend="italic">last,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I always think (fond <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> springing immortal in the human breast!)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I had got y<hi rend="italic">r Humboldt</hi> pamphlet<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentifed pamphlet about Alexander von Humboldt (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), Prussian naturalist and explorer.</note> and read it; I was longing much for a Letter when y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Note came on Friday. A right welcome thing to me in my almost total loneliness here. Human society does abound ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, as nowhere else on this Planet, &#x26; at midnight this King&#x2019;s-Road is a Niagara of cabs (not crossable with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> difficulty, except you are bound for or from Cremorne,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pleasure gardens nr.

<p>The <hi rend="italic">change</hi> to summer is usually unfavourable, and has been as good as its wont this year. I hope I am now pretty much across the transition strip; but for the last fortnight I have rather been <hi rend="italic">below</hi> par than above, and had to give up my first attempt (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> must be resumed) to get into riding <hi rend="italic">in the ev</hi>g, &#x26; dining bet<hi rend="italic">n</hi> 3 &#x26; 4.&#x2014; Not that sleep ever went as it did last year (hideous to look back upon!)&#x2014;but I have been very useless at work; &#x26; in fact tho with effort making frightfully little way. Contrary to expectat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> too, a cargo of <hi rend="italic">Slips</hi> yesternight warns me that I shall have a nice fortnight or 3 weeks of tusselling with Book XIV (<hi rend="italic">last</hi> of vol. 3) before it get thro&#x2019; the needle&#x2019;s eye!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Note with Alick&#x2019;s Letter in it was waiting for me when I got back from riding this afternoon. I remain ignorant of the particulars of Alick&#x2019;s Proposal; but the practical outline, as I suppose, of what is immediately to be done is very clear to me.</p>
<p>Seven or eight weeks ago, not knowing what you had written to Alick, nor whether you had written at all, I wrote to him myself, a little Note prompted by my dread of accidents, reiterating, &#x26; confirming as serious and practical, what I had said in a former Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote first to Alexander Carlyle in <date when="1860-04-00">April 1860</date>, then again in <date when="1861-04-00">April 1861</date>; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600413-TC-AC-01"><sic>36:95</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1860-04-13">13 April 1860</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610407-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1861-04-07">7 Aug. [April]</date></ref> (TC misdated the letter).</note> That by way of helping Tom<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s eldest son.</note> to an outfit <pb id="pg-37-171" n="37:171"/>there was money here, any sum not above &#xa3;250, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was intentionally set apart for that object, and wh<hi rend="italic">h he</hi> Alick might himself draw a bill for at any time, in case my great hurries did not permit me to <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> all about it, and to send it, before it sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be needed. This was, and is, the state of matters; as perhaps I explained to yourself also in writing ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it long ago.</p>
<p>There seems to me no trade in the world so little eligible as that of Schoolmaster for poor Tom; nor any so likely as something of the kind wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> appears now to have offered itself,&#x2014;namely, starting as a Farmer, or Tiller of the soil, with a fair chance of becoming Full owner of it by paying in gradual instalments. If the thing therefore is sound, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> on Alick&#x2019;s judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> we must take it to be,&#x2014;I can only desire you, for my own share, to act for me, with all despatch, on the above principle,&#x2014;viz. of &#xa3;250 in whole, or in part, being ready for the object: to you, with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> better information on particulars, coupled with knowledge of y<hi rend="italic">r own</hi> intentions, I must leave wholly to choose <hi rend="italic">what</hi> sum of mine (the whole or the part of that &#xa3;250); but <hi rend="italic">send</hi> at once what you judge right; and whatever you send I will be good for. <hi rend="italic">Tantum sufficuit</hi> [enough is enough].&#x2014; I am worried worse than usual with Proof-slips with &#x26;c &#x26;c; and must so leave it.</p>
<p>I write at some length sunday last; &#x26; put it into &#x201C;the Pillar&#x201C;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pillar boxes had been introduced, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, by Anthony Trollope (<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>; <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>) when he worked as a post office surveyor in the Channel Islands.</note> you do not seem to have got the poor <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> nevertheless;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-37/18610602-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-06-02">2 June</date></ref>, arrived <date when="1861-06-03">3 June</date>.</note>&#x2014;I will beware of Pillars again!

His son Tom wrote in his journal: &#x201C;Uncle[s] Thomas and John were endlessly generous and kind to us in every way. Carlyle, whom so many people, in their ignorance, characterize as harsh, and gloomy and gruff, was nothing short of an inspiration to us, arousing hope, courage, energy and steadfastness. The &#x2018;good&#x2019; Doctor too was one of a million for disinterested kindness, In fact, two such uncles would be hard to find in any age or country for high, noble, loveable qualities&#x201C; (Marrs 597).</note> or some other similarly eligible, Tom will have a fair start in life, and may be looked hopefully upon till we hear to the contrary.

<p>I got the <hi rend="italic">Junior&#x2019;s</hi> kind Note, your kind invitation.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James&#x2019;s son James had apparently written inviting TC to Scotsbrig, as John A.

But I doubt much it cannot be this year; scarcely, if avoidable at all, must I permit myself the thought of Scotland at all again with this horrible job still unfinished. Alas, alas, you never saw anything go on so slow; such are its difficulties,&#x2014;such is the poor remnant of strength for it now left in me. But Courage, Courage: I do hope, by the toil of many months yet, to get it <hi rend="italic">done;</hi> and then&#x2014;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of Burnswark,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Farm in Hoddam parish, Dumfriesshire, previously rented by TC&#x2019;s old friend William Graham. His sister Elizabeth Graham d. <date when="1861-05-21">21 May</date><corr>,</corr> and the tenancy was to be sublet by her nephew George Graham (b. ca. <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier,</hi> <date when="1861-06-11">11 June</date>, advertised the farm to be leased &#x201C;with entry at the present term of Whitsunday. &#x2026; Mr. Graham, the present tenant, will give directions for showing the boundaries of the Lands. &#x2026; [O]ffers will be received &#x2026; till Monday <date when="1861-06-17">17 June</date> next.&#x201C; John A. Carlyle wrote to his nephew James, <date when="1861-06-12">12 June</date>, &#x201C;I hope you may succeed, but [would] be sorry if you got the place at too high a rent. The house is a very good one. &#x2026; Perhaps also you might arrange with Mr Graham to take the furniture at a valuation. It might probably be got cheap in that way, &#x26; would be worth more to you than to any one else&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). John wrote again to James, <date when="1861-06-14">14 June</date>: &#x201C;I, for one, would not venture so large a sum on any land belonging to such people as the Jardines&#x2014;who seem to be guided in letting, as well as in buying their land, by mere commercial views&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). The owner of the land was Andrew Jardine (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">81</date>). James did not get the farm, and John wrote to him, <date when="1861-06-25">25 June</date>: &#x201C;I am sorry to hear that the Farm of Burnswark is let to the Ayrshire man&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086). Burnswark was let to an Ayrshire widow, Barbara McKerrow (b. <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>), with 12 children.</note> and that there are good outlooks of succeeding in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> offer there. It seems a very feasible kind of adventure too, <pb id="pg-37-175" n="37:175"/>were you once in it; a fair hope of Jamie&#x2019;s doing well there. No other spot c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so handy.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burnswark is about 2 mi. (3 km.) NW of Scotsbrig.</note></p>
<p>Don&#x2019;t fret ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the &#xa3;600; Jack says <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will not see you beaten with it;&#x2014;and there is <hi rend="italic">another</hi> of us that now says the like!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Alas, it is striking 3: I have not one other moment.

    <salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
    <p>I got all y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Notes, and duly both the <hi rend="italic">Books;</hi>
      <note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">Probably John A. Carlyle&#x02019;s copies of Ray&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Compleat History</hi> and Henderson&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">History of the Rebellion</hi> (see <ref target="volume-37/18610602-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-06-02">2 June</date>

       for which many thanks. I am not fallen worse than usual, nor has anything sinister occurred to cause my silence,&#x02014;except that (unexpectedly altogether, for I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the vile thing was <hi rend="italic">done</hi>) I have got into such a mess of incurable Proofsheets as beats all example hitherto; and am weltering over head and ears for two weeks past, the most disgusted, bedarkened and uncomfortable of men! I expected to get the essential <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> of the ugly thing finished today,&#x02014;and, alas, I merely puddled deeper and deeper into it, and c<hi rend="italic">d do</hi> nothing at all! I at least write this Note to tell you so before going to bed.</p>
    <p>I think it is very certain there has not for hundreds of years an English Literary man got into so insoluble, unfortunate, and in fact heart-breaking subject:&#x02014;nevertheless I count on still doing it;&#x02014;and even that it will prove <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> the doing (by and by when better knowledge comes), if I can do it well. In the meanwhile, &#x0201C;genius&#x0201D; (if poor I have any genius) &#x0201C;means <hi rend="italic">transcend</hi>t <hi rend="italic">capacity of taking trouble,</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss">TC&#x02019;s own phrase, used in vol. 1, bk. 4 of <hi rend="italic">Frederick;</hi> see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:339.</note>&#x02014;that, alas, and almost that only! I find it so, to my sorrow.</p>
    <p>We have a charming climate here just now; sun of the brightest, wind of the clearest, with due cooling admixture of rain (thundery wet, till 5 p.m. <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day, for example).

    <p>Sir,&#x02014; There is a great deal of public sympathy, and of deeper sort than usual, awake at present on the subject of Inspector Braidwood.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss">James Braidwood&#x02019;s funeral, <date when="1861-06-29">29 June</date>, was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi>
  <date when="1861-07-01">1 July</date>
   : &#x0201C;The hour fixed for the departure of the cort&#x000E8;ge was 3 o&#x02019;clock, but long before that time every avenue leading to Watling-street was blocked by a dense and almost impenetrable crowd, while, the entire length of the route along which it was to pass, every path was thronged, and the windows and even the roofs of the houses crowded. Before 3 nearly all the shops were shut up and at some houses &#x02026; the shutters were closed and the blinds drawn. Every bell from the city churches rang out a funeral peal.&#x0201D; The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi>
  <date when="1861-06-29">29 June</date>
   , pbd. a long description of the fire and details of Braidwood&#x02019;s death, recovery of his body, and the inquest; for the accompanying portrait of Braidwood, see <sic>opp</sic>
  <corr>above</corr>
  .</note> It is a beautiful emotion, and apparently a perfectly just one, and well bestowed. Judging by whatever light one gets, Braidwood seems to have been a man of singular worth in his department, and otherwise; such a servant as the public seldom has. Thoroughly skilled in his function, nobly valiant in it, and faithful to it&#x02014;faithful to the death. In rude, modest form, actually a kind of hero, who has perished in serving us!</p>

The question, therefore, suggests itself,&#x02014;Should not there be a &#x0201C;Braidwood Testimonial,&#x0201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss">Lord Mayor William Cubitt led a committee to organize a subscription on behalf of Braidwood&#x02019;s family.

   , reported the resolution taken at a meeting held at Mansion House, <date when="1861-07-04">4 July</date>: &#x0201C;that in consideration of the high character of the late James Braidwood &#x02026; it is expedient and proper that the regret manifested by all classes should find expression by means of a public subscription, to be applied to the benefit of his six children and two sisters, who have thus been deprived of his protection and support.&#x0201D; But the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1861-08-10">10 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;It was admitted by the committee generally that the endeavour to raise a fund for the object in question had been rendered comparatively abortive, and indeed unnecessary, in consequence of the public announcement that the fire-offices had voted 7000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the widow and family of the deceased, and that his personal property had been sworn by the executors in proving the will as under 5000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. It has, therefore, become desirable to proceed no further in the business.&#x0201D;</note> the proper parties undertaking it, in a modest, serious manner, the public silently testifying (to such extent, at least) what worth its emotion has?</p>
    <p>I venture to throw out this hint, and, if it be acted on, will, with great <pb id="pg-37-179" n="37:179" />satisfaction, give my mite among other people; but must, for good reasons, say further, that this [is]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss">Word omitted.</note> all I can do in the matter (of which, indeed, I know nothing but what everybody knows, and a great deal less than every reader of the newspapers knows); and that, in particular, I cannot answer any letters on the subject, should such happen to be sent me.</p>

    <note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> reported, <date when="1861-07-06">6 July</date>: &#x0201C;It is something to hear the voice of Thomas Carlyle. His utterances are few and far between, but when speech comes from him it has a trumpet sound. Great Tom of Chelsea has just boomed forth a short, powerful letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> advocating a testimonial to the lamented Braidwood. The Lord Mayor has kindly bestirred himself in the matter, and we may anticipate a noble subscription and a worthy monument to the gallant man who fell in the discharge of his duty. &#x02018;True Thomas of Cheyne Walk&#x02019; was, doubtless, ignorant of the fact that the original suggestion for a &#x02018;Braidwood memorial&#x02019; appeared two days after the great fire in a leading article of the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> newspaper; but Mr. Carlyle&#x02019;s advocacy of a worthy object is not the less valuable for having been anticipated.&#x0201D;</note>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have got out of my <hi rend="italic">Proofsheets</hi> again,&#x2014;one always gets out by struggling diligently!&#x2014;and write you a rapid word to say so. There has been, and it came quite unexpectedly, four of<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> five weeks of it; the sorrowfullest of all the quagmires (or almost the sorrowfullest) I had yet plumped into,&#x2014;oh me, oh me, there is no end of them, till the work itself end! But I am out for this bout; and take to writing at Vol IV tomorrow; Vol III now entirely off my hands, nothing but 2 hours or so (more of sport than of labour, on the <hi rend="italic">final revises</hi>) now likely to be required of me there. It is ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 740 pages long,&#x2014;too many by 80 or 100;&#x2014;but it is far <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than i<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> once hoped it could ever be made: adieu to <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> forever and a day. Before this time twelvemonth,&#x2014;surely <hi rend="italic">before,</hi> if I be spared in pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> health, I shall have the unutterable burden tumbled clear off me; and be once more a man like other men!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We have excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> weather here; I do not remember a finer summer than this hitherto. My place is (as at present) <hi rend="italic">sub divo</hi> [in the open air];<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s arrangement in the garden, see <ref target="volume-37/18610624-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-06-24">24 June</date></ref>.</note> far wholesomer, far pleasanter:&#x2014;but you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have seen me yesterday, when the thunder-deluge came on me; and the Water-Butt began spewing and overflowing, upon my paper-clippings, portable library, &#x26;c &#x26;c, in the very heat of the game!&#x2014; &#x2014; I am somehow sorry you did not get a longer spell of Annandale in the fine Summer.

The younger lass is, luckily, a very serviceable honest creature. But all this <hi rend="italic">postpones</hi> Jane&#x2019;s Scotch expedit<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> or pushes it altogether into the vague. We are rather agreeing with the summer, both of us; I sometimes (but hardly dare, since it may be only bile) think myself sensibly better than last year this time.

This Welch girl has, I think, more the shaping of a good cook than of a housemaid.

<p>The present state of affairs however is wretched; for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, <hi rend="italic">being a man,</hi> cannot understand to exact the least bit less attendance, when we are reduced to one servant again, that he had accustomed himself to exact from the <hi rend="italic">two.</hi> so I have all the <hi rend="italic">valeting</hi> and <hi rend="italic">needle-womaning,</hi> and running <hi rend="italic">up</hi> and down to the study for books &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c to do myself&#x2014;besides having to superintend the Welch girl and to go to St Georges (two miles off) almost every day in my life.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Friends of the Patients are allowed to visit them between the hours of Three and Four in the afternoon, Sundays and Wednesdays excepted.&#x201C; Rev.

<p>Mercifully the plentiful rain keeps things cooler and fresher here than is usual in summer&#x2014;and I am nothing like so sick and nervous as I was last year <pb id="pg-37-186" n="37:186"/>at this time. So I am more able to bear what is laid on me&#x2014;to bear amongst the rest the heavy disappointment of having to give up my visit to you&#x2014;and stay here at my post which is a rather bothering one&#x2014;</p>
<p>God bless you&#x2014; It does me good anyhow to think that if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have gone the kind D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and you would have been so kind to me!</p>

<p>Every day since I received your kind little note I have been aiming at writing to you; nay, I was aiming at writing to you <hi rend="italic">before</hi> receiving it. But what I had to say was very different before and after. &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Before</hi>&#x2019;; I had to tell you the hopes and purposes I was entertaining of making a short flight to Dumfriesshire, to which the prospect of fulfilling my engagement of last year, and having a long hearty talk with you at the Gill was no inconsiderable part of the attraction. While &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">after</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;alas! &#x2018;the spirit of my dream&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Byron, &#x201C;The Dream.&#x201C;</note> had undergone a dismal change, and there only remained to tell you of the hopes and purposes I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> entertained, and how there had been an extinguisher clapt on them in the most &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">promiscuous</hi>&#x201C; manner!</p>
<p>The same misluck however, which had so transformed my prospects, has given me so much more than usual to do and think of, that this is literally the first leisure hour I have had for answering your letter since I received it! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C told me [he]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> had written to you that I might perhaps go to Scotland by myself this summer; I don&#x2019;t know whether he told you the circumstances which had made the idea feasible, viz: that in room of Charlotte, who had again gone away in disgrace, and whom I could not have trusted <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to the cares of&#x2014;seeing that she was become much more thoughtless and needed looking after much more than when I first took her, a child of sixteen, four years ago. In room of Charlotte, we had got an elderly [cook?]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> who was so <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> the management of a house and gave one such a delightful impression of trustworthiness, and kindliness, that both he and I felt every thing would go on the same behind my back as when I was here. She had not <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> for hard work <pb id="pg-37-187" n="37:187"/>this woman; but with an active willing <hi rend="italic">Welsh Papist</hi> (!) to help her, (age nineteen) it was trustworthiness, and management more than hard work, that were required of her.</p>
<p>I thought <hi rend="italic">at last</hi> we had<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS starts here.</note> a prospect of a comfortable establishment, for years to come! the two new servants expressed themselves so pleased with their place, and got on so nicely together! And this had lasted just one month; and I had just written to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell that I would fix a time for being at Thornhill, so soon as the new cook had learnt under my superintendence to make the <hi rend="italic">bread</hi> to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s mind; when the Welch housemaid said to me one day: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">If you please</hi> Mam Matilda has got <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a lump on her side!&#x2014; She showed it me but said I was on no account to tell <hi rend="italic">you</hi> about it, for fear of its <hi rend="italic">worritting</hi> you; but I think <hi rend="italic">Mam</hi> you should know.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Of course I should!&#x201C;&#x2014; The next time Matilda came up, I asked what was this about a lump on her side?&#x2014; &#x201C;Not on her <hi rend="italic">side</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">if she might use the liberty to name it, the lump was on her</hi> groin.&#x201C; She showed it me&#x2014;as large as your two hands&#x2014;thro&#x2019; all her clothes! and as hard as stone!&#x2014; Frightened to death, I sent off immediately for my own D<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> He came, and examined her, and told me she had got a <hi rend="italic">rupture</hi> which had become thro&#x2019; long neglect a most alarming affair&#x2014;that I must get her into St George&#x2019;s Hospital the following Wednesday (Wednesday is the one admission day in the week)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A Letter of recommendation is necessary for In-Patients, and must be delivered on Wednesday morning by half-past eleven o&#x2019;clock, and none will be received after twelve&#x201C; (Rev. Albert Alston, <hi rend="italic">How Shall I Get into an Hospital?</hi> [<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>] 34).</note> and by no means miss that Wednesday, for her life wasn&#x2019;t safe for a day!!&#x2014;all next day (Tuesday) I was rushing about, like a Maniac trying to get an order for St George&#x2019;s&#x2014;at last Lady Ashburton, in the absence of her Husband, who is a <hi rend="italic">governor,</hi> but had his orders nobody knew where&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> a line to the Hospital to admit the woman;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Before the Patient can be admitted to the Hospital, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> or <hi rend="italic">she</hi> must attend with a Paper, duly signed by a Governor, and a House-holder&#x201C; (Alston 30).</note> and I was in agony till the last moment lest she should be refused on account of the informality. But it was all right. she was at once consigned to a bed, and if she is ever able to leave it poor soul, it will not they tell me be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">for months</hi>&#x201C;! Every day since but one, I have been back and forward to the Hospital which is two miles off, And then her place <hi rend="italic">here</hi> to be supplied by <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> in the mean time, and then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to be kept from feeling any difference&#x2014;men<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS ends here.</note> never understanding that any difference <hi rend="italic">for the worse</hi> in <hi rend="italic">their</hi> comforts is excusable under <hi rend="italic">any</hi> circumstances! All that complicated with a great dinner party at Bath house last night has kept me in a turmoil. And now there is not the least chance of my getting away&#x2014;unless M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C changes <hi rend="italic">his</hi> purpose to spend the whole summer and autumn under a sheet, at the side of the water barrel! <pb id="pg-37-188" n="37:188"/>The surgeons at the Hospital find that Matildas malady is ulceration of the Spine&#x2014;the rupture being merely part of the spinal complaint. They have put two issues in her back, and &#x201C;if she <hi rend="italic">do</hi> get over it, it will be a very tedious affair&#x201C;&#x2014; To wait for her in this state of things is out of the question. And the best I can see to do is to have my Welch girl trained to be Cook and get a fresh housemaid&#x2014;a thing much easier to get tolerably good than a cook is. I might have a hundred <hi rend="italic">Cooks</hi> before I lighted on one to be <hi rend="italic">trusted!</hi></p>
<p>With a girl under process of training, and a stranger girl coming, who may also perhaps, need training (God knows) you may judge what power I shall have to get away after my own pleasure!</p>
<p>I could sit down and take a good cry about it! I mean about the whole thing! the poor woman so good! and promising to be such a comfort! laid down so suddenly on that hospital bed! a new face and new ways to be made acquaintance with!</p>
<p>New Jeremiads from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C over the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a-<hi rend="small-caps">bo</hi>-minable condition servants</hi>&#x201C; to be listened to! And no dear old Dumfriesshire, nor dear old Dumfriesshire faces to be seen this year either! Oh yes I could cry, if it would make me the least bit happier&#x2014;but it wouldn&#x2019;t! The best thing to do for the moment is to go to bed and try and get a better sleep than I have had for some nights back. Good night dear; I send the kiss, I had ready for you, by post since no better may be. Kind regards to your husband and all of them.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter, and preceding it the <hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> the Dr Irving Pieces (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are very well worth reading, Laing&#x2019;s part intelligently done, and yours):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably John A. Carlyle had sent TC his edition of David Irving&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The History of Scotish Poetry</hi> (see <ref target="volume-37/18601119-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1860-11-19">19 Nov. 1860</date></ref>), pbd. <date when="1861-06-00">June</date>.</note> thanks to you for all those kind bits of remembrance. I am sitting here under my <hi rend="italic">Awning;</hi> and will use a few minutes that I have of interval to answer with a word. This Letter of Jenny&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Hanning.</note> came this morning; and is a new incitement.</p>
<p>I wish you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> write to Jenny poor little soul; and send her some sufficient news of the Annandale affairs she is interested in. She turns the best face out in regard to Canada &#x26; her little Household; and appears really to be struggling on, like the rest of us, on fairly reasonable terms. I will send the <hi rend="italic">Hoddam <pb id="pg-37-189" n="37:189"/>Antiquity</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained but probably connected to John A. Carlyle&#x2019;s query, <date when="1861-07-16">16 July</date>: &#x201C;Did you keep the receipt of the old Hoddam schoolmaster?&#x201C; Probably John Orr, their father&#x2019;s schoolmaster; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 23&#x2013;24.</note> too; I well remembered it last time I wrote; but had laid it so securely up, there was then no finding of it; but it has now come to light again, &#x26; I know its whereabout.&#x2014; Another little bit of business, let me not forget in my hurry: concerning Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> biscuits! It strikes me sometimes there were excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> biscuits procurable somewhere near Hanover Street:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle lived in Hanover St.</note> is that so, and do I only dream it? If that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> so, then pray get me a little bag of them, so many as Aitken can convenient stow into his luggages;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their nephew James Aitken was on holiday in Scotland; John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1861-07-16">16 July</date>: &#x201C;I expect young James Aitken to come here next Saturday &#x26; stay with me till the monday evening&#x2014;on his way back to London&#x201C; and then, <date when="1861-07-23">23 July</date>: &#x201C;James Aitken &#x2026; started last night for London. Biscuits &#x26; a book for you he took with him &#x26; will probably deliver them himself tomorrow or following night.&#x201C;</note> let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> come over hither with them; and they will be a real something to me. My supper is a tumbler of hot milk ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> midnight (stands simmering on a very old Craigenputtock or even Haddington lamp, till I am ready for it);&#x2014;and for <hi rend="italic">biscuit</hi> to it, there is nothing but sandy rubbish, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> a horse w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> reject. I have had in fact to give it up altogether, and take a crumb of bread if anything. <hi rend="italic">Verb. sap. sat.</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Verbum sapienti satis est:</hi> a word is sufficient for a wise person].</p>
<p>Robson gets on very slowly; has still above 40 pages of vol III in <hi rend="italic">revise.</hi> Vol IV is an awful <hi rend="italic">gachis</hi> [mess]; Book I of it just now on hand, and will take a great deal of work. Indeed the whole thing will be one of the toughest in the world; such <hi rend="italic">barking</hi> and hammering, and splitting &#x26; sorting, till the <hi rend="italic">slag</hi> is, in some measure, clear knocked out of it, and a presentable bit of metal (if possible) results! Alas, and my poor old limbs are nothing like so equal to that work as they once were. A fact that; but an irremediable one. Seldom was a poor man&#x2019;s heart so near broken by utter weariness, disgust and long-continued despair over an undoable job;&#x2014;the only point is, said heart must not break altogether, but <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> if it can! I consider myself to be perceptibly <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health than this time twelvemonth; <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in partic<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is nothing like such a &#x201C;horror&#x201C; of a business (really the only thing that quite cows me down) as it then was. I sit under my Canvas here, all days not rainy; a certain <hi rend="italic">Builder</hi> too <hi rend="italic">has fallen bankrupt</hi> over in Oakley Street<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Todd; see <ref target="volume-37/18610607-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1861-06-07">7 June</date></ref>.</note> (one can hardly help thanking Heaven), and there is a <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> as of Elysium in the mornings for a poor wretch seeking rest! I design to stay here; I know not where I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so well. Servants are reinstated again; a new one got from Hampshire (likely y<hi rend="italic">g</hi> lass<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maria Chamberlayne.</note>) instead of the old one in in<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word repeated on turn of page.</note> Hospital, is just come.

The house and paintings more interesting than the curiosities collected. The presence of ladies imparts a charm. &#x2026; Had a long talk with Thomas Carlyle, concerning his travels in Bohemia, his dislike of the Czechs, and the way in which a Czechist landlord cheated him, because the bargain for a wagon had not been put into writing. &#x2026; He said a good walk and book might be made out of Luther&#x2019;s land and special haunts; that the Wartburg is one of the most curious old castles he ever saw. I said I had often wished that he had taken up Luther to write about instead of the Great Frederick. He thought that enough had been written about Dr. Martin Luther&#x201C; (Walter White, <hi rend="italic">The Journals of Walter White</hi> [<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>] 172&#x2013;73).</note> and won&#x2019;t again.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>I was very sorry for myself I could not get out yesterday to lunch with the Infants &#x26; you:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Sandwich rented Harewood Lodge, on the edge of Windsor Forest, 24 mi. (38.5 km.) WSW of London, for later in the summer; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610726-JWC-JC-01">JWC to JC, [<date when="1861-07-26">26 July</date>]</ref>; she usually lived in London at 40 Grosvenor Sq., but was apparently staying elsewhere at the top of a hill, presumably with her younger grandchildren.</note>&#x2014;indeed, as was too evident, had I thought of it, there is no <hi rend="italic">lunching</hi> possible for me at all; the rule being that I dine (what is called dining) here at 3 p.m; then <hi rend="italic">go to sleep</hi> (deliberately); and am roused at 5 by the Horse stamping at the door, &#x201C;Come &#x26; ride me, you lazy fellow, till half past 7, when you shall have <hi rend="italic">tea!</hi>&#x201C; That is the fixed regulation, at this season; Water-Butt and Horse alike inflexible to their times. Nevertheless I hope to get out some evening, and see a glimpse of you before y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> dinner.</p>
<p>Here is a little <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Melesina Trench&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal;</hi> see <ref target="volume-37/18610724-TC-RCT-01">TC to RCT, <date when="1861-07-24">24 July</date></ref>. TC also sent the book to Sir George Sinclair, who thanked him, <date when="1861-09-03">3 Sept.</date>; Sinclair had met many of the people described in the book: &#x201C;The authoress seems to have been a very accomplished, amiable, witty &#x26; discerning person.&#x201C;</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> if you have not seen it, will amuse you for a Couple of Hours; at least I have found it very entertaining. It is by an Irish woman withal; and a very nice clear-eyed creature. I dare say you have seen Trench her Son. If you have seen the <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> too, or be bored by it, forgive me,&#x2014;at least till you come back!</p>
<p>In spite of St. Swithin,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbially, if it rained on St. Swithin&#x2019;s day (<date when="1861-07-15">15 July</date>), it was supposed to rain for the next forty days; John A.

Don&#x2019;t let me bother you to write; but, unless I appear in a day or two, <hi rend="italic">rain</hi> permitting, a couple of words w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very welcome.

<p>There is constant thunder in the air, to begin with; and that keeps me languid and sick. Then M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is in a crisis of proofsheets, such crisises occurring every two or three weeks and lasting two or three days; during which he tears about, wildly seeking scraps of paper, books, letters &#x26;c, which we are all accused of having &#x201C;swept out of existence,&#x201C; and which are finally, after hours lost found <hi rend="italic">under his eyes!</hi> Besides which, everything presented to him to eat at these times is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cold,</hi>&#x201C; or bad, or wrong somehow&#x2014;and in the whole universe there is nothing that is not &#x201C;rapidly going down to perdition&#x201C;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Milton, <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 1:47.</note> awful times! and complicated just now by such a series of household mischances that I begin to turn my eyes towards suicide as the only possible outlet!</p>
<p>The girl who had cooked for M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C these three years back, and &#x201C;knew all his ways&#x201C;&#x2014;took to knowing another person&#x2019;s ways equally well&#x2014;viz: the Devils!&#x2014; &#x2014;and had to be put away. In her place I engaged an elderly widow, of the highest respectability, and experienced not only in cookery but in Life So capable indeed, and trustworthy, and sympathetic, that I felt M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C could be safely intrusted to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> cares, and was going myself to Dumfrieshire for two or three weeks, for &#x201C;a change&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430722-JWC-TC-01"><sic>16:305</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-07-22">22 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;which I am greatly in need of&#x2014;when something came to light about this womans bodily State, which induced me to fetch my D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to her&#x2014;and he told me she must be sent immediately into St Georges Hospital as &#x201C;her life was not safe for twelve hours&#x201C;! <hi rend="italic">There</hi> she has been these three weeks, in the hands of Surgeons, and is not likely to be off her back, for months to come&#x2014; Meanwhile, till <hi rend="italic">her</hi> fate was decided, I had in an elderly married women of the neighbourhood, to do the cooking, and teach the housemaid to do it, in case Matilda could <hi rend="italic">never</hi> return.

And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was always pleased with whatever &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">M</hi>rs <hi rend="italic">Newman</hi>&#x201C; had cooked. Well! If this infatuated woman hasn&#x2019;t gone and chosen the present moment, when I was so in need of her&#x2014;to elope from her Husband and family!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her husband was Samuel Newnham; they had four children, the eldest (who m. <date when="1861-08-31">31 Aug.</date>) was 18, the youngest seven years old.</note> and go to service&#x2014;where her Husband cannot find her!!

<p>In these circumstances of course my project of going to Scotland on my own basis is clean snuffed out&#x2014;and I must struggle on thro the warm weather here where I am, with what strength and spirits I have left which are little enough!&#x2014; For here M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is resolved to remain under an awning in the back court, at least till <date when="1861-09-00">September</date> when we have an invitation to stay a while with old Lady Sandwich at a villa she has taken for two months in Windsor Forrest<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harewood Lodge; see <ref target="volume-37/18610911-JWC-LS-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, <date when="1861-09-11">11 Sept</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I was very glad of your Letter this morning.

God send I were out of this pres<hi rend="italic">t</hi> section of it!</p>
<p>Jane went off this morning to <hi rend="italic">Ramsgate</hi> (on the western Kent Coast ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 50 miles off); along with Miss Jewsbury; for a little breath of sea air,&#x2014;of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> certainly my poor little woman had ample need. She was to have gone yesterday; but &#x201C;had not slept a wink,&#x201C; and absolutely could not take the road. I dissuaded rather this morning still, weather being grey and showery, <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> still but a beggarly account: however, I was not listened to; nor indeed did I much wish it, thinking there might lie hope in the locomotion, in the &#x26;c &#x26;c. Miss J. is herself well; &#x26; serves as an assiduous companion. The place is said to be recommendable for quiet (if you avoid the very margin of the sea, and keep back upon the heights); the air must be of the freshest, and I know the sea for very good. I hope there will be some benefit; I have seen few more feckless looking adventures, nor more saddening to one&#x2019;s spirits, than the driving off of that hackney-cab this morning. I will encourage her to go to Scotland, if this answer at all: but I hardly think she will go,&#x2014;leaving her two maids here still in the half trained condit<hi rend="italic">n,</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; they are good hopeful creatures too.</p>
<p>I did not hear definitely of John&#x2019;s &#x201C;going Southward&#x201C;: if he can stay with you a while at Dumfries, it will be pleasant to think of in his wandering pilgrimage, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> often looks sad to me, it too, from this grim point of vision I now occupy.&#x2014; My 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> volume (about 100 pages too long, but not ill otherwise) is off my hands: and now I stand face to face with vol 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> &#x26; last;&#x2014;a sufficiently hideous and <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> object now that I am close to it. But that has all along been the way. Courage: it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be possible.&#x2014; I am not in worse but better health than last year.

Edward Payson Hammond, graduate of Williams College, Massachusetts, America. After holding a series of remarkable meetings at Annan, he visited Dumfries; and there, day and night, laboured as an evangelist from the 27th of <date when="1861-01-00">January</date> till the <date when="1861-02-15">15th of the following month</date>, drawing such continuous crowds to hear him, and making such an impression upon them, as were truly marvellous. Though much of the effect produced seems to have been transient as &#x2018;the morning cloud and the early dew,&#x2019; the religious public of the Burgh and vicinity cherish a grateful recollection of Mr. Hammond&#x2019;s devoted services, and there is reason to believe that they have been of lasting benefit to many&#x201C; (William McDowell, <hi rend="italic">History of the Burgh of Dumfries</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>] 878).

However the rooms looking on the sea cannot but be freer from noises than those to the back, looking on roofs of houses, stables streets &#x26;c&#x2014;but the bedrooms to the back are much larger, and better aired. With no sensibilities except my own to listen to them with, I can get used, (I <hi rend="italic">think</hi>) to the <hi rend="italic">not</hi> extravagant amount of crowing, and barking, and slamming with the wind, and even to occasional cat-explosions on the opposite roofs! If I cant; I can exchange beds with Geraldine and there I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> only have <hi rend="italic">the noise of the sea</hi> (considerable!)&#x2014;and the possibilities of occasional carriages passing.

<p>Thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> pretty little sheet, as winding up to Breakfast in the bright morning.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I am very glad to hear of you again,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I have been very remiss in writing. I am so chained and <hi rend="italic">hobbled</hi> amid footropes and handropes, and thrums of innumerable kinds! Not in bad health, however; not at all to call in <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> comparatively. There is a marked difference, for instance, from our pluisterings and voyagings in quest of <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> last year this time. And I am sitting here as quiet as if I were in my bed, all day as well as night. By degrees I will get <hi rend="italic">fairly</hi> into vol IV (not quite 3 sheets of it yet <hi rend="italic">off</hi> my hand!),&#x2014;and perhaps shall do better than I expect.</p>
<p>Jane reports good progress of herself at Ramsgate; in spite of such noises, brass-bands, bagpipes, ballad-singers, organ boys, cocks, donkeys as never were. She is to return tomorrow; her sickly <hi rend="italic">nausea</hi> quite gone for the moment &#x26;c: a very fair week&#x2019;s work. We have, and have had, in respect of weather all along, such a summer as I hardly recollect, for salubrity and not tolerability only but agreeableness &#x26; geniality to the human tabernacle:&#x2014;certainly there was nothing equal to it in my London experience  And so solitary it now is; quiet as in Elysium; free room for work (if one had any strength left). I am worst off with <hi rend="italic">unripe</hi> vegetables: nothing but a sop of bread by way of dinner vegetable.</p>
<p>Browning is said to be here; I expect him in an even<hi rend="italic">g</hi> or two. Poor fellow, I <pb id="pg-37-210" n="37:210"/>believe he is very sad ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> his loss of such a Wife:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Barrett Browning had d. <date when="1861-06-29">29 June</date> in Florence.</note> but I believe it may ultimately prove a great gain to him.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had always liked Elizabeth Barrett Browning (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460925-TC-JAC-01"><sic>21:57</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-09-25">25 Sept. 1846</date></corr></ref>), but he believed that Robert Browning, no longer having a sick wife to care for, could now return to England and devote himself to his own work; see <ref target="volume-37/18610817-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1861-08-17">17 Aug.</date></ref></note> If he come to England, and look after his own Tasks while it is yet time!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am not sorry you gave up the Killarney Adventure. The place is very wild and pretty; something touching in its intrinsic beauty, sublimity even, streaked with a kind of Irish squalor.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Killarney, town in County Kerry, SW Ireland; presumably John A.

It is a very manly, true, &#x26; honest letter&#x2014;I think: increasing one&#x2019;s love for Browning.&#x201C;</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we have read, naturally, with very great interest[.] The poor Lady seems to have passed away in a state of perfect peace, unconscious altogether of what was coming; the mildest end that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been provided to a gentle Human Life.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of Browning&#x2019;s letter is missing; the remainder contains a description of Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x2019;s last days. Browning wrote of her death: &#x201C;There was no struggle, no sigh even, only a dreadful suspense for a minute or two&#x2014;then a silence. I thought she had only fainted as her head lay on my arm&#x2014;then there was one least contraction of the brow and Annunziata cried, &#x2018;The blessed Soul has passed away!&#x2019; Why should I not have tried to tell you so much of this as will give you my own one comfort in some degree and not leave you to fancy there was pain, struggling, or the consciousness of departure and separation?&#x2014;She went, like God&#x2019;s child, into his presence with no more apprehension or difficulty than <hi rend="italic">that</hi>!&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">New Letters of Robert Browning,</hi> ed. William Clyde DeVane and Kenneth Leslie Knickerbocker [<date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>] 139).</note> Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a great consolation to <pb id="pg-37-213" n="37:213"/>survivors in their sorrow.&#x2014; I know not whether Browning has yet come to you; I partly expected or hoped to have seen him here; but had no right either,&#x2014;not having written, tho&#x2019; I did not want for matter, or even for intention, but only for a few minutes of composure; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you know are seldom if ever mine, in these sad months and years. Tell him from me to gird himself together out of these sore wrecks of the Past (as indeed I see he is manfully doing);&#x2014;and that I expect a <hi rend="italic">new epoch</hi> for <hi rend="italic">him,</hi> in regard to his own work in this world, now that he is coming back to England at last; and that, in my poor opinion, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have never changed, a noble victory lies ahead for him, if he stand to it while time yet is. This is my fixed thought; and often my greatest sorrow over the &#x201C;woes of Italy&#x201C; has been that a soul like R. B.&#x2019;s was kept weltering, in a <hi rend="italic">hobbled</hi> condition, amid such a mass of thrums and hopeless cobwebs! Assure him of my deep sympathy and true regard, at any rate.

I am convinced that you cannot&#x2014;and I woke the other morning in the midst of a violent argument of which the drift was to show that by attempting it you&#x2019;d not only do wrong to a magnificent piece of work by huddling it up at the close, but would inflict upon yourself all kinds of harassments and worries and troubles still more to be regretted by those to whom nothing that even you can write is so valuable as You.&#x201C;</note> No man, not the weariest of the Greeks before Troy, ever was so weary of a Task wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has fairly broken my heart,&#x2014;and far excels, in disgusting bother, and difficulty and discouragement of every kind, all the work I hitherto had to do in the world. &#x201C;I will <hi rend="italic">gar</hi> myself do it,&#x201C; nevertheless, if I live!

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>We are very glad to hear of you again, definitely at first hand, tho&#x2019; the news is none of the best.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote, <date when="1861-08-09">9 Aug.</date>, from Switzerland, where he was trying to recover his health: &#x201C;The last 5 or 6 months of my life were very sad; the bodily suffering was the least part.&#x201C;</note> I had been continually whipping myself up to the evident duty of <hi rend="italic">inquiring</hi> for what I was anxious ab<hi rend="italic">t;</hi> and probably I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been writing this Sunday at any rate,&#x2014;but it is better on the present terms.</p>

What it will do for me, time must shew; for the present it plagues me considerably.&#x201C;</note> And, one way and another, were it only from change of scene, and influx of new sensations instead of the dreary old, we calculate on getting you back a considerably improved man.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote: &#x201C;tho&#x2019; I am certainly much stronger than I was when I left home, I am not nearly as fresh and elastic as I was on the journey hither, when the mere moving about and change of air seemed to operate like a charm.&#x201C;</note> It will never do for us to break down now!

<p>I have sat out of doors here, under my awning, ever since you left; pulling along at the ropes, but hardly able to stretch <hi rend="italic">them</hi> straight, much less to make any perceptible way! The weather has been bright, but occasionally sultry, always heavy and enervating. To me the want of <hi rend="italic">ripe</hi> vegetables to my meat (unripe being poisonous to me) is always a great drawback at this season. Madam went off, for a week, with Miss Jewsbury, to Ramsgate: never was <pb id="pg-37-215" n="37:215"/>such air, such sea;&#x2014;but also never were such &#x201C;noises&#x201C; day and night, such unsightly cockneyhoods fallen opulent, such&#x2014; In short there was not, for me, the faintest likelihood there; nor elsewhere on the English coasts  My friend the sea must therefore remain a stranger, at present.

<salute>My dear young Woman!</salute>
<p>You have no idea, I am pretty sure, of the numbers of times you have been in my head since you heard any word to that effect! Just the more I don&#x2019;t write to the people I care about, the more I think about them! Latterly, that is for weeks back, a day hasn&#x2019;t passed without my meaning&#x2014;vaguely&#x2014;to write, and ask if there was any chance of my seeing you here, since there was clearly no chance of it elsewhere&#x2014; But I would wait always&#x2014;just another day&#x2014;to see if the question would not be anticipated by a letter from you or a visit! And this half-expectation was not so fantastic as you may think. There had been more than one person from Haddington here,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helena Shortess Ferme and Agnes Catherine Howden, das. of JWC&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s partner, Thomas Howden; see below.</note> at whom I had inquired about you and &#x201C;William Dods,&#x201C; and who had given me an <hi rend="italic">impression</hi> that I should soon see at least him if not both of you in London&#x2014; I say an <hi rend="italic">impression,</hi> because, to get anything like cordial, detailed, satisfactory information, about anybody or anything in old Haddington, that interests <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> by any pressure of questioning a Howden is frankly impossible!&#x2014; It is like squeezing an unripe orange, or a dry sponge. The very tone of voice in which my questions are answered is discouraging and makes me wish I hadn&#x2019;t asked any! What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that <hi rend="italic">dryness</hi> (<hi rend="italic">dreechness</hi>) that repells me so in the Howdens?&#x2014; I feel so glad to see any of them always&#x2014;for the sake of old times&#x2014;I strive to be agreeable to them and to <hi rend="italic">not</hi> take offence at their ungracious ways; and the result is always the same; that they leave me &#x201C;heavy and displeased.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >1 Kings 20:43.</note> Helen is the only one that I <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> to be welldisposed towards me, in spite of her uncouth manners&#x2014; &#x2014;and yet Agnes seems a good brave girl. The way she was bearing that spoiling of her good looks filled me with admiration. Do tell me when you write (you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> write?) if the London surgeon&#x2019;s remedies have <pb id="pg-37-217" n="37:217"/>been of any benefit to her face. It would give me real satisfaction to hear that she had been cured.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Agnes had possibly been disfigured by cholera; they may have been consulting James Startin (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1872-00-00">72</date>), senior surgeon at the Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, Blackfriars, who had a practice at 3 Saville Row, Piccadilly; otherwise unexplained.</note></p>
<p>I never was more astonished in my life than when on opening a large letter some weeks ago there fell out of it on the table a lot of the most atrociously ugly likenesses of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">myself</hi> (!) A letter from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Campbell (&#x201C;who Nurse&#x2019;t Miss Ds at Tenterfield&#x201C;)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Donaldson sisters&#x2019; nurse; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600407-JWC-EDO-01"><sic>36:93</sic><corr>JWC to EDO, <date when="1860-04-07">7 April 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> explained the mystery&#x2014; &#x2014;or, rather didn&#x2019;t explain it! for the wonder remained, how came the horrid things <hi rend="italic">into</hi> &#x201C;her box&#x201C;?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hear never a whisper of the London Donaldsons; which is a comfort!&#x2014; so far as it goes! It is curious how people may live in this London, as separated by their several &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">circles</hi>&#x201C; as tho&#x2019; the whole Atlantic lay between them!</p>
<p>I was very near going to Scotland this month,&#x2014;to Dumfrieshire; that is, I had taken a wild longing to go, and made up my mind to leave M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, (since he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> live on here, all thro&#x2019; the hot weather, writing away under an awning in the back court) to be cared for by a new Cook I had got, who inspired me with a most comfortable trust in her good sense, and kindliness, and delicate management; but the very day after I had written to my friend at Thornhill that I would come; this Woman who I was hoping to <hi rend="italic">retire upon</hi> as &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a Treasure</hi>&#x201C; for the remaining term of my earthly housekeeping was discovered to be <hi rend="italic">privately</hi> at death&#x2019;s door with an abcess in her back! had to be removed to St Georg&#x2019;es Hospital, where she is still, after about two months; and, instead of getting to Scotland, I had to spend my life in teaching the housemaid to <hi rend="italic">cook,</hi> and running backwards and forwards to the Hospital; till I fell so ill with it that I had to take a week of rest from my household worries, <hi rend="italic">at all costs and risks,</hi> and a breath of sea air&#x2014;which saved me I think from a nervous fever</p>
<p>I spent this <hi rend="italic">sacred week</hi> at Ramsgate, the nois[i]est<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> most odious place!, but such air!&#x2014; I was terrified that I should find on my return your cards or your Husbands card on my table but there was no such thing Do please put me out of this suspense. The more, that I am going soon with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C on a visit, which may last two or three weeks, if he finds he can work there&#x2014; It is no further than Ascot&#x2014; So I could come up home any day, for the sight of an old friend if any was forthcoming</p>
<p>All good be with you and <closer><salute>yours affl<hi rend="italic">y</hi> &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>J W Carlyle</name></p>

<p>I suppose, having heard nothing from you, that you are still in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and that you did not go to No[r]th<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> Berwick or anywhither. One is <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> of all in a Capital City during, these autumn times, really; and the <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi> [slothful life] tempts one more and more. London is emptier than I almost ever saw it; the weather, tho&#x2019; it has been generally dry and even bright, &#x26; occasionally for a couple of days very hot,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> noted, <date when="1861-08-14">14 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;The greatest heat in the sun was 135 deg. on Monday [12]&#x201C; and the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi> reported, <date when="1861-08-17">17 Aug.</date>, &#x201C;110 deg. F. in the sun and 95&#x2013;97 in the shade, a heat almost unprecedented in this century.&#x201C;</note> has not agreed with me quite as the summer did; and I am getting on with my Fourth Vol. even worse than I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have expected. Oh what a deliverance if I can really hold out till next year, and be rid of <hi rend="italic">it</hi> forever and a day! I do struggle; but with years got to the height of mine (and perhaps the want of <hi rend="italic">ripe vegetables</hi> to boot!) it is uphill work. Courage; silence!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have often been thinking whether you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be tempted to a sail up to London, while there is still sun in the sky. It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> blow the dust out of you better than most things; and might be a useful interlude between this and winter? If you could resolve on it, there is always a vacant room here; and there are now <hi rend="italic">two</hi> handy maids, no difficulty about waiterage;&#x2014;also Jane has been spoken to;&#x2014;and in short for a couple of weeks, or till you tired, there is nothing to hinder but yourself; and <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I hope is not too strong. There ought not at this point of time to be <hi rend="italic">years</hi> of interval between our meetings, so few years now by nature remaining. I bid you seriously think of this;&#x2014;and have delayed writing specially ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it too long.</p>
<p>Some time &#x201C;early in <date when="1861-09-00">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>&#x201C; we are to go out for a week or an indefinite time to Windsor or Ascot quarter: the good old Lady Sandwich (above 80 now, tho&#x2019; full of spirit) has taken some villa out there,&#x2014;very pretty little House she says;&#x2014;and insists that we shall go, &#x201C;Horse Fritz and all,&#x201C; &#x201C;dine when you like&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c. Principally with a view of breaking up the stagnancy here, we have consented.&#x2014; It need not interrup[t]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> were you even here: it is so near hand for coming &#x26; going; and the two maids w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take good care of you. Jane tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> she got real good of Ramsgate, &#x201C;air so elastic, sea so &#x26;c&#x201C;: but the noises, and vile opulent vulgarities, fat <hi rend="italic">Jewhoods,</hi> Cockneyhoods &#x26;c were such, that she c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not propose it to me at all. She has given up Scotland, restricts herself to this bit of Ascot &#x26; Windsor Forest.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-219" n="37:219"/>Three O&#x2019;clock is striking! You may read the Neuberg Letter, and light y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> pipe with it. But here is another special thing.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for the bright little Note you flung me from Blair Athol;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton wrote, <date when="1861-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, from Blair Athole (now Atholl), Perthshire (about 35 mi. [56.5 km.] NNW of Perth): &#x201C;We have arrived here safely, &#x26; are posting up the Highland road most happily with babe in romping spirits, growing brighter &#x26; stronger &#x26; heavier &#x26; taller every hour.&#x201C;</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was abundantly welcome here. We guessed well enough why you had not seen us; and what a miserable confusion that of poor Mason must have been.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mason (ca. <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>), Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s valet, had killed himself. Lord Ashburton wrote: &#x201C;We grieved much to miss seeing you in London during our 36 hours there spent but the disaster of Mason&#x2019;s death had so embroiled the accounts, &#x26; had such a remodelling of household arrangements to provide against the recurrence of past disorders then for the first time revealed to me in all their extent, that we had no time.&#x201C;</note> I have not been so shocked with anything for a long time. Jane, last time we were at Bath House, had been remarking to me what a desperate and gloomily deadly look the poor fellow wore;&#x2014;and the next news had of him was this <pb id="pg-37-221" n="37:221"/>of the finale! In spite of his bitter temper, I had always found poor Mason, in my outside experience of him, one of the most respectable men I had ever met of his station;&#x2014;a man now who has become permanently tragical to me. My guess is, the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> bend sinister in his character and course had been at that point, long since, when he found that (for valid reasons) he was never to reach Butlership;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; butler was George Maynard (b. ca. <date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>).</note>&#x2014;&#x201C;ambition thwarted&#x201C; is sore in a violent heart;&#x2014;like Dean Swift,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jonathan Swift (<date when="1667-00-00">1667</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26833"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), writer; dean of St. Patrick&#x2019;s Cathedral, Dublin.</note> whom Fate and the Duchess of Somerset had forever forbidden to be a Bishop!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Seymour (<date when="1667-00-00">1667</date>&#x2013;<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>; <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi>), duchess of Somerset; courtier and politician.

Samuel Johnson in <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Poets</hi> (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1781-00-00">81</date>) said that this referred to Swift&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">A Tale of a Tub</hi> (<date when="1704-00-00">1704</date>). In the &#x201C;Apology&#x201C; for <hi rend="italic">A Tale of a Tub</hi> (5th edn.; <date when="1709-00-00">1709</date>), Swift made reference to high churchmen disapproving of the work. But the cause may have been Swift&#x2019;s personal attack on the duchess of Somerset in the lampoon entitled &#x201C;The Windsor Prophecy&#x201C; (<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>).

This was confirmed by an expression that fell from his brother (whom he had stripped of &#xa3;140). The brother s<hi rend="italic">d</hi> he almost felt relieved when he heard that he was dead. He had always been haunted by the fear of some more awful catastrophe. &#x2F; The last act was brought on by the pursuit of creditors who dogged his steps, by his inability to make up the &#xa3;200 which proved afterwards to be owing on his book to me; and the receipt of a note of w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> no trace was ever found as he returned at 11 pm on the fatal night. I feel myself guilty. I trusted him with too much money, I humoured his madness; I allowed him to set all other authority but mine at defiance in the house to do no work in short of any kind but for my personal service.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>We flatter ourselves you are all safe in Brahan Castle; and that Rous&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">reports</hi> are still equally flourishing (from Baby upwards, everybody somewhat well);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton wrote: &#x201C;Rouse daily dogmatically examines &#x26; reports on each.

Our weather by report is superior to yours; nothing of rain here, tho sometimes grey and tempestuous; latterly rather cold, with a smell almost of <date when="0000-10-00">October</date> in it, and a suggestion of looking out for winter hosiery again.

But I know you have been in such <hi rend="italic">depths</hi> yourself occasionally, and will have sympathy with me,&#x2014;instead of being contemptuous or angry, as your strong-minded able-bodied women would be&#x2014;and accordingly strong-minded able-bodied women are my aversion, and I run out of the road of one as I would from a mad cow!&#x2014; The fact is, had there been nobody in the world to consider except myself, I ought to have &#x201C;carried out&#x201C; that project I had set my heart on of streaming off by myself to Holme Hill&#x2014;and taking a life-bath, as it were, in my <hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> native air, in the scene of old affections, not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> past and gone, but some still there as alive and warm, thank god, as ever! and only the dearer for being mixed up with those that <hi rend="italic">are</hi> dead and gone.&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Thursday [<date when="1861-08-29">29 August 1861</date>]</p>
<p>I was interrupted at this point, and could not find a quiet hour on Tuesday to resume my letter&#x2014;and yesterday morning brought your letter&#x2014;making what I had written out of place&#x2014;but I send it to show you that I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> writing voluntarily&#x2014;tho&#x2019; a second letter from you puts more <hi rend="italic">go</hi> into the voluntariness.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-37-223" n="37:223"/>Ah my Dear, your kindness goes to my heart, and makes me like to cry&#x2014;because I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> do as you bid me!</p>
<p>My Servants are pretty well got into the routine of the house now, and if M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C were like other men he might be left to their care for two or three weeks without fear of consequences! But he is much more like a spoiled Baby than like <hi rend="italic">other men!</hi> I <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> him alone, for a few days, when I was afraid of falling seriously ill unless I had change of air. Three weeks ago I went with Geraldine Jewsbury to Ramsgate one of the most accessible sea-side places, where I was within call, as it were, if anything went wrong at home; but the letter that came from him every morning was like the letter of a <hi rend="italic">Babe in The Wood!</hi> who would be found buried with dead leaves by the Robins if I didn&#x2019;t look to it! So even if Ramsgate hadn&#x2019;t been the horridest, nois[i]est<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> place where I knew nobody, and had nothing to do, except swallow sea air&#x2014;(the best of sea air indeed)&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t have got staid there long enough to make it worth the bother of going.</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> thought in going there, that if he got on well enough by himself, for the few days, I might take two or three weeks later and realize my hearts wish after all. But I found him so out of sorts on my return that I gave it up&#x2014;with inward protest and appeal to posterity! Again a glimmer of hope arose. Lady Sandwich had taken a Villa on the edge of Windsor Forrest, for a month and invited us to go with her there. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is very fond of that old Lady, partly for her own sake and partly for the late Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s (her daughter)&#x2014; He can take his horse with him there, and his books, and if he miss his sleep one night, he can come straight home the next! So on the whole, after much pressing, he consented to go, And the idea came to me, if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> were all right <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> mightn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">I</hi> slip away meanwhile to <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> Before however it had been communicated, he said to me one day; &#x201C;What a poor shivering nervous wretch I am grown! I declare if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> weren&#x2019;t to be there to take care of me, and keep all disturbance off me, nothing would induce me to go to that place of Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s, tho&#x2019; I dare say it is very necessary for me to go somewhere.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Humph! very flattering! but very inconvenient!&#x2014; And one can&#x2019;t console oneself at my age for a present disappointment, with looking forward to next year&#x2014;one is no longer so sure of one&#x2019;s next year!</p>
<p>One thing I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do and you can do&#x2014;we can write oftener. It is a deal nicer to speak face to face from heart to heart&#x2014; But we might make our correspondence a better thing than it is if we prevented the need of beginning our letters so often with an apology for silence.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your news. Every little detail about Thornhill people and things is interesting to me&#x2014; And oh many many thanks for your kind messages to us all&#x2014; God bless you Dear&#x2014;and love to the Doctor. &#x2F; <closer><salute>affectionately</salute></closer> <name>Jane W Carlyle</name></p>

<p>If I believe in one human will having power over another even thro&#x2019; some miles of other human beings?&#x2014;if I believe in Spiritual Mag[n]etism?&#x2014; Most assuredly! I believe in it absolutely and entirely!

<p>For the rest; I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> wish to see you; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> wish to hear from you; <hi rend="italic">do</hi> love you; (you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that; why make me <hi rend="italic">say</hi> it?)

<p>I have the strangest thing to tell you about your flowers!

I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> somehow&#x2014;knew as assuredly as if I had taken them out of your hand&#x2014;that those flowers <pb id="pg-37-226" n="37:226"/>were from <hi rend="italic">you!</hi> My maid, in entering the room with them said&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> from Mr Ruskin I think mam!&#x2014;at least it isn&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">his</hi> man that brought them.&#x201C; &#x201C;No&#x201C; I said as if I had known of their coming &#x201C;they are from Miss Cushman.&#x201C; And I knew the note was from <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> before I had looked at the signature or read a word of it!

<p>We are for the Windsor Country, Thursday coming (3 days hence).

Lady Sandwich, who is our Hostess, writes today that the place is airy, pretty, all very good, but afflicted &#x201C;with bats, gnats and wasps.&#x201C; Let me give you the Address:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Harewood Lodge &#x2F; Sunning Dale &#x2F; Staines&#x201C; (Countess Dowag<hi rend="italic">r</hi> of Sandwich&#x201C; may go on the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Letter, if you write soon).</p>
<p>I calculated on <hi rend="italic">riding</hi> out (Railway from Waterloo takes only an hour, but there are 2 miles driving at <hi rend="italic">each</hi> end); and had a great notion of my &#x201C;fine rides in Windsor Forest&#x201C;: but, alas, the other night, Horse Fritz fell into an absurd accident with his neighbour in the next stall; they broke their halters, got both into one stall, and were found fighting in the morning, with neck and shoulders all bitten! My poor Fritz, I have little doubt, must have been passive, or if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> invaded, it c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> only be with friendly intentions (poor quadruped): but, his neck all blue and lumpy, he was a shocking fellow on the sudden, and went very ill withal, every step <hi rend="italic">hurting</hi> the bitten parts: in short he was such a fright, I had him turned out to grass (a field here, where they give him corn too), and since Thursday I have no Horse! Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is going to be a considerable disappoint<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> If I find the neck quite <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> again, even with <hi rend="italic">defect</hi> of hair, I may be tempted to take him after all. We shall see on Thursday.&#x2014; The weather here is, and gen<hi rend="italic">lly</hi> has been, admirable for Harvest work. Bid them all good speed (the excellent kind souls!) at Scotsbrig.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>We are coming tomorrow as per contract; and intend to be, at least Jane does with <hi rend="italic">both</hi> the luggages, at the Sunning Dale Station,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sunningdale, small town about 1&#xBD; mi. (2.5 km.)

<p>As for me, I am, after all, thinking to come on horseback! My unfortunate Fritz, who gratefully salutes y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ladyship, has to the eye become a perfect fright,&#x2014;Jane w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> explain to you by what accident. He has been shoe-less, out at grass, for a week; I had him brought in today, for a look at him: he is ten times uglier than ever (has been <hi rend="italic">rubbing</hi> himself on posts &#x26;c), and in fact I have never seen a handsome fellow fallen so out at elbows on the sudden,&#x2014;more like a costermonger&#x2019;s horse, than a respectable Philosophical Historian&#x2019;s!&#x2014; &#x2014; However, as the poor creature has intrinsically all his old speed, strength and willingness, and may be of immense convenience to me in your woody solitudes &#x26; interesting localities, I almost (or altogether?) decide to bring him, all the same;&#x2014;and shall arrive most probably by <hi rend="italic">Staines Bridge</hi> (a pretty ride of 20 miles or so, if all go well); and (I should think) most probably too <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the Better Half&#x2019;s arrival.&#x2014; &#x2014; I do not design to be heavy on <hi rend="italic">work</hi> while we are with you: fresh air, riding, walking, driving ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> under the fresh sky, will be perhaps a better investment of my industries and your kindnesses,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I will bring something, too, for odd hours, and to keep my hand in use. At present (Proofsheets &#x26;c up to the chin, and time n<hi rend="italic">r</hi> done) I am in vast hurry, and need not keep you by the Apron-string any longer.</p>

<salute>Respected Sir,</salute>
<p>I hope you are well!&#x2014; And happy in your mind; which is indeed nine tenths of everything!&#x2014; And I hope you are still intending to come to London in <pb id="pg-37-231" n="37:231"/><date when="1861-10-00">october</date>; and that I shall have the joy of seeing you there again&#x2014;you and Her!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Dods.</note>&#x2014; Bless you!, there are so few joys in the world now (don&#x2019;t you remark that?) and so little power of <hi rend="italic">enjoying joy</hi> when one has a chance at it! no wonder if I hold much to the prospect of seeing any one, that can still make my heart beat with a certain enthusiasm!</p>
<p>I shall be at Home in another week or ten days I expect;&#x2014; If anything should send you South sooner than the time your Wife mentioned; send me word to this address. The distance is not so great but that I could go up to Chelsea for a day, on purpose to not miss you.&#x2014; Do you ever <hi rend="small-caps">dream</hi>? I do, indefatigably! and I have got into the way of regarding dreams as&#x2014;not prophetic, I am not quite credulous enough for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;but as to a certain extent, suggestive and monitory! I think that <hi rend="italic">good</hi> sleep calms down and clears ones ideas, so that one&#x2019;s dreams, in spite of their insane incoherency are sometimes worth minding, as being further sighted than one&#x2019;s waking thoughts&#x2014;</p>
<p>Now I dreamt last night, without the slightest apparent connection with anything that had been occupying me the preceding day,&#x2014;without, to say the truth, my having, to the best of my remembrance, so much as once thought of you that day!&#x2014;that I was standing with you at the stile in <hi rend="italic">B&#x2019;abbies Butts,</hi> and saw you drawing a mathematical figure on one of my (<hi rend="italic">present</hi>) visiting cards&#x2014;And while standing there the <hi rend="italic">Babbies Butts</hi> stile changed itself, more insensibly than any &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Dissolving View</hi>&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pictures produced on a screen by a magic lantern, one gradually disappearing while another appears.</note> ever did, into a gate in <hi rend="italic">Battersea Fields</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Battersea Fields, common land on the S side of the Thames, opp. Chelsea; in their early years in Cheyne Row the Carlyles often walked there (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400823-TC-JAC-01"><sic>12:229</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1840-08-23">23 Aug. 1840</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430707-JWC-JW-01"><sic>16:240</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-07-07">7 July 1843</date></corr></ref>); by the mid-<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>s it had become notorious as a site for illegal racing, gambling, and drinking; see also <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:242</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-13">13 April 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> on which, when I first lived in London, I used to <hi rend="italic">swing</hi> (!!) <hi rend="italic">when nobody was in sight!</hi>&#x2014; And I looked up at your face in a perplexed frame of mind; and was still further perplexed by finding it your <hi rend="italic">young face!</hi>&#x2014;the face that owned the white cotton stockings!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610429-JWC-WDO-01">JWC to <sic>WD</sic><corr>WDO</corr>, <date when="1861-04-29">29 April</date></ref>.</note> But I was perfectly well aware that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> face wasn&#x2019;t the same that borrowed the stockings, and while I was making a great mental effort to <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> and reconcile things; a Railway train swept past, and I <hi rend="italic">knew,</hi> without having seen how, that you had gone in one of the carriages! And we hadn&#x2019;t exchanged words, and that was all; and I awoke in a state of vexation. And therefore it is that I write today to tell you where I am and for how long. So guard against the disappointment which my dream put into my head as not unlikely if I didn&#x2019;t take care. Love to your wife&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I had a short Note from the Doctor two days ago, and some hopes of another, or two others one from you &#x26; another from him, neither of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter have come. I suppose probably you have lost my exact address: I learned from the little that already came, what was important, that you are all in your usual way of welfare,&#x2014;nothing worse among you than wet weather, and hagglings with the tail of Harvest.</p>
<p>We came out here exactly this day (Thursday) gone a week: Jane went by railway, taking all the luggage; it is about an hour and ten minutes by a good train till you land within two miles of this. I <hi rend="italic">rode</hi> out, <hi rend="italic">took</hi> my horse after all in spite of the accident wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he had met with to his skin; I had a good day, and a pleasant Country, the last twelve miles of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were new to me; on the whole both horse and I did very fairly, tho&#x2019; it took <hi rend="italic">us</hi> 4 or 5 hours, and I had a great difficulty <hi rend="italic">spiering</hi> my way after I got into the Forest. It is such a country for roads, for <hi rend="italic">multiplicity</hi> of roads, as I think is not elsewhere in the world; scattered everywhere with House of Gentry; and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Harewood is a place of no distinct<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> except for the common <hi rend="italic">Owner&#x2019;s</hi> name, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I did not know. At last a fat good man, a watchmaker at Egham<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Egham, village about 6 mi. (9.5 km.) ENE of Harewood Lodge; watchmaker un-identified.</note> asked me if &#x201C;the Lady I was going to did not keep a French Cook?&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William; see below<corr>,</corr> n. 4.</note> By guess I considered I might safely answer &#x201C;Yes.&#x201C; Upon wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the good man joyfully directed me, with perfect accuracy as it proved! A &#x201C;Lord W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Paulett&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maj. Gen. Lord William Paulet (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21624"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), army officer.</note> usually occupies the house; him everybody in the neighbourhood knew; &#x26; my watchmaker had heard that there was to be a Lady very grand indeed &#x201C;with a French Cook&#x201C; and all the other trimmings resident in the place for a couple of months. Thanks to the French Cook<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently called William; see <ref target="volume-37/18610924-JWC-LS-01">JWC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, [<date when="1861-09-24">24 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> for that at any rate; tho&#x2019;, except it be good hot coffee that he makes in the morning I owe him nothing but <hi rend="italic">mischief</hi> on other grounds.</p>
<p>Jane does very well here; I not so well,&#x2014;owing to French Cookeries (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> honest mutton and beef very ill), and still more to a French Bed (sorrow on it), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I sometimes liken to &#x201C;big potatoe-scull&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A shallow wicker or wood-lath basket shaped like a scoop and used for carrying potatoes, peats, turnips; for TC&#x2019;s experience of scull-shaped beds in Germany, see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520909-TC-JAC-01"><sic>27:277</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1852-09-09">9 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> given one to sleep<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS 517.25 ends here.</note> in,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-37-233" n="37:233"/>curtainless, crooked, hard, strait and in every way rather detestable than otherwise.</p>
<p>For the rest we are quiet as <hi rend="italic">mice;</hi> there have been only one or two people here,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Raikes and Lady Elizabeth Emily Bertie; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610922-JWC-IEB-01">JWC to IEB, [<date when="1861-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref>].</note> and the last of them went to-day.

I have even a little room called the &#x201C;study&#x201C; for my sake: but alas, alas! <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is actually the first time I have put pen to paper since my appearance here! An exact fact, tho&#x2019; a strange one. The French Cook and the Potatoe Scull are sore ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me. I have had express <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> from the second day (rather gone now); and have felt nothing but feverish discomfort and inability to do anything but read a little, and ride considerably. The weather has once or twice been damp; but generally is the best that can be in <date when="0000-09-00">Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date><hi rend="italic">;</hi> burning bright in the noon period, sinking into chill at night. I might have staid here for a month, with advantage, and done regular work, had it not been for my perverse Cook and Bed! As it is, I think of being home on Saturday; my longing to be again in a Christian Bed is very considerable.</p>
<p>This is one of the prettiest Countries for riding that one c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find in the world. Fifty or a Hundred Square miles (10 miles each way) of country mostly in wood and park; the finest wood and the finest green, all broken into knolls and vales, that c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be desired. Windsor Park (Queen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">special</hi> part of it) is by far the finest I have ever seen: gigantic old oaks, endless shady lanes (to wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you need a key), avenues with Windsor Castle (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is like a little Edinburgh)<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He means Edinburgh Castle, not the city.</note> far off at the end of them;&#x2014;and in particular such expanses of perfect turf for galloping upon as c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not be matched. I have been there once (after long mistake and delay ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the &#x201C;key&#x201C;); yesterday, being somewhat bankrupt in the <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> way, I did not ride at all; but today I am off again, preferring much a solitary canter to a drive on wheels.</p>
<p>I had something to write to you about <hi rend="italic">trowsers</hi> that I want (if you <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get any &#x201C;Orleans Stripe&#x201C;);<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-34/lt-18580702-TC-JCA-01"><sic>34:5</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1858-07-02">2 July 1858</date></corr></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">item</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a pair of Sponges!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550216-TC-JCA-01"><sic>29:265</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-02-16">16 Feb. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> But I will put it all off till next week and composure again at home.

<p>Yesterday I wrote to Dumfries (to Jean for surety) in answer to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> word from The Gill; and gave a long account of my <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> of an existence as carried on here. This morning, lying on the table for me there was the inclosed,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a letter for John A. Carlyle sent to Cheyne Row.</note> successively inclosed in the covers as now sent. Not knowing, when I got to the second cover, but it might actually be for myself, I opened the second cover; but at the first word, stopped short, and now forward to Scotsbrig as the surer place for getting done with it at once. I have no doubt I might have read to the last syllable without harm to you or any of my fellow-creatures; but there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> where I stopped short, as evidently steering nowhither.</p>
<p>Having given Jean so much talk about nothing at all, I need not add to it today on the same subject. We have still sunshine along with silence; I am in a haggly rheumatic totally useless posture; sauntering about with paltry printed bubble called &#x201C;Books&#x201C; in one hand, and a long white &#x2019;bacco-pipe in the other;&#x2014;determined to have my ride <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> today, and superadd to it the drive in the afternoon. I am sorry only to say that it will not be <hi rend="italic">tomorrow</hi> I get home; it has had to be put off till Monday,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> gives me still 3 nights of my &#x201C;Potatoe-Basket&#x201C; Dormitory and my too elaborate Form of Cookery. Perhaps the very change will be of a little use. Yesterday I had a fine Canter of Windsor &#x26; back, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> must be ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a dozen miles, mostly over turf. Blessed is he that is getting forward with work!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>And <hi rend="italic">why?</hi>&#x2014; Were I to assign the only reason which occurs to me, for the moment; it would seem incredible to your wellregulated mind! <hi rend="italic">You</hi> could never conceive how a woman &#x201C;born of respectable parents, and having enjoyed the advantages of a liberal education&#x201C; (like Judge Somebody&#x2019;s malefactor who &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">instead of which</hi>, had gone about the country stealing Turkies!&#x201C;)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> should be withheld from doing a thing, by just the feeling that she <hi rend="italic">ought to!</hi> altho&#x2019; if she had <hi rend="italic">ought to</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">not</hi> <hi rend="italic">to</hi> she would have done it at the first opportunity!

<p>For the rest; I should have enjoyed this beautiful place excessively: if Eve hadn&#x2019;t eaten that unfortunate apple a great many years ago! in result of which there has, ever since, been <hi rend="italic">always a something</hi> to prevent one&#x2019;s feeling oneself in Paradise! The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">something,</hi>&#x201C; of the present occasion, came in the form of <hi rend="italic">Lumbago!</hi> not into my own back but into M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s; which made no difference, so far as the whole comfort of my life was concerned! For it was the very first day of being here that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C saw fit to spread his pocket handkerchief on the grass&#x2014;just after a heavy shower&#x2014;and sit down on it!&#x2014;for an hour and more!&#x2014;in spite of all my remonstrances!! The Lumbago following in the course of nature; there hasn&#x2019;t been a day that I felt sure of staying over the next, and of not being snatched away&#x2014;like Proserpine&#x2014;as I was from <hi rend="italic">the Grange</hi> last winter!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles visited The Grange <date when="1861-01-15">15</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-01-19">19 Jan.</date>; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610201-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [early Feb.]</ref>.

<p>And so, all the ten days we have been here, it has been a straining on M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s part to tear his way thro&#x2019; the social amenities back to Chelsea!&#x2014;while I have spent all the time I might have been enjoying myself, in expecting to be snatched way!&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Never having heard of that strange Isle-of-Lewis Adventure<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Jr. was interested in renting a farm at Galson, Isle of Lewis, and had been consulting John A. Carlyle. The farm was widely advertised over the summer; for example, &#x201C;Farm to be Let In the Island of Lews [Lewis], on Lease, with Entry at Martinmas <date when="1861-00-00">1861</date> &#x2F; The Valuable Sheep and Arable Farm of Galson &#x2026; consisting of 15,000 Acres of Moor Pasture &#x2026; and 500 Acres &#x2026; of Arable, partly superior pasture and partly under crop. &#x2026; The Dwelling-House and Steadings are ample and in good repair, accessible by a good road from Stornoway, and there is a regular post. &#x2026; Steamers ply Twice a Week between Stornoway and Glasgow&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Courier,</hi> <date when="1861-08-20">20 Aug.</date>). James Jr. had written to John, <date when="1861-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, suggesting John &#x201C;take the farm and assume me as a managing partner.&#x201C; John replied, <date when="1861-09-18">18 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;there would be great risk for you in venturing on so large a concern, &#x26; in a place so far off &#x26; so new to you in all ways, more especially as you have so little practical experience in the details of farming. &#x2026; In no circumstances could I undertake the lease myself, for I could not now stand the anxiety &#x26; tear &#x26; wear of such a concern.&#x201C; On <date when="1861-09-19">19 Sept.</date> he wrote: &#x201C;A place so distant &#x26; isolated, requiring so much outlay &#x2026; it seems to me, might give rise to endless disappointment &#x26; vexation to everyone connected with the farming of it; &#x26; I think your father will be of this opinion too when he considers the details.&#x201C; He then wrote, <date when="1861-09-20">20 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;I feel that I know almost nothing of farming &#x26; may have made a mistake in regard to it. &#x2026; W<hi rend="italic">d</hi> your father go with you to see the place if I paid the expenses?&#x201C; James replied, <date when="1861-09-21">[21] Sept.</date>: &#x201C;My Father thinks it extremely probable that Galson will be got very cheap, but how to raise the necessary capital for renting a place of its size is of course the difficulty with him. &#x2026; My father is anxious to go and see the place.&#x201C; John replied, <date when="1861-09-23">23 Sept.</date>, that he hoped to see James&#x2019;s father on Wed., <date when="1861-09-25">25 Sept.</date>, to discuss it: &#x201C;I have sent the documents to your uncle in Chelsea, asking him what he thinks of the project, &#x26; whether he would be ready in any circumstances to advance the half of the &#xa3;1800 you need for its execution; &#x26; I hope to have his answer by Wednesday&#x2019;s post, so as to show it to your Father&#x201C; (MSS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> till now, nor having at present any leisure to consider it, I can only say that it looks very <pb id="pg-37-238" n="37:238"/>wild and dangerous indeed. A miserable barren drowned<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John A. Carlyle misread &#x201C;drowned&#x201C;; when he sent TC&#x2019;s letter on to James Carlyle Jr., <date when="1861-09-25">25 Sept.</date>, he wrote: &#x201C;What your uncle means by &#x2018;doomed&#x2019; relates, I suppose, to the languid fixed habits &#x26; incapability of change amongst most of the inhabitants of the Western Islands&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> Country, cut off from all the world: it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> seem to me a far likelier thing if a man <hi rend="italic">had</hi> skill in sheep and other husbandry, and such a command of money, to go at once to N.

Wales<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle Jr. had previously thought of going to Australia; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600413-TC-JF-01"><sic>36:96</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1860-04-13">13 April 1860</date></corr></ref>.</note> with one&#x2019;s faculty and resource, and there plant it down with at least a noble <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> of spreading &#x26; growing!&#x2014; My notions, however, in this sudden hurry, are positively worth nothing in regard to the practical affair: but I can say at once that I have at present no such sum as &#xa3;900 or anything resembling it, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I could conveniently disburse; or should incline to sink in any Enterprise not of the most pressing necessity. All the less, as money affairs have gone a good deal awry with me, during last year,&#x2014;owing to badness of trade says Chapman, owing to I know not what;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mid-Victorian economy was marked by several short-term booms and slumps, and political uncertainty in America had affected global trade.</note>&#x2014;and till once this Book is done, I cannot go into the business at all, to take real order with it.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his London checkbook, <date when="1861-09-24">24 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;as marked in &#x2F; the Pass Book, <hi rend="italic">Balance</hi> in my &#x2F; favour is &#xa3;128..13..1.&#x201C;; he added, possibly later, &#x201C;&#xa3;140 from Fr Ch<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was paid &#x2F; by <hi rend="italic">then</hi> (I suppose)&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753). As TC only kept money for daily expenses in his London bank account, it seems unlikely he was looking to see if he had enough to give James; he kept more money in the Dumfries bank account where, <date when="1860-09-00">Sept. 1860</date>, he had &#xa3;<date when="3028-00-00">3028</date>..12..9 (Robert Adamson to TC, <date when="1860-09--06">6 Sept. 1860</date>. MS: NLS 607.559).</note></p>
<p>I think young Jamie a fine honest spirited fellow; and tho&#x2019; perhaps rather sudden and headlong as young men are, capable of doing well in almost any arena where his bodily health did not suffer,&#x2014;or wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> were not quite below his <hi rend="italic">just</hi> aspirations in regard to employment. But I own, it has always seemed to me that he is quite <hi rend="italic">unlike</hi> Scotch Farming, that his true scene is not there at all, most likely;&#x2014;and that his Father perhaps <hi rend="italic">ought,</hi> tho&#x2019; I can well understand how painfully, to ask himself whether in actual fact that is not so?__ Kindest regards to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> and to everybody. We both got home yesterday: I riding, Jane by rail. Thank Jean for writing. <closer><salute>Yours in utter haste &#x2F;</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We shall be happy to see you on your return to Town.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parkes was sent as a commissioner of immigration and was touring Britain to encourage emigration. He arrived <date when="1861-08-04">4 Aug.</date>; he wrote to TC, <date when="1861-09-25">25 Sept.</date>, enclosing Gavan Duffy&#x2019;s letter of introduction: &#x201C;There is scarcely another man living whom I should so like to know and yet I have not called upon you with my letter partly from the pressure of business engagements but much more from a confused fear that I might be considered an intruder. I am now on the eve of leaving London for a week or ten days. &#x2026; Should it be agreeable to you I shall be happy at the earliest opportunity to pay my respects in person to one whom I have so long admired &#x26; honoured from a distance.&#x201C; In his letter, <date when="1861-05-23">23 May</date>, Duffy wrote: &#x201C;I have not sent you a single letter of introduction from Australia, and if I break this salutary rule now it is in favour of a man whom I wish to present to you as a specimen of our public men in this new world. Mr Parkes goes to England as agent for the government and Legislature of New South Wales, and he has long held a foremost place in the parliament of that country. &#x2F; Of the rest I will not speak as you will judge for yourself.

My knock was answered by a demure young person who at once ushered me into the presence of the grim philosopher and his gentle wife. The evening meal was of the most frugal&#x2014;thin cakes, I think of oatmeal, and a cup of richly-made tea. After tea my host sat down on the floor with his back straight up against the wall and his legs stretched out at full length, and, charging and lighting a long white clay pipe, he happily puffed away, stopping at short intervals to talk on all manner of things in the style of one of his later books. He spoke unreservedly of great men whom he had known, and he asked many curious questions about Australia, which showed the original light in which he viewed some well-threshed-out subjects of colonisation. For instance, he contended that, if governing men could only free themselves from the trammels of custom and be truly wise, they would remove the Sovereign and the Court and all the machinery of Government to Australia, where the field for national life was so wide, attractive, and unencumbered, and so leave the contracted spaces and the murky atmosphere of England behind them. &#x2026; He spoke of America and of the Civil War then raging, which subjects were renewed again and again in later conversations&#x201C; (Parkes 1:160&#x2013;61).</note> Have the goodness to name some Evening that will suit you,&#x2014;and then come, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> hear nothing to the contrary.</p>

<salute>Dearest Mary</salute>
<p>We have been to Lady Sandwich&#x2019;s, and staid near a fortnight, and have been back as long, and John Carlyle has been here a week. It has been an <pb id="pg-37-244" n="37:244"/>unsettled sort of time; but I am going to make a vigorous effort to subside into the old, regular, dull way; and such efforts with me always begin in <hi rend="italic">sorting up my drawers,</hi> and paying off my letter-debts&#x2014; I begin with <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> to whom it was my intention to have written from Harewood Lodge. Indeed I had meant to write such a many letters from there!&#x2014;where I should have no household cares (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Livings-cares</hi>&#x201C; or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the cares of Bread</hi>&#x201C; as Mazzini calls them.) and my time and soul entirely to myself <hi rend="italic">till three oclock</hi> every day, (Lady S&#x2019;s hour for coming down). But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was a fond imagination soon dispelled! Oh my Dear! just imagine what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle went and did! The very first day after our arrival&#x2014;it had rained heavily all morning but suddenly the sun came out&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C went and spread his silk pocket-handkerchief on the wet grass of the lawn, and sat down on it with a book! and in spite of remonstrance continued sitting there for an hour! tho there was a capital seat under a tree within three yards of him!&#x2014; That is the sort of thing your wise men do!&#x2014; The consequences of course were pretty severe&#x2014; He took lumbago; and tho&#x2019; it was not bad enough to double him up&#x2014;it was quite bad enough to make him wretched&#x2014;and impatient to escape out of the precincts of civilization back to his own den where he might growl to his hearts content. It was such a pity! for the place was most lovely, and there was no racket of company&#x2014;and Lady Sandwich lets <hi rend="italic">him</hi> do exactly as he likes; and except for that lumbago he could hardly have managed to feel discontent, and hardly have managed to fail being bettered by the change. And for myself I should have enjoyed the &#x2018;beautiful Nature,&#x2019; and the daily drive in an open carriage, and the emancipation from &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Livings-cares</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and all the rest of it, amazingly&#x2014;if He had only been getting on <hi rend="italic">well.</hi> But there was the constant apprehension, on my spirits, of being snatched away&#x2014;like Proserpine&#x2014;that day or the next&#x2014;besides the worry which a husband with a pain anywhere feels it his duty to <hi rend="italic">share</hi> with the wife of his <hi rend="italic">bosom!</hi></p>
<p>So on the whole that visit was a failure, tho&#x2019; never Hostess took more pains than that dear old Lady Sandwich (80 years old) took, to make it a signal success&#x2014; In fact luck has not been on my side this great long while back&#x2014; Let us hope that I shall have a fortunate &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">first foot</hi>&#x2019; next neyears<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;newyears.&#x201C;</note> morning&#x2014;to bring things round! I had so set my heart on <hi rend="italic">see</hi>ing you this summer in your new home! But it wasn&#x2019;t to be! And so it is no use grumbling about it&#x2014; That invalided Cook<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matilda.</note> was only discharged from S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Georges Hospital some two weeks ago&#x2014;what they call <hi rend="italic">cured</hi>&#x2014;but that doesn&#x2019;t mean fit for any active service&#x2014;and I dont think she will ever be <hi rend="italic">that</hi> again. I got her into a Convalescent Hospital at Walton on Thames.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Metropolitan Convalescent Institution, Walton-on-Thames, 17 mi. (27.5 km.) SW of London; it received &#x201C;free of charge, poor convalescent patients from the various London hospitals, dispensaries, and from their own unhealthy and ill-provided homes&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Herbert Fry&#x2019;s Royal Guide to the London Charities</hi> [<date when="1917-00-00">1917</date>] 174).</note> where she would be kept in all the <pb id="pg-37-245" n="37:245"/>comforts of life, without a penny to pay, for <hi rend="italic">one month,</hi> But after?&#x2014; It is really time some former mistress should take her up&#x2014;for she has lain very heavy on me for a long time now,&#x2014;Considering that she was just five weeks my servant&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Welsh girl whom I put in her place continues to do very well and the Hampshire housemaid<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret (&#x201C;Button&#x201C;) Sullivan and Maria Chamberlayne.</note> is also a success&#x2014; They agree wonderfully considering one is <hi rend="italic">Roman Catholic</hi> and the other a <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodist</hi>&#x2014; But they are too young to found any prospect of continuance on them&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Girls</hi> here, I observe, only strive to do well and to keep a place as long as they are learning their work&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">having</hi> learnt it they must be off to new work and new ways!</p>
<p>My little cook is now up to most cooking that we need&#x2014; She has a nice easy place of it&#x2014;and is better off every way than she ever was in her life&#x2014; But she takes away my breath sometimes&#x2014; By asking me &#x201C;if I think it would be a good thing for her to go out to her Sister in Australia&#x201C;?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellen Sullivan was in Mantell&#x2019;s service in New Zealand; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610507-JWC-JGCO-01">JWC to JGCO, <date when="1861-05-07">7 May</date></ref>.</note> or &#x201C;if I think she would make a good kitchen-maid, to be under a mancook so as to rise to be head Cook in a family&#x201C;?!! She doesnt call <hi rend="italic">this</hi> a family! I dare say she will stay on where she is so comfortable till she has got all the good to be squeezed out of the place&#x2014;but such speculations coming quite naively out of the little creatures head make me feel I hold her by a most insecure tenure.</p>

    <p>The Dr came duly on the Saturday night; staid with us 8 days; and went away, for Cambridge and Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> Monday morning last. He was very agreeable, much more so than usual; and I am truly gratified to have seen him <pb id="pg-37-248" n="37:248" />again, poor good soul. I got out of sleep the first evening (owing a little, not wholly, to the increase of talk and excitation, on the <hi rend="italic">thinnest</hi> of all human skins); and <hi rend="italic">into</hi> sleep I never c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get fairly again,nor have yet quite done, tho&#x02019; I am coming on;&#x02014;but we had some pleasant walks, plenty of free communication; and looked forward to a time when a certain <hi rend="italic">skin,</hi> relieved of its harness, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> no longer be such a tissue of <hi rend="italic">raws,</hi> or liable to injury from the wind blowing on it, as now. Ah me,&#x02014;but we must not complain.&#x02014; On Monday I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have written after him to Cambridge, had I rightly known how; for in truth I was very sad. Not till this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> (Thursday) did there come any news: &#x0201C;Was to leave Cambridge this morning&#x0201D;; be ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Peterborough (an old Cathedral &#x26;c still in that Cromwell Country) tonight; and at home in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> before bedtime tomorrow.</p>
    <p>The last pair of sponges you sent me cost, I think, 12&#x0002F;;&#x02014;if <hi rend="italic">this</hi> coming pair be <hi rend="italic">as</hi> good, I think they will pretty much be all I shall need in the world! No hurry ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> them nor ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the trowsers either; the old are not yet done: but they are in fact telling me daily that they will be. If they have <hi rend="italic">Orleans stripe</hi> of a black-grey or blue-grey colour, still better if of a <hi rend="italic">nut-brown</hi> or analogous shade, and the cloth be good,&#x02014;you might send me little clippings; and I will have trowsers of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> kinds.

<salute>Dear Lady Sandwich,</salute>
<p>I intended to write you this very day (at the end of a <hi rend="italic">Chapter of King Fr</hi>h, when there is &#x201C;holiday&#x201C; for half an hour, if we be in luck!) a word of petition for some news again: and, behold, the news is come; and of the best kind possible, That you are coming home to us again almost directly! I accept the omen; and will hope the <hi rend="italic">next Chapter</hi> may go a little better than the last did.</p>
<p>That was a sad procedure of your faithful and obliged but demented Juba, to take himself for a lapdog; and spring upon his poor Lady, with such sorrowful result! Surely it was not you, of all persons, that needed such a bit of help to make front against the daily difficulties that the day brings. You say nothing of it, this time; but I am not sure it is yet altogether off,&#x2014;but will hope to see it so before this week end.&#x2014; On the other hand, your little Ladies<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps her granddas., Emily and Anne Montagu; see <ref target="volume-37/lt-18610724-TC-LS-01">TC to <sic>Lady S</sic><corr>LS</corr>, <date when="1861-07-24">24 July</date></ref>.</note> were a comfort to me to think of as beside you. The &#x201C;morning rays&#x201C; are so bright and beautiful; and gild,&#x2014;in that loving relation especially,&#x2014;all the other parts of life. Courage, courage: the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> always shines, whether <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are in the morning of it or the uncertain afternoon!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have done very little good since quitting Harewood &#x26; its hospitable solitudes. My work went unusually ill (no part of this sad work has ever gone well); and I have been in a kind of crisis as to health,&#x2014;changing <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> for <hi rend="italic">breast-cold,</hi> to little advantage; losing sleep, and pining about in a very useless manner,&#x2014;only fairly a little better, since the last few days. If I can hold out till about the middle of next summer,&#x2014;perhaps! But there is a great mass of dirty quagmire ahead still. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> however, I mean to rest till the end of the chapter, and be perceptibly less miserable. Ah me, ah me, what a change since I <hi rend="italic">began</hi> this thing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Ashburton has arrived; Baby &#x26; Ladyship well; self still considerably gouty:&#x2014;they were quite fixed at first for a <hi rend="italic">Winter in Nubia</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nubia, a region in S Egypt and N Sudan; once an independent kingdom. For the Ashburtons&#x2019; <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> trip there, see <ref target="volume-35/lt-18590130-TC-LOA-01"><sic>35:15</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1859-01-30">30 Jan. 1859</date></corr></ref>.</note> again; but the Doctors have relented, and prescribe The Grange instead, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am very glad of. The Grange, I am convinced, if he will sit quiet there, will mend him shortly; and &#x201C;Nubia&#x201C; may&#x2014;stay where it is! But he got y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> address; and will probably have himself written. Good b&#x2019;ye, then, dear Lady,&#x2014;till Thursday next. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p>When lying awake in the dark night I think of you and your troubles on the other side of the wall!</p>
<p>I have no news to tell you but that I was in a room the other day with Miss Frederica Johnstone! a large, fair, <hi rend="italic">goodish</hi> looking woman, over forty. She didn&#x2019;t seem in low spirits on account of her lover in penal servitude, and her own egregious folly in the newspapers!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederica Johnstone (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>) had become engaged, <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>, to Vincent Collucci (b. ca. <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), an Italian artist; during his absence in Italy in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> she broke off the engagement and asked him to return her personal letters. He demanded &#xa3;2,000 for them, to which she agreed, but on receiving the money, he handed her a package which she later discovered to contain old newspapers. Collucci was tried, found guilty of obtaining money under false pretences, and given three years&#x2019; penal servitude. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1861-10-24">24 Oct.</date>, the trial at the Old Bailey; in an editorial, <date when="1861-10-25">25 Oct.</date>, it commented: &#x201C;Miss Johnstone dealt with him very sensibly after a while, and was, perhaps, actuated as much by benevolence as fear in yielding to some of his demands.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>I send a letter from Madame Venturie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emilie Venturi, in Italy; JWC apparently replied, as Venturi wrote, <date when="1861-12-26">26 Dec. 1861</date>, thanking JWC for her letter of <date when="1861-10-31">31 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I am delighted to know you liked Charlotte Cushman.

It was due to her that JWC had agreed to meet Cushman, who wrote to JWC, <date when="1861-11-16">16 Nov. 1861</date>: &#x201C;I want to write to Emilie Hawkes&#x2014;did she not make you see me&#x2014;&#x26; how much do I not owe her&#x201C; (MS: NLS 1774.216).</note> in case it might amuse you to read it&#x2014;if not, have no <hi rend="italic">delicacy</hi> as to returning it unread.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your long good Letter; thanks for the <hi rend="italic">Rulhi&#xE8;re</hi> and the short one,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC refers to Claude-Carloman de Ruhli&#xE8;re, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de l&#x2019;anarchie de Pologne et du d&#xE9;membrement de cette r&#xE9;publique; suivie des anecdotes sur la r&#xE9;volution de Russie, en <date when="1762-00-00">1762</date>,</hi> 4 vols.

TC&#x2019;s copies: HCC.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> had arrived punctually some days before. I am glad you are established in your old place, among your old connexions,&#x2014;and that Erskine, for one item, is to be y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> neighbour again this winter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine spent much of each winter at 16 Charlotte Sq., Edinburgh.</note> One finds few such companions left in the world; I may say that, here in my circles, I have none such at all.</p>
<p>It was not you that took away my sleep while you were here; it was a bad combination of many things, and a &#x201C;crisis&#x201C; that had come, as I sometimes told you. I ought to have applied to my <hi rend="italic">blue</hi> friend weeks, perhaps months before:&#x2014;I am now a great deal better by <hi rend="italic">his</hi> help; and going on, almost up at the old level; sleep &#x26;c not to be complained of at all. The <hi rend="italic">ph[l]egmatic</hi> windpipe (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was very annoying in your time) has yielded mostly to a warm <hi rend="italic">hareskin,</hi>&#x2014;has changed itself latterly, I think, into a weak cold in the nose, and does not annoy me farther. In fact I am as well as I was this time twelvemonth; &#x26; tho, weak and old, expect to get my vile burden shuffled off, <pb id="pg-37-257" n="37:257"/>on honourable terms, in the course of 8 or 10 months, if I luck. I do not overwork myself, at least try not to do so, or to neglect any wise precaution; but it is frightful to see how <hi rend="italic">little</hi> work is to be had out of me; how much of each whole day is spent in [cere]monies<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first two syllables of &#x201C;ceremonies&#x201C; are unclear.</note> in refections and preparations; hardly four <hi rend="italic">hours</hi> of it good for any real exertion, 20 spent in looking back and forward upon these! The Printer has started work again; but it must be at the slowest rate, for a couple of months to come, or he will catch me straightway. Oh if I were but done! You will then be able to come &#x26; see me with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> danger to sleep!&#x2014; I sometimes think of a sail to America; of a&#x2014;great variety of things. Courage, courage!</p>
<p>Henry Watt called here the other night; I suppose he must be with you ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> this time. I have never seen Browning yet, except a glimpse on the streets. Ruskin, whom I rode out to ask for, last Sunday, is in Lausanne,&#x2014;till <date when="1861-12-00">dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date> next.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ruskin was in Lucerne, 152 mi. (244.5 km.) NE of Geneva. He wrote to TC and JWC, <date when="1861-11-07">7 Nov. 1861</date>, that he hoped to be home by Christmas (MS: NLS 555.11).</note> Woolner has got some fine public work to do at Manchester (sculptures for a Court-House),<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Woolner had been commissioned to decorate with statues and high-reliefs the New Assize Courts, Manchester, designed in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date> by Alfred Waterhouse (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1905-00-00">1905</date>; <ref target="volume-37/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36758"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>). Woolner worked on them between <date when="1863-00-00">1863</date> and <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>; the statues were of kings and law--givers, and there were two high reliefs of historical subjects, and a third of the Judgment of Solomon with the figures of the Good Woman and the Drunken Woman; see Woolner 339.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I am willing to hear of.

Craik referred to Carlyle twice; discussing the &#x201C;preponderance &#x2026; of the element of narrative&#x201C; in Victorian prose, he credited Macaulay and Carlyle with giving &#x201C;a new eloquence to the language&#x201C; (Craik 2:533). He later contrasted Carlyle favorably with Gibbon: &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Germanisms are a thing of a different nature altogether from Gibbon&#x2019;s Gallicisms. Nor, if his flashing narrative may sometimes elude or perplex a dull apprehension, is it ever ambiguous or obscure from any affected and unnatural indirectness such as Gibbon habitually indulges in&#x201C; (Craik 2:538).</note> I have not seen, but mean to look at it one day. We have very cold weather (fierce n.e. winds with foggy sky) for a week past.&#x2014; Write to me soon, dear Brother, and at large. <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer> <name>T.
