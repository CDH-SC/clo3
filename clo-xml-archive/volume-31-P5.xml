<p><date when="1856-01-00">January</date> to <date when="1856-09-00">September 1856</date> were further months in the shadow of Frederick the Great for both Carlyles; months of unrelenting work for TC and often unrelenting ill health for JWC, ending in a prolonged summer in Scotland that led to a voluminous exchange of letters between them (as holidays always did when the Carlyles were separated) and a notable reappraisal of their national identity by two Scots who had not spent much time in their native parts for several years.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote 144 and JWC 29 of the 173 letters in this volume; two-thirds (62 percent) of TC&#x2019;s are published for the first time, and over one-third (38 percent) of JWC&#x2019;s. Of the remainder, 6 percent of TC&#x2019;s letters have previously been published in collections, 14 percent published elsewhere, 5 percent partly published, and 12 percent quoted, while 4 percent of JWC&#x2019;s letters have been published in collections, 27 percent published elsewhere, 21 percent partly published, and 10 percent quoted. &#x201C;Partly published&#x201D; indicates that more than half of the letter has been previously published; &#x201C;quoted&#x201D; means less than half (in most cases between a sentence and a paragraph) has been previously published.</note></p>
<p>TC greeted the new year without much enthusiasm. Their winter visit to the Grange (from <date when="1855-12-17">17 December 1855</date> to <date when="1856-01-14">14 January</date>) had been full of good company. Nevertheless, he later characterized the house party&#x2014;&#x201C;Our last Grange Christmas, such as it proved, under the presidency of that great lady,&#x201C;&#x2014;as a gathering of aristocrats and scientists, &#x201C;some of whom have left more than the shadow of an impression on me&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See TC&#x2019;s recollections, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:278.</note>&#x2014;a notably grudging comment, considering that one of the acquisitions of the time was the long-lasting friendship of John Tyndall, whose devotion to TC was unwavering. Clearly, both TC and JWC continued to charm socially through their good company and good humor, and his published writing, however controversial, continued to fascinate. As K. J. Fielding has observed, commenting on such evidence as Tyndall&#x2019;s correspondence, &#x201C;[I]t gives a clear idea of what Carlyle&#x2019;s works meant to many of his readers in the forties and fifties. Through their language, beliefs, and social commitment they had a powerful effect.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >K. J. Fielding, &#x201C;Carlyle and John Tyndall: I,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Studies Annual</hi> 18 (<date when="1998-00-00">1998</date>): 43&#x2013;52 (quotation on 51).</note></p>
<p>JWC&#x2019;s effect certainly was as striking in the circle of friends who continue to elicit her epistolary skills in this volume, friends like Ellen Twisleton, who had commented shrewdly in <date when="1855-04-00">April 1855</date>: &#x201C;Nobody has been kinder to me than Mrs Carlyle. &#x2026; It seems to me sometime, as if all the love and charity and goodness and unworldliness, in England, were among the heathen, while <pb id="pg-31-xii" n="31:xii"/>&#x2018;those who profess and call themselves Christians&#x2019; are hard, and cold, and selfish.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550430-TC-JAC-01"><sic>29:299</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-04-30">30 April 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> JWC shared Twisleton&#x2019;s impatience with energetic Christians (with her own aunts in Edinburgh, for instance), as we see from her letters and Notebook and Journal (see vol. 30). But her letters continue to demonstrate genuine affection, openly and attractively displayed (for example, her letters to Mary Russell)&#x2014;and her conduct demonstrates the independence of mind that so many found attractive in the first place. That she should have added her signature in February to the <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560216-JWC-LOP-01">Petition for Reform of the Married Woman&#x2019;s Property Law</ref> is perhaps astonishing in one who preferred to do good in private, if not by stealth. But JWC was fond of asserting her individuality, and she felt keenly in Scotland later in the year the difference between &#x201C;being loved for the sake of ones dead Father and Mother&#x2014;and being make-believe-loved for the sake of one&#x2019;s living &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">distinguished Husband!</hi>&#x2019;&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560820-JWC-EDO-01">JWC to <sic>ED</sic><corr>EDO</corr>, [<date when="1856-08-20">20 Aug.</date>]</ref>).</p>
<p>The Carlyles were plainly both of them attractive friends, whatever bitterness may occasionally surface in their letters. While JWC&#x2019;s Journal, covering March to early <date when="1856-07-00">July 1856</date>, may also describe illness, depression, and anxiety, it is also a record of an extremely active social life, something that is not as apparent in her surviving letters (see <ref target="volume-31/ed-31-chronology">Chronology</ref> and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:232&#x2013;62</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal</corr></ref>). All her letters were to elicit strong feelings when TC read them in his bereaved state in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> after her death, finding them &#x201C;mournful to me while I live.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 158.</note> Preparing the <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> he systematically read through JWC&#x2019;s letters: &#x201C;[S]uch a day&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> as I perhaps never had in my life before. What a piercing radiancy of meaning to me in those dear records, hastily thrown off, full of misery, yet of bright eternal love; all as if on wings of lightning, tingling through one&#x2019;s very heart of hearts!&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 160.</note></p>
<p>These months were overshadowed for both of them by TC&#x2019;s hard work on <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi> On <date when="1856-01-19">19 January</date> he wrote, &#x201C;I have been the idlest, feeblest, and probably among the unhappiest of mankind; never felt so vanquished, overwhelmed and totally useless,&#x2014;or hardly ever,&#x2014;in my life before. Incapable of writing, of thinking, of acting. In fact a down-broken creature indeed. Which is shameful to think of&#x201D; (<sic>TC to JN, <date when="1856-01-19">19 Jan.</date></sic><corr><ref target="volume-31/lt-18560119-TC-LA-01">TC to LA, <date when="1856-01-19">19 Jan.</date></ref></corr>). There were frequent spells of self-disgust and near despair caused by a book &#x201C;thoughtlessly gone into,&#x201D; revulsion for subject and country both&#x2014;&#x201C;I have little real love for Frederick, and for his century, and its works and ways, contemptuous abhorrence rather than love&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560128-TC-ES-01">TC to ES, <date when="1856-01-28">28 Jan.</date></ref>). Work&#x2014;steady, methodical, and measurable work&#x2014;seemed to be his only resource, for (as he confessed <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560403-TC-LA-01">to <sic>Lady Ashburton</sic><corr>LA</corr> <pb id="pg-31-xiii" n="31:xiii"/>on <date when="1856-04-03">3 April</date></ref>) &#x201C;It is only when I fall altogether idle, that I get altogether miserable.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As the year progressed, <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> seemed a little less formidable; by <date when="1856-05-05">5 May</date> TC thought it possible he would be sending the first half of the book to press in autumn, &#x201C;then a little pause for the other two (or one), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> ends it!&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560505-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1856-05-05">5 May</date></ref>). Alas, nine years were to pass before that end, though the first volume did take shape in <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>, at the same time as TC began preparations for publishing a &#x201C;Cheap Edition&#x201D; of his works with Chapman. With the sterling help at this point of Vernon Lushington and Joseph Neuberg&#x2014;and what better proof could be asked of his magnetism than that people volunteered to help with the drudgery of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>&#x2014;he did make progress, however grudgingly admitted. Even on holiday in August, &#x201C;I have brought some Papers with me; and occasionally try to do a bit of work, getting F<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> &#x2018;Introduction&#x2019; worked thro&#x2019; the shoreless lake of <hi rend="italic">Reichshistorie,</hi>&#x2014;not with much effect hitherto&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560813-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1856-08-13">13 Aug.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>The present volume, then, like its predecessors, functions as a window on the creative process of TC&#x2019;s research and writing, the misery it caused him (and caused those about him), the near panic he felt at lack of progress, and the remorseless rise in the size and scope of the project. All he could do was grind steadily at it all, realizing that the self-disgust he would otherwise feel would be unbearable. And JWC? Her letters, while fewer in number than her husband&#x2019;s, remain sharp, observant, frequently confessional, and illustrated more and more by correspondence such as Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s and her sister Elisabeth Dwight&#x2019;s (see, for example, <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-ellen-twisleton-account-of-life-at-craigenputtoch"><sic>30:267&#x2013;74</sic><corr>Ellen Twisleton&#x2019;s Account of Life at Cragenputtoch</corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551114-JWC-LA-01"><sic>30:114</sic><corr>JWC to LA, <date when="1855-11-14">14 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551223-TC-JCA-01"><sic>144</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1855-12-23">23 Dec. 1855</date></corr></ref>), and the originals of such papers as the Ashburton collection now in the National Library of Scotland.</p>
<p><date when="1856-08-00">August</date> and <date when="1856-09-00">September 1856</date> were months when husband and wife were separated by their prolonged summer holiday, a separation that generated an almost daily correspondence, without which TC in particular was quite miserable and could work himself into a frenzy: &#x201C;Well, thank Heaven I hear of you at last! The man, yesterday too, at first denied, &#x2018;No Letters for you, Sir&#x2019;; and I had three minutes of sceptical suspense, till he did produce the article. You have no idea how glad I am to hear of you on any terms&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560923-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref>). JWC replied tartly to criticism, not least since her husband was an unreasonably demanding correspondent, sometimes eliciting from JWC real fire. TC, for instance, had forgotten to take enough money with him to Scotland, and simply wrote to JWC to ask for more. JWC was not amused:</p>
<q>Oh dear! Oh dear! To be thrown into a quandry like <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> just when I am getting ready to start for Thornhill! You are so wrong in your dates that I don&#x2019;t know what to make of it!&#x2014;<date when="1856-09-22">22<hi rend="italic">d</hi></date> you have written at the top of your note and it arrives here on the <date when="1856-09-22">22<hi rend="italic">d</hi></date><hi rend="italic">!</hi>&#x2014;It <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be all right, but also it may <pb id="pg-31-xiv" n="31:xiv"/>very probably be all wrong&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">five pound note</hi> I sent you from Ecclefechan on Thursday the <date when="1856-09-18">18<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>, and the long letter that accompanied it, gone to nobody knows where!&#x2014;Pleasant! Why can&#x2019;t you take money enough <hi rend="italic">with</hi> you! (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560922-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1856-09-22">22 Sept.</date></ref>)</q>
<p>In fact, both were suffering from nervous reaction to their long visit to Scotland. TC&#x2019;s return to Scotsbrig had been almost ecstatic: &#x201C;I woke a couple or more of hours in the night; but in return fell sound asleep from 7 to past 10! After which, with bathing, with excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> coffee &#x26;c, I am really in a very fair way&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560726-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-07-26">26 July</date></ref>). But then he went so far as to raise the specter of taking JWC back to live there, an idea she had roundly rejected before:</p>
<q>I will really put it to you once more, my little Dame, to consider if it were not better we returned to poor old Scotland, there to adjust ourselves a little, there to lay our bones. &#x2026; It is certain we might live here in <hi rend="italic">opulence,</hi> (keep <hi rend="italic">brougham,</hi> cow, minister&#x2019;s man &#x26;c), and give our poor selves and Nero a much wholesomer life, were those Printing Enterprises once ended.&#x2014;However, there is still plenty of time to reflect: the Printings are by no means done! (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560807-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-08-07">7 Aug.</date></ref>)</q>
<p>JWC, too&#x2014;for a while&#x2014;found Scotland enchanting. After staying with her cousins in Auchtertool, Fife, she arrived, <date when="1856-08-08">8 August</date>, in Haddington to stay with the two surviving Donaldson sisters (one of whom was her godmother); she wrote to TC that it &#x201C;is like being pretty well up towards Heaven, being here&#x201D; (<date when="1856-08-08">8 Aug.</date>). She felt she was back in childhood, everything &#x201C;in perfect condition still.&#x201D; Puzzled by her own response to a return to familiar scenes, she wrote to Robert Tait in London a few days later:</p>
<q>Do you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> I think dear old Scotland so much better in every respect than &#x201C;the South&#x201D; that I should like to come back to it for altogether&#x2014;and have you and two or three more London people come to stay with me in the summer. &#x2026; I was grown as cold and hard as a stone, with continued pressure of ill health and worry&#x2014;Now I am so <hi rend="italic">soft</hi> that I fall a-crying twenty times aday with sheer gratitude to every body for making so much of me. (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560812-JWC-RST-01">JWC to RST, <date when="1856-08-12">12 Aug.</date></ref>)</q>
<p>Dead fathers and mothers confronted the Carlyles in Scotland as they faced up to their past. In <date when="1856-09-00">September</date>, TC revisited the graveyard where his father had been long immured and, since <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, his adored mother (see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531230-TC-JWC-01"><sic>28:366</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1853-12-30">30 Dec. 1853</date></corr></ref>). After his return to London, he would write about this experience to his brother Alexander:</p>
<q>There, yes there they all lay; Father, Mother, and Margaret&#x2019;s grave between them: silent, now that were wont to be so speechful when one came among them after an absence. I stood silent, with bared head, as in <pb id="pg-31-xv" n="31:xv"/>the sacredest place of all the world, for a few moments; and I daresay tears again wetted these hard eyes which are now unused to weeping. &#x2026; I did not return to that sacred spot; but if I come again to this country, I will visit it. No shrine can be so holy to a man. (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561003-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1856-10-03">3 Oct.</date></ref><sic>[to be pbd. in vol. 32]</sic>)</q>
<p>JWC was frankly surprised at the strength of her own emotional response to Scotland, and in letters to Mary Russell (which become much more intimate after she stayed with Mrs. Russell this summer and visited Crawford churchyard and Grace Welsh&#x2019;s grave with her), she was to lament her return to Chelsea and to normality: &#x201C;I was so tired I could neither eat nor sleep&#x2014;and after lying awake all night it seemed when I came down to breakfast as if I had taken on all the load of ailments again, I had kicked off on starting for Scotland&#x2014;dear dear Scotland! I could have found in my heart to lie down and take the ground in my arms, and kiss it, that morning I came away&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">only it was raining torrents!</hi>&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561006-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1846-10-06">6 Oct.</date></ref><sic>[see vol. 32]</sic>).</p>
<p>Traveling with TC was no easy task. Quite apart from the forgotten money, there was his hatred of railways, which made him a really difficult companion. It had been difficult for JWC, coming north in the Ashburtons&#x2019; private railway coach, &#x201C;a grand &#x2018;Queen&#x2019;s Saloon&#x2019; or <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ne-plus-ultra</hi></foreign> of railway carriages (made for the Queen some time before) costing no end of money.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 158.</note> But waiting for him in Ecclefechan for the homeward journey was worse. She was to describe him as being</p>
<q>in what people here call &#x201C;a state of mind&#x201C;&#x2014;all his nerves in a phrenzy from the long confused journey he had made&#x2014;and the prospect of further journey still before him!&#x2014; &#x2026; I arrived here with a furious face ach; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C having insisted on my sitting in a violent draught all the journey. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> kept me perfectly sleepless all night in spite of my extreme fatigue&#x2014;and so I began to be ill <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> and have gone on <hi rend="italic">crescendo</hi>&#x2014;in the same ratio that my worries have increased. (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561010-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1856-10-10">10 Oct.</date></ref><sic>[see vol. 32]</sic>)</q>
<p>London company and Scotland company were very different in their effects on JWC, as she reflected on her return to London. There Geraldine Jewsbury, for instance, was JWC&#x2019;s constant companion, as can be seen particularly in the frequent references to her in the Journal (see vol. 30). Other friends such as Ellen Twisleton thought she was too frequent a companion: &#x201C;unfailing Miss Jewsbury&#x201D; (<sic>see</sic><ref target="volume-29/lt-18550530-TC-AGI-01"><sic>29:321</sic><corr>TC to AGI, <date when="1855-05-30">30 May 1855</date></corr></ref>), and &#x201C;the everlasting Jewsbury&#x201D; (ET to Elisabeth Dwight, <date when="1858-12-05">5 Dec. 1858</date>, Houghton MS). For JWC as well, Jewsbury&#x2019;s company could be too much, especially when compared to the more discreet attentions of Mary Russell, or the Edinburgh aunts who, with all their faults, <pb id="pg-31-xvi" n="31:xvi"/>looked after JWC kindly when she arrived seasick from crossing the Firth of Forth. Jewsbury, with what JWC called &#x201C;her trade of Novelist&#x201D; had &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">desire of feeling and producing violent emotions.</hi> &#x2026; When I am well I can laugh down this sort of thing in her; but when I am ill it fatigues me dreadfully, and irritates my moral sense as well as my nerves&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-32/lt-18561128-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1856-11-28">28 Nov.</date>]</ref>; see vol. 32).</p>
<p>Even TC learned from his travels that life with his adored Lady Ashburton could be rather tiresome, when, instead of the servanted grandeur of Bath House or the Grange, they were cooped up together in a cold and damp Highland shooting lodge: &#x201C;Her Ladyship, in worse humour than usual, is capable of being driven to extremities by your setting up a peat from its flat posture; so I have learned altogether to abstain! Nothing earthly is to be <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> nothing good to be read, to be said or thought,&#x2014;this is not a luxurious kind of life for a poor wayfaring individual&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560920-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-09-20"><date when="1856-09-22">22</date> [20] Sept.</date></ref>). He was not at home in Kinlochluichart or in the Highlands generally. He told his brother John that it was &#x201C;a deplorable country.&#x201D; The hunting lodge had been bought for sport, and TC had no interest in hunting. The weather was bad: &#x201C;Every day it rains in flintmaking showers, one in five minutes, if one walk <hi rend="italic">off</hi> the highway &#x2026; one runs imminent risk not only of wet feet but of sprained ancles&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560925-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref>). It was so bad that it was not only an inconvenience for TC but was reported in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1856-09-29">29 September</date>, as almost destroying the harvest. The year <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date> saw the beginnings of a recovery from the hardship of the ten-year potato famine and a bad harvest would have inflicted great damage on the fragile Highland economy. Fortunately, the weather improved after TC left, and the harvest was saved.</p>
<p>TC had little sympathy for Highlanders. During the <date>1840s</date> and <date>1850s</date>, when many Highland estates were being sold off by the hereditary landlords, it became fashionable for some wealthy Scots Lowlanders and English families like the Ashburtons to buy or rent Highland estates for hunting. Other new owners, like some of the earlier owners, introduced large-scale sheep farming, resulting in depopulation. TC&#x2019;s perception was of &#x201C;a country <hi rend="italic">totally</hi> unimproved by the Natives; but considerably improvable,&#x2014;thanks to South country farmers who are coming in here and there with their draining apparatus and their Cheviot sheep&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560925-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1856-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref>). TC chose not to stay at the estate of one of the better kind of southern landowner, Edward Ellice, friend of the Ashburtons and the Carlyles, who had an estate fifty miles from Kinlochluichart (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560923-TC-EEL-01">TC to <sic>EE</sic><corr>EEL</corr>, <date when="1856-09-23">23 Sept.</date></ref>). The Ellices were English but had strong connections with the north of Scotland. Ellice&#x2019;s son, also Edward, who had greatly increased the family estates, was interested not just in ownership of land but also in the welfare of its inhabitants. He opposed the Highland clearances and assisted emigration, and fought for more humane administration of the Scottish Poor Law.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-xvii" n="31:xvii"/>What the letters make abundantly plain is the continuing intellectual energy of both Carlyles, despite the obvious problems of health, temperament, and nervous irritability. Their lives in these months, as in other years, are punctuated by visits to the Ashburtons&#x2019; homes, where they met many intellectually stimulating conversationalists and companions. They also describe the steady stream of visitors in the afternoons and evenings in the Chelsea drawing room, which JWC had enlarged and redecorated at such cost of nerves and energy in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>. The streams of visitors are even more visible in the months of her Journal (<date when="1856-03-00">March</date> to early <date when="1856-07-00">July 1856</date>; see vol. 30), as it gives much more precise details of both those who visited the house, and the social occasions that both of them, or JWC on her own, took part in outside of the house. The fascinating counterpoint between the public face of the Carlyles&#x2014;genial, enthusiastic, passionately friendly&#x2014;and the more morbid and acid commentary that enlivens their letters is even more vividly present with the counterpoint that is possible only at this period between both their letters and the Journal. We know that TC at the Grange at the beginning of the year made his impatience at Tennyson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Maud</hi> all too clear even in the poet&#x2019;s company (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560110-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, [<date when="1856-01-00">10 Jan.</date>]</ref>), but JWC (who no doubt kept her own counsel in public) wrote in private of Tennyson, &#x201C;going about asking everybody if they like his <hi rend="italic">Maud</hi>&#x2014;and reading <hi rend="italic">Maud</hi> aloud&#x2014;and talking of Maud, Maud, Maud till I wished myself far away among people who only read and wrote prose or who neither read nor wrote at all&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560110-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, [<date when="1856-01-10">10 Jan.</date>]</ref>). TC could thank Ruskin for volume 3 of <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters</hi> and call it in his letter &#x201C;the real <hi rend="italic">Sermon</hi> of the season and Epoch&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560118-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1856-01-18">18 Jan.</date></ref>). But JWC&#x2019;s letters to William Allingham are far more interesting in their recognition of Ruskin the man as well as Ruskin the writer: &#x201C;As for Ruskin; I never saw a man so improved by the loss of his wife! He is amiable and gay, and full of hope and faith in&#x2014;one doesn&#x2019;t exactly know <hi rend="italic">what</hi>&#x2014;but of course <hi rend="italic">he</hi> does.&#x201D; She concluded: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ruskin must have been hard to please&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560223-JWC-WA-01">JWC to WA, <date when="1856-02-23">23 Feb.</date></ref>).</p>
<p>TC was very private in his research and his writing in these months, but far from invisible to a generation that had come to recognize, in his moral, ethical, and social writings, one of the foremost influences in the thought of Victorian Britain (or, as both he and others infuriatingly continued to call it, &#x201C;England&#x201D;). Writers like James Martineau (in the <hi rend="italic">National Review</hi> of <date when="1856-10-00">October 1856</date>) bracketed TC with Newman and Coleridge as a wellspring of &#x201C;the altered spirit, in regard to religion, pervading the young intellect of England.&#x201D; He wrote there with enthusiasm of TC&#x2019;s hostility to rationalism:</p>
<q>The very things which this desiccating rationalism flung off, were to Mr. Carlyle just the essence and whole worth of the universe: and to show that beauty, truth, and goodness, could not thus be got rid of, while <pb id="pg-31-xviii" n="31:xviii"/>imposters were hired to bear their name; that religion is not hope and fear, or duty prudence, or art a skill to please; that behind the sensible there lies a spiritual, and beneath all relative phenomena an absolute reality,&#x2014;was evidently, if not his early vow, at least his first inspiration. Surely it was an authentic appointment to a noble work: and on looking back over his quarter-century, no one can deny that it has been manfully achieved.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Martineau, &#x201C;Personal Influences on Present Theology,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">National Review,</hi> <date when="1856-10-00">Oct. 1856</date>; rptd. in <hi rend="italic">Essays, Reviews, and Addresses,</hi> 4 vols. (London: Longmans, Green, <date when="1890-00-00">1890</date>), 219&#x2013;81 (quotation on 267).</note></q>
<p>Like him or not, TC was obviously a force in his time. Another eminent Scot of the times, George Gilfillan, made the point when lecturing in the Queen Street Hall, Edinburgh, in <date when="1856-02-00">February 1856</date>: &#x201C;He alluded to Carlyle&#x2019;s last lamentable letter to John Sterling. He was afraid that John Sterling had left this world stripped of every hope by a friendly hand. Mr. Gilfillan then referred to Mr. Carlyle&#x2019;s calumnious view of the public teaching of Christianity, and drew a picture of the great loss which the world would sustain if the ministrations of the pulpit were withdrawn.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Scotsman,</hi> <date when="1856-02-16">16 Feb. 1856</date>.</note> Superbly indifferent to most criticism, TC would barely have noticed such comment. Curiously insensitive to his effect on those who wrote, he could dismiss Browning&#x2019;s offering of <hi rend="italic">Men and Women</hi> with the remarkable summing-up: &#x201C;My friend, it is what they call &#x2018;unintelligibility&#x2019;! That is a fact: you are dreadfully difficult to understand; and that is really a sin. Admit the accusation: I testify to it; I found most of your Pieces too hard of interpretation, and more than one (chiefly of the short kind) I had to read as a very enigma&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560425-TC-RB-01">TC to RB, <date when="1856-04-25">25 April</date></ref>). Continuing his diatribe against poetry, a week later, he was writing to an unidentified correspondent that &#x201C;whatever the idle humour of mankind, thro&#x2019; their Newspapers and Literary Gazettes, may be in our time, there is no idler trade now carried on than that of verse-writing, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of the thousand, now is; not any in which success is more uncertain, nor more utterly worthless to a serious man, when it does come&#x201D; (<date when="1856-05-01">1 May</date>).</p>
<p>The Carlyles remain supremely gifted enigmas in this volume, as in previous ones. Sociable, private, generous, sarcastic, wonderful letter writers, demanding letter receivers, they were at the heart of a network that makes them exceptional observers not only of their London environment but also of a larger canvas that could include farmsteads in the Lowlands and shooting lodges in the Highlands of Scotland. Characteristically, TC puts down his pen with the realization that even his gifts as a letter writer were inadequate to the task he set himself: &#x201C;Oh Goody, Oh poor Goody, Goody! How hard and cold <pb id="lastpage-31-xix" n="31:xix"/>is my talk in contrast to the thought that lies in me,&#x2014;obstructed by the East Wind alone! May God bless thee: that, any way, is one prayer that I can pronounce with entire completeness of utterance. But I think it now certain you will leave this world one day without ever knowing what my heart was towards you&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-31/lt-18560821-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref>). JWC would not have committed such a thought to paper, nor anticipated the outpouring of TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> that her death in <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> was to provoke. What these months of <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date> brought to them both was a physical return to their roots, not just for a fleeting stay but for long enough to consider the thirty years of their marriage and the twenty-two years they had spent together in Chelsea.</p>

<p>Thanks kindly; and many counter wishes from us both, as cordial as they can well be. We are delighted both of us to hear your good news:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster had been appointed sec. of the Lunacy Commission (late <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>) at &#xa3;800 a year and resigned as ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>.</note> no man deserves such a piece of good fortune better, or has more right to be congratulated on any occasion of joy by those whom he ranks as friends. This thing, in the uncertainties of literature and health, is altogether well and suitable, and comfortably closes the gap on the side of economic contingencies. Long may the good Forster live to enjoy this and the other blessings he has. By no man&#x2019;s good luck are his fellow men <hi rend="italic">less</hi> likely to reap other than kindly fruits: that I will say for the man!&#x2014;</p>
<p>We are getting on here <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [one way or another]: I fancy myself improving a little in bodily health; for I walk, ride, pass nearly all my daylight time in the open air;&#x2014;and am as <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> as the brown leaf upon the south wind now blowing. I find on survey that there is really no other &#x201C;duty&#x201D; well capable of being done on present terms. Ten days more, and it will be over; and we shall then see how the old harness sits on us.</p>
<p>We are a fluctuating company; come like shadows and so depart.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> 4.1. John Tyndall (<sic><date when="1802-00-00">1802</date></sic><corr><date when="1820-00-00">1820</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1893-00-00">93</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27948"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) was to be one of those who came and went; Lord Ashburton, one of the managers of the Royal Institution, where Tyndall was prof. of natural philosophy from <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, had invited him. On his arrival, <date when="1856-01-11">11 Jan.</date>, he found Lord Ashburton in a wheelchair because of gout; he listened to fellow guests talking about TC and heard Lady Ashburton read aloud from Browning, &#x201C;Carlyle at intervals grunting out assent. Once he said &#x2018;that&#x2019;s just it, faith is the conviction in something not the discerning of its truth&#x2019; or some words to that effect.&#x201D; He talked briefly with TC and then discussed education with Lord Ashburton. This was followed by homemade entertainments, with Carlyle roaring with laughter: &#x201C;One feature strikes you every where, and that is the thorough freedom of every body, each seems to do just as he likes; wanders where he pleases through the magnificent rooms; reads, talks, or admires the pictures.&#x201D; At breakfast, TC was not what Tyndall expected. They discussed homeopathy, which drew in almost everyone at the table: &#x201C;What I have seen of Carlyle makes me revere the old brute more than ever. Nobody seems to agree with him, but he pushes his way through it all, dealing out doom and praise.&#x201D; TC spoke about the Crimean War, that fools seemed to think it could be won by writing in the <hi rend="italic">Times.</hi> Tyndall described the &#x201C;absence of all formality and restraint.&#x201D; At lunch TC was &#x201C;cordial and human.&#x201D; JWC thought it &#x201C;too bad of Carlyle to have hit me so hard on the question of homeopathy.&#x201D; After dinner, he tried to &#x201C;stir&#x201D; TC by discussing scientific theories about &#x201C;the nature of life &#x2026; ascribing it to molecular force,&#x201D; but TC was immovable on its &#x201C;incomprehensibility.&#x201D; TC &#x201C;spoke solemnly, earnestly and lovingly of his great brother [Emerson]. &#x2026; I loved the tones of Carlyle&#x2019;s voice&#x201D; as he spoke of Emerson. TC thought Lewes&#x2019;s life of Goethe admirable but not a true image. Goethe &#x201C;ought to have been King of Germany.&#x201D; Tyndall sat by JWC at dinner and enjoyed talking to her. She spoke about TC&#x2019;s attitude to criticism, his contempt for anonymous letters (possibly thinking about the anonymous letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> about the Lowe subscription; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551107-TC-CHDI-01"><sic>30:108</sic><corr>TC to CHDI, <date when="1855-11-07">7 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>), about Charles Kingsley being &#x201C;rank and noisy,&#x201D; and young women&#x2019;s admiration of TC. They discussed the difference between him and Macaulay, who took &#x201C;pleasure in pulling men down.&#x201D; At breakfast, they discussed Goethe again, and TC said he thought little of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> in comparison with his other work: &#x201C;Beau Brummel was a reality equal to Mephistopheles. A friend came to him one morning and asked him how he did. &#x2018;Suffering from cold,&#x2019; said he in in his own imperturbable way, &#x2018;I have been sleeping with a damp woman all night!&#x2019; The tone of Carlyle&#x2019;s voice in repeating the anecdote was extremely rich: indeed &#x2026; it could be put beside the best of Mephistopheles.&#x201D; At lunch, TC talked about the Chinese novel <hi rend="italic">Two Fair Cousins</hi> (see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520910-JWC-JRS-01"><sic>27:279</sic><corr>JWC to JRS, <date when="1852-09-10">10 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>) and then about libraries: &#x201C;Sometimes during this conversation Carlyle&#x2019;s words rose to eloquence. Branching off from his description &#x2026; his eyes would gleam, his voice become more deep and solemn while his fingers would squeeze and crush his napkin. &#x2026; His fingers were the accompaniment of his thoughts, and he crushed his napkin repeatedly before the conversation ended.&#x201D; As Tyndall left, TC gave him a &#x201C;cordial squeeze of the hand&#x201D; (Tyndall to Hirst, dated <date when="1856-01-12">12 Jan.</date>, with a note &#x201C;sent <date when="1856-01-19">19 Jan.</date>&#x201D;; typed copy, Tyndall Papers, Royal Institution).</note> The <pb id="pg-31-2" n="31:2"/>agreeablest phenomenon at present is Alfred Tenny<hi rend="italic">n</hi> who came two days ago and is still to hold out a little while.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson had corresponded with Lady Ashburton since the <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>s and had had several invitations to the Grange and the other Ashburton homes, all of which he had refused; this was his first visit (see Richard Moore, &#x201C;New Letters from Tennyson to the Ashburtons,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Tennyson Research Bulletin</hi> 7 [<date when="1998-11-00">Nov. 1998</date>]: 75&#x2013;82).

At his side was Carlyle, who had been publishing his contempt of poetry. Immolating myself to the public cause, I went over to Carlyle and asked him to come for a walk. &#x2026; While we were gone, the reading came off&#x201D; (Goldwin Smith, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> [<date when="1910-00-00">1910</date>] 142). Mrs. Brookfield also described this: &#x201C;Lord and Lady Ashburton were kept waiting; chairs had been arranged in a quiet sitting room; the visitors (ourselves amongst the number) were taking their places. Alfred was ready. So was Carlyle&#x2014;in the Hall&#x2014;waiting for a companion in his walk, and evidently determined not to stir without one. It was quite an anxious moment. We each of us probably wondered which of us would volunteer to leap into the gulf. &#x2026; At length Mr. Godwin Smith generously stepped forward &#x2026; and then William joined them&#x201D; (Brookfield, <hi rend="italic">Circle</hi> 2:428&#x2013;29). According to H. J. Jennings, JWC had already heard Tennyson read &#x201C;Maud&#x201D; three times before it was published in <date when="1855-07-00">July 1855</date> (see <hi rend="italic">Lord Tennyson: A Biographical Sketch</hi> [<date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 155&#x2013;56), but an annotation by Tennyson on the Tennyson Research Centre&#x2019;s copy denied that the readings took place.</note>&#x2014;Oh Heavens!

Rickards, <hi rend="italic">Zoe Thomson of Bishopthorpe</hi> [<date when="1916-00-00">1916</date>] 63&#x2013;64). Henry Taylor wrote that Zoe Thomson &#x201C;lighted up the black coats more or less, though she was not as vivacious as a Greek should be but rather, in a graceful way, quiet and retiring. &#x2026; [T]here was a great deal that was agreeable and interesting in the party; and had there been three more elements in it,&#x2014;youth, folly and music,&#x2014;there would have been nothing to its charm&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Henry Taylor <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date></hi> [<date when="1885-00-00">1885</date>] 2:141).</note></p>

<salute>Dear Ruskin.</salute>
<p>Last night your beautiful Book<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vol. 3 of Ruskin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters;</hi> advertised, <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> <date when="1856-01-19">19 Jan.</date>; H.

Success appears to have converted such knowledge as our author originally possessed into an imperiousness which brooks no question. Whether they be the fumes of the tripod, or the fumes of self-admiration, which have mounted into Mr. Ruskin&#x2019;s brain, let others tell.&#x201D; It ends: &#x201C;We cannot close this volume without regretting such waste of power, knowledge, and fancy. Mr. Ruskin has eloquence and taste enough to interest the best audience of his age:&#x2014;and he chooses to throw away the choicest gifts of nature on paradox.&#x201D;</note> was handed in to me; a very handsome welcome indeed on one&#x2019;s return home.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Carlyles returned Mon., <date when="1856-01-14">14 Jan.</date></note> I have already galloped extensively up and down over it; find that it will be excellent reading for me in the coming nights.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your active remembrance of my wants and me; to you and to another high Personage,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prince Albert. The Ashburtons had also left the Grange on <date when="1856-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, for a visit to Windsor.</note> I am surely much indebted in these days!</p>
<p>It is the opinion, then, that some important, not superficial but essential, improvement in military <hi rend="italic">tactics</hi> has been introduced, in the Prussian and all Armies, since Frederick had done with them? I wish much to know accurately <hi rend="italic">what;</hi> who did it, and at least who says it was done. I used to hear the same assertion about Frederick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Strategies</hi> (this of <hi rend="italic">tactics</hi> is quite new to me); but I find after long examination, that such does not appear; that Napoleon did not &#x201C;improve&#x201D; upon Frederick in this respect, but perhaps considerably the <hi rend="italic">reverse;</hi> that in fact he did not differ from Fred<hi rend="italic">k,</hi> except as a blazing Corsican Pirate, of wondrous gifts, and commanding a Nation gone wholly mad, must differ from a veritable Sovereign Man, also of wondrous gifts, whose poor Nation has not gone mad at all, but has to depend on the sober truth of things for any success it may have. Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> could not spend &#x201C;10,000 men aweek,&#x201D; nor blaze away gunpowder and resources at that rate:&#x2014;what a dreadful expense was that in <hi rend="italic">mendacities</hi> alone (the account of it not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> settled in France by any means)! Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> never wrote a <hi rend="italic">bulletin;</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unlike Napoleon; see <hi rend="italic">Bulletins officiels de la Grande Arm&#xE9;e, dict&#xE9;s par l&#x2019;Empereur Napol&#xE9;on, et recueillis par A. Goujon, &#x2026; contenant les Campagnes d&#x2019;Austerlitz, de Jena, de Prusse,</hi> 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>). See also &#x201D; &#x2018;False as a bulletin&#x2019; became a proverb in Napoleon&#x2019;s time&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Heroes, Works</hi> 5:238).</note> I believe it will turn out that his feats of soldiership were far ahead of Napoleon&#x2019;s, so soon as men recover their eyesight, and learn to discriminate greatness from bulk. Wellington,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Arthur Wellesley (<date when="1769-00-00">1769</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29001"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 1st duke of Wellington, field marshal.</note> in his way, was a soldier of the Frederick kind. Anybody that tries the Napoleon line, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a &#x201C;mad&#x201D; Nation to depend on will certainly run his head against stone walls,&#x2014;of which these have been instances in our day!</p>
<p>All this however has nothing to do with special improvements in <hi rend="italic">tactics,</hi> <pb id="pg-31-8" n="31:8"/>drilling of men &#x26;c &#x26;c: and I am very anxious to get to the bottom of what you assert on that head.</p>
<p>I read <hi rend="italic">Jomini,</hi> for many painful weeks, with great diligence, some years ago,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine Henri Jomini (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), baron, gen., and military writer; TC read his <hi rend="italic">Pr&#xE9;cis de l&#x2019;Art de la Guerre</hi> (Paris, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>) in <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">52</date>; see <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511209-TC-JWC-01"><sic>26:256</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1851-12-09">9 Dec. 1851</date></corr></ref>, <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520110-TC-LA-01"><sic>27:9</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1852-01-10">10 Jan. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520706-TC-JN-01"><sic>154</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-07-06">6 July 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> all that he had to say about Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> and his campaigns; but gained absolutely nothing from Jomini, except the growing suspicion (now become a private conviction with me) that nothing could be gained from him; that he had not even studied this matter well; that he had, with very much to say for himself, a most feeble unfurnished intellect, was not to be depended on for common honesty (steals Tempelhof&#x2019;s<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Georg Friedrich von Tempelhoff (<date when="1737-00-00">1737</date>&#x2013;<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>), German soldier and historian; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520202-TC-JN-01"><sic>27:27</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-02-02">2 Feb. 1852</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520706-TC-JN-01"><sic>154</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1852-07-06">6 July 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note> Plates &#x26;c), and in short would avail a sincere inquirer almost nothing, in spite of the big name. He is continually adoring Buonaparte at the expense of Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> and others, and had <hi rend="italic">bow-wowed</hi> me into that opinion, till I saw better into some things. That is my experience of Jomini.</p>
<p>Clausewitz I had heard of lately, as a truly superior man and writer: I must decidedly look into Clausewitz for this new opinion.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Karl von Clausewitz (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), Prussian army officer, administrator, and modernizer.

TC&#x2019;s view that the &#x201C;Art of War&#x201D; is founded on &#x201C;veracity and human courage and insight, not upon &#x2026; unlimited expenditure of men and gunpowder&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Frederick, Works</hi> 12:7&#x2013;8) suggests Clausewitz&#x2019;s influence.</note> Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Sterling (who knows nothing about the &#x201C;opinion&#x201D;) has a Copy of Clausewitz, which he promises to search out for me tonight,&#x2014;if he <hi rend="italic">can;</hi> for he is off to the Crimea again tomorrow morning,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Sterling.</note> and may fail in the Clausewitz! If he do, I will (with thankful surprise) apply to the High Quarter you indicate,&#x2014;will ask you to apply, that is. I suppose it is not seemly for the like of me to thank H.R.H.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His Royal Highness.</note> in word or message of any kind; but I hope you will, on some good occasion, indicate for me how sensible I am to this mark of humanity in high places.</p>
<p>Not having any chance to see you tonight, I have scribbled all this,&#x2014;which, unless you like, you need not read! I should have desired much to hear how the Gout is,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Ashburton had been in a wheelchair at the Grange because of his gout; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560110-JWC-MW-01">JWC to MW, [<date when="1856-01-10">10 Jan.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;how The Grange generally is,&#x2014;all this while.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>I send you my heart&#x2019;s blessing, in words if that is useful, before the week depart;&#x2014;I beg you to forgive all my sins, I do indeed with a humble and contrite mind! They are many and great; but not against <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with my will; no, nor ever can be, while will is left me in this world. You may depend on that; for that is very true.</p>
<p>All these days I have been the idlest, feeblest, and probably among the unhappiest of mankind; never felt so vanquished, overwhelmed and totally useless,&#x2014;or hardly ever,&#x2014;in my life before. Incapable of writing, of thinking, of acting. In fact a down-broken creature indeed. Which is shameful to think of. However, I have languidly gathered my tools together again, in some measure cleared the decks; and do mean to rally with the new week, and creep if I cannot walk. You shall hear from me then, when I have become articulate again:&#x2014;or you will come in person, will you not, to the opening the <pb id="pg-31-10" n="31:10"/>Palmerston Palaver,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Parliament reopened <date when="1856-01-31">31 Jan.</date></note> about the end of this month? Which is now nigh. And <hi rend="italic">not</hi> cheat me out of a sight of you, as you sometimes tyrannously do? Oh, it is not for me to complain of your stripes:&#x2014;I am a sinful son of Adam; and you&#x2014;have no malice against me, have you?</p>
<p>All morning Anthony Sterling has been here; just on wing for the Crimea; a very hairy rugged fowl of the air.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 9:2; Ps. 8:8.</note> But we hope Peace is now coming:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1856-01-18">18 Jan.</date>, reported that Russia had accepted unconditionally, <date when="1856-01-17">17 Jan.</date>, the peace proposals put forward by Austria and agreed by the allies with the ultimatum that diplomatic relations would be broken off with Russia if the proposals were not accepted. The agreement was formally signed by France, Britain, Austria, and Russia in Vienna, <date when="1856-02-01">1 Feb.</date> It became the protocol for the Paris peace conference, the first meeting of which took place <date when="1856-02-25">25 Feb.</date></note> a general cessation into &#x201C;As you were,&#x201D; and a wiping of bloody noses after this foolery.</p>
<p>Likewise Lord A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> has been bringing the Prince&#x2019;s military science to bear upon me in the way of indirect criticism;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >About this time Lord Ashburton wrote to Lady Ashburton that TC had &#x201C;complained that he could get from our military men no knowledge of the history of Prussian tactics. I s<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the Prince w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> know.&#x201D; On asking Albert, he was told to refer TC &#x201C;to the United Service Museum, for the best work on that very subject which y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Prince had deposited there long ago for the information of our Officers. The leaves probably will be cut by Carlyle&#x201D; (undated; MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note> two Letters from his Lordship, with an offer of Books, which proves not needful, Sterling having brought them down this morning.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Brydges the Actuary answers me, this morning, that he <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> &#x201C;be ready with his conclusive responses on Wednesday night,&#x201D; but requests that I will give him till Friday night.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1856-01-25">25 Jan.</date></note>&#x2014; So that <hi rend="italic">our</hi> meeting at the Athenaeum, if it is to be conclusive and practical, must stand over till <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> instead of Thursday,&#x2014;as you once gave me the choice. I hope there is still no hindrance on <pb id="pg-31-11" n="31:11"/>your side. In wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> case, no writing; it shall be settled <hi rend="italic">so,</hi> if you say nothing.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I got the &#xa3;20 yesterday morning: many thanks to My Lady and you. I suppose it is Her Ladyship&#x2019;s money, not yours; and must stand in her name? I will put it so unless you prohibit: &#x201C;The Lady Ashburton&#x2014;&#x2014; &#xa3;20&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was listed so in the list of subscribers pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> <date when="1856-05-12">12 May</date>; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560423-TCCDJF-T-01"><sic>TC, CD, and JF</sic><corr>TCCDJF</corr> to <sic>Ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi></sic><corr>T</corr>, <date when="1856-04-23">23 April</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;which will worthily shut-in the Subscription, now, I believe, about &#xa3;250.</p>
<p>Brydges is Actuary of a certain &#x201C;Mitre Insurance Office&#x201D; (in Pall Mall), a <pb id="pg-31-12" n="31:12"/>very innocent intelligent creature; has been making the due business inquiries, and practical preparations, as to this Miss-Lowe matter; he gives his final report on Friday; when I will make him happy by your message. He talks of running over to New Brunswick, this summer, with his scheme;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bridges&#x2019;s scheme in New Brunswick, Canada, is unidentified, though presumably to do with investment. New Brunswick had been granted self-govt. by Britain in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, and a reciprocity treaty with the U.S., <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>, stimulated an already thriving economy.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> corresponds to your notion of what is feasible in the matter,&#x2014;an interest of the Colonies&#x2019;, rather than of ours, just now. Speed to the poor soul, in working this small thread of things! The Destinies are opulent; and find a man for every kind of job.</p>
<p>You say nothing about gout, so I suppose it is steadily retreating or gone;&#x2014;nor about My Lady&#x2019;s cold, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> however I learn otherwise is well over. Quiet, in this fine weather, after such a hurly burly,&#x2014;how welcome to both of you!</p>
<p>I am getting slightly steadier, what may be called better, in body and mind; hope even to profit by my singular month, and all that the beneficent Grange imparted to me in those 28 days, were the account once fairly liquidated.&#x2014; &#x2014; But there lies before me such a sea of mud to be swum thro&#x2019;; and I am such a broken poor soul! Perhaps I shall live to get to the other side, after all.</p>
<p>Every night, since Saturday, I have been in <hi rend="italic">Clausewitz;</hi> who is a truly able man, of strong judgment, clear utterance,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; highly <hi rend="italic">metaphysical</hi> (lost frequently in definitions, theoretic hair-splittings); a visible contemporary of Kant.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Immanuel Kant (<date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>), philosopher.</note> Except Lloyd;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Humphrey Evans Lloyd (<sic><date when="1720-00-00">1720</date>?</sic><corr>ca. <date when="1718-00-00">1718</date></corr>&#x2013;<date when="1783-00-00">83</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16836"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), <hi rend="italic">History of the Late War in Germany between the King of Prussia and the Empress of Germany and Her Allies</hi> (<date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>) 3 vols., trans.

<p>What will surprise you, however, he does not in the least confirm the assertion made, but precisely the reverse;&#x2014;strengthens and clears up, so far as he touches on that matter, the notion I had already groped out about it!

<p>Many thanks for the pleasant, welcome, and useful Letter I had from you the other day; one of the welcomest I have read for a long time.

Such is the fact; beyond doubt, in this bottomless, shoreless, vilely fermenting mud-lake and general reservoir of Human Nonsenses, which is called the &#x201C;Literary Public,&#x201D; I can very well see you too have got an understanding audience scattered up and down; and it may be a satisfaction to reflect on that, in certain moods. &#x201C;The great soul of this world,&#x201D; in spite of its outer nonsenses, &#x201C;is <hi rend="italic">just.</hi>&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>We were at a Country House in Hampshire, during Christmas time; and the entertainment of two evenings, much the best two that turned up, was reading (superlatively well-done) out of Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Men and Women.</hi> The Old Corregidor (&#x201C;How it appears to a Contemporary&#x201D;), that Devils &#x201C;Bishop and Gigadibs&#x201C;:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Old Corregidor,&#x201D; see &#x201C;How It Strikes a Contemporary,&#x201D; line 90; for &#x201C;Gigadibs,&#x201D; see &#x201C;Bishop Bloughram&#x2019;s Apology,&#x201D; line 13; both <hi rend="italic">Men and Women.</hi></note> we sat (being intelligent creatures, all) in rapt attention, with <pb id="pg-31-15" n="31:15"/>the little ruffles of assent (chiefly <hi rend="italic">nasal,</hi> laughter being prohibited as it were), and understood everything,&#x2014;as indeed the melodious clear Voice (Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s) had beforehand taken care to do. Two Evenings, the best two we had; and good hopes there were of more, had not unluckily our reading genius &#x201C;Caught cold,&#x201D; and left us eclipsed thenceforth.

<p>You do me far too much honour, dear Browning, when you ask my poor counsel and judgement about these things. I have never been in doubt about the noble spiritual outfit I discerned in you from our first acquaintance, many years back now; and my faith still is, you have got a great deal to tell your poor fellow creatures contemporary and future.

However, you are so loyal, you shall know what my impressions are, by and by.&#x2014; I wish you lived here, Mrs B. and you, on this side of the sea! <closer><salute>Meanwhile, write now &#x26; then; and all good be ever with you</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p>No book I ever undertook has been such a misery to me, from causes extrinsic and intrinsic, as this of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great;</hi> thoughtlessly gone into, and in which I am still sunk overhead, uncertain yet whether I shall ever get out of it alive.

<p>It will give me real pleasure to see you again, which by some happy chance I hope to do before long. I expect to be steady here, sunk in my sad Brandenburg element of &#x2018;barren sand&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> for many months to come.</p>

<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute>On behalf [For behoof]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where TC has written words above the line, they are placed between square brackets in the text.</note> of such of your readers as took interest in the Subscription for Sam<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Johnson&#x2019;s Goddaughter the aged Miss Lowe and her Sister; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was set on foot in Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> last, will you permit us to announce that the same is about to close.</p>
<p>The sum raised is still [only] considerably under &#xa3;300: but on the other hand, the price of such a [the proposed] Life Annuity proves cheaper than we anticipated; and in addition to this, there has a lucky chance come to help us a little. Mauritius Lowe, Miss Lowe&#x2019;s father, is now discovered to have been the benevolent Painter by whom Turner, at that time a barber&#x2019;s boy, was first recognised, befriended, and saved to Art: in return for which fine action, an ardent and renowned admirer of Turner<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

So that, on the whole, there is now as good as an &#x201C;add<hi rend="italic">al</hi> Annuity of &#xa3;30,&#x201D; &#xa3;30, which was our minimum limit, secured for these aged ladies; and thus by one means and another, our small problem can be considered as done.</p>
<p>One fact must not be omitted: there has been no soliciting, nor shadow of such, anywhere used in this matter. The sum gathered has altogether fallen voluntarily, like the rain or the dew; as genuine gift of the feelings appealed to;&#x2014;rather touching to see amid the huge expenditures (not all of them celestial, or like the dew on Gideon&#x2019;s fleece)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>It surely cannot be unlawful to beg for a word of clear news from you in these distressing circumstances. I am grieved to the heart to think of your anxieties, confusions, and of poor Lord A<hi rend="italic">n&#x2019;s</hi> painful time;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With his gout.</note> and I do not even know whether you are still at Bornemouth or distinctly how or where you are! This is surely <hi rend="italic">beyond</hi> what the Law, with its biggest wig, can prescribe. One little word of clear history, I beg in pity from you.</p>
<p>Of a truth I do not think too <hi rend="italic">seldom</hi> of you, whatever I may do, tho&#x2019; I write nothing! The truth is, I am all <hi rend="italic">dark</hi> as the winter-solstice in Spitzbergen;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The main island in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean.</note> and do not afflict you with my Night Thoughts till the morning dawn<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the anon. religious poem, &#x201D; &#x2018;Night Thoughts&#x2019; Repeated at Dawn&#x201D; (<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>).</note> again. As surely it will and must?&#x2014; To add to all, I am a good way below average in health;&#x2014;sad dinner at Lord Goderich&#x2019;s<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1856-01-28">28 Jan.</date> TC noted &#x201C;(<date when="1856-01-29">29 jan</date><hi rend="italic">y;</hi> dining at L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Goderich&#x2019;s last night: alas, alas!)&#x2014;Not the least likelihood of finishing Voltaire&#x2019;s business in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> way.

I am sorrowfully worse. &#x201C;Serve him right!&#x201D; that is what the bystander may well say; and what I myself say.</p>
<p>One sad consolation is, I do not quit work: I must not, or I should go mad! At a snail&#x2019;s pace (sometimes, alas, at a <hi rend="italic">crab&#x2019;s,</hi> the wrong way), I keep puddling along, whether dead or alive: some day I shall get delivered; and then&#x2014;perhaps all things will be better!</p>
<p>One word, dear Lady,&#x2014;and as many merciful thoughts as your kind heart can spare, the noble goodness of which I will not doubt of, whatever else I may fall to doubting.</p>

For the rest, you will be interested to hear that within the last two weeks, I have made two involuntary attempts on my life; neither of which proved fatal!

<salute>Dear Lady Stanley,</salute>
<p>I need not say, &#x201C;I would with much pleasure&#x201D;; for that you already know, this long while past! But the sad fact is, I am so low and sickly I cannot go out to dine at all, in these weeks,&#x2014;but have to sit mournful at home; up to the chin in old &#x201C;Brandenburg rubbish,&#x201D; unhappy that I am! I hope to get sight of you soon, some morning; and that you will drop a tear over me from those fine eyes.</p>

<p><salute>Sir,&#x2014;</salute>On behalf of such of your readers as took interest in the subscription for Samuel Johnson&#x2019;s goddaughter, the aged Miss Lowe, and her sister, which was set on foot in November last, will you permit us to announce that the same is about to close?</p>
<p>The sum raised is still but a little over 250<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>; but, on the other hand, the price of such a life annuity as was proposed proves cheaper than we anticipated; and in addition to this there has been a lucky chance come to help us somewhat. Mauritius Lowe, Miss Lowe&#x2019;s father, is now discovered to have been the benevolent painter by whom Turner, at that time a barber&#x2019;s boy, was first recognized, befriended, and saved to art, in return for which fine action an ardent and renowned admirer of Turner<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/lt-18551106-TC-RMM-01"><sic>30:107</sic><corr>TC to RMM, <date when="1855-11-06">6 Nov. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> (whose name we need not indicate further) desires to gratify himself by bestowing henceforth 5<hi rend="italic">l.</hi> annually on the Misses Lowe, and permits us to publish his resolution, if that can make it more binding. So that, on the whole, there is now as good as an &#x201C;additional annuity of 30<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>,&#x201D; which was our <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> limit, secured for these aged ladies; and thus, by one means and another, our small problem can be considered as done.</p>
<p>One fact must not be omitted. There has been no soliciting, nor shadow of such, anywhere used in this matter. The sum gathered has altogether fallen <pb id="pg-31-26" n="31:26"/>voluntarily. Very sincerely we beg to thank our fellow-contributors, and dismiss the little transient assemblage with a kindly farewell.</p>
<p>The subscription-books at Messrs. Coutts&#x2019;s, Strand, and at Messrs. Grote and Prescott&#x2019;s, 62, Threadneedle-street, City, will continue open until Wednesday, the 12th of March. After Wednesday, the 12th of March, they will be closed, and the net amount will then promptly be invested in the form of life annuity for the Misses Lowe,&#x2014;we expect, in the Mitre Insurance-office, 23, Pall-mall,&#x2014;and, so soon as that operation is complete, the list of subscribers will be published in <hi rend="italic">The Times.</hi></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I like to believe myself interesting to you and so I write to tell you about my side&#x2014;or breast&#x2014;(for I never know which to call it. the hurt being just where the rib joins the breast bone). I had made up my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> mind&#x2014;that after mustard blistering at it for four whole days (!) to subdue the inflamation; there was nothing more to be done&#x2014; But Countess Pepoli (Elizabeth Fergus) and my chief Friend Geraldine Jewsbury made such long faces and prayed so hard I would &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">see</hi> a Surgeon&#x201C;&#x2014;that finally I <hi rend="italic">saw a surgeon</hi>&#x2014;and what was worse a surgeon &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">saw</hi> me<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I, Johnny Peep, saw three sheep, / And then three sheep saw me, etc.&#x201D; (A.

<p>The pain is wearing off gradually and rapidly within the last few days&#x2014;so that now I can lie in any position&#x2014;indeed hardly feel it&#x2014;and believe it to have been nothing but a simple <hi rend="italic">sprain</hi></p>

One pair of eyes would be very blithe to see you. The sight of your handwriting, even that does me good, beyond what you imagine: I sink into such misgivings, scepticisms of the plainest truths, total (temporary) unbeliefs, in this dark element of mine.

<p><pb id="pg-31-34" n="31:34"/><hi rend="italic">To the Honourable the House of Commons, in Parliament assembled, The Petition of the Undersigned Women of Great Britain, Married and Single,</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">Humbly Sheweth</hi>,&#x2014;That the manifold evils occasioned by the present law, by which the property and earnings of the wife are thrown into the absolute power of the husband, become daily more apparent. That the sufferings thereupon ensuing, extend over all classes of society. That it might once have been deemed for the middle and upper ranks, a comparatively theoretical question, but is so no longer, since married women of education are entering on every side the fields of literature and art, in order to increase the family income by such exertions.</p>
<p>That it is usual when a daughter marries in these ranks, to make, if possible some distinct pecuniary provision for her and her children, and to secure the money thus set aside by a cumbrous machinery of Trusteeship, proving that few parents are willing entirely to entrust the welfare of their offspring to the irresponsible power of the husband, to the chances of his character, his wisdom, and his success in a profession.</p>
<p>That another device for the protection of women, who can afford to appeal, exists in the action of the Courts of Equity, which attempt within certain limits to redress the deficiencies of the Law; but that trustees may prove dishonest or unwise in the management of the funds entrusted to their care, and Courts of Equity may fail in adjusting differences which concern the most intimate and delicate relation of life;&#x2014;that legal devices, patched upon a law which is radically unjust, can only work clumsily, and that here, as in many other departments of justice, a clearance of the ground is the chief thing necessary. That, since this is a truth, which has gradually come to be recognised in regard to protective restrictions upon trade, to titles of property in land, and to the legal machinery for conveying such property from one owner to another, &#x26;c., we would hope that before long it will also come to be recognised in matrimonial legislation.</p>
<p>That it is proved by well-known cases of hardship suffered by women of station, and also by professional women earning large incomes by pursuit of the arts, how real is the injury inflicted.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-35" n="31:35"/>That if these laws often bear heavily upon women protected by the forethought of their relatives, the social training of their husbands, and the refined customs of the rank to which they belong, how much more unequivocal is the injury sustained by women in the lower classes, for whom no such provision can be made by their parents, who possess no means of appeal to expensive legal protection, and in regard to whom the education of the husband and the habits of his associates offer no moral guarantee for tender consideration of a wife.</p>
<p>That whereas it is customary in manufacturing districts to employ women largely in the processes of trade, and as women are also engaged as sempstresses, laundresses, charwomen and in other multifarious occupations which cannot here be enumerated, the question must be recognised by all as of practical importance.</p>
<p>That newspapers constantly detail instances of marital oppression, &#x201C;wife-beating,&#x201D; being a new compound noun lately introduced into the English language, and a crime against which English gentlemen have lately enacted stringent regulations.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A bill for the &#x201C;better Prevention and Punishment of Aggravated Assaults upon Women and Children,&#x201D; applying to England and Wales, had been introduced to Parliament, <date when="1853-03-10">10 March 1853</date>, citing several recent cases of men charged with beating their wives. The word &#x201C;wife-beating&#x201D; was not used in the bill or debates. The act was passed <date when="1853-06-14">14 June 1853</date>. The <hi rend="italic">OED</hi> cites &#x201C;wife-beating tyrant&#x201D; from Mary Russell Mitford, <hi rend="italic">Our Village: Sketches of Rural Character and Scenery</hi> (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) 4:86 and George Eliot&#x2019;s use, <date when="1856-01-00">Jan. 1856</date> (see n.2).</note></p>
<p>But that for the robbery of a man of his wife&#x2019;s hard [won]<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted in <hi rend="italic">Leader.</hi></note> earnings there is no redress&#x2014;against the selfishness of a drunken father, who wrings from a mother her children&#x2019;s daily bread there is no appeal. She may work from morning till night, to see the produce of her labour wrested from her and wasted in a Gin Palace, and such cases are within the knowledge of every one.</p>
<p>That the law, in depriving the mother of all pecuniary resources, deprives her of the power of giving schooling to her children, and in other ways providing for their moral and physical welfare; it obliges her, in short, to leave them to the temptations of the street, so fruitful in juvenile crime.</p>
<p>That there are certain portions of the law of husband and wife which bear unjustly on the husband, as, for instance, that of making him responsible for his wife&#x2019;s debts contracted before marriage, even although he may have had no fortune with her. Her power also after marriage, of contracting debts in the name of her husband, for which he is responsible, is too unlimited, and often produces much injustice.</p>
<p>That in rendering the husband responsible for the entire maintenance of his family, the law expresses the necessities of an age, when the man was the only money-getting agent; but that since the custom of the country has <pb id="pg-31-36" n="31:36"/>greatly changed in this respect the position of the female sex, the law of maintenance no longer meets the whole case. That since modern civilisation, in indefinitely extending the sphere of occupation for women, has in some measure broken down their pecuniary dependence upon men, it is time that legal protection be thrown over the produce of their labour, and that in entering the state of marriage, they no longer pass from freedom into the condition of a slave, all whose earnings belong to his master and not to himself.</p>
<p>That the laws of various foreign countries are in this respect much more just than our own, and afford precedent for a more liberal legislation than prevails in England<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Norton had made great rhetorical play with the differences between the divorce laws of England and those in Scotland, where divorce was supposedly more accessible to women, in <hi rend="italic">A Letter to the Queen on Lord Chancellor Cranworth&#x2019;s Marriage and Divorce Bill</hi> (<date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>) 14&#x2013;33.</note>&#x2014;and your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will take the foregoing allegations into consideration, and apply such remedy as to its wisdom shall seem fit&#x2014;</p>
<p><title>And your Petitioners will ever pray.</title></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter was delivered me last night at the Athenaeum; the first chance they had had of me there. I go very seldom to that or any other place at present, being extremely busy.</p>
<p>Oliver Cromwell has no squint, stare, or deficiencies of any kind in the eyes of him. One eye (probably the left right?, but I am not sure) is considerably bigger than the other; that is to say, wider open,&#x2014;habit of <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> intently, and rather with one&#x2019;s right side, for sake of the right hand?&#x2014; He has no wart on his underlip, nor anywhere but above one eyebrow, near the nose (right side, I think?): a small tuft of a <hi rend="italic">Charles-First</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A short pointed beard.</note> is visible on the underlip, thin moustache on the upper: nothing more, of the mark kind, in that quarter. He is found, on measurement, to have a face <hi rend="italic">bigger</hi> than almost any other man&#x2019;s,&#x2014;among its various other prominences, this is one.</p>
<p>There are very many false and absurd Portraits of Oliver in circulation: nevertheless the real face of him is capable of being perfectly well known The dead mask of it is to be had in Stucco-shops (a man with an Italian name near Soho-square used to have them);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Paul Garbanati, carver and gilder, 31 High St., St. Giles&#x2019;s, in <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date> Post Office <hi rend="italic">Directory,</hi> and 14 Marlebone St. (later Glasshouse St.), Piccadilly, in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> <hi rend="italic">Directory,</hi> both addresses near Soho Sq. Woolner later acquired a death mask of Cromwell from Garbanati from which he had seven casts taken. He gave one of them to TC in <date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>. He also gave TC a memorandum saying why it was a more authentic likeness than other casts and describing the provenance of the mask, saying that &#x201C;Mr. Garbanati of Glasshouse St.&#x201D; had bought it in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date> (MS: Houghton fMS Am <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date> [2]). In <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>, TC gave the cast and the memorandum to Charles Eliot Norton (<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>); see <hi rend="italic">Letters of Charles Eliot Norton,</hi> ed. Sarah Norton and M. A. DeWolfe Howe (<date when="1913-00-00">1913</date>) 1:478. In <date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>, after TC&#x2019;s death, Norton gave the mask to Harvard University, &#x201C;that it may be with those books relating to Cromwell which Mr Carlyle has bequeathed to it with such memorable and affecting words&#x201D; (MS: Houghton: fMS Am <date when="1792-00-00">1792</date> [3]).</note> a goodish Oil Picture is to be found in the Museum: Cooper &#x201C;that prince of limners&#x201D; (as old Anthony Wood, his contemporary, justly calls him) did an elaborate and extremely successful Miniature of Oliver;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;goodish Oil Picture&#x201D; is possibly the <date when="1654-00-00">1654</date> portrait by Peter Lely (<date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>&#x2013;<date when="1680-00-00">80</date>), now owned by Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery, or one of the portraits by Robert Walker (d. <date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>?), although TC told Norton, &#x201C;[t]he portrait of him by Walker isn&#x2019;t Cromwell; but the miniature by Cooper has got his face. I had it engraved for my book, but the subtile excellence of the portrait all oozed out in the process&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Letters of Charles Eliot Norton</hi> 1:455). Samuel Cooper (<date when="1609-00-00">1609</date>&#x2013;<date when="1672-00-00">72</date>); Anthony &#xc0; Wood (<date when="1632-00-00">1632</date>&#x2013;<date when="1695-00-00">95</date>), historian. For the engraving of Cromwell from Cooper&#x2019;s <date when="1656-00-00">1656</date> miniature, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:frontispiece. The original is in the National Portrait Gallery, London.</note> one or more, which he seems to have copied several times, being now <pb id="pg-31-41" n="31:41"/>master of the face: such Coopers, in perfect preservation, still exist in the hands of persons tracing descent to Cromwell;&#x2014;I know one of undoubted genuineness in a House in Essex:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced. TC had been driven by FitzGerald, <date when="1855-08-00">Aug. 1855</date>, to a &#x201C;notable mansion&#x201D; with &#x201C;a notable Portrait of Oliver,&#x201D; about 9 mi. from Woodbridge, Suffolk, but 9 mi. would not have taken them into Essex, nor was TC impressed by the portrait; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>30:34</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1855-08-15">15 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> what I can believe to be, as it were, the very face of Cromwell, or the nearest we shall ever come to that. Cooper (if one avoid well the <hi rend="italic">spurious</hi> &#x201C;Coopers,&#x201D; which also exist in plenty) was the man of men to do such a face. There are Medals also by good contemporary hands;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Simon (<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1665-00-00">65</date>), chief engraver of the Tower Mint, created most of Cromwell&#x2019;s medals; some are in the National Portrait Gallery, London; see John Cooper, <hi rend="italic">Oliver the First</hi> (<date when="1999-00-00">1999</date>) 12&#x2013;18. The medal in Swansea is untraced.</note> and I know one Medallion (at Swansea in Wales) which much pleased me.</p>
<p>In all the good Pictures the eyes have a singular wild earnestness, wild silent sorrow you might call it; the mouth and lips are very grand: the face altogether is heroically grim and heroically kind and true (in Cooper especially) to the superlative degree. On the whole I am not acquainted with any grander human countenance, to my thinking.</p>

The motion was agreed.</note>&#x2014; A most sordid platitude; well worthy of being reprobrated<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and rebuked. If indeed there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> any public still left to whom you can appeal, on behalf of the Heroic, against platitudes done in high places and low? Which we are bound to believe there is; tho&#x2019;, for my share, I often think I do not know where it lives at present,&#x2014;and in fact have taken shelter by withdrawing out of the dirty welter altogether for the time; and never by any chance look into a Morning Newspaper; but keep well to windward rather, while these big Tumbrils of the Spiritual Night-soil are in passage, poisoning the blessed air of the Heaven-sent new Day of one&#x2019;s life! Do you, therefore, if you still have faith, pitch into that turpitude; and call a dull-nosed public to look at it: I can have no opportunity upon it. I should not have known what you meant, had not a man happened to call yesterday, with some rumour that there had been a Debate (bless the mark!) <hi rend="italic">about</hi> having a National Picture Gallery, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has long been an aspiration of mine.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s paper proposing a national portrait gallery, sent to Lord Ashburton in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>, see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530909-TC-RWE-01"><sic>28:264</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1853-09-09">9 Sept. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note> &#x201C;A <hi rend="italic">coronet</hi> or Westminster Abbey&#x201C;: Oh Heavens, Oh Earth!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are a happy swift man; I here, slower than the snail or the boring worm and yet human, am very unhappy; buried in endless Giant Mountains of Prussian Pedantry, Prussian Stupidity and <hi rend="italic">In</hi>fidelity; seeking a poor prize after all, even if I should attain it! However, I shall perhaps get <hi rend="italic">out</hi> one day, and that will be blessedness enough: we must have faith.&#x2014; Your Book is scattering the astonished cohorts of Chaos into strange agitated groups, I perceive. Which is the natural effect of it, and surely a salutary one by way of preliminary. Go on and prosper.</p>
<p>My wife here has caught cold a week ago, and sits prisoner; otherwise we are in the old way. Ought you not to come and see with your eyes now at last?</p>

<p>Next Wednesday,&#x2014;I need not remind so vigilant a man,&#x2014;is the ultimatum of the Lowe Subscription. I have sent various tolerable sums since we last met; I think there must be above &#xa3;300 now. Which will do perfectly well.</p>

Like a trusty soul, as you are!</p>
<p>I went one ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> to the Athenaeum upon chance, another to the London Library Committee, with a view of trying to see you; but did not either time; therefore now write.</p>
<p>My impression is, by all I can observe, the <hi rend="italic">Mitre</hi> (tho&#x2019; rapaciously advertising &#x26;c &#x26;c) is perhaps not practically <hi rend="italic">unsafe;</hi>&#x2014;but, except that the Actuary is there <hi rend="italic">ready,</hi> what charm has the Mitre for us that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> run <hi rend="italic">any</hi> risk whatever by preferring it?

<p>Lady S. was quite brisk and lively, tho&#x2019; rather avoiding the cruel March airs, which was wise: she expects to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">flit</hi> personally&#x201D; on Monday, and is deep in upholstery, and cheery negociations with upholsterers and decorators of human life.

<p>I am very busy; in fact busier than man sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be. The air is harsh and dark, soot and dust considerable elements of it; the world&#x2019;s outer business is not momentous to me just now; I dismiss the rumour of it in silence, and sit doggedly in my garret here. I am getting on a little better, thank God: one day I shall have done with these horrible affairs, and look back on all that soul-confusing labyrinth, like a man that has got <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> the mountains, and sees them all lying in heavenly <hi rend="italic">azure</hi> behind him,&#x2014;their detestable peat-bogs, damp caverns, torrents, rocks and quagmires all beautifully lapped up in that manner.&#x2014; Don&#x2019;t I wish it!</p>
<p>Lowe&#x2019;s downbreak in the H. of Commons is said to be a considerable one:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Downbreak&#x201C;: TC&#x2019;s coinage, perhaps as &#x201C;breakdown&#x201C;: being opposed, failing. On <date when="1856-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, Robert Lowe introduced a bill proposing the abolition of dues levied on ships and cargoes, not used for the benefit of shipping. These included passing tolls imposed by ports that provided no harbors of refuge and town dues imposed by municipal corporations and town authorities for such items as lighting, paving, and health. In his speech to the Commons, Lowe said that the dues must originally have carried with them responsibility for maintaining the harbors in respect of which they were levied, but that only in Scotland, where the law states that the proprietor of a harbor should keep it in repair, was this still the case. In England, he said, &#x201C;the rights of property have always been more durable and permanent than the duties imposed upon the holder of the property&#x201D; (<date when="1856-02-04">4 Feb.</date>, <hi rend="italic">Hansard,</hi> 3d ser. 140 [<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>]: 157).

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>That M&#xfc;ller is an excellent Book of its kind, very brief, clear, and wonderfully exact considering all things. I was in hopes it had treated wholly of the Two <hi rend="italic">Silesian Wars</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Respectively, <date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1742-00-00">42</date> and <date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>&#x2013;<date when="1745-00-00">45</date>; see <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vols. 15 and 16.</note> still so called, upon which there is a defect of good military elucidation; but I perceive nine-tenths of his Book are occupied with <pb id="pg-31-48" n="31:48"/>what he calls the &#x201C;Third Silesian War,&#x201C;&#x2014;which had not then begun to be called the Seven-Years War. On this latter I am amply provided (tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Decker</hi> is still in Paris, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> ever there); and Tempelhof and others have completely elucidated that matter.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Decker, see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560205-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, [<date when="1856-02-05">5 Feb.</date>]</ref>.

<p>The Pamphlet<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC&#x2019;s remarks on the pamphlet, see n. 6.</note> too, which is a thing printed abroad, translated from an English Pamphlet (probably by Fred<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> order, it being much on his side) is well worth having or reading,&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">sequel</hi> to one you already fished out for me, and which I have here.</p>
<p>There is in this new 4<hi rend="italic">to</hi> Pamphlet a curious old sheet of writing paper; which I find to be an Official Prussian Order to a certain Purveyor whose name is on it to make the needful preparations for buying <foreign><hi rend="italic">Hafer</hi></foreign> (Oats; <foreign><hi rend="italic">haver</hi></foreign> as the Scotch still call it) in the Polish market!&#x2014;I keep it, carefully preserved in the Cover of the Pamphlet, till you call next,&#x2014;which do, pray, the first day you are in Town.&#x2014; With many new thanks,</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I perceive the Prussian State-Paper (ie. <hi rend="italic">Polish-Oats</hi> Paper) may <hi rend="italic">be</hi> inclosed here; it goes at once, therefore. Do not forget to call, all the the same or the rather.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC enclosed the order and wrote on the reverse: &#x201C;An original Order from one of Frederick the Great&#x2019;s Ministers (whose Initial, not legible to extraneous persons, is given by way of Signature) to one <hi rend="small-caps">Bein</hi>, an &#x2018;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ober-Proviant Meister</hi></foreign> [director of provisions] at Fordan,&#x2019; to inquire punctually what the net price of Oats is in Poland just now, and for how much per <foreign><hi rend="italic">Scheffel</hi></foreign> [bushel] fair-grain of that species can be laid down at Frankfurt (on the Oder).

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>I shall not be at home next Sunday,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., <date when="1856-01-16">16 March</date>.</note> I am sorry to predict. Happily it will not stand in the way of work at present. I am even not quite certain for the following or second sunday,&#x2014;but there is time ahead between us and that.</p>
<p>On the whole, I think it will be better if you bring me back that &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">First Silesian</hi>&#x201D; mass of Papers in the state they are now in. It will cost you infinite trouble to pick out the available passages,&#x2014;and it will do me but little good in proportion; as, I suppose, they are excerptible mainly by the <hi rend="italic">scissors,</hi> in a readable kind of condit<hi rend="italic">n;</hi> and I myself know better, at this stage, what is worth excerpting. You shall have another stroke at the thing, when <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is more reduced to order, and worthy of your unweariable pains.</p>
<p>We are still very ill of cold here, my poor wife worse than when you saw her; no likelihood except in <hi rend="italic">change of the wind to west.</hi>&#x2014; I hope your dose of the business is over. My Brother is gone to Cheltenham<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spa town, 7 mi. NE of Gloucester.</note> for two days; I endeavour to keep very busy: the will good enough, but the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> very small and trifling!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,&#x2014;</salute>The sun has got across the Line; this is the first day of Spring, by temperature and light the first,&#x2014;Sun giving us his company for several hours, tho&#x2019; now hidden again;&#x2014;and I, with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> shadow of excuse, must make you my compliment on the event.</p>
<p>Half an hour ago, moreover, I got thro&#x2019; the Second Silesian war,&#x2014;not too <pb id="pg-31-54" n="31:54"/>honourably, but <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> it (that is, for the first <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> time) after a sort; which is beyond half-way in this unutterable task of mine; a gladness, more or less;&#x2014;and I, black monster, black with worse than gunpowder, look in your bright face (in idea), and see it glad at the news, in some measure! Why not? If the actual face were to look hostile on me (which it never did, nor will do), do I not know the cruel force of actualities; and that the real internal and intrinsic face is beautiful to me, and a benediction always, while I live?&#x2014; God be thanked for that fact. And so you may either laugh or cry, Madam; or do both together, which perhaps were most appropriate in the strange case. The <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> I for my part believe to be as above.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Had you been at Addiscombe<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ashburtons&#x2019; home nr. Croydon, Surrey.</note> now, how pretty to run out for a week, and enjoy the bright green world there, by way of rest and <foreign><hi rend="italic">interbellum</hi></foreign> [between wars]. But there is nothing of that; the waves have carried that away; and we must not regret that, standing here upon the beach of things, with so much still to be thankful for and glad of.

<p><salute>Best Lady,&#x2014;</salute> You are indeed the best and bountifullest; bountiful as Summer and the Sun! Your Letter has given me such pleasure (and will do); but, alas, it is pleasure dashed abundantly into the wholesome pitch by sorrow, almost by remorse and suppressed rage! No, I cannot come that is quite plain; must not, if I am wise: it is fit only that I continue here,&#x2014;caught a cold too yesterday, which ought to be itself enough for negative. In fine I must compose myself here, and sit silent in my natural circumambient element of <hi rend="italic">Chaos, Nox</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Erebus;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chaos, Night, and Hell.</note> and only <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> to my share in the Empyrean.

<p>&#x2014; Here is a blockheadism of an interruption come; and I cannot even get writing today. &#x201C;New Tenant&#x201D; (of a certain Peat Farm,&#x2014;and be hanged to him!); &#x201C;Letter to the Agent at Dumfries&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mr. Common of Capelfoot; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560422-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-08-22">22 April.</date></ref> [<date when="1856-04-00">April</date>].

<p>Early in the day I wrapt up that little Book for you,&#x2014;if it can amuse an idle hour in your own room. Book of no immediate (or distant) use to me, may be burnt if you fall short of fuel.

Well, I have been quite out of sorts, decidedly below par in health and jocundity, ever since I last wrote and before; I could have got but little good of the most <foreign><hi rend="italic">joyeuse entr&#xE9;e</hi></foreign> [joyful reception]: &#x201C;two afflictions, put together, sometimes make a consolation.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech, from a French proverb; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350615-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:147</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-06-15">15 June 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note> It must be owned our climate has, for most part, been very sad hitherto, grim grey east-wind and dust the main elements of it; the &#x201C;young Spring&#x201D; till within two days past has been an extremely tart young <pb id="pg-31-57" n="31:57"/>lady. Now however, we have western breezes copiously tempestuous, evidently laying in abundant rains for us: the health of all creatures, my own among others, is sensibly improving. I have also begun to try work again; I did nothing but read, and grope about, during those harsh temperatures, and sorrowfully <hi rend="italic">survey</hi> the unspeakable boundless quagmire in which I am still sunk,&#x2014;with <hi rend="italic">vow</hi> (&#x201C;registered&#x201D; I know not where) to work a miracle upon it, with such opulence of strength as I at present boast of! Ah me, ah me!&#x2014; But one must plunge on, all the same. It is only when I fall altogether idle, that I get altogether miserable. Privately I have various abstruse satisfactions otherwise; and when the eye of Pity sheds a tear over the heavy-laden sore-struggling (too much complaining) mortal, said mortal is not so ill-off as he would make generous Pity think,&#x2014;foolish mortal. But when one is <hi rend="italic">idle,</hi> then the question does rise, gorgon-headed, &#x201C;What is the use of such a life if one get no work out of it? Would a dog have it on such terms?&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c Oh my Lady, my Lady, have I nothing else to help <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with but the foolish story of my own foolish woes? Truly I am the poorest of all men, I often think withal; and you, are you not the best and richest of all women? Let me hold my peace once more! That, at least, is possible to the resolved mind!&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Sunday night late the voice of cannon was heard; then soon afterwards the voice of bells. Peace come, ah yes their Peace,&#x2014;with my blessing on it.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,&#x2014;</salute>I got another Note from that old Lady at Deptford,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ann Lowe.</note> which I meant to send you; but (happily) it has fallen aside, into the fire. She will be <hi rend="italic">punctual</hi> to the time in meeting with your man; she hints rather a wish not to sell her Long Annuities;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550615-TC-JF-01"><sic>29:332</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1855-06-15">15 June 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note> but to have the whole &#xa3;300 laid out in an Annuity by itself,&#x2014;thereby for three years she would have a plentiful time, and then suddenly fall short. &#x201C;Perhaps <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> before three years&#x201C;: that is her poor old notion, I guess.&#x2014; It seems to me this whim of hers, if she produce it, ought to be mildly <hi rend="italic">rejected,</hi> as evidently proceeding from an improvident frame of mind.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mounted on the same page as this letter is an undated note, presumably to TC, from Ann Lowe: &#x201C;The Desk of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Samuel Johnson will be disposed of as you think proper&#x201D; (FC).

<p>But the grand point is that we get, now at last, <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with her affairs. Done at last forever and a day! Oh I will pray for punctuality, for successful speed. I will hope your next Note will be to the effect: Finished now and no mistake! We shall then have nothing but the Times Advertisement to despatch, and wash our hands of the business to all eternity.</p>
<p>For the last two weeks I have been a good way below par in respect of health; east-wind catarrhs, went off, and today a kind of relapse: I am also getting ill on with work or rather not on at all. Courage, dear F.; for you also have too much weight on your back just now!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster&#x2019;s job as sec. of the Lunacy Commission was a demanding one, and, though he was no longer ed., his connection with the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> continued (see James A. Davies, <hi rend="italic">John Forster</hi> [Leicester, <date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>] 108).</note> Times do mend: there is an opulence of tender mercy withal lodged in this strange Universe, abstrusely amid its iron rigours and devouring vengeances, which sometimes surprises the pious heavy-laden heart. We will work to the last, anyway. And you, I hope, you are getting some kind of clerk or clerks to lighten you a little?&#x2014;</p>
<p>Pray put into <hi rend="italic">The Examiner,</hi> if you have not done so this week, a Sentence of Landor&#x2019;s about our thrice-detestable English word &#x201C;Pluck&#x201D; (pah! viler word was never coined by dogs). Landor&#x2019;s utterance is in the last <hi rend="italic">Fraser;</hi> and did my heart good. See the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> of those two &#x201C;Imaginary Conversations&#x201D;;</p>

We Italians would have said <hi rend="italic">spirit,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">heart,</hi> which comes nearest. But the meaning of <hi rend="italic">pluck,</hi> until this year, had always been the <hi rend="italic">entrails of animals, torn out of them, and the vilest part of them</hi>. &#x2026; [W]hat is ejected from a beast is to an Englishman the coronal of glory&#x201D; (444). The article was not quoted in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> April or May. The 1st conversation was &#x201C;Alfieri and Metastasio&#x201D;; the 2d, &#x201C;Menander and Epicurus.&#x201D;</note> Do you think the grand old Pagan wrote that Piece just now? The sound of it is like the ring of Roman swords on the helmets of Barbarians. An unsubduable old Roman!&#x2014; Also make my loyal respects to him the first time you write.</p>

Here is the Title:</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Formey</hi> (Berlin French Parson, Sec<hi rend="italic">y</hi> of the Academy &#x26;c): <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs d&#x2019;un Citoyen</hi> (Berlin Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois de la Garde <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>) two small volumes, I guess;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Henri Samuel Formey, <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs d&#x2019;un citoyen</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>). TC&#x2019;s copy, 2d edn., <date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>: HCC.</note>&#x2014;but it seems to be fallen out of notice: I believe it a dull dreary Book, useful to <pb id="pg-31-64" n="31:64"/>nobody but one in my case. A copy w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> probably come very cheap if you happened to fall in with it. Try, pray!&#x2014;</p>
<p>And in case you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> get the Book itself,&#x2014;could you not perhaps give me and it an hour in some <foreign><hi rend="italic">Stadtbibliothek</hi></foreign> [municipal library] or the like where some copy of it may be; and <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> me (or get copied for me) at pp. 239 and 245 vol I, certain <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> of Voltaire to Formey (ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Jew Lawsuit,</hi> entreating him to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> to the Judges &#x26;c,&#x2014;see Klein V, 229); also to look at p. 235, and copy or <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi> for me what is there said about Volt<hi rend="italic">re&#x2019;s</hi> pomp &#x26; grandeur of influence (levees of Courtiers ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> him) before this Lawsuit (which happened, the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> month after his coming, namely, end of dec<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <date when="1750-00-00">1750</date>). Formey also mentions him, first <hi rend="italic">visit</hi> (says Klein) at I, 232,&#x2014;which look at, but I think there is nothing to be copied there. And this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all, dear Brother. And I have to add, with a kind of emphasis, that <hi rend="italic">Formey&#x2019;s</hi> Book or the &#x201C;Copying&#x201D; I talk of, or any transaction with Formey, is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> essential to me by any manner of means; nay perhaps it is only the kind of <hi rend="italic">morbid</hi> craving I often have to go into the very bottom of the smallest matters? In fact I appear to myself to have already spent far <hi rend="italic">more</hi> labour on this paltry business than will ever be rewarded to me! So regulate yourself according to all the facts.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>You certainly excel all people in hunting out old useful Books! We will have the <hi rend="italic">Decker,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560205-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, [<date when="1856-02-05">5 Feb.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;in a certain contingency, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> copy of it.

<p>Another of the Books I set him to look for in Hamburg is <hi rend="small-caps">formey</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs d&#x2019;un Citoyen</hi> (Berlin, <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>, 2 vv.).

<p>We have been rather out of sorts in the late intemperate weather,&#x2014;my wife confined with cold, and myself, what is more unusual, making signals of distress now and then in that way.

<p>I am very proud to be thought worthy of such a Gift by Sir William Napier;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Francis Patrick Napier (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19772"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:11</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>), gen. and historian of the Peninsular War; Bruce&#x2019;s father-in-law.</note> I will certainly reserve this Book on Scinde<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">History of Sir C.

Napier&#x2019;s Administration of Scinde&#x2014;it being, in Sir William&#x2019;s opinion, the record of those actions which, of all he lived to perform, give him the fairest claim to be considered a great &#x26; good man.&#x201D; The conquest of Sind (Scinde), a province in NW India, by Sir Charles James Napier (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19748"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350112-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:10&#x2013;11</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-01-12">12 Jan. 1835</date></corr></ref>) aroused much controversy, but his brother, Sir William, staunchly defended him, representing Sir Charles as a Carlylean hero who created order from chaos: &#x201C;He had found Scinde groaning under tyranny, he left it a contented though subdued province of India, respected by surrounding nations and tribes, which he had taught to confide in English honour, and to tremble at English military prowess&#x201D; (342). His writings about Sir Charles were considered by many to be inaccurate and partisan, only serving to prolong the controversy (Priscilla Napier, <hi rend="italic">I Have Sind: Sir Charles Napier in India, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date></hi> [<date when="1991-00-00">1991</date>] 289).</note> for my very first holiday (or hour <pb id="pg-31-68" n="31:68"/>of right freedom from Prussian tyranny); and read it with the attention due to so distinguished a Record of a man whose valiant character and fine faculties I already so much honour. Please to make my thankful and respectful acknowledgements to Sir William for this mark of his goodness to me. Say I am greatly obliged; and shall expect pleasure and profit of no usual kind from this volume,&#x2014;the high qualities of which (and a noble <hi rend="italic">fraternal piety</hi> by way of finish to them) I am well enough prepared to anticipate.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Your first Note did come on friday morn<hi rend="italic">g,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1856-04-18">18 April</date>.</note> and the Book-parcel in the course of the day; but somehow I had got it into my head that there could no answer reach you till after monday; and on that entirely hollow ground I proceeded (being dreadfully bothered and occupied with <hi rend="italic">Voltaire&#x2019;s Jew</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abraham Hirsch.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c) nothing doubting, till your second Note came, of which there was notice sent yesterday.</p>

I have known the Book well for 36 years; and read it again in these late times, but had not liberty to mark upon it, nor free scope to <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> it, lying idle when not wanted, &#x26; ready for use when a new demand might arise. It is by no means a <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> Book,&#x2014;on the contrary it is good, and even <hi rend="italic">unique</hi> of its kind, being <hi rend="italic">autobiographic</hi> withal;&#x2014;but it is not set up to be a military History. Poor A<hi rend="italic">z</hi> was put out of the Army for gambling, and had to live by miscellaneous literary methods, never getting to any science or authority in soldiering. None of his compilations are without worth; and this has partly the superior character of a Book drawn from himself and his own experiences.</p>

It is but a poor <hi rend="italic">Book,</hi> treating of your subject at all, which will not far outweigh a few shillings in such an Enterprise as this unheard-of one I am now sunk in!&#x2014; Tell me what the Books cost in all, and I will pay you at once and have done with it.</p>
<p>Nothing whatever in the form of novelty has fallen out since you went. <pb id="pg-31-70" n="31:70"/>Jane&#x2019;s cold is about gone; but she complains of immense &#x201C;weakness,&#x201D; has lost all her talent for walking.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:245</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-20">20 April 1856</date></corr></ref>.</note> Everybody is <hi rend="italic">weak,</hi> I think; in all my days I never felt more helpless, utterly unequal to the hideous job I have in hand.

<salute>Dear Browning,</salute>
<p>It is a long time since I got your Book according to program;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Men and Women</hi> from Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560127-TC-RB-01">TC to RB, <date when="1856-01-27">27 Jan.</date></ref></note> a long time since I read it all, many of the Pieces again and again: nor was it a difficulty of <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> that has kept me silent; my approval was hearty and spontaneous, able I was and am to give you &#x201C;Euge! [well done]&#x201D; far beyond what I reckon you desire; and indeed I believe myself to stand among the first ranks of your readers in that particular. But you asked with so much loyalty, &#x201C;What shall I do to be saved,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Acts 16:30.</note> and gain the top in this sore upward course?&#x201D; and seemed to have such a faith in the older Stager and fellow-climber to give you a word of advice,&#x2014;I really knew not what to say, and hesitated always. Not to say that I am dreadfully busy, and never have a moment that is not sunk in dust and difficulty and semi-despair these many months and years!&#x2014; At length I have renounced altogether the high thought of &#x201C;advising,&#x201D; and the like; for indeed I see the case is very complex, and I have learned by experience that advice, real <hi rend="italic">advice</hi> from without, is generally an impossibility. &#x201C;Nobody follows advice,&#x201D; they say; which means withal, &#x201C;Advice never hits the case; the case is not known to any Adviser, but only to the Advisee,&#x2014;who has good right to protest, for most part!&#x201D; Accept a few rough human words, then, such as the day gives; and do not consider them as pretending to be more than honest words, rough and ready, for a fellow-pilgrim well affected to you.</p>
<p>It is certain there is an excellent opulence of intellect in these two rhymed volumes: intellect in the big ingot shape and down to the smallest current coin;&#x2014;I should look far, I believe, to find such a pair of <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> as I see busy there inspecting human life this long while. The keenest just insight into men and things;&#x2014;and all that goes along with really good <hi rend="italic">insight:</hi> a fresh valiant manful character, equipped with rugged humour, with just love, just contempt, well carried and bestowed;&#x2014;in fine a most extraordinary power of expression; such I must call it, whether it be &#x201C;expressive&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">enough,</hi> or not. Rhythm there is too, endless poetic fancy, symbolical <hi rend="italic">help</hi> to express; and if not melody always or often (for that would mean finish and perfection), there is what the Germans call <foreign><hi rend="italic">takt</hi></foreign> [tempo],&#x2014;fine <hi rend="italic">dancing,</hi> if to the music only of <hi rend="italic">drums.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For TC on poetry, see &#x201C;The Hero as Poet&#x201C;: &#x201C;Poetry, therefore, we will call <hi rend="italic">musical Thought.</hi> The poet is he who <hi rend="italic">thinks</hi> in that manner. At bottom, it turns still on power of intellect; it is a man&#x2019;s sincerity and depth of vision that makes him a poet. See deep enough, and you see musically; the heart of Nature <hi rend="italic">being</hi> everywhere music, if you can only reach it&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:83&#x2013;84).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-76" n="31:76"/>Such a faculty of talent, &#x201C;genius&#x201D; if you like the name better, seems to me <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> cultivating, worth sacrificing oneself to tame and subdue into perfection;&#x2014;none more so, that I know, of men now alive. Nay, in a private way, I admit to myself that here apparently is <hi rend="italic">the finest</hi> poetic genius, finest possibility of such, we have got vouchsafed us in this generation, and that it will be a terrible pity if we spill it in the process of elaboration. Said genius, too, I perceive, has really <hi rend="italic">grown,</hi> in all ways, since I saw it last; I hope it will continue growing, tho&#x2019; the difficulties are neither few nor small!</p>
<p>Well, but what is the shadow side of the Picture, then? For in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> too I ought to be equally honest. My friend, it is what they call &#x201C;unintelligibility&#x201D;! That is a fact: you are dreadfully difficult to understand; and that is really a sin. Admit the accusation: I testify to it; I found most of your Pieces too hard of interpretation, and more than one (chiefly of the short kind) I had to read as a very enigma. I did make them all out,&#x2014;all with about two insignificant exceptions;&#x2014;but I do not know if many readers have got so far. Consider that case; it is actually flagrant!</p>
<p>Now I do not mean to say the cure is easy, or the sin a mere perversity. God knows I too understand very well what it is to be &#x201C;unintelligible&#x201D; so-called. It is the effort of a man with very much to say, endeavouring to get it said in a not sordid or unworthy way, to men who are at home chiefly in the sordid, the prosaic, inane and unworthy. I see you pitching big crags into the dirty bottomless morass, trying to <hi rend="italic">found</hi> your marble wall,&#x2014;Oh, it is a tragic condition withal!&#x2014; &#x2014; But yet you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> mend it, and alter. A writing man is here to be understood: let him lay that entirely to heart, and conform to it patiently; the sooner the better!</p>
<p>I do not at this point any longer forbid you <hi rend="italic">verse,</hi> as probably I once did.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410621-TC-RB-01"><sic>13:155&#x2013;56</sic><corr>TC to RB, <date when="1841-06-21">21 June 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> I perceive it has grown to be your dialect, it comes more natural than prose;&#x2014;and in prose too a man can be &#x201C;unintelligible&#x201D; if he like! My private notion of what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Poetry,&#x2014;Oh I do hope to make <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> one day, understand that; which hitherto no one will do: but it must not concern us at pres<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Continue to write in verse, if you find it handier. And what more? Aye, what, what!&#x2014; Well, the sum of my ideas is, If you took up some one <hi rend="italic">great</hi> subject, and tasked all your powers upon it for a long while, vowing to Heaven that you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> be plain to mean capacities, then&#x2014;!&#x2014; But I have done, <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> <closer><salute>Good be with you always, dear Browning; and high victory to sore fight!

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I do not pretend to say that you might not, with industry, come by and by to write verses as well as very many persons do who follow that business as their trade at present: at the same time, I will explicitly advise you to renounce all thoughts of writing verse, otherwise than perhaps as an amusement; and also by no means to think seriously of trying Literature, in any form, as a stepping-stone towards some improvement of your position in life. This advice I give with all seriousness, and with whatever weight a long observation of the matter, aided by personal experience in certain branches of it, can lend to any vote of mine.</p>
<p>You may depend upon it, whatever the idle humour of mankind, thro&#x2019; their Newspapers and Literary Gazettes, may be in our time, there is no idler trade now carried on than that of verse-writing, nine hundred and ninety-nine times out of the thousand, now is; not any in which success is more uncertain, nor more utterly worthless to a serious man when it does come. The like,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; in some cases, to a less degree,&#x2014;holds of Prose Literature: if I found a young man, with seeds of real talent, of real wisdom and superiority, discernible in him, it is certainly by no means to Literature that I would direct him to go for the developement and employment of these. Be chary of speech; &#x201C;watch well <hi rend="italic">your tongue,</hi>&#x201D; what you will utter and not utter: that was ever, and is still, and will ever be,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 24:21.</note> the advice of the wise man to an ingenuous inquirer. Do not watch your tongue at all; try to utter everything; spend your life in pumping everything out of you in the <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> of <hi rend="italic">words:</hi> that truly is pretty much the universal unconscious advice just now; but you may assure yourself (so far as my poor word can assure you) it is bad advice, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be followed; and I think the longer you live with any manfulness of purpose, the better will you see <hi rend="italic">how</hi> bad such advice was.</p>
<p>It is very natural and proper you should try to better your situation; tho&#x2019;, if you have honest labour, with decent food and raiment in return for it, you are bound not to be too impatient,&#x2014;as very many are, giving ear to ambition &#x26;c, which it is not a good thing to indulge; frightfully the reverse indeed. However, we will suppose your impatience no other than just and manful; and taking it so, my deliberate counsel to you is, to sharpen and cultivate your faculties, to train and equip yourself by all possible methods, in modest strenuous <hi rend="italic">silence,</hi> as one of the chief conditions of really good progress; and, <pb id="pg-31-78" n="31:78"/>on the whole, to aim at getting a better situation by doing, with your whole might, to more and more perfection, the duties of your present one,&#x2014;which however low, you may depend upon it, can be done with all degrees of excellence, moral, spiritual, practical, and with all degrees of want of excellence in these three respects. You will thus grow, not only to be thought, but to <hi rend="italic">be,</hi> a really clever and worthy worker and man; and you need not fear there will be ample need felt of <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> in a time with so much work on its hands and so very few to whom it can be entrusted in that high form!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Too probably you will think this advice very crabbed, and will at once or gradually resolve upon, or drift into, the opposite and too common road: however, I thought good to offer it you (hurried as I am);&#x2014;and I will wish sincerely you may choose what is right; and so will bid you farewell.</p>

There is a note on the envelope (in a later hand) that a drawing was in the envelope when NLS received it, but the drawing contains nothing that obviously represents a &#x201C;horse,&#x201D; unless it is &#x201C;horse&#x201D; as beast of burden, i.e., the bearer of documents; it is of a respectable manservant with umbrella walking through the rain, with several documents under his arm, and the words in the corner: &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> James Sheridan M<hi rend="italic">tt</hi> sends more documents to Miss Jewsbury to prove what he had done&#x201D; (see 74).

<salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>
<p>We know not what night you are coming; but hope only it will be soon. I have got your Fourth Volume<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <hi rend="italic">Modern Painters,</hi> pbd. April.</note> (best thanks for such a Gift), and have not yet time to read it except in snatches, but struggle forward towards a freer day <pb id="pg-31-79" n="31:79"/>before long. You have an enviable and admirable power of clearing off, in articulate swift piercing utterance, the divine indignation that may be lying in you against the genus charlatan; whereby you can then say, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Exoneravi animam meam</hi></foreign> [I have unburdened my soul], and proceed to new enterprises: it is a very different, and I assure you a much worse case, when said indignation <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be got cleared off, but lies sticking upon a man, like burning sulphur on the skin of him,&#x2014;like to drive the poor soul mad till he some how or other do get rid of it! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi>&#x2014;and be thankful to Heaven.</p>
<p>It seems the genus charlatan has broken out in strong counter-cry, in some of the Reviews, this month: that also is very well, and indicates to a man that the physic has begun griping,&#x2014;more power to it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><sic>Chorley</sic><corr>H.

<p>I have a message for you, or indeed two messages. The first is from Lady Ashburton, a very high Lady both extrinsically and intrinsically, who invites you hereby to her Party at Bath House for Wednesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> next:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., <date when="1856-05-07">7 May</date>.</note> the place, as you perhaps know, is in Piccadilly (first gate, to left in Bolton Street there), the hour of rally is probably 10 or after, and the Party I suppose will consist of the usual elements in their highest figure of perfection. Perhaps you will consent to have a look at such a thing in its best perfection, for once? There are very fine Pictures in the House, and many of them, D&#xfc;rers, Murillos<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albrecht D&#xfc;rer (<date when="1471-00-00">1471</date>&#x2013;<date when="1528-00-00">1528</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470630-TC-JCA-01"><sic>21:247</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1847-06-30">30 June 1847</date></corr></ref>); Bartolom&#xE9; Esteban Murillo (<date when="1617-00-00">1617</date>&#x2013;<date when="1682-00-00">82</date>), Spanish artist.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c: and I certify the Host &#x26; Hostess to be themselves highly worth knowing. If you thought of coming, it would be pleasantest if we all went together;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; that, for practical result, is not of the least moment:&#x2014;we two (unfortunately, I may well call it) are to <hi rend="italic">dine</hi> previously that night, somewhere in the Portman Square region;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the Rennies; see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:248</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-28">28 April</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>250</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-05-01">1 May</date></corr></ref>.</note> and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> need to be taken up there (with a good loss of distance to you) if you pleased to like that method of entrance. Either way will do, if indeed you decided to go at all; which I may privately hope or not, but have no business to advise or desire in an audible manner.</p>
<p>The second message is from Lord Ashburton: You made an Address at Manchester lately; which perhaps was printed, separately or at least in the Newspapers:<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Address to the Workmen employed on the Oxford Museum,&#x201D; Oxford, <date when="1856-04-18">18 April</date>. It was pbd., <hi rend="italic">Jackson&#x2019;s Oxford Journal,</hi> <date when="1856-04-26">26 April</date>. In his address Ruskin echoed TC&#x2019;s view that &#x201C;the great mistake of the day was, not distinguishing between work which was calculated to have a permanent and beneficial effect for the good of society, and that which was of a transient nature.&#x201D; He mentioned speaking to TC &#x201C;the other day&#x201D; about the suffering of needlewomen, then cited JWC as saying that the reason for their suffering was that &#x201C;they could not stitch, and that was the secret of their not getting work; but when they could work in a plain way and a proper way, then they could get employed&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x2019;s Works</hi> 16:433).</note> his Lordship (an amiable, clear-minded, <hi rend="italic">high</hi>minded man,&#x2014;uniformly high in volitions at least) desires to see a copy of this address; and bids me ask it of you. Comply if you can; even take a little trouble to comply.</p>
<p>And this is all I had at present: sufficient for the day is the evil thereof!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Matt. 6:34.</note> You will have to write your determinations on those important points. We are out on Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> not otherwise, nor like to be, except as here indicated.</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I will in spite of fate write you a word today,&#x2014;you have no idea how many days I have been disappointed in that good purpose, and found my time all <hi rend="italic">up</hi> decidedly and more, or some still uglier impossibility. Ah me, Ah me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There was not much to be said, at any rate; in the shape of news, next to nothing. We have got round into our usual condition, in spite of the continuance of wintery weather into May,&#x2014;the harshest frostiest May I ever remember to have witnessed, thus far. Even Jane is fairly on foot again (tho&#x2019; still feebler, and making complaint of the north wind): as to me, I am fully as well as before, perhaps a shade better;&#x2014;and as so much depends on comparison, I hail this degree of bad health as <hi rend="italic">good,</hi> after its sort. When clear of <hi rend="italic">dinnering</hi> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I exert my best industry to be, but am led in once in the fortnight or so, do what I may), there is some capability of work in me again, and I stagger forward with less of despair.</p>
<p>Nay I believe I shall have to get to Press this very Autumn (or sooner) with the First Half of my wretched Book:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first two vols. of <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> were not pbd. until autumn <date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>; there were 6 vols. in all; the printers were Levey, Robson and Franklyn, 23 Gt. New St., Fetter Lane.</note> once fastened to the Printer, I shall <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to sort these accumulated rubbish mounds, and cut my way <hi rend="italic">thro&#x2019;</hi> them better or worse: I see little chance of doing it so well otherwise as on brief compulsion of that kind. Two Volumes c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perhaps be done in that way; then a little pause for other two (or one), wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> ends it! At no period of my life have I had such an affair. I have often weakly sunk; and wished I were dead and that job well done. But it will not do except by <hi rend="italic">living,</hi>&#x2014;by standing to it with the &#x201C;obstinacy of ten mules&#x201D; as I sometimes say.</p>
<p>There is also going to be another work: an Edition (<hi rend="italic">Cheaper</hi> if not exactly &#x201C;Cheap&#x201D;) of all my bits of Works; 14 or 15 volumes, 6/ per volume, and very respectable paper &#x26; print.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s Works,</hi> advertised by Chapman &#x26; Hall as a &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">cheap edition</hi>&#x201D; in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1856-12-06">6 Dec. 1856</date>, and in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; there were to be 16 vols.</note> This is very welcome for several reasons,&#x2014;first of all that it will yield a little fraction of <hi rend="italic">payment</hi> again (more than I ever got before perhaps) after so long an interval. For the rest, it will not create much <foreign>fash</foreign> to me,&#x2014;at least not if I can get a right hand, to correct Press, to make Indexes &#x26;c, and steadily oversee the thing; which I must be all means endeavour to do.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Gilchrist began and Vernon Lushington continued this work; see Fielding, &#x201C;Vernon Lushington.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; All this is of the nature of <hi rend="italic">good</hi> luck comparatively. The Bookseller<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Chapman.</note> came down with it the other morning under that character; I <pb id="pg-31-82" n="31:82"/>believe he was afraid I might take my new Book past him, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he would not have liked. A stingy close-fisted kind of fellow; but long-headed, skilful in his craft; and, as far as I know, exact to his bargain. I shall probably continue with him after all,&#x2014;&#x201C;keeping an eye upon my partner,&#x201D; as the Irish gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> did when dancing with a Bear!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your sorrows with servants are of a kind growing ever more universal; I often wonder what on Earth is to become of all that! We have to step <hi rend="italic">canny,</hi> steady, and get thro&#x2019; our part of it as we can.&#x2014; Jim&#x2019;s Translation from the Ghost seer<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son James&#x2019;s translation of Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Der Geisterseher</hi> (<date when="1789-Leipzig-00">Leipzig, 1789</date>).</note> seems spirited and good,&#x2014;here and there an error in it, mostly produced I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> guess by hurry of transcribing. It is far too close-written, and crowded on the paper, for correcting, or even for reading to eyes like mine, except with spectacles. It is an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> way of occupying idle time: tell the good youth so, and bid him persevere, persevere. Every bit of useful knowledge he can acquire is worth more than silver or gold to him. A good boy, I do think; and you a lucky mother, as mothers go!</p>

<p>Our dining-place on Wednesday (day after tomorrow) is &#x201C;71. Glo&#x2019;ster Place, Portman Square&#x201D; (Mr Rennie&#x2019;s); and it is proposed that you should call for us there at 10 &#xBD;,&#x2014;half past 10;&#x2014;we will of course come down to you directly; and that will bring us to Bath House in excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> time.

<p>I have little doubt the <hi rend="italic">Oxford</hi> Address is what Lord Ashburton meant; but I could not find him yesterday, on trial;&#x2014;and it was agreed I should take you to him in person on Wednesday evening, and let him tell his own story. Take no trouble therefore about the Address till then,&#x2014;unless by accident you hear again tomorrow, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is not likely.</p>
<p>Mr Rennie, &#x201C;71. Gloucester Place Portman Square, at &#xBD; past 10 Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>&#x201C;: that is the essential point;&#x2014;and I will hope a pleasant meeting.</p>

<p>Do you chance to know anybody that could be depended on for correcting the Press, doing a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Index, and the like services? A good handwriting, some scholarship,&#x2014;but above all things, exactitude faithfulness, what I call &#x201C;mother-wit and mother-worth,&#x201D; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be indispensable qualities! There is a &#x201C;Collective Edition&#x201D; about to be set on foot, for which I should need such a man. Some are vaguely in my eye, nobody decisively; nor have I yet spoken of the matter to anybody.&#x2014; Considerable <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be needed to index (reasonably <hi rend="italic">well</hi>) such a set of Books.

<p>I send you a poor <hi rend="italic">Oxford &#x26; Cambridge Magazine,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> came this morning.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Oxford and Cambridge Magazine,</hi> nos. 1&#x2013;12 (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), founded by William Morris (<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1896-00-00">96</date>;<ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19322"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>) and Edward Coley Burne Jones, later Burne-Jones (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4051"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), while undergraduates. The May issue was no. 5. For Lushington&#x2019;s comments on TC, see Fielding, &#x201C;Vernon Lushington&#x201D; 8&#x2013;9.</note> If you have anything weighty to do or read, you will not get much good <pb id="pg-31-86" n="31:86"/>of that! In fact it is chiefly worth looking at in the prophetic way; as an indication of the sense and nonsense working in the heads of those young fellows, who will be Legislators &#x26;c in a few years, and endeavouring to execute what they think. Please spend another penny stamp upon it, and send it on to Jean, who got the former N<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and is the natural proprietress of it: I would have sent it on direct, only she got <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> the other day, and is probably preoccupied with reading for a night or two.</p>
<p>Fuge did get me <hi rend="italic">Seckendorff</hi> bound at last,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560422-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-04-22">22 [April]</date></ref>.</note> tho&#x2019; not till after a fortnight of effort. It is all right now, and will be useful to me far beyond its money value. I was in some fear lest it might be only <hi rend="italic">Half</hi> the Book; Varnhagen, whom I was re-reading, cites it once &#x201C;in <hi rend="italic">four</hi> volumes&#x201D;; but again &#x201C;in two,&#x201D; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> latter I perceive is the actually correct way.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Several works by Karl August Varnhagen von Ense are cited in <hi rend="italic">Frederick;</hi> three are HCC. It is not clear which work TC refers to here. Seckendorf (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560411-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-04-11">11 April</date></ref>) was pbd. in 4 vols.</note> We must do without the <hi rend="italic">Journal S&#xE9;cret,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560411-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-04-11">11 April</date></ref>.</note> as without so many things.&#x2014; Since you heard last, I have got quite a sublime Book on the 7-years War: an elaborated History in the form of Lectures by the &#x201C;gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Staff Officers&#x201D; of those parts for instruction of the Cadets in their military Schools: really, I perceive, an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> work, with Maps, Plans &#x26;c in profusion;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Frederick&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Military Instructions Written for the Generals of his Army; being his own Commentaries on his Former Campaigns.

An honour indeed:&#x2014;at least I was glad to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> the Book <hi rend="italic">after</hi> having applied for it; not to be found in a <hi rend="italic">dis</hi>honourable position in regard to the affair: this advantage I am sure of, if many of the rest be problematical!</p>
<p>There has also been a magnanimous proposal made by Chapman for a &#x201C;Collective Edition&#x201D; of my duds of Writing: I suppose it will go on; <hi rend="italic">monthly</hi> volumes, 6/ each, 16 of them, to start ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> September;&#x2014;but I doubt we shall have a good deal of vile higgling about the terms &#x26;c before starting.&#x2014; The F<hi rend="italic">k</hi> too, I think, will have to go on; two volumes of it, as first Half, sent to the Printer before long. The wreck of it is threatening to choke me otherwise; nor does there seem any so likely plan as that of being <hi rend="italic">chased</hi> and forced thro&#x2019; <pb id="pg-31-87" n="31:87"/>it.&#x2014; &#x2014; I shall be in great want of some exact, acute, faithful person to look over the Proofs &#x26;c of &#x201C;Collective Edition&#x201D; (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is to be stereotyped), and also to make a good <hi rend="italic">General Index,</hi> which is a job requiring much good sense withal, and a clear steady head and hand. Neuberg I am fallen into a kind of abeyance with, and can, at this time, be either off or on! I am considering what is the real course to follow in such a relation. He has hardly been here at all,&#x2014;by various accidents and arrangements,&#x2014;since the night you saw him here so contradictory and piglike!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg had written to TC, <date when="1856-05-01">1 May</date>: &#x201C;The sacred volumes of the State-Paper-Office &#x2026; have become accessible to me again, and I enclose the &#x2018;recollections&#x2019; of a day&#x2019;s study there.&#x201D; He called them &#x201C;recollections&#x201D; because the superintendent, &#x201C;a very polite gentleman otherwise,&#x201D; had enforced the &#x201C;strict rules of the Department, which are, That no Notes whatsoever, not even the use of a pencil be allowed during the reading. But that for every Note &#x2026; the permission of the Foreign Office is first to be secured!&#x2014;Probably what I have &#x2018;recollected&#x2019; may serve your purpose.&#x201D; He had left markers in some passages and asked permission to copy them should TC need more details. He wrote again, <date when="1856-01-28">28 May</date>, telling TC that he was sending &#x201C;Notes and Abstracts from <hi rend="italic">B&#xfc;sching</hi>&#x201D; and a paper of TC&#x2019;s, so that TC could &#x201C;put them all into some &#x2018;pigeon-hole,&#x2019; &#x201D; and giving his address near Nottingham for the following week.</note> But I suppose I must send again soon.&#x2014; There is a man <hi rend="italic">Ross,</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.

<p>Thanks for your kind remembrance of me.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I again want a little bit of Etymology from you,&#x2014;and solicit patience.</p>
<p>The German all name their great Empress, as you must have noticed, &#x201C;Maria Theres<hi rend="italic">i</hi>a,&#x201D; while the French and English stand steadily by <hi rend="italic">Ther&#xE8;se, Theresa,</hi> and know nothing of an <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in the case. The Germans even use &#x201C;Theres<hi rend="italic">i</hi>us&#x201D; as a man&#x2019;s name (as I have observed), and retain the <hi rend="italic">i</hi> there too.</p>
<p>Almost beyond doubt I shall have to say &#x201C;Maria There<hi rend="italic">sa,</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC duly calls her Maria Theresa; see <hi rend="italic">Frederick.</hi></note> too, if I ever print anything on the Subject:&#x2014;at the same time, I should like rather to know which of the two parties is <hi rend="italic">right.</hi> The real etymology of <hi rend="italic">Theresa, Theresia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Theresius:</hi> that would throw decided light upon the question.</p>
<p>I never doubted it must be Greek: some Greek <hi rend="italic">Saint</hi> or the like (who perhaps was herself nothing more than a vocable,&#x2014;as I think they say is Saint <hi rend="italic">Catherine&#x2019;s Case!</hi>);&#x2014;but with all my dictionaries and guessings I am foiled on that side. Some say <hi rend="italic">Theresa</hi> is originally Gothic: I think the Saintess <hi rend="italic">was</hi> Gothic-Spanish;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The etymology of the name is uncertain.</note>&#x2014;but I have not even a <hi rend="italic">Bollandus</hi> quite at hand.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Lives of the Saints</hi> ], begun by a Jesuit, Heribert Rosweyde, taken up by Joannes Bollandus and later Jesuits; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470109-TC-LHB-01"><sic>21:130</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1847-01-09">9 Jan. 1847</date></corr></ref>.</note> In short I find it much easier to ask you again.</p>
<p>No hurry in answering; only so soon as you are deliberately sure, please to write one word,&#x2014;which shall be the answer of the Bacon&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Brass Head</hi> to me,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460925-TC-JAC-01"><sic>21:57</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-09-25">25 Sept. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> or better than that.</p>
<p>I have not seen you for a long while, and you have had mutations and adventures in the interim. On the whole I suppose you will find Cambridge<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Donaldson was now living.</note> to be the real soil for such a tree, after all. We have a native country of extreme stupidity, tossed about by dark fierce winds; one has to choose the sheltered places, and the good neighbourhoods.</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sir</hi>,</salute>
<p>I have read with attention, and with many feelings and reflections, your record of Sir C. Napier&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Administration of Scinde.</hi> You must permit me to thank you, in the name of Britain at large, for writing such a book; and in my own poor name to acknowledge the great compliment and kindness implied in sending me a copy for myself.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560412-TC-HAB-01">TC to HAB, <date when="1856-04-12">12 April</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>It is a book which every living Englishman would be the better for reading&#x2014;for studying diligently till he saw into it, till he recognised and believed the high and tragic phenomenon set forth there! A book which may be called &#x2018;profitable&#x2019; in the old Scripture sense; profitable for reproof, for correction and admonition, for great sorrow, yet for &#x2018;building up in righteousness&#x2019; too&#x2014;in heroic, manful endeavour to do well, and not ill, in one&#x2019;s time and place. One feels it a kind of possession to know that one has had such a fellow-citizen and contemporary in these evil days.</p>
<p>The fine and noble qualities of the man are very recognisable to me; his subtle, piercing intellect turned all to the practical, giving him just insight into men and into things; his inexhaustible adroit contrivances; his fiery valour; sharp promptitude to seize the good moment that will not return. A lynx-eyed, fiery man, with the spirit of an old knight in him; more of a hero than any modern I have seen for a long time.</p>
<p>A singular veracity one finds in him; not in his words alone&#x2014;which, however, I like much for their fine rough <hi rend="italic">na&#xEF;vet&#xE9;</hi>&#x2014;but in his actions, judgments, aims; in all that he thinks, and does, and says&#x2014;which, indeed, I have observed is the root of all greatness or real worth in human creatures, and properly the first (and also the rarest) attribute of what we call <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> among men.</p>
<p>The path of such a man through the foul jungle of this world&#x2014;the struggle <pb id="pg-31-92" n="31:92"/>of Heaven&#x2019;s inspiration against the terrestrial fooleries, cupidities, and cowardices&#x2014;cannot be other than tragical: but the man does tear out a bit of way for himself too; strives toward the good goal, inflexibly persistent till his long rest come: the man does leave his mark behind him, ineffaceable, beneficent to all good men, maleficent to none: and we must not complain. The British nation of this time, in India or elsewhere&#x2014; God knows no nation ever had more need of such men, in every region of its affairs! But also perhaps no nation ever had a much worse chance to get hold of them, to recognise and loyally second them, even when they are there.</p>
<p>Anarchic stupidity is wide as the night; victorious wisdom is but as a lamp in it shining here and there. Contrast a Napier even in Scinde with, for example, a Lally at Pondicherry, or on the Place de Gr&#xE8;ve;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Arthur Lally, baron de Tollendal (<date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>&#x2013;<date when="1766-00-00">66</date>), commander of a French expedition to India in the war with Britain, <date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>; he was besieged and forced to surrender at Pondicherry; sent to England as a prisoner; against advice, he returned to face trial in France, where he was imprisoned for two years, then beheaded in the Place de Gr&#xE8;ve, <date when="1766-05-09">9 May 1766</date>.</note> one has to admit that it is the common lot, that it might have been far worse!</p>
<p>There is great talent in this book apart from its subject. The narrative moves on with strong, weighty step, like a marching phalanx, with the gleam of clear steel in it&#x2014;sheers down the opponent objects and tramples them out of sight in a very potent manner. The writer, it is evident, had in him a lively, glowing image, complete in all its parts, of the transaction to be told; and that is his grand secret of giving the reader so lively a conception of it. I was surprised to find how much I had carried away with me, even of the Hill campaign and of Trukkee itself;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Napier had annexed Sind, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, but resistance to British rule continued. Truckee was a remote hideout in the Cutchee (Kacchi) Hills, NW Sind, where, after a short siege, rebel hill-men surrendered, <date when="1845-03-04">4 March 1845</date>; see <hi rend="italic">History of the Administration of Scinde</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) 234.</note> though without a map the attempt to understand such a thing seemed to me desperate at first.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many thanks, and gratified to have made this reflex acquaintance, which, if it should ever chance to become a direct one, might gratify me still more,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Napier wrote to TC from Scinde House, Clapham, <date when="1856-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x201C;Your kind letter has given me great pleasure, not so much by the praise you bestow on my work, tho&#x2019; I am not insensible to that portion as coming from so great a master in literature, but for the true and exact view you have taken of my brother&#x2019;s character. &#x2026; It would be very agreeable indeed to me to have a personal acquaintance with you, and my hope is to make it in time, but at the moment I have no heart for society for affliction is heavy in my home.&#x201D; Napier&#x2019;s married daughter was dying of tuberculosis.</note></salute></closer></p>

Certainly M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Ross would not like <hi rend="italic">me</hi> as well, or anything like as well, as that dear, romantic, impetuous Kate had done!&#x2014; And was there not here matter enough for crying?&#x2014;if one have a tendency to cry.</p>
<p>God bless you Dear! I ought to say all sorts of sensible and encouraging things to you at the present <hi rend="italic">crisis,</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">improve the occasion</hi>&#x201D; in fact&#x2014;but I can say nothing but just this short and simple prayer&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">God bless you!</hi></p>
<p>After all I have never found the least good, myself, in what others <hi rend="italic">say to us,</hi> either for comfort or edification! One must <hi rend="italic">work out for oneself</hi> every lesson of Life, or it is merely like a mathematical proposition learnt by rote&#x2014;turn the figure upside down, or change the letters, and you stand confounded in your pretensious ignorance! Ah Heaven Yes! Havn&#x2019;t I, for example been privileged for the last quarter of a century, to hear &#x201C;the Greatest Thinker of the age&#x201D; denouncing the sins and shortcomings of the World, the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night, and have I hated and despised the world&#x2019;s ways a bit the more for all that&#x2014;? &#x201C;quite the contrary&#x201D;; I turn sorry for the poor bad world, and every feeling of mercy and generosity in me is roused to take its part! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the effect of exhortation on <hi rend="italic">me,</hi>&#x2014;being of a contradictory turn. My dearest, I heard a great deal in praise of your future Husband from a friend of ours M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Masson the other night. He had been at college along with him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Masson (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>&#x2013;<date when="1907-00-00">1907</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34924"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> <sic>27:399</sic><corr>See <ref target="volume-27/ed-27-biographical-notes">27:biographical note</ref></corr>); Masson studied divinity at Edinburgh Univ., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1842-00-00">42</date>; Ross was also a student there. Masson decided not to become a churchman during the Disruption, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, and Ross joined the Free Church of Scotland. In <hi rend="italic">Memories of London in the &#x2019;Forties,</hi> Masson wrote about hearing of TC &#x201C;at secondhand&#x201D; from &#x201C;my friend and class-fellow&#x201D; Ross, who had just returned from Madeira where he had known John Sterling, &#x201C;whose stay in Madeira for the sake of his health, through the winter of <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>, is now one of the memorabilia of the history of that island. &#x2026; Ross, one of the most genial and sympathetic of men, and with a range of literary tastes and accomplishments and of cultivation by travel much beyond what was then common among Scottish students, had been so fascinated by Sterling that he could not help describing him to me, and repeating to me this and that from Sterling&#x2019;s conversation&#x2014;though then little foreseeing the close relationship into which he himself was to be brought with the Sterling family by his marriage, long after Sterling&#x2019;s death, with one of Sterling&#x2019;s daughters. Sterling was then a totally new name to me; and I was more interested in what Ross could tell me of Sterling&#x2019;s talk about his friend Carlyle. At the time &#x2026; he had known Carlyle about three years; and it would appear that he also, wherever he went, had Carlyle&#x2019;s name always on his lips&#x201D; ([Edinburgh, <date when="1908-00-00">1908</date>] 12&#x2013;13).</note> If he make <hi rend="italic">you</hi> happy&#x2014;that is if <hi rend="italic">he help you in making <pb id="pg-31-96" n="31:96"/>yourself happy</hi> (for I dont believe in any mortal&#x2019;s power to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> another either happy or miserable) I shall like him at first hand<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Julia Sterling wrote to JWC, <date when="1856-12-25">25 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;We find Katy pretty well &#x26; of course happy.

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>This morning Ruskin, from Dover, sent me the enclosed Note, with an old Newspaper from which I have cut out what was of use to you,&#x2014;Ruskin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> at Oxford to his assembled mechanics.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560502-TC-JRU-01">TC to <sic>JR</sic><corr>JRU</corr>, <date when="1856-05-02">2 May</date></ref>.</note> I have not read it, being extremely busy all morning: please do not burn it till I come; perhaps tomorrow or next day (if the Fates are so beneficent) I may find a chance of looking into it. Ruskin I have found in all things to mean well, and aim high with the very highest; but he strikes me always as infinitely too hopeful of men and things,&#x2014;in fact as having soared aloft out of all contact with rugged <hi rend="italic">facts;</hi> which class of objects accordingly he contemplates, as with outspread level wings, very much at his ease, far up in the azure aether.&#x2014; &#x2014; It is certain, however, he does teach various working young men to <hi rend="italic">draw,</hi> and has a boundless zeal to continue teaching more and more. His Fourth volume<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Modern Painters.</hi></note> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have not time to read) is full of the finest &#x201C;eloquence,&#x201D; Swiss descriptions &#x26;c,&#x2014;the like of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have hardly ever seen;&#x2014;but tending nowhither, except towards the impracticable, the impossible, so far as I could surmise. It is one of the strangest Books, for gift and want of gift, I have ever met with. The man himself I find exceedingly amiable, in spite of all that is said. But he flies out like a soda-water bottle, gets into the <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> of various people (being incautiously <hi rend="italic">drawn</hi>), and these of course complain dreadfully!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-98" n="31:98"/>I do design for Addiscombe before you get away: If the weather pleased to take up, it might be <hi rend="italic">tomorrow,</hi>&#x2014;if I had a horse or hippogriff, why not this very night!&#x2014;but I have only bad feet and railways, and dejected heart (unwell below par): unless it be really bright, I do not calculate steadily on tomorrow. But we shall see, we shall see. On Sunday I come at any rate;&#x2014;and tell My Lady I compute, as to Saturday, that if I be not there, <hi rend="italic">at six,</hi> I have no right to dinner.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so I remain, with many aspirations,&#x2014;recommending myself to your prayers</salute></closer></p>

<p>Well, I hope you are getting better, dear Lady, and meaning to come home to us soon? This is a day to amend you of itself.</p>
<p>You were very beautiful, in spite of your cold and your chagrins:&#x2014;I perceive clearly you will continue beautiful so long as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> live to judge you; this I think certain, and this should be enough to me on that head.</p>
<p>All was so beautiful, in spite of the rains and winds; and my Bedroom&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> I reminded myself of a banished soul (Satan <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the devilry) taking a walk thro&#x2019; Paradise:&#x2014;and yet that was but a sickly thought.

And hope, hope; we will never quit hope!</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Note (or long <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> rather, if I were not in such a hurry!) just come from Alick; and, lest I fail later in the afternoon, I will begin the day with packing that up for you,&#x2014;to go on to Jean &#x26;c after you have done with it.</p>
<p>The temperature here has grown &#x201C;perfectly delightful&#x201D; (as temperature), and the weather I really believe to be propitious in a high degree, as well as pleasant. Lively west winds; bursts of brief sunshine, and a great deal of good rain.&#x2014; Tomorrow, I think, is Whitsunday in your region; a day that brings many recollections back!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the Scottish term day when rent is due rather than a literal Sunday; TC is probably thinking of his father taking him to Annan Academy for the first time &#x201C;on Whitsunday morning, <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> 34); it seems more likely that this would have happened on a Monday than a Sunday.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Nothing is altered here, or nothing to speak of,&#x2014;except that poor Jane has caught a bad cold again, and did not come down to breakfast this morning, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is a sign of much suffering on her part. I hope nevertheless it will be off again in a day or two.&#x2014; &#x2014; I am busy, busy; but utterly <hi rend="italic">lamed</hi> (9 days out of 10) by an overclouded state of nerves,&#x2014;by the miserable state of <hi rend="italic">liver,</hi> in fact! Often, such is the nature of my employ<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> I cannot get on at all on these terms; <pb id="pg-31-100" n="31:100"/>or find I could do more work in an hour, with spirits clear, than I can manage in a week with <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> as it is! I am on search for a horse again, at least making some inquiry: I absolutely must attempt some improvement of my health before we begin printing: nothing is <hi rend="italic">so</hi> necessary.</p>

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry I can be of no help in this matter. Two Candidates have already applied to me; and I have undertaken to <hi rend="italic">say nothing whatever;</hi>&#x2014;which indeed was my only clear course in regard to such an &#x201C;Art&#x201D; as that of Logic.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scott was applying for the chair of logic at Edinburgh Univ.; for the other candidates, see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560805-TC-AJS-01">TC to AJS, <date when="1856-08-05">5 Aug.</date></ref>; which others had applied to TC is not known.</note></p>
<p>I adhere to what I wrote long since about you,&#x2014;believing that it was my true opinion then, tho&#x2019; I have quite forgotten the terms of it;&#x2014;but on this subject I must not write.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had written a reference in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> for Scott for the chair of English literature, University Coll., London (see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480921-TC-CUCL-01"><sic>23:115&#x2013;16</sic><corr>TC to CUCL, <date when="1848-09-21">21 Sept. 1848</date></corr></ref>), and wrote another in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> for Owen&#x2019;s Coll., Manchester, of which Scott became the first principal, <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>; see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18500501-TC-TOCM-01"><sic>25:78</sic><corr>TC to TOCM, <date when="1850-05-01">1 May 1850</date></corr></ref>. Scott&#x2019;s <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> testimonials had included one from Sir William Hamilton, whose chair of logic was now vacant.</note></p>
<p>What my wishes are, it is of no use stating. I believe, whatever I may think of the &#x201C;Art&#x201D; in question, you surely would do more good in treating it than either of the Two I allude to.</p>

<salute><hi rend="small-caps">My dear Sir</hi>:</salute>
<p>It must be at once admitted, and ought to be always gratefully remembered, you have stood a real father to that poor down-broken bond; and have set it up triumphantly, with victorious kindness, on such a footing as it never had before! I think (so far as vague recollection serves), it bears now almost the value, and yields about twice the interest that was originally attached to it, which is a result valuable to me, in more ways than one. The money is worth something in this ever-hungry world; and as to the transaction which the money now comes from, that is one with a value in it higher, probably, than any money. I may long recollect that pleasant brief evening, and the chivalrous procedure that has arisen out of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1853-11-00">Nov. 1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18531118-TC-JCA-01"><sic>28:314</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1853-11-18">18 Nov. 1853</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>By all means, leave the document where it is, if you will still be so kind as to trouble yourself with the keeping of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had sent a copy of the bond, <date when="1854-01-00">Jan. 1854</date>; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540117-TC-CBU-01"><sic>29:21</sic><corr>TC to CBU, <date when="1854-01-17">17 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> If you continue to think the investment safe, I may send you some more in the course of years; the interest, in August or any time, will find uses for itself here.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Butler enclosed $70 with his letter, <date when="1856-08-04">4 Aug.</date>, due &#x201C;for 6 months&#x201D; on the bonds &#x201C;of 1000$ each of the Chicago St. Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad Company which I hold as your agent. If you have a little more money to spare I can place it for you more securely so as to give you about 10%.&#x201D;</note> And so, with many thanks, let the matter lie arranged.</p>
<p>We are in our usual state here, little different from what you saw, except that I am dreadfully overwhelmed this long while with an ill-fated <hi rend="italic">Prussian</hi> enterprise in the Book way, the ugliest I ever undertook, and the most thankless and hopeless, in which, except the unwillingness to be flatly <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi> in one&#x2019;s old days, there is no adequate motive to persevere. This is really a sore job, and I have often fallen nearly desperate upon it. One needs &#x201C;the obstinacy of ten mules,&#x201D; as I sometimes say, &#x201C;in this world.&#x201D; However, I now do begin, in cheerful moments, to see promises of daylight here and there through the abominable black dust-whirlwind where my dwelling has so long been; and expect to get out of it alive after all, doing a bad Book, the best I can, since a good one is not possible in the case.</p>

She lives about four miles from us (in a street leading off Hyde Park Gardens, toward the Paddington region, at least there she did live, when I called long since and found her gone out).<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had moved to 12 Spring St., Sussex Gardens, near Hyde Park Gardens, <date when="1854-12-00">Dec. 1854</date>.

I have often asked myself, and ask all American friends, what poor Miss B. is about? but nobody knew her, nobody can tell. Her very address I have now lost; could find the place, I think, from the physiognomy of the street, were I there in person, and from some recollections of &#x201C;twelve&#x201D; as being the number of the house. Poor lady! I fear she is in a very abstruse condition; engaged in an enterprise which is totally without rational basis, and getting more and more exasperated that she does not (as she cannot by possibility) succeed in it.</p>

<salute>Dear Lady Dillon,</salute>
<p>I am very happy to find that the greatest of the Marshals Browne is certainly your kinsman: he was a person of much talent, worth, and distinction in his day; and gets a new hold upon me by his genealogy now.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Dillon&#x2019;s letter, [<date when="1856-05-31">31 May</date>], enclosed letters from her nephew, Richard Kirwan, and Mrs. Browne of Moyne: &#x201C;I think Ulyses Maxamilian is <hi rend="italic">your</hi> Marshall&#x2014;&#x26; if he was son to the first mentioned Coll.

Of whom I have found a great many traces in my Austrian Books;&#x2014;but will at present only mention the following, and with a practical purpose:</p>

<p><salute>Darling!</salute> That last was the most provoking <hi rend="italic">miss</hi> of all! We had just returned from Addiscombe, where we had been since the previous Saturday, and when you came I was close at hand; at Geraldine Jewsbury&#x2019;s in the next street! I had run over to give her some commissions before retiring myself from public life, into my fourposted red bed! I had come home with such a faceache and such a sorethroat! instead of those charming results always promised one from &#x201C;change of air.&#x201D;</p>
<p>All yesterday I was too ill to write you even a bit of a note&#x2014;While at Addiscombe I dreamed about you one night&#x2014;a wretched dream&#x2014;that you were sitting as white as a sheet, slowly weeping, and refusing to be comforted; because M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Twistleton and you were to be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sparated</hi>&#x201D;!!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">for political reasons;</hi> I partly believed; but I could not at all make it out, and knew only that you were miserable and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was misereable, and Miss Dwight<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her sister, Elisabeth Dwight.</note> and I were <pb id="pg-31-109" n="31:109"/>crying over you! On waking I determined I should go and see you the day after my return. But as I have said I had to spend it in bed&#x2014;besides you named Tuesday. If I am <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> anything I have to lunch at a M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Daubeny&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the wife of George Daubeny, 84 Denbigh St.</note> at Fulham on that day.

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>It appears almost fabulous and unworthy of belief, in respect of one who has the pen always in his hand as his implement of trade; but it is nevertheless a literal fact, that I have constantly had in purpose for the <hi rend="italic">last ten days</hi> to write you a Letter, and every day have failed to be able! This argues a sad state of affairs with me; and such alas it really is. My head is dark, my life overloaded (worst of all <hi rend="italic">loads,</hi> the state of my <hi rend="italic">liver</hi>),&#x2014;I have no heart left in me: and stand by my task with an obstinacy, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is very great, and which avails me or it very little. Not that I am <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than usual, or that my task is more ungainly, on the contrary it is <hi rend="italic">less</hi> rather: but I am quite gone to confusion in the &#x201C;inner man&#x201D; (meaning <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> and <hi rend="italic">stomach,</hi> first of all),&#x2014;and cannot even write you a Letter, as you perceive!&#x2014; However, we will say no more of all that; understand only what the reason of my silence is and was; and don&#x2019;t let your imagination be playing tricks with you on the subject.</p>
<p>I have got a small bit of my Book actually <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> and laid into the drawer, waiting for more which lies in heaps ahead of me, in the <hi rend="italic">un</hi>rid state. I am seriously purposing to go to Press with it in winter, and let the Printer <hi rend="italic">chace</hi> me thro&#x2019; it. Were I in average health of body, this would do:&#x2014;I must try to get into the old poor average! The day before yesterday I settled the Bargain with Chapman the Bookseller about the &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s Works,&#x201D; which is coming out:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560505-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1856-05-05">5 May</date></ref>.</note> this will actually make its appearance sometime about October, and go on <pb id="pg-31-110" n="31:110"/>month by month for 16 months;&#x2014;I have got a kind volunteer (young Barrister man, called Gilchrist,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Alexander Gilchrist&#x2019;s help with TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Collected Works,</hi> see Fielding, &#x201C;Vernon Lushington&#x201D; 9&#x2013;10.</note> much an admirer &#x26;c) who will take the trouble of all that off my hands: so that, were it once fairly started, I hope to have little farther to do with it; but to be at leisure to go on with the <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> (the Printer chacing me) as if I had nothing else to mind.&#x2014; A busy winter coming for me, if all go as I could wish and intend.</p>
<p>Jack is here, two Boys with him and a third coming;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two youngest of John&#x2019;s stepsons, Arthur and William, and the third, Henry Watt. Tom, the oldest, was still in Germany.</note> he takes an endless trouble with these creatures, and I know not that they are of the best stuff, or ever likely to repay the pains he is at. Latterly he was off doing a visit to a certain Mrs Fletcher, a daughter of the Churches once of Hitchill,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Churches had two surviving sons, John and James, and two das.; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320831-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:217&#x2013;18</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-08-31">31 Aug. 1832</date></corr></ref>; Mrs. Fletcher otherwise unidentified. For the Church family and Hitchill, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150822-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:58</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1815-08-22">22 Aug. 1815</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-02/lt-18221113-TC-AC-01"><sic>2:200&#x2013;201</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1822-11-13">13 Nov. 1822</date></corr></ref> (where Mrs. Church, who was distantly related to Ruskin through his cousin Joan Agnew, is wrongly identified as his great-aunt), and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 213, 258, and 450.</note> who has a rich (stupidish) husband and fine place in these southern parts: Jack and I contrive to meet (chiefly <hi rend="italic">my</hi> work, I think) as often as possible, but do not yet quite make out once a day. He is &#x201C;in the City&#x201D; &#x26;c during the light hours; and at night when I sally out for my last walk, his House is apt to be bolted too early for me. He has a kind of cold; otherwise is well, and always very kind company.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jane too has a <hi rend="italic">cold,</hi> of far more obstinate and worse kind; and indeed is very weakly in spite of the beautiful weather we now have. Your Glasgow Boys are with you, I suppose,&#x2014;Tom at least?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her son.</note> I understand you also to be in fair health, and going on as one could expect. My thoughts often wander to the shores of the Nith, out of these crowded hot streets with their dust and their uproar.</p>
<p>What do you practically think of my running off (very soon) for a month or more of <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> seclusion, with sea-bathing and country diet, with Mary<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> at Gill? That is an idea I still cherish on my hot pavements here. I wish you would go down and examine, or when you are down at any rate, examine, what the practicalities there seem actually to be. The good Mary, I will suppose, is <hi rend="italic">willing</hi> to any length: but have they a handmaid to be spared for the occasion; have they &#x26;c &#x26;c? In short look quietly <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it all, with a severe eye, and report when you are ready. As to <hi rend="italic">diet,</hi> if there is anybody that can &#x201C;make a pudding,&#x201D; and will be goodnatured, correct and attentive, I should have no difficulty in managing. The capabilities for <hi rend="italic">sleep,</hi> also for reading, writing, I know not exactly what they are. I know only I want much a small spell of <pb id="pg-31-111" n="31:111"/>silence, country, and sea-bathing.&#x2014; Perhaps there might even somewhere be a <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> attainable; nimble <hi rend="italic">shelty</hi> if nothing better. I have truly great need of a horse; being much disable<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> for walking in more ways than one. I have fairly <hi rend="italic">slit</hi> my walking shoes into stripes (on the outside, little-toe region), and so escape the torment of <hi rend="italic">corns:</hi> but that is by no means my worst obstruction in walking.&#x2014;Bid your James ask himself if there is no feasible outlook for a riding quadruped in your parts;&#x2014;we must not <hi rend="italic">steal</hi> one; nor do we quite wish, tho&#x2019; not absolutely forbidden, to beg or borrow: if one could <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> with the prospect of reasonably selling again,&#x2014;but that, for so short a time &#x26;c, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> perhaps not be a wise course, tho&#x2019; it is the open one? Bid James think it over; and do what he can for me.&#x2014; If I do not get to the Gill, I feel as if I must actually some way or other get into the Country for a couple of months. I am really quite below par; and incapable of working till I be a little set up again.</p>
<p>Here is heavyish rain, come in the rear of distant thunder which was going on when I began. We have had for a month the &#x201C;perfection of weather,&#x201D; according to my taste; a beautiful warm temperature without blazing sun; rain pretty frequent, which dries again instantly, and such a rich luxuriance in the woods and fields as is blessed to behold.&#x2014; Three days last week we were at Addiscombe with not too much (the Lady not very well just now); I went up and down, with profit, in the green world; but always got myself spoiled again with hot rooms &#x26;c in the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fore</hi>nights,&#x201D; and so made little of it.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>I will write no more today; only send my love to all the House; and remain ever</salute></closer></p>

<p>As to your coming hither to be next-neighbour to us, in reference to the noises &#x26;c and in spite of them, I can say nothing other than what you heard from me the other day.

<p>Not another moment is left: &#x201C;Breakfast ready, Sir!&#x201D; (for I have been up too early).</p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I must by no means let this post pass without a word to you: but nobody could guess what a deep well of confusions I am in (first with my work wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-114" n="31:114"/><figure><graphic url="volume-31-114-07.gif"/><p>Jane Welsh Carlyle, by Robert Scott Tait, 1 July 1856.</p><p><hi rend="italic"></hi></p></figure></p>

<p><pb id="pg-31-115" n="31:115"/>has all misgone today, and <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi> with impertinent blockheads bothering me from without, one waiting down stairs this some time, there let<hi rend="italic">him</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> wait!)&#x2014;so that I must again be brief in the extreme; brief, and not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> conclusive.</p>
<p>I am greatly obliged by your promptitude, and much taken with the picture you give of things at the Gill: in fact I have a <hi rend="italic">strong leaning</hi> and eager tendency towards it; but dare not say I have resolved yet; only <hi rend="italic">almost,</hi>&#x2014;poor wretch that I am! I am so weak of body, grown weak of mind in such things; the distance, the &#x26;c &#x26;c. Nevertheless I almost do believe I shall come. Were the weather to become burning hot, as it might do any day, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> start me up; but hitherto it has been good weather, and today has grown actually rather cold again.</p>
<p>In short I will write again in a day or two; and you need do nothing in the interim. I will try to make up my mind: sorrow, sorrow, why am I to go shifting and jumbling, and cannot help it, tho&#x2019; I like it less than any man! There are a good few packthread complexities tied round a man in this world, and pegged into the earth,&#x2014;which keep him well on his back, and at discretion to the world, for most part. Oh <hi rend="italic">whow!</hi>&#x2014; &#x2014; But I will write no more today; another day soon, and more definitely then. Consider it fairly <hi rend="italic">likely</hi> that I will indeed come; and so let it lie.</p>
<p>Jack has not been findable for a three days past: he came here last night; but then I in turn was out. Jane seems to be better a little; but the <hi rend="italic">element</hi> (just at its noisiest now) is by no means wholesome. In two weeks hence, probably 50,000 foolish persons will have poured themselves out into the country, and other 50,000 will be thinking of it; and London will be much quieter!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The annual summer exodus of society to the country.</note>&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>Your letter quite warmed my heart and gave me a pull, towards Scotland, stronger than I had yet felt. I think it in the highest degree unlikely, and certainly it will not be my own fault if I am there without seeing you. But we have no programme positively laid out yet for the summer, or rather the <pb id="pg-31-116" n="31:116"/>Autumn&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C always hithers and thithers in a weary interminable way before he can make up his mind <hi rend="italic">what</hi> he would like most to do. And so, as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> dont like wandering in uncertainties; with a net of &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">ifs</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">buts</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">perhapses,</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">possibly&#x2019;s</hi>&#x2019; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">probablys</hi>&#x2019; about my feet; I have got into the way of standing aside, and postponing my own plans, till <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has finally got to some conclusion. His present &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">most probably</hi>&#x201D; is that he will go to his sisters at a farm within a few miles of Annan,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Austin at the Gill.</note> and &#x201C;enjoy perfect solitude for a time.&#x201D; I mean in that case to stream off after &#x201C;my own sweet will,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<salute>Dear Miss B&#xF6;lte,</salute>
<p>Forgive my sins in regard to Professor Hettner&#x2019;s Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Herman Hettner (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>), prof. of literature, Heidelberg Univ. His book was possibly vol. 1 of <hi rend="italic">Literaturgeschichte der achtzehnten Jahrhunderts,</hi> 3 vols. (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>) or <hi rend="italic">Die romantische Schule in ihrem inneren Zusammenhange mit Goethe und Schiller</hi> (Braunschweig, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>); both are in the London Lib. catalogue.</note> and contrive somehow to make the Professor forgive them! I perceive you have not the least idea how I am situated in the matter of Books; overwhelmed with continents of Prussian rubbish, these many years now (for my sins),&#x2014;forbidden to read <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> except what has reference to my own thrice and four times dreary Enterprise; which often threatens to be the death of me, if I don&#x2019;t get rid of it soon!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The sad truth is, I have never yet read your Professor&#x2019;s Book; and it were idle to promise myself that I could, within any limited period, find time and heart for reading it. I looked thro&#x2019; it one evening, perhaps two, long ago, soon after it came; I read here and there in some of the leading Articles: and it seemed to me a Book got up by tolerably careful reading of the Biographical Dictionaries and such works, but to betoken nowhere much original recognition, or even direct personal acquaintance with the Authors treated of. A work not likely, therefore, to be very interesting or very useful out of Germany, when <hi rend="italic">such</hi> knowledge is probably <hi rend="italic">not</hi> current everywhere. I gave the Book on loan to Miss Wynne, who had heard it spoken of: she soon read it; and returned a Verdict, somewhat to the same effect, at any rate not favourable: this I meant to inclose to you by way of answer,&#x2014;but my Wife, when I came to ask for the Note, had by mistake already slit it into <hi rend="italic">spills;</hi> and I had now again Nothing to send! That was months ago; and there has been silence since as before. Such is the naked truth: clothe it in handsome habiliments, I beg of you; and be merciful in your judgements of me in this matter!&#x2014; &#x2014; I intend to present the Book to the <hi rend="italic">London Library;</hi> that it may there have its<pb id="pg-31-118" n="31:118"/>chance among the general mass of mankind, and that my hand and conscience may be free of it.</p>
<p>I am about setting off for Scotland, in quest of a little quietude, sea-bathing, and fresh air: they are to begin printing at that unutterable <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k <hi rend="italic">the Great</hi> (a sore Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) before long; and I ought, above all things, to try and be in a little better health first.&#x2014; I have often been in Dresden in spirit since you saw me there in the body:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; see <ref target="volume-27/lt-18520925-TC-JWC-01"><sic>27:303</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1852-09-25">25 Sept. 1852</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;sore &#x201C;sieges&#x201D; and confusions indeed: I do not know that Heyne himself suffered so much when bombarded out of it by the Great Fritz 100 years ago!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Gottlob Heyne (<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>; see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340130-TC-HI-01"><sic>7:92</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1834-01-30">30 Jan. 1834</date></corr></ref>), classical scholar who moved to Dresden, <date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>; worked as a clerk in Count Heinrich von Br&#xfc;hl&#x2019;s lib. and as a translator.

Johnstone&#x2019;s letter recalled that he first met TC and JWC at William Graham&#x2019;s house about twenty-five years before; he had taught Alick&#x2019;s children at Ecclefechan and wrote that Alick &#x201C;might himself have been a man highly distinguished, if he had found his proper sphere.&#x201D; He had seen TC for the last time in Jean Aitken&#x2019;s house in Dumfries in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, when he had just left his teaching post for religious reasons and had become ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries and Galloway Standard,</hi> <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date> (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430819-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:66</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-19">19 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>).

<p>Mr Leighton has vol I.&#x2014; The volumes that are to go <hi rend="italic">in pairs</hi> are tied together: vol. 70 <hi rend="italic">is wanting:</hi>&#x2014;I think there will be 73 voll. in this form of binding (23 in pairs, if I count right, and 1 wanting). The Work is <hi rend="italic">complete,</hi> all but vol. 70, and one <hi rend="italic">sheet</hi> in another volume (vol. 64) which I have marked.</p>
<p>Please to be very particular about the <hi rend="italic">Lettering</hi> on the back; the perfect accuracy of that is important. <hi rend="small-caps">Voltaire</hi> (instead of <hi rend="small-caps">Oeuvres de Voltaire</hi>) will do at the top;&#x2014;and in general the Lettering you find on the <hi rend="italic">Covers</hi> will be your guide; except &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Livraison</hi></foreign> [installment]&#x201D; at the bottom, which always <hi rend="italic">omit.</hi> Be careful of the <hi rend="italic">accents,</hi> &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">Th&#xE9;atre</hi>,&#x201D; not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Theatre</hi>&#x201D; &#x26;c. Also, if you put a big <hi rend="italic">arithmetical</hi> numeral to designate the general <hi rend="small-caps">Volume</hi> (for instance, &#x201C;95&#x201D;), as is done on those Covers,&#x2014;then perhaps a small <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> Numeral (also as on the Covers) would be best for designating <hi rend="italic">what</hi> vol. of the particular <hi rend="italic">Department</hi> it is? But, of course, an <hi rend="italic">arithmetical</hi> numeral would be <hi rend="italic">easier</hi> here too; and perhaps you could take it of such shape and size as w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be sufficiently discriminative? For example: &#x201C;95&#x201D; / &#x201C;Correspondance 28&#x201D;? I want only <hi rend="italic">distinctness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">exactitude.</hi>&#x2014; Be so good, however, as put, on the <hi rend="italic">Correspondance,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">years</hi> as I have marked them with the pen.&#x2014; On <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Philosophique</hi> too (8 voll. 51-59), it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be useful to put on the back what <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi> is inside: that is easy to do (tho&#x2019; I cannot get at the volumes, piled where they are); but indeed it is not of very much moment, tho&#x2019; desirable if doable easily.</p>
<p>Lastly be sparing of the <hi rend="italic">margins,</hi> so far as you rightly can: if vol 70 can be recovered in Paris, the Book will be worth a superior form of <hi rend="italic">re</hi>binding.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Will you, on your own judgement, slit asunder such of those Voltaire <hi rend="italic">Pairs</hi> as appear to require it. Several struck me myself as too thick, and I had the scissors at the back, of some; but I was too tired to meddle with the <hi rend="italic">imbroglio</hi> again, and so let it stand as it was.</p>
<p>On the other hand I think you will still find 4 or 5 Pairs (more or less) that will do better so than otherwise: I know I have handled Voltaire volumes unpleasantly <hi rend="italic">thin:</hi>&#x2014;it was not precisely of that Edition, but of an analogous one, which I thought might have been similar in that particular. There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one volume left single there, which is palpably too thin: but, being the first of a class or &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">department,</hi>&#x201D; it could only be joined to its right-hand neighbor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> and said neighbour, already thick, could not stand it. On the whole, give a steady look at them, you, and do what <hi rend="italic">will be for the comfort of the Book and its Reader,</hi> with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> respect to the sixpence. Index must be in one vol. What you say about the price is not to be contradicted.</p>
<p>Let me recommend only: Correctness, Strength, Speed!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have got the addit<hi rend="italic">l</hi> volume of <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres de Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric;</hi> and will surrender it, if you send; but w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> rather <hi rend="italic">read</hi> first: wait therefore till you actually <hi rend="italic">do begin,</hi>&#x2014;say a week hence? You <hi rend="italic">can</hi> have it tomorrow on those terms. <closer><salute>Yours truly</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Along with this I send a Pamphlet, which contains a Narrative interesting to read,&#x2014;and deserving in my opinion to be known to many persons (indeed to all wise Englishmen, if that were possible) who are more or less concerned in what it says.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pamphlet is Helen Mackenzie&#x2019;s account of what happened at Bolarum, Hyderabad: &#x201C;we hastened to London to print a true narrative of the Bolarum Mutiny&#x201D; (Helen Mackenzie, <hi rend="italic">Storms and Sunshine of a Soldier&#x2019;s Life</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="1884-00-00">1884</date>] 2:150); presumably the first version of <hi rend="italic">Narrative of the Mutiny at Bolarum in <date when="1855-09-00">September 1855</date>. For the Information of Brigadier Colin Mackenzie&#x2019;s Family and friends, drawn up from Memoranda taken at the time, by an Eye-witness</hi>(Edinburgh, <date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>). In <date when="1855-09-00">Sept. 1855</date>, the main religious procession of the Islamic month of Muhurrum had fallen on a Sunday. Mackenzie was a member of the Free Church of Scotland and therefore a sabbatarian, so first forbade, then, meeting with protests, ordered that the procession should not pass down the roads near the officers&#x2019; quarters. The order was disobeyed, and Mackenzie went out alone to confront the procession. He was attacked and seriously wounded. A subsequent enquiry held that he had acted rashly. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> leader wrote that &#x201C;the murderous attack&#x201D; was &#x201C;occasioned &#x2026; by some disrespect shown by him to the procession of the Mohurrum&#x201D; (<date when="1855-11-7">7 Nov. 1855</date>) and that &#x201C;there are rumours that the Brigadier did not act with judgement in the matter; that he had alienated himself from the Mussulman troopers by exhibiting a proselytizing spirit&#x201D; (<date when="1856-11-15">15 Nov.</date>). On his return to Britain in June, he had applied for compensation for his injuries but was refused on the grounds that &#x201C;the regulation mentioned only wounds received &#x2018;from enemies in the field,&#x2019; his being from mutineers in a garden&#x201D; (Mackenzie, <hi rend="italic">Storms</hi> 2:363). TC told William Knighton in <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date> that Mackenzie &#x201C;played quite a heroical part in the whole business, and I believe what he says, because I respected him of old as a truth-telling, honest, sincere man. It is quite true, as the papers state, that he is a devout Christian; but how that should be to any man&#x2019;s discredit in a Christian country is not easily explained, except in this way&#x2014;that unbelief, and cant, and humbug, and insincerity are gaining the day&#x201D; (Knighton, <hi rend="italic">CWC</hi> 39: 917).</note></p>
<p>I used to know Brigadier Mackenzie, and see a good deal of him about 11 years ago:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440413-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:11</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-04-13">13 April 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> he is a man of sterling principle (sincerely yet with enlightment<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">religions</hi> in mind), of very superior intelligence, of long experience in all Indian matters; and I should think as valiant clear and manly a character as could easily be met with;&#x2014;in particular a <hi rend="italic">Soldier</hi> (now of long service) of the very first quality, as I should judge. The word that he deliberately utters I confidently take as <hi rend="italic">true;</hi>&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">falsity,</hi> I should reckon, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be in it; and <hi rend="italic">mistake</hi> on any important point, from such an intellect so disciplined, is not at all likely. On reading this Pamphlet, and seeing the man again, I have been <pb id="pg-31-122" n="31:122"/>struck with many feelings. The small <hi rend="italic">practical result</hi> of all which is now this message to you.</p>
<p>If you read the inclosed Note (which do now, and then burn it), you will see I want <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to ask <hi rend="italic">yourself:</hi> if there is any competent hand in your Circle to whom the task I suggested to that Lady could be hopefully committed? If on reflexion you find there is <hi rend="italic">none,</hi> then let the matter <hi rend="italic">end</hi> at once; for I have no outlooks elsewhere, and cannot go farther into it, in the terrible confusion of hurry I am now in about quite other things. An Article in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> an Article in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review:</hi> perhaps however you do know somebody who could do them both or one of them: <hi rend="italic">both,</hi> I think, would be real <hi rend="italic">gifts</hi> to the Public; and really it is on that ground only that I would advise such a thing.&#x2014;To Venables I told the story: Venables w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do excellently if he liked to engage in it. Or perhaps you know a still likelier I should add farther that Mackenzie is far too much of a Soldier, gentleman, and person of sen[se] to think of making any clamour about his ow[n] bad usage: One of the Black Sergeants (Havildar, or whatever they call them) whom he knows to ha[ve] had, as the reward of conspicuous fidelity, an ig[no]minious <hi rend="italic">injustice</hi> done him: on behalf of this Havildar, &#x201C;a respectable hoary old Hindoo Soldier, now above 70,&#x201D; and dismissed as a traitor,&#x2014;on behalf of him Mackenzie is decided on stirring, and will stir in the right place;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The havildar (a native Indian noncommissioned officer in the British Indian army, corresponding to a sergeant) was one of three Indians dismissed from the army &#x201C;for not firing on the mutineers. &#x2026; The Brigadier sent in petitions of the three men so unjustly dismissed, strongly supporting them. &#x2026; But this and all his subsequent efforts on their behalf proved vain&#x201D; (Mackenzie, <hi rend="italic">Storms</hi> 2:145&#x2013;46).</note> but not on his own behalf at all: &#x201C;better to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi> your peck of dirt,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. the proverb &#x201C;We must eat a peck of dirt before we die.&#x201D;</note> he says. Which I approved of as wise.</p>
<p>Well, in brief, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> see your way toward doing any good with Mrs Mackenzie&#x2019;s Documents,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Pierpont Morgan Lib. MS ends here.</note> and M<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> elucidations,&#x2014;I have no doubt she will receive you like a gentlewoman, if you call and present that card inclosed. She is a very sensible pleasant still youngish lady (unfortunately a little <hi rend="italic">deaf</hi>);<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For JWC&#x2019;s description of Helen Mackenzie&#x2019;s deafness, see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480612-JWC-LA-01"><sic>23:47&#x2013;48</sic><corr>JWC to LA, <date when="1848-06-12">12 June 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> the Brigadier, being still an invalid, lies rather in the background: but him too, I doubt not, if you wished it, you might see. <hi rend="italic">You,</hi> I say all this while; but that of course means your Literary Man <hi rend="italic">a fortiori,</hi>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I think it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the directest way if you went yourself.</p>
<p>It would be in the highest degree unpleasant to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> and I will believe to the Mackenzies too, if anything <hi rend="italic">not</hi> rigorously the fact was stated on this matter.&#x2014;The Mackenzies leave Town (I think on monday next) for Germany: all this week (not much of it that now remains) is available for the Enterprise with &#x201C;farther Documents&#x201D; and expositions; after that, it can only <pb id="pg-31-123" n="31:123"/>be undertaken on the basis of the Pamphlet itself: I do not think there is anything very sacred in the &#x201C;Private-and-Confidential&#x201D; character of the Pamphlet,&#x2014;certainly nothing beyond what is common on <hi rend="italic">all</hi> such occasions. The Writer w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not himself be <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> speaking it forth at Charing-Cross,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., telling the whole world about it.</note> nor will he urge any other person so to do: but <hi rend="italic">if</hi> any other person finds good to speak it,&#x2014;the Writer can answer him or others: &#x201C;You are speaking <hi rend="italic">truth,</hi>&#x2014;and here is proof farther, if you like.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But enough written. Had I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> been in such a hurry, a few lines would have sufficed, and I should have had done more sooner!&#x2014; &#x2014; The whole turns on your inclining to go into the business at all. I hope you will; but cannot <hi rend="italic">advise</hi> one way or the other. If you do not, it drops so far as I am concerned. I know not at present (being indeed much hidden in my den) any Body of Writers, except those you have about you, who (according to my judg<hi rend="italic">t</hi>) are much worthy to have such a thing proposed to them. This therefore is the best thing I can do; and shall be <hi rend="italic">all</hi> in that kind.</p>
<p>No answer needed to <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> If you decide quite in the negative,&#x2014;merely burn all these Papers, Card &#x26;c &#x26;c, and let the thing go up the chimney,</p>

<p>I this day had a view of the <hi rend="italic">Little-Drummer</hi> Picture at Bath House (Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great &#x26; his Sister);<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560701-TC-AGI-01">TC to <sic>AG</sic><corr>AGI</corr>, <date when="1856-07-01">1 July</date></ref>.</note> and you are now and for what remains of this week, perfectly at liberty to act upon it by Photograph either there or at your own House. Now, therefore, or never! It is hugely superior to the Engraving we have here.</p>
<p>I ought to say, however, that I have given you a very false idea of the <hi rend="italic">size</hi> of the Picture;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The original at Charlottenburg is 69 &#xBD; by 65 &#xBD; ins. (174 by 163 cm.).</note> it is much larger than I represented, and in a very fine Frame;&#x2014;would not go into a Hackney Cab at all.&#x2014; On the other hand the room where it hangs is second-floor, large, well lighted; also there is a free out-of-doors space, level with the first floor (towards Piccadilly; bushes growing on it, &#x26; a flagged walk in the middle); also a <hi rend="italic">back</hi> Court, gravel, 30 or 40 yards square:&#x2014;in fine, I judged likely it could be done far best where it now is.</p>
<p>Of course the first thing is that youall this, and examine its capabilities with your own eyes; at any time in the daylight hours, you have only to go to <pb id="pg-31-124" n="31:124"/>Bath House (first <hi rend="italic">gate</hi> in Bolton Street out of Piccadilly), and present this Card. You will be at once admitted; even if the Lady is there, she can remove into another room.</p>
<p>If you make up your mind to proceed, please ask for &#x201C;Mr Mason&#x201D; (the Chamberlain) and consult with him about the hour, methods &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; This is all, and I am dreadfully whipt from post to pillar, so will end.</p>
<p>We in all probability go to Scotland about Wednesday next.</p>

<salute>Dear Tait,</salute>
<p>I may well be ashamed your obliging promptitude should have been checked in that way!&#x2014; I find it was all a piece of nervous surprise produced by the suddenness of the affair: a <hi rend="italic">shower</hi> was falling at the time your men came; her Ladyship had never once dreamt but you would <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> to do the operation <hi rend="italic">there,</hi> since it was permitted; supposed your men were mere porters, ignorant how to deal with Pictures, especially in rain &#x26;c &#x26;c.&#x2014; In brief, I judge, it will practically now be best to wait till Wednesday next, when the coast will all be clear, and servants still in the House for 4 or 5 days following (I know not precisely how long; but there is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> a solid old Housekeeper with assistants, ready to <hi rend="italic">receive</hi> anything that is brought):&#x2014;I will endeavour to have the servants instructed not to interrupt you again. But if they <hi rend="italic">do</hi> (in spite of all my endeavours, in that delicate element),&#x2014;then we will give up the Enterprise altogether, and leave the Little Drummer <hi rend="italic">un</hi>photographed. But I hope better things tho&#x2019; I thus speak!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260513-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:94</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-05-13">13 May 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I think, in about a fortnight hence, you will send me, into Scotland, a beautiful little Photograph of the Picture, after all. For which purpose I will leave you my Address:</p>
<p>Mrs Austin / Gill, Cummertrees, / Annan, N.B.</p>
<p>And with or without a Photograph, I surely will not forget your loyal endeavour to oblige me on this as on all occasions.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>In regard to Education, you have often heard me say (and yet perhaps you know not how serious I am) that the essence of all doctrine on the matter, the real summary of whatever I belie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;believe.&#x201D;</note> to be wisest on the subject, is set forth, symbollically, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> unintelligibly, in Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540313-TC-LOA-01"><sic>29:47</sic><corr>TC to LOA, <date when="1854-03-13">13 March 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> This is deeply my opinion, and has become ever more so, for the last five-and-twenty years or more. And continues to deepen, tho&#x2019; I cannot fairly get one human creature to share it; in fact I believe it to be the very gospel of the matter:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For an expansion, see TC&#x2019;s <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> &#x201C;Inaugural Address,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:472&#x2013;76.</note>&#x2014;and in you, I must say, I find very many affinities to it, far more than I have done in any other person. The vain preaching I have had, and fruitless recommending of that doctrine to this and the other man of likelihood, is almost surprising to me! Nobody <hi rend="italic">will</hi> understand it; for the sad reason, I believe, that nobody will give the due meditation to it,&#x2014;or has any <hi rend="italic">clear sky</hi> in his mind for a quite new idea to print itself upon: <hi rend="italic">London Fog</hi> is a far commoner material for minds! Of whom there is no hope.</p>
<p>However that may be, it is a fact that if I had prizes to give for Education, <pb id="pg-31-127" n="31:127"/>and could hope by prizes or otherwise to bring the English fairly on the way towards understanding that Doctrine of Goethe&#x2019;s, and translating it (even beginning to translate it) into practical methods and endeavours suited to our &#x201C;dialect&#x201D; of things (so let me name it, &#x201C;dialect&#x201D;), I should feel quite certain, &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Omne tuli punctum,</hi></foreign> I have done what ever of <hi rend="italic">best</hi> was doable&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;<foreign>Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci</foreign>&#x201D; [He who mixes the agreeable and the useful has achieved everything], Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica,</hi> 343.</note>&#x2014;and wrought a revolution in Education, the blessed issues of which (putting continents of traditionary fatal <hi rend="italic">mistake,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we might even call deadly universal <hi rend="italic">nightmare,</hi> and worse than mistake, to inevitable flight by and by) are beyond computing!&#x2014;</p>
<p>To propose a Prize for interpreting Goethe&#x2019;s Book, I am well aware, would be a most sad speculation;&#x2014;not by any means a thing to be entered upon, or recommended in the present state of matters.</p>
<p>But this, it strikes me, I may do, since you honour me by asking my advice: I will seriously suggest that, before <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> anything on the subject, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do fairly possess yourself of that Book and its Doctrine,&#x2014;read it well over (the whole <hi rend="italic">Book,</hi> in the solitude of the Highlands, will be well worth reading) and meditated till you are satisfied <hi rend="italic">your</hi> eyes see in some fair degree what Goethe&#x2019;s saw when he wrote it:&#x2014;really I think I am safe in recommending that, as a thing that cannot but help in the shaping of your Prize-questions and all other attempts.&#x2014; &#x2014; If I am wrong, forgive me. This is <hi rend="italic">all,</hi> today. Brigadier Mackenzie (an Indian military martyr) has been here, and has stolen all my time.</p>
<p>Last night two unfortunate men<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> came in upon me at the wrong time; I got (after shaking them off) up as far as Hyde Park on my way to Bath House; but found it was then 20 m. past 10,&#x2014;clearly too late,&#x2014;and had to turn home.</p>
<p>Today I know not whether my Wife will come or not. Tomorrow I flatter myself with walking out to Addiscombe, if I am able at all; but the truth is I am in the last degree of abject weakness, and good for next to nothing.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours ever truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Welcome was your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1856-05-06">6 May</date>.</note> to me, after the long interval; as welcome as any human Letter could now well be. These many months and years I have been sunk in what disastrous vortexes of foreign wreck you know, till I am fallen sick and almost broken-hearted, and my life (if it were not this one interest, of doing a problem which I see to be impossible, and of smallish value if found doable!) is burdensome and without meaning to me. It is so rarely I hear the voice of a magnanimous Brother Man addressing any word to me: ninety-nine hundredths of the Letters I get are impertinent clutchings of me by the button, concerning which the one business is, How to get handsomely loose again; What to say that shall soonest <hi rend="italic">end</hi> the intrusion,&#x2014;if saying Nothing will not be the best way. Which last I often in my sorrow, have recourse to, at whatever known risks &#x201C;We must pay our tribute to Time&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; perhaps in reference to Emerson&#x2019;s openings words, <date when="1856-05-06">6 May</date>: &#x201C;There is no escape from the forces of time &#x26; life, &#x26; we do not write letters to the gods or to our friends, but only to attorneys landlords &#x26; tenants&#x201D; (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 508).</note> ah yes, yes;&#x2014;and yet I will believe, so long as we continue together in this sphere of things, there will always be a <hi rend="italic">potential</hi> Letter coming out of New England for me, and the world not fallen irretrievably dumb.&#x2014; &#x2014; The best is, I am about going into Scotland, in two days, into deep solitude, for a couple of months beside the Solway sea:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Solway Firth, part of the Irish Sea, between Dumfries and Cumberland. TC was going to stay with the Austins at the Gill.</note> I absolutely need to have the dust blown out of me, and my mad nerves rested (there is nothing else quite gone wrong): this unblessed <hi rend="italic">Life of Fred</hi>k is now actually to get along into the Printer&#x2019;s hand;&#x2014;a good Book being impossible upon it, there shall a bad one be done, and one&#x2019;s poor existence rid of it:&#x2014;for which great objects, two months of voluntary torpor are considered the fair preliminary. In another year&#x2019;s time (if the Fates allow me to live), I expect to have got a great deal of rubbish swept into Chaos again. Unlucky it should ever have been dug up, much of it!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your Mrs Ward<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Ward; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560524-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-05-24">25 [24?] May</date></ref>.</note> should have had our best welcome, for the sake of him who sent her, had there been nothing more: but the Lady never shewed face at all; nor could I for a long time get any trace,&#x2014;and then it was a most faint and distant one as if by <hi rend="italic">double</hi> reflex,&#x2014;of her Whereabout: too distant, too difficult for me, who do not make a call once in the six months lately. I did mean to go in quest (never had an <hi rend="italic">Address</hi>); but had not yet rallied for the <pb id="pg-31-129" n="31:129"/>Enterprise; when Mrs W. herself wrote that she had been unwell, that she was going directly for Paris, and would see us on her return.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle was in Scotland when she returned, so they did not meet; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560828-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1856-08-28">28 Aug.</date></ref></note> So be it:&#x2014;pray only I may not be absent next! I have not seen or distinctly heard of Miss Bacon for a year and half past: I often ask myself, what has become of that poor Lady, and wish I knew of her being safe among her friends again. I have even lost the address (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> at any rate was probably not a lasting one);<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was still at 12 Spring St., Sussex Gardens, near Hyde Park Gardens; she left London for Stratford-upon-Avon, <date when="1856-08-00">late Aug.</date> Emerson had written to Bacon, <date when="1856-06-23">23 June</date>, telling her that the chapters of her book, which she had sent to him, had been lost. Her contact with the Carlyles was infrequent in spite of TC&#x2019;s offers of help. She wrote to a friend, <date when="1856-08-09">9 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I broke off with the Carlyles&#x2014;for there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of them&#x201D; (V. C.

Heigho!&#x2014; But let me get to business; for I have a little piece of actual business again to burden you with; and my Paper is rapidly wasting away.</p>
<p>Chapman the Bookseller (in addition to <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k, about which we have yet made no bargain) has at length resolved on a &#x201C;Collective Edition of Carlyle&#x2019;s works&#x201D;; to be printed in a cheap but handsome and immaculately correct form: 16 handy little volumes (big 12<hi rend="italic">mo;</hi> no, foolscap 8vo I should think) to sell at 6/ each, and be published monthly,&#x2014;first of them will come out probably in Nov<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and so last for 15 months more (French Rev<hi rend="italic">n</hi> makes the first <hi rend="italic">two</hi> volumes). The Book is to be stereotyped; I have got a loyal friend<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Gilchrist.</note> to do the correcting, to do an Index &#x26;c &#x26;c; the printer is the excellent Robson<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Robson of Levey, Robson &#x26; Franklyn, TC&#x2019;s printers since <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>. Dickens wrote to TC, <date when="1856-07-20">20 July</date>, recommending his own printers: &#x201C;This is to present to you my printers and old friends, Messrs. Bradbury and Evans. They desire to have the honor of seeing their imprint attached to the proposed collected Edition of your works. Now, they have not only printed my books from the first page thereof to this hour, but have been closely associated with me in matters of trust and confidence. And I believe that when I assure you they are &#x2026; the best and most powerful printers in London, &#x2026; you will believe that you cannot do better than entrust your Edition to them.&#x201D;</note> (acquainted with that peculiar article): in short I believe the thing will be <hi rend="italic">well</hi> done, in all points. The Stereotyped Plates, after Chapman has printed his 2,000 or 4,000 are to be <hi rend="italic">mine.</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman&#x2019;s &#x201C;Cheap Edition of Carlyle&#x2019;s Works&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1857-01-10">10 Jan. 1857</date>) began publication, <date when="1857-01-01">1 Jan. 1857</date>.</note></p>
<p>Well, you perceive now what I am at. If an American Publisher has liberty to import British Stereotype Plates (and to send them back <hi rend="italic">soon,</hi> for that too will be needed), he might, if his mind lay towards such an adventure, have the <pb id="pg-31-130" n="31:130"/>chance of doing a &#x201C;Carlyle&#x2019;s works&#x201D; for Americans, on terms both of cheapness and correctness defying all competition.

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your kindness. We are certainly going off: the day after tomorrow, for Edinburgh by express (if all turn out as we expect); and ought to be in Edinburgh that same night (Wednesday) about half past 9.&#x2014;Jane goes across to Fife, to her Cousin&#x2019;s; I am bound to The Gill, as you know, for some Sea-bathing. However, I do mean to take Scotsbrig on my way. The train leaves Edinburgh at 5 o&#x2019;clock, I am told, and gets to Ecclefechan at 9 p.m. (that is the best remembrance I have of it). Unless I go across to Fife with Jane for a day <hi rend="italic">on Thursday,</hi> my way will be therefore to move towards you that day;&#x2014;and it will be shortes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS, for &#x201C;shortest.&#x201D;</note> if I say, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Unless you hear farther</hi> of me, I am due at the Ecclefechan Station by the Edinburgh train on Thursday 9 p.m.&#x201C;&#x2014;However, you must be very punctual in looking out for Letters on <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> and Thursday, lest there be a disappointment; for I am not <hi rend="italic">master</hi> of the situation; and cannot predict at present farther than as above. Jamie, if he hear nothing more, will probably be at the Station with the Gig on Thursday: and if I be <hi rend="italic">not</hi> <pb id="pg-31-131" n="31:131"/>there to take a seat beside him, he may understand that I am as much disappointed as anybody.</p>
<p>The Dr was here last night; very well; and wholly busied with his three Wards,&#x2014;or rather with Two, for the Sailor one is fairly sent away some days ago, and sailing towards India now. A second goes off today towards Ayrshire, there to be boarded and taught till Winter and Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>-College come. The third is for Switzerland, thro&#x2019; France; and with him the Doctor sets off, some day this week,&#x2014;straight towards Paris and Geneva or a little beyond.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry went to sea, <date when="1856-07-15">15 July</date>. Arthur left for Ayr, <date when="1856-07-21">21 July</date>, and John left for Switzerland with William, <date when="1856-07-26">26 July</date>; the oldest boy Tom, still at school in Germany, was to go to sea, early <date when="1856-10-00">Oct.</date> John&#x2019;s friend, Thomas J.

He will there learn German &#x26; French and get an Insight into Life. &#x2026; Harry only stayed with us two or three days. He is a bit of good company. &#x2026; If you write to Arthur tell him to write to us occasionally we shall be delighted to hear from him. Is it not rather a sudden Freak of Toms going to Sea? &#x2026; I hope the Captain with which he sails will keep a good watch over him&#x201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9086).</note> At what time, or by what route, the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> comes back again, is not yet said or fixed. But the three &#x201C;Boys&#x201D; will all be happily in their places for some good while coming, and a little out of people&#x2019;s way in the interim.</p>
<p>Jane is moving about; but has very much need of a bit of country, as well as myself. I think it very likely she will contrive to see you before going southward again. But all this is lying quite loose hitherto.&#x2014; We have never had any oppressively hot weather yet,&#x2014;only a day or two in june too hot:&#x2014;the rest always dampish and <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> a delightful temperature, tho&#x2019; not too good for corn. <closer><salute>with affectionate regards to all,&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>We set off for Edinburgh on Wednesday morning; to arrive there that night (if all go prosperously), and stay in Scotland for 6 or 8 weeks, I hope.</p>
<p>We shall not see you again before departure; but on our return, shall hope to find you in a flourishing condition, settled down in our neighbourhood.&#x2014; I called at Chapman&#x2019;s the other day; find they have <hi rend="italic">got,</hi> in sheets or otherwise, a complete Copy of the Books to be printed: I spoke of you to the younger Chapman (Elder was not there),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The elder was Edward Chapman, founder of Chapman &#x26; Hall; the younger was his cousin, Frederic Chapman (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5116"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470301-TC-CGD-01"><sic>21:169</sic><corr>TC to CGD, <date when="1847-03-01">1 March 1847</date></corr></ref>), his partner since <date when="1847-00-00">1847.</date></note> and settled that you were to call, and get possession when you liked, on presenting a Card from me,&#x2014;Card is now <pb id="pg-31-132" n="31:132"/>inclosed. The <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> leads off; Mr Chapman can shew you in what series the others are to follow. It will be very obliging if you can spare time for an accurate reading of the Fr. R<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> any errors that are palpable, correct as you go on; anything whatever that is dubious, if you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be so kind as mark it and shew it me. You will thus spare me a great deal of time and trouble. The Printer (Robson) is the most exact I ever dealt with: by your aid and his we may hope there will come out an &#x201C;immaculate edition.&#x201D; Of the trouble you volunteer to take I will say nothing more at present.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Maupertuis</hi> Books you need not mind farther. I have just read a new French <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of him (new, tho&#x2019; it has lain in <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> near 100 years):<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Laurent Angliviel de la Beaumelle (<date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>&#x2013;<date when="1773-00-00">73</date>), <hi rend="italic">Vie de Maupertuis &#x2026; ouvrage posthume, suivi de lettres in&#xE9;dites de Fr&#xE9;d&#xE9;ric le Grand et de Maupertuis,</hi> ed.

Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (<date when="1698-00-00">1698</date>&#x2013;<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>), French mathematician and astronomer, perpetual president of the Berlin Academy, involved in many quarrels, and satirized by Voltaire; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:273&#x2013;77.</note> the rest of his Books that are of interest to me, I know where to borrow henceforth: and I had rather not have them of my own (dull blustery Pedantisms) after they have once yielded what I want from them.</p>
<p>If you fall in with any likely <hi rend="italic">Amanuensis,</hi>&#x2014;good hand and swift, good sense and fidelity, whatever other qualifications,&#x2014;I should like very well to find such a one ready for being treated with, on my return.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Address</hi> may be various in Scotland; the Address &#x201C;Chelsea&#x201D; will always be safest,&#x2014;where the Letter-Carrier (John Piper, an excellent man, who will also be yours in Cheyne Walk) always knows where we are.</p>
<p>And so good-b&#x2019;ye till we return. <closer><salute>I send many regards to Mrs Gilchrist, and hope I may be in good case to enjoy a little of her music, against my getting back into these parts.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>If all go well, we are to be at Edinburgh tomorrow evening about 9 p.m. On Thursday, I now find, it will be better for me to go across the Frith with Jane, and see her fairly lodged with her Cousins at Auchtertool. That will throw me late for coming forward to you the same evening: so we will say <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi> the next day, for Scotsbrig. At 5 p.m. <hi rend="italic">on Friday</hi> I will leave Edinburgh to come to <pb id="pg-31-133" n="31:133"/>you; and if you can be at the Ecclefechan Station that (Friday) evening, I hope you will find me to bring over with you.</p>
<p>Jack is here at this moment; and all is in great haste, packing &#x26;c &#x26;c. We hope this will still be in time, and give you clear Warning on Thursday morning. <hi rend="italic">Next</hi> night, you have me, if all go as I expect&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Alas, my poor little dear, there are no clogs for you:</salute> I had buoyed myself up almost into a certainty that I should find the Article at Mackie&#x2019;s; but the answer was No, &#x201C;sure to be noticed, Sir, if they had been left!&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly John W. Mackie, confectioner and biscuit maker, 108 Princes St., Edinburgh, where presumably JWC thought she had left some parcels by mistake.</note> So we must bid goodb&#x2019;ye to the Sedlitz Powders<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Usually Seidlitz; a mild laxative and antacid.</note> too;&#x2014;and take our losses handsomely. <pb id="pg-31-134" n="31:134"/>&#x2014; &#x2014; I got my Purse changed; rather, I confess, from <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> considerations ultimately, for I do not think the new fellow is an improvement, tho&#x2019; he cost me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> more; but I could not bear to be <hi rend="italic">beaten</hi> by such a thing. This, and the futile Mackie, was all I did in Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> There was no refresh<hi rend="italic">t</hi> room at the station, or I would have tried to eat something during the half hour I had: I smoked a cigar instead, and went on towards Scotsbrig for my next repast after the substantial breakfast Fife had given me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Before his departure from Auchtertool.</note></p>
<p>The day and evening were altogether of the brightest kind of weather: I was not crowded, or annoyed with bad air or otherwise, in my vehicle; and from Elvanfoot<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village 25 mi. N of Dumfries.</note> I had it altogether to myself, and freedom to smoke; on the whole it was a mournful, but clear decent, and not unpleasant ride. At half past nine, Jamie and his gig received me with the old honest welcome; Isabella had excellent tea and refection ready in an incredibly short time: a new <hi rend="italic">long pipe</hi> even was discovered for me;&#x2014;and all went well as it could have done in a mood so sad as mine naturally was. Alas, the very place where I lay down to sleep,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> scene I had seen in that same room&#x2014;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother&#x2019;s death, <date when="1853-12-25">25 Dec. 1853.</date></note> But there was no wisdom in yielding to such thoughts. It is on death that all life has been appointed to stand for its brief season, and none of us can escape the Law. There is a certain solemn consolation which reconciles me to almost everything, in the thought that I am myself now fairly <hi rend="italic">old,</hi> and that all the confusions of life, whether of this colour or that are soon about to sink into <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> (flat nothing) and only the <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">work</hi> (if one did any that had a soul) can be expected to survive.</p>
<p>I woke a couple or more of hours in the night; but in return fell sound asleep from 7 to past 10! After which, with bathing, with excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> coffee &#x26;c, I am really in a very fair way. I do not think there is, for the essentials of human comfort, a better lodging in the world than this w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be for me or for you. Here it is for you at all times and to any length you like. Remember that always in your schemings and plannings.&#x2014; Out of mere <foreign><hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi></foreign> [force of inertia] I continue here till tomorrow, when (<hi rend="italic">smuggling</hi> the trunk, or not) Jamie will take me to the Gill. I will write in about 3 days. <closer><salute>All good be with my dear Goody, and regards to the kind cousins every one.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Here I am since yesterday about 1 p.m.&#x2014;to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> after a furious thrice uncomfortable 12 hours; next day to Fife (whence I sent you a word); Friday night to Scotsbrig;&#x2014;thence, after good resting, land here as above.</p>
<p>I have got, in confused pieces, a really good sleep; have been down at the shore, looking where the tide <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be tomorrow (when I begin): I am certainly not worse but better since I left home; and perhaps shall really do myself some good, tho&#x2019; very much tumbled about, and in a confused state up to this date.</p>
<p>Thanks for the Gig, in which I have been this day down at the shore;&#x2014;tho&#x2019; as I am to have a kind of <hi rend="italic">galloper</hi> (really tolerable riding horse) and saddle from Jamie, I think I shall not much need it.&#x2014; What day I am to see you? I will appoint nothing today. I think of Saturday if nothing sooner! But it will be as well to rest a little; and I must not neglect my <hi rend="italic">tides.</hi></p>
<p>The two Boys<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jean&#x2019;s younger sons, Thomas and James.</note> are well employed here; sauntering about the woods with their little cousin.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James (b. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), Mary&#x2019;s younger son, or one of the younger das. whose names and dates are unknown.</note> Tom gave extraordinary tokens of interest and welcome on my arrival.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas was deaf.</note></p>
<p>Jack is off to Switzerland, Saturday morning last; probably in Paris today.</p>
<p><closer><salute>God bless you dear Jean, you and yours. I am right glad to have the chance of seeing you again. Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>Let me send you, in haste, the announcement at least that I am got to my final quarters, and that nothing has gone wrong with me. It will <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> a comfort to you in your Fife solitude to know so much. If I had properly obedient paper and pen, I could write much more; but that is not <pb id="pg-31-136" n="31:136"/>the case,&#x2014;my <hi rend="italic">team</hi> (of <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> and <hi rend="italic">straw,</hi> sorrow on them and on sinful men!) is mutinous more or less, so I forbear to drive farther than is indispensable.</p>
<p>I got an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ride thro&#x2019; Springkell<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hamlet, 2 mi. SE of Scotsbrig.</note> woods on Saturday afternoon (a grey blowing not unwholesome day); and that I think was pretty much all the work I did,&#x2014;longdrawn continual talk, with Jamie chiefly, of which I had rather more than I wished, tho&#x2019; it was easily avoidable too at any time.&#x2014; Scotsbrig I continued to find the <hi rend="italic">perfection of human lodgings;</hi> also I was charged to express expectations confident &#x26;c &#x26;c on your behalf; and a little line of writing to Isabella w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very valuable at any time. In short if you at all come within wind of the place, it will be <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> to go; and I think it will be very agreeable to you over and above, and worth <hi rend="italic">coming</hi> to,&#x2014;on various considerations.&#x2014; &#x2014; Jamie&#x2019;s horse rides really very respectably; my old saddle and bridle, too, were discovered (ah me, ah me!), needing only some <hi rend="italic">pannelling,</hi> owing to the moths; horse and saddle are to come to me tomorrow,&#x2014;such was Jamie&#x2019;s offer unsolicited, the thrice excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Jamie, always a bit of sound stuff since the first finding-out of him.</p>
<p>He set me down here yesterday, thro&#x2019; a grey windy country with populations (very sparse) visible about the Parish Kirks,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">between</hi> &#x201C;in&#x201D; and &#x201C;out&#x201D; we meant to be, for orthodoxy&#x2019;s sake;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably between the beginning and end of church service.</note>&#x2014;about 1 p.m.; staid till 6, <hi rend="italic">over</hi> chicken-broth and tea, and then whirled home again. My welcome was kindness itself, and all kinds of arrangements were affectingly good or tolerable; so that I make no manner of doubt I shall do very well, and even be <hi rend="italic">comfortable</hi> were I once <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">.</hi> Yesternight in my stroll out, thro&#x2019; intricate footpaths (bad shoe tearing my heel all the while, as I discovered afterwards) in the cloudy blustery evening thro&#x2019; a world all as if <hi rend="italic">dead,</hi> I could have felt abundantly sad; but strove not to do so, nor did more than was perhaps useful.&#x2014; After <hi rend="italic">old-style</hi> porridge, I fell asleep; made in spite of breaks and confusions (for indeed I was not well) a great deal of sleep out;&#x2014;found excellent coffee after my bathe and walk (the lass Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Austins&#x2019; elder da., b. <date when="1831-00-00">1831.</date></note> being really up to several things);&#x2014;was carried down by Jamie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin, TC&#x2019;s brother-in-law.</note> after breakfast, (had not the heart to refuse him) to see my future bathing ground; which will be ready tomorrow morning at 10, my first plunge if all go right: an excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> place,&#x2014;only about 3 miles off, by the nearest practicable route; that is an unexpected and not pleasant feature of it! For the rest, there seems to be very great <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> thro&#x2019; the night and morning; and all day I perceive I shall be <hi rend="italic">well let alone.</hi> When I compared all things here with the Lodgings at Eastbourne,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unexplained unless referring to JWC&#x2019;s plans for renting a cottage in Rottingdean, a village approximately 15 mi.

After breakfast at eight, he used to work in the sitting-room &#x2026; till two o&#x2019;clock. Then he went out either riding or walking &#x2026; and returned to dinner about six. After dinner he took a nap, and then came tea and then another walk, generally on the Priest-side sands, returning to supper. Then came talking or reading aloud till bed-time. / He avoided strangers calling in the afternoons. A letter came from Mrs. Carlyle every day; and once or twice it failed to come and he was uneasy all the rest of the day.&#x201D; Wilson also noted that TC &#x201C;was a familiar figure in adjacent Cummertrees, where a boy who watched him remarked that when walking about he carried a &#x2018;heavy yellow stick.&#x2019; He was &#x2018;quite erect and moved about rapidly with an air of great decision. He stepped high and had a faraway look, which was just like many of the farmers, and so was his way of opening his mouth at times to breathe; but what was odd was that he seemed the embodiment of will&#x2019; &#x201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 5:232&#x2013;33).</note></p>
<p>No Letters; hurried note or two from John, that he is off to Vevay,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vevey, Swiss resort where his stepson, William Watt, was to go to school.</note> that he wants to be &#x26;c &#x26;c.

The fewer of that sort the better: that is clearly my vote!</p>
<p>Dear Goody I am scribbling to no use or purpose; wasting away the time that remains for walking between this and dinner. I will terminate once and away.&#x2014; I expect a full counter-detail of everything on your side (except oneself one has nothing to write about, nor is anything so interesting it may be hoped); after which response, even without event in it, will follow duly.</p>
<p>I hope you have got your bathing-gown, and will be in the sea before me.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>It is very mortifying to hear of new mistakes in the <hi rend="italic">Voltaire;</hi> a couple of new breaking out, so soon as the old two are made good!</p>
<p>However, we must not pause longer upon the business: you must just bind up Vol. 9 and Vol. 41 as if they <hi rend="italic">were</hi> complete,&#x2014;only marking with pencil on the titlepage of each what imperfection there is. Voll. 64 and 70, I conclude, you already have in the perfect shape,&#x2014;along with the <hi rend="italic">Fred</hi>k volumes.</p>
<p>I will send to Paris in quest of new re<supplied>[c]</supplied>tifications<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> for the two volumes, that are still wrong; but as that is a work of time, and also rather uncertain, we will not wait upon it;&#x2014;it is only spending a couple of shillings <hi rend="italic">more</hi> upon the Perfect 9 and 41, if we do ever get them, and giving away the others, bound instead of unbound. I hope to find the whole thing standing in order, ready for the shelves, if not in them, against my return from these coasts, which is to be before very many days.</p>

Pbd: Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:279&#x2013;81 inc. &#x201C;After Addiscombe and three months more of deadly wrestling with Friedrich and the mud elements, we went to the Grange for Christmas; stayed for several weeks. Company at first aristocratic and select (Lord Lansdowne and Robert Lowe); then miscellaneous, shifting, chiefly of the scientific kind (Jowett, and an Oxonian or two among them), some of whom have left more than the shadow of an impression on me. Our last Grange Christmas, such as it proved, under presidency of that great lady. We returned in January, both of us. I at least much broken by this long course of gaieties, resumed work for <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>, and with dreary obstinacy kept pushing, pushing. The intolerable heats of July forced us north again. Ride to Edinburgh in the Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s royal carriage, which took fire, and at Newcastle had to be abandoned, dustiest and painfullest of rides, regardless of expense, and yet actually taking fire and falling flat like Dagon of the Philistines. Nothing good in it but the admirable bearing of that great lady under its badness. The Ashburtons off towards Ross-shire next morning. I under promise to follow thither by-and-by. Towards Auchtertool Manse we two, where after some days I left my dear woman and took refuge with my sister Mary at the Gill, near Annan, seeking and finding perfect solitude, kindness, and silence (the first time there) for a good few weeks. / Scotsbrig ten miles off, but that was now shut to me. Poor brother John had tragically lost his wife; was much cast down, and had now, most unwisely as I thought, filled Scotsbrig with his orphaned step-sons&#x2014;three mischievous boys, whom to this day none of us could ever get to like. Scotsbrig accessible only on a riding call at this time&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:278).

<p>I hear from Geraldine that Ann<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne, the Carlyles&#x2019; maid at Cheyne Row.</note> has got the kitchen white-washed and yellow-washed and that poor little Nero is no redder on the back but monstrously dirty.</p>
<p>I shall write to Ann to day that he must positively be washed twice a week as usual&#x2014; There was no other news from London except that Miss Wynne&#x2019;s<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte Williams Wynn.</note> favorite dog had got its leg broken by the kick of a horse and they had been obliged to poison it!

<salute>My dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I am quite sure of being in Scotland <hi rend="italic">now</hi>&#x2014;for lo and behold! I am here&#x2014;at Auchtertool! And if ever a poor woman was thankful to see her own land and her own people again, after long and weary exile it is <hi rend="italic">me!</hi></p>
<p>We left London as I predicted we should &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">quite promiscuously</hi>&#x201D; at the last. Lady Ashburton was going to her Highland shooting quarters and engaged the great big railway carriage called &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Queen&#x2019;s Saloon</hi>&#x201D; to take her to Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the journey, see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560730-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-07-30">30 July</date></ref>.</note> So having lots of room to spare she offered one day to carry both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and me along with her free of all trouble and expense. And the offer was both too kind and too convenient to be refused.</p>
<p>Only we had &#x201C;terribly&#x201D; short time for packing and preparing&#x2014;</p>
<p>We staid over night at a Hotel<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >British Hotel, 70 Queen St., owned by J. H. Barry.</note> with the Ashburtons and then they went north, and I came over the water to Auchtertool&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C accompanying me; for a twenty four hours stay.</p>
<p>Oh mercy into what <hi rend="italic">freshness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cleanness</hi> and kindness I have plumped, here!&#x2014;out of the smoulder and din and artificiality of London! It has been like plumping down into a bed of rose-leaves with the dew on them! My Cousins are so kind! and the only thought that comes to spoil my enjoyment is that I must go back to London some time! cannot get staid here <hi rend="italic">forever!</hi></p>
<p>This note is only to tell you I am in Scotland dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2014;not to tell you <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I shall be at Thornhill according to your kind invitation which came so opportunely when I first thought of coming north&#x2014; They expect me to make a long visit here, and I am so glad to rest quietly a while to recover from the fatigues not of my journey which were inconsiderable but of the London summer. Then I have to visit the dear old Miss Donaldsons at Haddington&#x2014;and finish of all I have to do and see in and about Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> before going into Dumfrieshire&#x2014;as I shall return to London by the Carlisle Road&#x2014;</p>
<p>Oh my dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell my courage fails me when I think of finding myself at Thornhill&#x2014;at Crawfurd<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Crawford, where her mother was buried; see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420127-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>14:30</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1842-01-27">27 Jan. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420414-TC-JWC-01"><sic>146</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-04-14">14 April 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> make myself go&#x2014;and once there I shall be glad I did not reject a pleasure (tho a sad one) for fear of the pain accompanying it&#x2014; And <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will be good to think of after&#x2014;</p>
<p>Are you going from home anywhere?&#x2014;for I could of course arrange my movements otherwise if it did not suit you to receive me for a few days some <pb id="pg-31-142" n="31:142"/>three or four or five weeks hence&#x2014;and would suit you better sooner&#x2014; I could go to Dumfrieshire <hi rend="italic">during</hi> my visit here instead of after it was concluded&#x2014; but it would be more convenient not to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> to Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>
<p>I was very poorly indeed when I left home but I am quite another creature on the top of this Hill&#x2014;with the sharp fife breezes about me.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have seen three Notes from you, one of them to myself, since we parted; the main new purport of which was that you were actually off on Saturday morning, and that I was to write as &#x201C;on Wednesday&#x201C;:&#x2014;Wednesday from Annandale, I judged it to be; and am now, with a good enough apparatus and arrang<hi rend="italic">t</hi> at the good Sister&#x2019;s front window, but with rather an unsteady hand, writing you a word accordingly, tho&#x2019; except routine matter and (thank Heaven) still &#x201C;All well&#x201D; there is as good as nothing to be said.</p>
<p>We had a very tumultuous and unpleasant journey to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> in spite of all our means and appliances. The sublime vehicle we went in was her Sacred Majesty&#x2019;s own apparatus for such uses; but unfortunately, at the end of the first stage, it was discovered that the axle was about taking fire; which fatal tendency it continued to manifest all the way, in spite of endless mopping, pouring of watering pots, and smearing of grease,&#x2014;the guard at last, we could observe, got a line attached to the Stoker&#x2019;s place, and spent his hours waiting till we should blaze out: finally at Doncaster,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Yorkshire; possibly correct; TC also thought it was &#x201C;somewhere in Northumberland,&#x201D; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560813-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1856-08-13">13 Aug.</date></ref>, and Newcastle, see his later description in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences:</hi> &#x201D; Lady sat, or lay, in the &#x2018;saloon&#x2019;; a common six-seat carriage, immediately contiguous, was accessible from it; in this the Lady had insisted <hi rend="italic">we</hi> should ride, with her Doctor and her maid; a mere partition, with a door, dividing us from her. The Lady was very good, cheerful though much unwell; bore all her difficulties &#x2026; with admirable equanimity and <hi rend="italic">magna</hi>nimity; but it was physically almost the uncomfortablest journey I ever made. At Peterborough, the <hi rend="italic">Ne-plus-ultra</hi> was found to have its axletree <hi rend="italic">on fire;</hi> at every station afterwards <hi rend="italic">buckets</hi> were copiously dashed and poured &#x2026; and at Newcastle-on-Tyne, they flung the humbug <hi rend="italic">Ne-plus</hi> away altogether, and our whole party into common carriages. Apart from the burning axle, we had suffered much from dust and even from foul air.&#x201D; TC opened the door; &#x201C;I &#x2026; sat with my head and shoulders stretched out backward, into the wind. This had alarmed my poor Woman, lest I should tumble out altogether; and she angrily forbade it,&#x2014;dear loving Woman; and I complied, not at first knowing why she was angry.&#x201D; Lord Ashburton met them in Edinburgh. &#x201C;They went for Barry&#x2019;s Hotel at once, servants and all,&#x2014;no time to <hi rend="italic">inform</hi> us (officially) that <hi rend="italic">we</hi> too were their guests. But that, too, passed well. We ordered apartments, refreshments of our own there (first of all <hi rend="italic">baths</hi> &#x2026; )&#x2014;and before the refreshments were ready we had a gay and cordial invitation etc. etc.; found the &#x2018;Old Bear&#x2019; (Ellice) in their rooms &#x2026; and Lord Ashburton and he with a great deal to say about Edinburgh and its people and phenomenon&#x201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 158&#x2013;59).</note> on the sudden, he gave it up, <pb id="pg-31-143" n="31:143"/>condemned the vehicle as <hi rend="italic">crazy</hi> beyond cure; and pitched us and our luggage, in vast haste, to the right and the left, wherever a hole could be found for one and the other of us. Never was a sumptuous contract worse fulfilled; &#x201C;regardless of expense,&#x201D; and utterly &#x201C;futile in fulfilment&#x201D;! Add to which the day was intolerably hot; the carriage, all carriages, in spite of all windows down, continued foul to breathe; and for dust&#x2014;I never laid off such a shirt collar as that night (a collar that seemed to have been wiping shoes, tho&#x2019; the rest of the shirt was clean), and my hair was like a door-mat, hardly cleaned yet after a week. However, we did all survive, all of us, especially the women, and most especially the Hostess of the party, behaving in a heroically calm manner; and about 9 p.m. we were all safe in Edinburgh, and clean water, and other refections (including fair sleep by and by) awaiting us at Barry&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel.&#x2014; We saw no Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> person, except by accident Robert Chambers<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Chambers (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1871-00-00">71</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5079"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-28/lt-18530722-TC-RC-01"><sic>28:215</sic><corr>TC to RC, <date when="1853-07-22">22 July 1853</date></corr></ref>), publisher, author, and ed. of <hi rend="italic">Chambers&#x2019;s Edinburgh Journal.</hi></note> on the street; we tried for Erskine, but without basis, and did not succeed: about 2 p.m. we were at Burntisland,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Fife coast.</note> and &#x201C;Mary&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> and a vehicle (Walter being off on some parish duty) came up half a moment after, and drove us home thro&#x2019; the clean quiet green of the fields, very welcome to London eyes after such a bout. Mary seems decidedly unwell of <hi rend="italic">liver,</hi> is ordered to drive about &#x26;c; I think she had a declared inflammation of the liver. The rest are well there; Walter a decidedly improved, worthy and amiable man; what their place is, and their manner of welcome to friendly pilgrims, you yourself know. I left Jane under good auspices on Friday afternoon (have not yet heard since); and, under the usual conditions, found Jamie waiting for me at Swaugh;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Ecclefechan railway station; see <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480814-TC-CS-01"><sic>23:91</sic><corr>TC to CS, <date when="1848-08-14">14 Aug. 1848</date></corr></ref>.</note> and all thenceforth plain sailing. At Nethercleugh,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Railway station, Applegarth parish, Dumfriesshire, 3 mi.

<p><pb id="pg-31-144" n="31:144"/>Scotsbrig was all in its usual state; very full of mournful thoughts to me; but otherwise of more matters for thankfulness. I hardly ever in my life was (in all essential points) <hi rend="italic">as well lodged</hi> as during the two nights I continued there. Jane, I suppose, will come down by and by, and then we may have another longer trial.&#x2014; Jamie bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me over hither on Sunday: went home after tea, and here I have been in my fixed quarters,&#x2014;getting on, I must say, very fairly hitherto. Mary is tolerably well, tho&#x2019; sadly wasted and grown old: she has everything in good order, and never was creature more bent to make a fellow creature comfortable. I have bathed twice, and excellently, tho&#x2019; the tides are yet early (today at 11 a.m.); I get supreme coffee every morning; Jamie (of Scotsbrig) has lent me his riding-horse, James Aitken has provided a gig; the Priestside<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sands on the Solway Firth, off the Dumfriesshire coast; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430710-TC-JCA-01"><sic>16:256</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1843-07-10">10 July 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> sea-sahara is really almost sublime to wander about upon; the weather fluctuates but is oftenest brisk and bright: I even get sleep in fair measure,&#x2014;at least always till last night, owing to reasons which we will be aware of in future. I have even brought work, and did scribble a little yesterday: on the whole I hope to be <hi rend="italic">well let alone,</hi> and to do a little good perhaps. Last night (a windy Scotch mist) Austin took me out to drive; drove on to Caerlaverock old Castle<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-21/lt-18460902-TC-JWC-02"><sic>21:39</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1846-09-02">2 Sept. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you recollect); there proposed Dumfries &#x201C;to get a feed for the horse&#x201D;! Which was done, and ought to have been omitted on those terms. I got an evident damage out of such a poking-up. However, we found Jean, James<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken.</note> and all the house in brisk order;&#x2014;we even saw Aird<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Aird.</note> by luck, who runs much better than formerly.

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">My Dear Sir</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>I had received your beautiful little Book, &#x2018;Angel in the House, Book II.,&#x2019; some time ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Betrothal</hi> (<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>) was pt. 1 of Patmore&#x2019;s poem, <hi rend="italic">The Angel in the House. The Espousals</hi> (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>) was pt. 2; it was advertised in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1856-06-28">28 June</date>, as ready &#x201C;this day.&#x201D; Both parts celebrated an ideal of Victorian womanhood and married love. Henry Fothergill Chorley had parodied Patmore&#x2019;s style in his review of <hi rend="italic">The Betrothal,</hi> &#x201C;The author, gentle as a lamb, Has manag&#xE8;d his rhymes to fit, And, haply, fancies he has writ Another &#x2018;In Memoriam&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum,</hi> <date when="1855-01-20">20 Jan. 1855</date>). In spite of this and other contemporary parodies, both parts of <hi rend="italic">The Angel</hi> were extremely popular; by Patmore&#x2019;s death, the poem had sold more than 250,000 copies. It was later criticized as &#x201C;goody-goody dribble&#x201D; (Frederic Harrison, <hi rend="italic">Choice of Books and Other Literary Pieces</hi> [<date when="1886-00-00">1886</date>] 74), and for its attitude toward women: &#x201D; A wife was indeed to be the Angel in the House, but only on condition of remaining always within it, and of spending her life seated at the feet of her lord&#x201D; (Virginia Crawford, &#x201D; Coventry Patmore,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> 75 [<date when="1901-02-01">1 Feb. 1901</date>]: 309&#x2013;10).</note> and reserved it for a good opportunity, which I saw ahead. I brought it with me into these parts, the only modern Book I took that trouble with; and last night I gave myself the pleasure of a deliberate perusal. Upon which, so favourable was the issue, I now give you the superfluous trouble of my verdict,&#x2014;prior to getting into the Solway for a little swim, the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of which I also hear approaching.</p>
<p>Certainly it is a beautiful little Piece, this &#x2018;Espousals&#x2019;; nearly perfect in its kind; the execution and conception full of delicacy, truth, and graceful simplicity; high, ingenious, fine,&#x2014;pure and wholesome as these breezes now blowing round me from the eternal sea. The delineation of the thing is managed with great art, <hi rend="italic">thrift</hi> and success, by that light sketching of parts; of which, both in the choice of what is to be delineated, and in the fresh airy easy way of doing it, I much admire the genial felicity, the real <hi rend="italic">skill.</hi> A charming <hi rend="italic">simplicity</hi> attracts me everywhere: this is a great merit which I am used to in you.&#x2014; Occasionally (oftenest in &#x201C;the Sentences&#x201D;) you get into an antique <hi rend="italic">Cowleian</hi> vein,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., like Abraham Cowley (<date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>&#x2013;<date when="1667-00-00">67</date>), metaphysical poet.</note> what Johnson would call the &#x201C;Metaphysical,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his &#x201C;Life of Cowley,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">The Lives of the English Poets,</hi> 3 vols. (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>).</note> a little; but this too, if well done, as it here is, I like to see,&#x2014;as a gymnastic exercise of wit, were it nothing more. Indeed, I have to own, the whole matter is an &#x201C;ideal&#x201D;; soars high above reality, and leaves the mud of fact (mud with whatever <hi rend="italic">stepping stones</hi> may be discoverable therein) lying far under its feet. But this you will say is a merit, its poetic certificate&#x2014;well, well. Few Books are written with so much conscientious fidelity nowadays, or indeed at any day; and very <pb id="pg-31-146" n="31:146"/>few with anything like the amount of general capability displayed here. I heartily return many thanks for my share of it.</p>
<p>I am here in a kind of &#x201C;retreat&#x201D; for four or three weeks, in the most silent country I could get, near my native Solway, and apart from all mankind,&#x2014;really a kind of Catholic &#x201C;retreat&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> the invocations to the Virgin, &#x26;c. I am about 10 miles from my Birthplace, know all the mountain tops 50 miles round since my eyes first opened; and I do not want for objects of a sufficiently <hi rend="italic">devotional</hi> nature, sad and otherwise. But the &#x201C;tide is in&#x201D; or nearly so: time and tide will wait on no man!</p>

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I am doing excellently well here; have been thrice in the sea, and am just now going again; <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the moss roads;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lochar Moss, nr.

The Mare is a great accommodation; gives me an exceedingly useful and pleasant ride every afternoon (twice over now);&#x2014;has already learned the <hi rend="italic">right-foot</hi> exercise; and in fact is a capital rider. The Canter along these Priest-side Sands is as good as anything I ever tried of that kind.

This contrast of the little bit of Time, during which her goodness can be practically useful to her sad son, with the great Eternity which has now divided us,&#x2014;truly it is sorrowful, but it is grand and high. We will think of it; we will not speak of it.&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>I cannot well get away from my <hi rend="italic">tides,</hi> which last at their best, till about Monday next: Monday, as I judge, will be the last of them. I think a little of coming over to you perhaps on Tuesday <hi rend="italic">after</hi> dinner, and staying till Thursday (<hi rend="italic">precise</hi>): but I do not yet quite know. If you hear <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> farther, you may partly expect me then, about 6 p.m. or so in time for <hi rend="italic">tea.</hi></p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-147" n="31:147"/>Jane writes me altogether favourably from Auchtertool. Tell Isabella, she sends her regards in the kindest terms; says she surely will never be within wind of your House without coming thither; had she been the own sister of both of you, you could not have been kinder; and Scotsbrig was always <hi rend="italic">home.</hi> These are about her words.

If I could do the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> as well as this Picture is done&#x2014; But that will not be my luck this time!</p>
<p>I am grieved a little to think of all the trouble you have had, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> there is no means of repaying: but when you <hi rend="italic">succeed</hi> as in this case, there is a kind of payment in that itself.</p>
<p>I left Mrs C. a week ago in fine airy quiet sea-quarters (or <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> sea) with her Cousins at Auchtertool; she reports altogether favourably of herself yesterday, and seems as if she would stay a while.&#x2014; I myself am excellently situated here: solitary almost as if I were in La Trappe,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Often cited by TC as the epitome of silence; cf. <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540828-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:140</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1854-08-28">28 Aug. 1854</date></corr></ref>.</note> with brisk sea breezes, tides, green fields, Hills English and Scotch all round known to me since birth: I have such a ride on the <hi rend="italic">Priestside</hi> sands every evening (miles on miles of the sleekest hard sea sand) as I could hardly get elsewhere.

<salute>Dear little Jeannie mine,</salute>
<p>It will be better that I write you never so short a word than none at all; you will not grudge any brevity when you understand that is for the sake of &#x201C;work&#x201D; (bless the mark!) which lies immediately behind it. I wrote all my other Notes; three, to Tait, to Scotsbrig, to Dumfries, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> going out to bathe; and now, after a hot walk to and from, and a nice dip between I am here for you before going farther.</p>
<p>I was vastly glad of your little Letter, kind and good, tho&#x2019; sombre and distrustful perhaps beyond need; and bringing me nothing but favourable news. It had &#x201C;too late&#x201D; conspicuously marked on it, otherwise I had not been disappointed on the Wednesday: on Thursday (yesterday) morning it was all the welcomer directly after breakfast. Many thanks to you always, my good little woman; and know, if you can, that in my own way none loves you so well, nor feels that he has better cause to do so.</p>
<p>I am getting on quite perfectly here; hardly ever had such an <hi rend="italic">ideal</hi> of a farm-lodging almost; for I am well let alone too, besides all my other blessings: I have excellent country fare (chickens, milk abundantly, one egg with superior hot coffee to breakfast, and daily at dinner the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> bread-pudding you could wish me,&#x2014;for Margaret<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Austin.</note> is very expert, and all are attentive and good): I ride magnificently too every afternoon (at least 2 and the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> coming); walk again in the fresh dusk, clear solitary roads almost as smooth as Chelsea pavement): I even sleep tolerably; have missed only one night, when Austin took me out to drive, drove on (imprudently) to Dumfries, where we found Jean with <hi rend="italic">company,</hi>&#x2014;and came in for the fag-end of her teapot; I believe that to be it; and will avoid again!&#x2014; &#x2014; Mary has had out the bed, down to its very elements, basking and airing; has even put in new featherbed, and it is really quiet beyond wont: nevertheless it is certain I get bitten,&#x2014;not in the bed, I do believe, but by mosquitoes and other trash, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> abound to a degree.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have been three times down trying &#x201C;work&#x201D; for a couple of hours: it never fairly got begun till yesterday,&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">began</hi> it yet be.</p>
<p>No news or Letters worth a penful of ink: the Voltaire Bookseller,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Heath; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560411-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-04-11">11 April</date></ref>.</note> ignorant of the two <hi rend="italic">new</hi> failures, paid me for the old in <hi rend="italic">stamps</hi> at once, the magnanimous man: Chorley, in reference to the new, writes sham-grandly, &#x201C;like a Bartholomew <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> of flaying;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No closing quotation marks on MS.</note>&#x2014;a very ill-given man, studying to be morally perfect in this world! At last, this morning by itself, comes Tait&#x2019;s Letter <pb id="pg-31-149" n="31:149"/>here inclosed with the Photograph: is it not beautiful? I think the two faces are capital; the whole far beyond any engraving. And have told Tait so.&#x2014; On Tuesday I am for riding up to Scotsbrig (driving, that is, with saddle included), and staying till Thursday. On Monday I ask Jean to come hither. That, O Jeannie mine, is all my history.</p>
<p>How thankful am I that the <hi rend="italic">Anak</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A giant and father of a race of giants; see Num. 13:33 and Deut. 2:11.</note> clogs do serve the turn.

<ps><p>Perhaps you had better send that Photograph <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Tait Letter on to Lady Ashburton; as a sign that nothing has been injured in the great Process.&#x2014; I have never yet written; but you can say I will along with one of the &#x201C;bigger impressions&#x201D; when they come.

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>On informing myself better about the tides, I find that there <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be good bathing tomorrow, and tolerable next day; so that it will not be till Thursday that I get loose. If I write nothing to the contrary, expect me on Thursday, then: it will be <hi rend="italic">after</hi> dinner; I have some kind of work here, which I can get on with in the forenoon when there is no interruption.</p>
<p>The weather has grown consummately hot; for the corn&#x2019;s sake we will wish it may last a fortnight so. I have learned to keep within shelter mainly during the heat. I am well, doing well, but terribly <hi rend="italic">bitten</hi> with <hi rend="italic">clegs,</hi> mosquitos and other wretches</p>
<p>The horse goes excellently; and does me a great deal of good; well earning its daily bit of bread.</p>

<salute>Dear Scott,</salute>
<p>I am very sorry to miss you again: but here I am for the last ten days, and hope to be for three weeks more, in a remote corner of the Solway shore, struggling to compose and refit myself a little; London dirt and tumult being at length grown insupportable to me. My Wife too is in these parts, tho&#x2019; not at the moment with me. We tried, the other day, in Charlotte Square Edinburgh (a kind of desperate venture, grounded on some vague memory of the N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, &#x2018;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 27&#x2019; I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it, which proved false) to get some news of Erskine and you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Erskine often stayed in Charlotte Sq. at various addresses; Scott&#x2019;s connection with the sq. is untraced.</note> during the one hour we had; but it came to nothing, as you may suppose.</p>
<p>Neither is my Brother in London, from whom I could have had reports. He went, Saturday gone a week, towards Vevay in Switzerland, with a young Boy he is guardian of, and means to put in some school there: I suppose he must have already arrived; but I have heard nothing: nor did it seem to be certain whether he would return direct, or go round by Munich &#x26;c. His Address in London used to be: 48. Brompton Road, Brompton: if there is any word of his return before your leaving Town, they will know of it there.</p>
<p>We heard weekly of the ups and downs of your Edinburgh Candidateship, thro&#x2019; the Newspapers.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After the death, <date when="1856-05-06">6 May</date>, of Sir William Hamilton (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12144"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-25/ed-25-biographical-notes"><sic>25:334</sic><corr>25:biographical note</corr></ref>), Scott had applied for the Edinburgh Univ. chair of logic and metaphysics; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560525-TC-AJS-01">TC to AJS, <date when="1856-05-25">25 May</date></ref>.

The <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> pbd. a letter from Edinburgh, <date when="1856-07-24">24 June</date>: &#x201C;No subject more engrosses the attention of a certain class of Edinburgh society at present than the question who shall be the successor of Sir William in the Logic Chair. &#x2026; I regret to say that it is every day assuming more and more an ecclesiastic aspect.&#x201D; The chair was under the patronage of the Town Council of Edinburgh and the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman,</hi> <date when="1856-07-16">16 July</date>, devoted three and a half columns to its report on their proceedings. In the first ballot, Ferrier received 12 votes, Fraser 11, and Scott 8; in the second, Fraser received 17 votes, and Ferrier 14. The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> reported, <date when="1856-07-26">26 July</date>: &#x201C;Among the rumours current, in London at least, as to the circumstances likely to influence the election were the following:&#x2014; That Mr. Fraser might be injured by belonging to the Free Church;&#x2014;that Mr. Ferrier, as the son-in-law of Wilson, would have an almost certain preponderance,&#x2014;that he would be held disqualified by the Germanism of his opinions, and that Mr. Fraser would come in as the representative of the Scotch School;&#x2014;and so on. What influenced the electors we cannot tell; but as we believe they have made a right choice, as between the two, we think it possible enough that our mode of viewing the subject may have been theirs&#x201D; (932).</note> I was disappointed at last; but after all not very sorry <pb id="pg-31-151" n="31:151"/>that you had missed such an Office. If you could but discover, or begin to discover, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> the real University that would suit a Manchester now in our day is, that were an achievement infinitely beyond anything that could be done in Logic either in Edinburgh or out of it! I admit, the problem is exceedingly abstruse; but it is surely not insoluble, and the need of solving it is very great.</p>
<p>I fear there is no chance of your being back in Scotland within the next six weeks; or of my coming athwart you anywhere during these wayfarings of mine. I am trying to pick up a little strength for dealing with frightful masses of Brandenburg and other rubbish which lie ahead of me, and indeed round me over me, nearly to suffocation, this long while! And I have no spur in the head to this Enterprize; only spurs in the heel, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are sore upon an old horse</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We will take Two Pairs of Trowsers according to this Specimen &#x201C;5/&#x201D;; they are the thinnest I can see, and of an <hi rend="italic">inoffensive</hi> pattern of cloth,&#x2014;to which the animal is used.</p>
<p>That &#x201C;5/9&#x201D; dressing-gown pleases me tolerably as to cloth; but the pattern is not quite good, tho&#x2019; better than any of the others. I think of submitting it to Jane (and for that reason have retained <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the sample) before we decide: red and black or blue <hi rend="italic">Plaid</hi> would please me better;&#x2014;but I suppose the narrow stripings are now out? At all events, Jane&#x2019;s failure to do anything better will secure me against criticism in wearing it.&#x2014; I know not whether it is worth while sending to &#x201C;Jim&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken, her son.</note> at Glasgow, in the interim, as you suggested? Follow your own judgement in regard to that. Auchtertool takes probably two days more time.&#x2014; So soon as we have Jane&#x2019;s approval, or her failure and answer, we will, since better may not be, proceed to purchase of that Dumfries &#x201C;5/9,&#x201C;&#x2014;a specimen of lining too is included:&#x2014;keep these and have them all ready to go off at a day&#x2019;s warning. Probably about the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>Here has a little <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> come too, this morning; little Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> (by and by Fred<hi rend="italic">k</hi> the Great) beating a child&#x2019;s drum year (<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>) and his eldest sister (age <pb id="pg-31-152" n="31:152"/>then 6 or 7) assisting,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560701-TC-AGI-01">TC to <sic>AG</sic><corr>AGI</corr>, <date when="1856-07-01">1 July</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014;who also became a notable woman by and by (&#x201C;Margravine of Baireuth&#x201D;), and wrote a book wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> all the world still reads.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560305-TC-AGI-01">TC to <sic>AG</sic><corr>AGI</corr>, <date when="1856-03-05">5 March</date></ref>.</note> The incident is a truth, and the bits of figures are Portraits taken at the time.&#x2014; &#x2014; I have a Copy of the Photograph considerably <hi rend="italic">larger;</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you may have in exchange for that, if you like it better when you next come Sunday week, I hope?&#x2014;</p>

<p>According to Tait&#x2019;s (this <hi rend="italic">Photographer&#x2019;s</hi>) Letter, John is likely to be home from Switzerland &#x201C;about the end of this week!&#x201D; I hardly think so; it must have been some loose word spoken.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Tait,</salute>
<p>Your valuable heavy Parcel came safe yesterday morning; full of beautiful impressions of the &#x201C;Little Drummer,&#x201D; the choicest ones on Card, as I could notice, of which due regard shall be had. I am again very much obliged to you.&#x2014; These Copies will amply suffice for the present: but pray <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> the &#x201C;Negative&#x201D; carefully, for it is of value.</p>
<p>Could you compute, with commercial accuracy, what the printing of, say, 2000 Copies, each on a bit of paper the size of a leaf of Macaulay&#x2019;s History,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A leaf of Macaulay&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The History of England from the Accession of James II</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>) measured 4 by 7 ins. (10 by 18 cm.).</note> and in a colour sure of standing, would cost? There is no manner of hurry; but pray try by degrees. I have a notion such a frontispiece w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do very well for the first volume of such a Book as mine.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Little Drummer&#x201D; became the frontispiece to vol. 1 of the first edn. In the Centenary edn., it is 12: opp. 370. Possibly it was taken from Tait&#x2019;s photograph as the reproduction is credited: &#x201C;<hi rend="small-caps">engraved by frances holl</hi>. <hi rend="small-caps">from a copy in lord ashburton&#x2019;s possession of the picture at charlottensburg by antoine pesne</hi>&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12: opp. 370).</note> No Engraving will ever come near that Photograph in point of excellence.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-153" n="31:153"/>Meanwhile w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> you do me another favour: Go to your Frame-maker,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> namely, and ascertain accurately what <hi rend="italic">his</hi> charge for men&#x2019;s work, expended on this present adventure, amounts to. It would be intolerable to me to think of your being called to <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> money over and above;&#x2014;and this is one of the few points that <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be got at. Plan to pay him at once, and I will pay you back in Postage-stamps; and so we will stop up that little hole.</p>
<p>I am still perfectly secluded here; and seem to myself to be making marked improvements in regard to the health department. We have had a week of the hottest weather known for 30 years. Yesterday it thundered all round in the distance, all day; and at length in the evening, right overhead, with copious down pouring for near an hour: today all is dry again, and it is as warm as ever. The thunder killed an Ox in the next farm, but did no other mischief that I hear of. The heat is most welcome to the farming world;&#x2014;means <hi rend="italic">broad bannocks</hi> for everybody,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., thick, as opposed to thin, bannocks would follow a good harvest.</note> for which there was a bad outlook lately.</p>
<p>I have not heard from my Brother since the morning of his outset: he did not then seem to anticipate being home so soon as his word to you had indicated.&#x2014; Foxton<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick J. Foxton (F<hi rend="italic">n</hi>) admired TC; in <hi rend="italic">Popular Christianity</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), he referred to TC as &#x201C;the greatest of modern seers&#x201D; (127) and cited long passages from <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> (137) and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (216&#x2013;17) to reinforce his attacks against those who tried &#x201C;to bind the faith of mankind by dogmatical articles, by creeds and confessions&#x201D; (149).</note> writes in a very cheery manner, inviting Cheyne Row to come and see <hi rend="italic">Rhayader.</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A market town on the river Wye, central Wales.</note> F<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is brown as a berry, he says; his ill-health all gone, by virtue of rustic labours, and a natural way of life.</p>

However, I will suppose there is still nothing wrong; and wait patiently,&#x2014;having no chance now till Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> or Monday morning when I return from Scotsbrig, whither I am bound this afternoon at last. My <hi rend="italic">tides</hi> are now fairly done; yesterday was about 4 p. m., and <hi rend="italic">brakish</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;brackish.&#x201D;</note> instead of salt.</p>
<p>I seem to be doing really excellently in regard to health: it is hardly credible <pb id="pg-31-154" n="31:154"/>what a change (<hi rend="italic">mostly</hi> for the better) has been bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> about since I escaped from that Devil&#x2019;s-Oven with its dirts and noises. In fact, I believe myself a good deal <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; sleep is still a little defective (not owing to noises or faults of the bed), and my thoughts, altogether solitary (or worse, when I am put to talk much with these kind simple souls), are gloomy and heavy, very far indeed from bright or of undue <hi rend="italic">levity.</hi>&#x2014; For the rest, I have done a little work (actually 3 leaves or so!) as well as bathed and been bitten. The Parson of the Parish<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >3. Probably George Gillespie (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), Church of Scotland minister of Cummertrees, Annan presbytery, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">70</date>.</note> took the freedom to call one day; left a card, I being happily in the sea: I do not think of returning his call, being here incognito, so to speak. I go about, free and easy; actually in my old <hi rend="italic">Tartan jacket</hi> (which has a rustic <foreign><hi rend="italic">degag&#xE9;</hi></foreign> air, Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> having mended the elbows, and weighs hardly above 3 ounces); I luckily too had packed in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> pair, half-dirty, of duck trowsers, which are a perfect treasure in this great heat. Such a heat as I do not recollect since <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, the rainless year. Yesterday, nearly all day in the distance, and at even<hi rend="italic">g</hi> right overhead with vehement rain, we had thunder, of strange rattling quality, like musketry near at hand: it killed a <foreign><hi rend="italic">stot</hi></foreign> in the next farm; no other damage done. I rode almost to Annan, and back, after it was over. Today is hot as ever, and there is again thunder audible.</p>
<p>Have you got to bathe, then? You surely should. Does your good sleep (comparative) continue?&#x2014; Tell Anne (who hates free air) to <hi rend="italic">love</hi> it while we are away; and to keep up the windows thoroughly: do; I often think of this. She is capable of having the House all <hi rend="italic">infected</hi> with live rubbish against our return. Here I have bed, mattress, clothes and everything carried out into the sun, and laid out over trestles all day; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has wro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a wondrous benefit,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the villainous mosquitos occasionally get in upon me, for there is thorough-draft, windows up to the utmost in permanence day and night.&#x2014; But I ought to end clattering, and take to the little bit of business I have.</p>
<p>Business is merely of a <hi rend="italic">Dressing-gown</hi> and pair of light Trowsers to be made here. Trowsers are settled; Jean, who was here on Monday, sending out specimens yesterday; of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> the Trowsers suited,&#x2014;but the Dressing-gown, as you may see by the inclosed specimens, was dubious These were the two likeliest Patterns; price is marked on each. After painful weighing, I settled it thus: the <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> check &#x201C;5 / 9&#x201D; was returned to Jean, with instruction, not to buy till you had seen and reported; if you could do no better, <hi rend="italic">then</hi> buy,&#x2014;what else c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> we do? I wanted a narrower stripe (common red-and-blue <hi rend="italic">Plaid,</hi> of fair quality, or the like) but I know not whether other places are not as empty of it as Dumfries&#x2014;I by no means bid or even wish a sail across to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on such an errand; not by any means unless you yourself like it for a &#x201C;lark&#x201D;;&#x2014;that is absolutely the fact. Take off your <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> from the grey duffle,&#x2014;so that you <pb id="pg-31-155" n="31:155"/>cannot quiz me while wearing it,&#x2014;and that specimen will do abundantly well for an old fellow like me.&#x2014; I intend 3 new nightshirts, and other slight outfittings; but these I can right well (best of all) manage here or at Dumfries. Margaret is a capital sewer, washer, housemaid (elementally), Cook (d<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> makes Breadpuddings nearly incomparable, and coffee hot as even I wish it), can yoke gigs &#x26;c &#x26;c withal: in short, I think she is worth about four Annes,&#x2014;and does not look for any &#x201C;Tea money&#x201D; from the world, poor thing! The disgusting <hi rend="italic">dearth</hi> of London, the noise, unwholesomeness, dirt and fret of one&#x2019;s whole existence there, has often forced itself upon me, while I look at this frugality and these results. If I had once done with those Books, what more have I to do with that healthless profitless, mad and heavyladen place? I will really put it to you once more, my little Dame, to consider if it were not better we returned to poor old Scotland, there to adjust ourselves a little, there to lay our bones. I care not much in what part: Annandale is very sad to me; and has no charm almost,&#x2014;except that Jamie w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be here to do bargaining &#x26;c. It is certain we might live here in <hi rend="italic">opulence</hi> (keep <hi rend="italic">brougham,</hi> cow, minister&#x2019;s-man<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >General servant.</note> &#x26;c), and give our poor selves and Nero a much wholesomer life, were those Printing Enterprises once ended.&#x2014; However, there is still plenty of time to reflect: the Printings are by no means done!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I kept those three Notes, that you might read them before burning. Foxton is very good: Thackeray sent a Brass Pen; won&#x2019;t do; but I found it very kind to think of one in that way. Foxton I <hi rend="italic">asked</hi> to come to us &#x201C;for 3 nights&#x201D; after our return;&#x2014;probably he will, in October or so.</p>
<p>And now yesterday morning Tait sends his new Copies of the Photograph;&#x2014;I think, 3 of each kind; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> seem to me very good. The <hi rend="italic">best,</hi> I can notice, are put <hi rend="italic">on Card;</hi> these I keep for your ultimate disposal: I have already given Jean one, Mary one (to be framed); and must send a couple analagous to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> of your lot to Lady Ashburton; after which my work with them is done.&#x2014; Do not write if it is a bother to you; but do if it is not.

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Here have the promised &#x201C;large impressions&#x201D; of the Little Drummer and his Sister arrived; and along with your copy of them, I am permitted to write a word. Jane sent you, I suppose, the smaller &#x201C;first impression&#x201D; of all: I fear you care nothing about any of them; but to me they are very pretty, a new fruit of the goodness of Bath House withal; and very welcome today as the term I had set myself for again send you a word. A word <foreign><hi rend="italic">de Profundis</hi></foreign> [from the depths]; for there is not out of La Trappe, if in it, any depth of seclusion in the remote corners of the universe equal to mine. You vanished from me, this day gone a fortnight, out of Barry&#x2019;s H&#xF4;tel,&#x2014;Mason and the <foreign>valetaille</foreign> [team of flunkeys] just hastily bowling off when we returned;&#x2014;My Lady gone north to the <foreign>ultima Thule</foreign>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Northernmost point of the habitable world.</note> and I to go south hitherward into very still quarters. I have almost nothing to say, whatever I may have thought: an inarticulate <foreign><hi rend="italic">suspirium</hi></foreign> [sigh] &#x201C;from the deeps,&#x201D; towards one whom I figure, and have always figured, as soaring and sailing naturally in the clouds, looking down with a goodness to me which partakes of the nature of miracle to my mind.</p>
<p>Certainly you did a good thing that day in tearing me up from Chelsea, and whirling me off, with <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> axle, in a whirlwind of dust, into these dumb regions:&#x2014;how beautifully you did it, too; I really never saw better behaviour under baddish usage:&#x2014;but you do belong to the clouds, in a sense, you; tho&#x2019; some others of us do not.&#x2014; I reached this, Sunday gone a week; went at once into a vigorous, rigorous, rustic regimen; maximum of action, minimum of speech: and actually the change in my poor nervous system is already becoming conspicuous. I hope it will turn out for good! I gallop daily on boundless expanses of sea-sand vacant of any creature, except sea-mews and my horse and me; ten miles of it if I like, Skiddaw Fells and the Solway far off on one hand of me; nearer, on the other, innocent white cottages (of farmers skilful in bog and marsh; of poor weavers, fishers of flounders &#x26;c,&#x2014;who are happy creatures, with their cat and dog, and wife baking in the silent yellow of the evening sun,&#x2014;at least so one of them was, to appearance, when I entered to inquire my road)&#x2014;innocent white cottages and the whole of Scotland with its Hills and Memories Loch Luichart among the rest. Nobody speaks to me, I to nobody, except time of day. I bathe diligently in the sea, also in fresh <hi rend="italic">douches</hi> (so surprising to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> French friend);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC possibly meaning waterfalls by &#x201C;douches,&#x201D; rather than showers; French friend unidentified.</note> I live literally altogether upon <pb id="pg-31-157" n="31:157"/>farm-produce, eggs, milk, ground meal, with a modicum of chicken-broth; my drink is the crystal well (or sweet whey, upon which I am carousing at present), and one desert-spoonful of brandy mixed with the sauce of my daily bread-pudding.

Opposed on the grounds that a more general bill to cover such cases would be preferable to one that affected only certain individuals, it was also argued that it broke church law to allow resignations on compact of money, which could lead to corruption (<hi rend="italic">Hansard</hi> 3d ser., 143 (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>): 841&#x2013;42).

<p>The new leaf warns me to close this babble.&#x2014; I am greatly bitten by insects, mosquitos, horse-flies, gnats and rubbish,&#x2014;what on Earth becomes of your poor Ladyship in the Highland Heather?

One night my hand was actually as plump as one of yours,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; perhaps inferior a little in colour and form. By Heavens favour the wretches are tiring of me again.&#x2014; For the rest, we have for a week past such a heat as was not seen for 30 years,&#x2014;welcome to the farmer;&#x2014;and today is the second day of thunder; which however does not seem to cool us at all, the rain vanishing again straightway.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dear little Goody:</salute> your kind little Note was a great and welcome surprise to me here this morning, after my <hi rend="italic">first</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">bathing</hi>) walk before breakfast: I had no idea you could have so well computed the days, and contingencies of posts.</p>
<p>I came over yesterday afternoon, according to program; dry and unhurt, tho&#x2019; begirt with thunder-clouds;&#x2014;drove in the gig, carrying my saddle with me. I am very well (for the present, rain pouring outside, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> must <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> before my horse and I can act); I need not say I was well received. I have also the privilege of being <hi rend="italic">left alone</hi> this forenoon altogether, and am busy reading <hi rend="italic">Suetonius,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gaius Suetonius Tranquillus, <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Caesars;</hi> possibly the trans. by A. Thomson (<date when="1796-00-00">1796</date>) that TC had tried to get for Lord Ashburton in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date> (see <ref target="volume-25/lt-18501117-TC-R-01"><sic>25:289&#x2013;91</sic><corr>TC to R, <date when="1850-11-17">17 Nov. 1850</date></corr></ref>).</note> upon a sofa of due length. People are better to me than I deserve.</p>
<p>Yesternight passing thro&#x2019; Ecclefechan I put a Letter for you into the Post office; it will be at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> tonight, at Auchtertool tomorrow, and I think you will not get it till monday. It was written at Gill, with some private disappoint<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <pb id="pg-31-160" n="31:160"/>at not having <hi rend="italic">heard</hi> that morning. A <hi rend="italic">weighty</hi> Letter; contains <hi rend="italic">cloth</hi> and other things! The <hi rend="italic">Cloth</hi> concerns a new <hi rend="italic">Dressing-gown;</hi> which you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> now be able to manage for me: the Letter from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> will only take a day to Gill; and a Parcel (if you find right to <hi rend="italic">purchase,</hi>&#x2014; see Letter when it arrives) will cost very little. Do what you find best, when you have seen the Letter now running on its travels.</p>
<p>And thanks again, dear Goody, for your desperate <hi rend="italic">attempts</hi> to write,&#x2014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are perfectly successful, you see: the distracted scrub of a steel pen, and gas-light that will not illuminate with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> poisoning, cannot prevent one&#x2019;s meaning from shining thro&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Poor good Betty, with her pale old clean face, and honest afflicted heart!

<p>And do not stay long at <hi rend="italic">Craigen</hi> Villa with its carts going thro&#x2019; your brain! I surely need not bid you get fast out of that, and back to Auchtertool again.&#x2014;I return, Sunday ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> or Monday morning, according to the weather.

The next moment I was in her arms, and then my &#x201C;god mother&#x201D; tottered <hi rend="italic">blindly</hi> forward and took me in hers and the two dear old women clasped and kissed and wept over me, both together&#x2014;and called out &#x201C;Jeanie Jeanie&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh my own bairn&#x201D;!&#x2014;&#x201C;my Angel&#x201D;!! and ever so many beautiful names.&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Donaldson and Miss Eliza,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The famed Cantab. doctor&#x2019;s (Dr. Donaldson) mother and sister&#x201D; (note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> had kindly retired to their own room, that the meeting might transact itself in peace.

<p>I expect to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in my great comfortable fourposted bed&#x2014;now that the first exciting night is over&#x2014;and shall stay till the middle of next week I think. My Aunts were extremely kind, and expect me to make <hi rend="italic">them</hi> a long visit on my return&#x2014;but that is not possible, on account of the gass in my bedroom at Morningside, and the public road passing the window, where carts grind from three in the morning&#x2014;Besides that I <hi rend="italic">like</hi> being at Auchtertool, and they want me there for all the time I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> stay&#x2014; Everybody is so kind to me&#x2014;oh so kind! that I often burst out crying with pure thankfulness to them all&#x2014;</p>

<p>I had two bathes in the sea&#x2014;neither did me any good but harm&#x2014;the first a great deal of harm, by ill luck&#x2014;</p>
<p>Just the day after I wrote I had had no bathing; Walter took me to Aberdower and I was to partly undress and get a bathing gown at Aberdower House<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aberdour House is beside Aberdour Castle, Aberdour, S of Burntisland, on the Firth of Forth.</note> wher M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Major Liddle<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a relation of the Liverpool Liddles, friends of the Welshes (see <ref target="volume-25/ed-25-biographical-notes"><sic>25:336</sic><corr>25:biographical note</corr></ref>); or possibly married to a descendant of the Charles Liddell who designed the gardens of Aberdour House (early 17th cent.); not otherwise identified.

<p>I inclose a note from Lady A which was forwarded to me here this morning&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am not sure where to address but as one letter was sent to Scotsbrig I had best send this one to the Gill</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am sorry, but not much surprised, to hear of the bad commercial success of your Poem.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In fact the poem was a commercial success; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560731-TC-CP-01">TC to CP, <date when="1856-07-31">31 July</date></ref>.</note> The Public of Readers, now that everybody has taken to read, and whosoever has twopence in his pocket to pay into a Circulating Library, whether he have any fraction of wit in his head or not, is a sovereign Rhadamanthus of Books for the time being, has become more astonishing than ever! Probably there never was such a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Plebs</hi></foreign> [Populace] before, entitled to hold up its thumb with <foreign><hi rend="italic">vivat</hi></foreign> [let him live] or <foreign><hi rend="italic">pereat</hi></foreign> [let him die] to the poor fencers in the Literary Ring.&#x2014; The only remedy is, not to mind them; to set one&#x2019;s face against them like a flint:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 50:7.</note> for they cannot kill one, after all, tho&#x2019; they think they do it; one has to say, &#x201C;Dull impious <foreign><hi rend="italic">canaille</hi></foreign> [common herd], it was not for you that I wrote; not to please <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that I was brandishing what weapons the gods gave me!&#x201D; Patience too, in this world, is a very necessary element of victory.</p>
<p>It is certain, if there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> any perennial Running Brook, were it the smallest rill coming from the eternal fountains, whole Atlantic Oceans of froth will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be able to cover it up forever; said rill will, one day, be <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> running under the light of the sun, said froth having altogether vanished no man knows whither. That is the Law of Nature, in spite of all blusterings of any Plebs or Devil; and we must silently trust in that.</p>
<p>Unhappily the Reviewer too is generally in the exact ratio of the Readers; a dark blockhead with braggartism superadded; properly the supreme blockhead of blockheads, being a vocal one withal, and conscious of being <hi rend="italic">wise.</hi> Him also we must leave to his fate: an inevitable phenomenon (&#x201C;like people, like priest&#x201D;)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hosea 4:9.</note>
, yet a transitory one he too.</p>
<p>You need not doubt but I shall be ready, of my own accord, to recommend this Book by all opportunities for what I privately perceive it to be. I am considering also whether there is not some exceptional reviewer, whom I might endeavour to interest in it, with some hope of profit; shall perhaps hit on such a one by and by: unhappily my connexion with that guild of craftsmen is almost <hi rend="italic">null</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">less</hi>) this long while. You may depend upon it I will neglect no good occasion.&#x2014; Recommending perseverance in the mean time and at all times; and what the Scotch call &#x201C;a stout heart to a steep hill,&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> <closer><salute>I remain always</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Is n&#x2019;t it vexatious?</salute> it has rained almost incessantly ever since I left Auchtertool. I can&#x2019;t get out to look about me and see the people&#x2014;only for half an hour last evening there was a drizzling <hi rend="italic">fairness,</hi> in which I walked along the Dunbar road some half mile, accompanied by Miss Eliza,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donaldson.</note> tho&#x2019; I would rather not&#x2014;</p>
<p>I slept a little better last night&#x2014;but how queer it was to hear that &#x2018;Town Clock&#x2019; striking!&#x2014; Its voice was so familiar, and yet so ghostly&#x2014; But there is no use for describing my present feelings all the more that they <hi rend="italic">cant</hi> be described&#x2014;</p>
<p>I take &#x201C;good long <hi rend="small-caps">cries</hi>&#x201D; in my own room, and that is the best relief, and the least troublesome to &#x201C;others&#x201D;</p>
<p>What I am writing about today is the dressing gown, both your packets came together this morning I think the checked grey duffle very pretty&#x2014;it would be better thicker cloth perhaps. I shall look at what they have in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; In case I find any I think more suitable, I should need to know the quantity&#x2014;and you could tell me at the same time how to send the parcel&#x2014;</p>
<p>I think I shall return to my aunts on Tuesday or Wednesday&#x2014; I cannot get staid much longer as Jeannie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chrystal.</note> is coming ove<supplied>[r]</supplied> to Auchtertool to see me the end of the week So have a letter for me at Craigen Villa Morningside on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I came back last night, whole and well (all but a speck of skin lost from one of my toes, by defect of <hi rend="italic">shoes</hi> in the <foreign>glarry</foreign> weather): I had waited the last 24 hours in expectation of the rain ending, which it at length did. I kept well, tho&#x2019; with sad objects round me all the time I was there; managed to get a ride or two over the wildernesses; and was very affectionately treated: but on the whole I find roving does me mischief; I am better the quieter I keep,&#x2014;better here with my bits of papers, and mere silence round me. It was such a 60 hours of thunder, and then such a <hi rend="italic">Ditto</hi> of rain, as I have seldom seen.</p>
<p>Here was a Note lying from Jack; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I send you first; to be sent on to Scotsbrig next. Just put it into an empty cover; write &#x201C;all well,&#x201D; if you have no notion of more; and despatch it: I have written a word that explains.&#x2014;Neuberg my German, I find, is bending towards those Geneva regions on some tour; I have a thought to give Jack and him a chance of meeting,&#x2014;but perhaps shall not have time today.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-167" n="31:167"/>Jane, from whom I have three Notes is at Haddington among the kind old Donaldsons, who will not let her go for the whole of this week; about next Monday she returns to Fife, without pausing hardly at all, as she anticipated, with her Aunts at Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> She is well, for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>; and full naturally of many emotions among her old Friends, and earliest Scenes wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are now so altered to her, according to the common lot.</p>
<p>She <hi rend="italic">approves</hi> of the grey check, as &#x201C;a very nice pattern,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; perhaps the cloth might be finer:&#x2014;since that is so, I will write to her this day, that we will simply stand by it, then; and that she need not give herself the trouble of a ride to Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Do not altogether <hi rend="italic">buy,</hi> however, till I hear again that she has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and bought!</p>
<p>For the rest the Tailor is here just now (upon Austin&#x2019;s work); and is appointed to appear on <hi rend="italic">Friday morning,</hi> and start with me. So we must attend to that date. I fear, therefore, we shall not be quite up to the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow patterns</hi> if you have got them; at least we must have something else to start with. I send another <hi rend="italic">pair</hi> of samples, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I had thought of before,&#x2014;one pair of trowsers from each, since you object to the other corduroy. Those latter will really do well enough; one of them (<hi rend="italic">simple</hi> as a waistcoat-back, never mind) is supple as air, very cheap too; and <hi rend="italic">corduroy</hi> like the other (only it might be softer and thinner with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> harm) is my regular wear. Will do very well.&#x2014; I forgot when you were here that I wanted a <hi rend="italic">Cape</hi> too, of humble plaiden stuff (if the man know how to cut it?)&#x2014;perhaps Glasgow can do something for us there?&#x2014; No more: at least till I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> writing, and come to seal.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi></salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks dear Goody:</salute> I got two of your Letters here, when I arrived last night; and the other has come this morning: very well, very well indeed. You will surely be better at Sunny Bank than you could almost anywhere be; very clearly better than at any <hi rend="italic">Craigen</hi> where waggons roll upon one&#x2019;s brain all morning. It is quite affecting, all that comportment of the good old Women; the scene in general is naturally the saddest but also the sacredest of all <pb id="pg-31-168" n="31:168"/>scenes to my poor little Jeannie;&#x2014;it does one good to be sad in such a way, and is better than any joy now left, or indeed that one ever had.</p>
<p>The 60 hours of thunder were succeeded by a 60 hours of rain, part of it pouring deluge, the most of it tempestuous drizzle, all of it very uncomfortable. I got a ride daily nevertheless; one a fine long one, thro&#x2019; the desarts of Linbrigford and the Upper Kirtle Water<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Linnbrig Ford, 5 mi. NE of Scotsbrig, and Kirtle Water, a stream in S Dumfriesshire, winding 16 mi. SW into the Solway Firth at Kirtlefoot.</note> (in the visitation of the <hi rend="italic">winds,</hi> and of nothing else), other two were shorter, and the last of them at 10 <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> m.,&#x2014;very useful all. Kindness could not be more complete; but I had far too much talk. On Sunday I made a visit, not to any Church, but <hi rend="italic">whither</hi> you can guess;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The graveyard at Ecclefechan.</note> had a few sacred moments there, standing with bared head out of sight: surely there is not any mystery more divine than this unspeakably sad and holy one.

<salute>Dear Tait,</salute>
<p>I had been across the Country for a couple of days; and found your Note last night at my return.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your prompt definite compliance on this occasion: I enclose the due 63 Majesty&#x2019;s Heads;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Postage stamps.</note> and so roll that little matter off my conscience.</p>
<p>Do not trouble yourself too much ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the projected Frontispiece Photograph: I almost foresee it will not come practically to much,&#x2014;with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> more <hi rend="italic">luck</hi> than I can expect. As to the <hi rend="italic">size,</hi> we must be regulated by the size of the <hi rend="italic">Book-page</hi> (of which I have no specimen here); the biggest <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will admit will be the preferable,&#x2014;I mean biggest <hi rend="italic">whole group.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> one therefore, I fear, is too large?</p>
<p>But again the <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> one would be very pretty, if a space the size of it were left blank in the due printed page, and the thing there pasted on: is that ever done? It is a possible operation;&#x2014;and the difference between that and <hi rend="italic">wood-cuts</hi> is incalculable. You might ask a little about that latter point too.</p>
<p>A Letter from Neuberg this morning gives animated account of <hi rend="italic">Kissingen,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >German spa, 62 mi. E of Frankfurt.</note> <pb id="pg-31-170" n="31:170"/>and the Bath-People there: N<hi rend="italic">g</hi> aims towards Switzerland, and to be home before Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> end. My Brother is not coming while August lasts.</p>
<p>Another Letter from Foxton urges me to Rhayader on my way homeward: unfortunately, I have no chance for that. Indeed I am better here than I could well elsewhere be, so long as my rustication will endure.</p>
<closer><salute>Yours always with many thanks,</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>

<salute>Dear Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Your Kissingen Letter reached me safely yesterday morning in this remote corner of the Earth; and conveyed an interesting picture of Human Life in the vallies of the Frankish Saale.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saale Fr&#xE4;nkische, river in N Bavaria, flowing SW into the Main.</note> You appear to have All the World and his Wife about you in those Pumprooms at Kissingen:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spa town in N Bavaria.</note> it is like reading the Gazette of a big seafight, while sitting far inland amid solitary bushes by a tinkling little brook. I am glad to hear the place suits you in point of health; and promises some improvement in that most important particular.</p>
<p>We got away from London, as if by a kind of miracle, or help of the gods, in the last week of July. The beneficent Lady Ashburton tore us up, being bound herself to the Highlands, in a sublime vehicle, used by the Queen on former occasions, of the nature of a travelling house, rather than mortal railway carriage; and whirled us off, there being spare room in abundance, towards Edinburgh, at the rate of 40 miles an hour, one morning. Our journey was none of the pleasantest after all; heat very potent, dust very copious; delirious speed presiding over every part of our arrangements;&#x2014;axle-tree of sublime vehicle at last taking fire, so that it had to be <hi rend="italic">condemned</hi> somewhere in Northumberland, and we flung into common vehicles, much in a hurry at last; which however we all of us (especially the Lady) stood in a heroic manner. Within the time, after all (about 11 hours) we were landed at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (above 400 miles I think)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From London.</note>
; a very dusty astonished party, but otherwise uninjured by the whirl we had undergone. I continue to feel that, under all conditions, Express-Train (or indeed Rail in any form) is by far the most inhuman mode of travelling that the sinful Posterity of Adam have ever hit upon since they lost their natural mode of Psyche-wings,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Psyche,</hi> Greek for &#x201C;soul,&#x201D; often pictured in Greek folklore as a butterfly.</note> a very long time ago.&#x2014; Next day the Lady A., who had found her Husband waiting in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> <pb id="pg-31-172" n="31:172"/>went off again towards the <foreign>Ultima Thule</foreign>; I took my wife across the Frith there, to a very pleasant place among pleasant cousins; and on the morrow after that, struck southward (90 miles or so) to this stillest of all nooks, on the shore of the Solway, within ten miles of my birthplace, where arrangements had been made for me much to my mind. Here with trifling interruptions I have been ever since; diligently bathing when the full-sea serves, diligently riding, walking every twilight and morning;&#x2014;silent nearly as a stone, and altogether more solitary than I could be anywhere else even in La Trappe itself. The Mistress of the House is a kind Sister of mine, memorable to me for her practical goodness from of old; her Daughters wait loyally, and with every kind of skill, upon the veteran uncle,&#x2014;as does the master their Father (a most quiet loyal Scotch Farmer);&#x2014;and everybody knows that first duty of leaving me <hi rend="italic">well alone.</hi> So that, on the whole, I was never better lodged, or done for; and seem to myself in these two weeks to be making singular improvements in respect of health and strength. I do not want for innumerable reflexions; generally of a rather sombre nature, in a place so much resembling <hi rend="italic">Hades</hi> to me; but these are not useless to a man, by no means, even if they were avoidable. I know, from my boyhood, all the mountains &#x26;c fifty miles round, and have liberty to converse with these; the human species not having any right to trouble me with its foolish speech, except a pious Good-morrow if by rare accident we meet on the lonely smooth roads. I have ten miles excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sea-sand to gallop upon (no company but a few sea-mews consulting remotely about their commissariat affairs): my Horse is excellent, and reminds me, by its temper and some of its ways, of the worthy quadruped I had last autumn.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg&#x2019;s horse; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550827-TC-JN-01"><sic>30:43</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1855-08-27">27 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; I have brought some Papers with me; and occasionally try to do a bit of work, getting F<hi rend="italic">k&#x2019;s</hi> &#x201C;Introduction&#x201D; worked thro&#x2019; the shoreless lake of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Reichshistorie</hi></foreign> [Empire history],&#x2014;not with much effect hitherto. My Wife still continues among her kindred and old friends, <hi rend="italic">Head</hi>-quarters where I left her; and seems to be doing almost as well as I, and to be in no haste to move. There is little chance of our lifting anchor, I should think, before August end: after that, all is still vague; but I guess it may be near or altogether the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of September before we see Chelsea again.</p>
<p>If you had gone to Wien,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Vienna.</note> I meant to have set you on asking where the Island of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Camberg</hi> on the Donau&#x201D; is: and to bid you take a good look of it as you passed. It was <hi rend="italic">there</hi> that Ottocar (A.d.<date when="1276-00-00">1276</date>) did his <hi rend="italic">homage</hi> to Kaiser Rudolf, with the curtains of the tent rushing down on a sudden:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Camberg, an island in the Danube, and the forced homage of Ottocar II (ca. <date when="1230-00-00">1230</date>&#x2013;<date when="1278-00-00">78</date>), king of Bohemia and duke of Austria, to Emperor Rudolf I (<date when="1218-00-00">1218</date>&#x2013;<date when="1291-00-00">91</date>), see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:110.</note> In K&#xF6;hler

TC&#x2019;s copy, inscribed &#x201C;T. Carlyle, Chelsea, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>&#x201C;: HCC. He writes in <hi rend="italic">Frederick:</hi> &#x201C;This is by no means K&#xF6;hler&#x2019;s chief Book; but this too is good, and does, in a solid effective way, what it attempts. He seems to me by far the best Historical Genius the Germans have yet produced, though I do not find much mention of him in their Literary Histories and Catalogues. A man of ample learning, and also of strong cheerful human sense and human honesty; whom it is thrice pleasant to meet with in those ghastly solitudes, populous chiefly with doleful creatures&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:59).</note> I find the place specified as above, no whisper of it in any other Book, nor in any Map or Lexicon of mine; and I want to know <hi rend="italic">where</hi> it is if I could. Perhaps you may fall in with some superior Map, learned Professor or the like, who can tell you. Environs of Wien I should guess&#x2014;but truly it is no great matter; and I have already arranged to do without knowing.</p>
<p>My Brother is just now, and till the end of the month, in the very country you are bound for: one of the reasons of my writing so soon is to give you a chance of meeting if you care mutually to exert yourselves. He went off, shortly after us, towards Vevay (or <hi rend="italic">Vevey</hi> I think he writes), with one of his Boys whom he is settling for a year or two in some big School there,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Pre</hi>-Military School, as it were; the name of it not farther known to me.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The school is untraced.</note> A Letter from him two days ago represents the operation as happily completed; his own resolutions not yet fixed farther, except that he means to continue till about the end of August, without travelling farther, except towards Berne or Z&#xfc;rich, for a day or two, to meet some English friends who are passing,&#x2014;who, probably before this, <hi rend="italic">have</hi> passed. A Letter addressed &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Poste Restante,</hi> Vevay, Canton de Vaud&#x201D; would be apt to find him, if not too late. I have not written to him at all of any such possibility; nor am likely to do so, being silent till a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Letter come: so that the adventure rests wholly with yourself, and will never crow as a Cock in this world but die <foreign><hi rend="italic">in ovo</hi></foreign> [in the egg], if you merely do nothing.</p>
<p>I sent the Reichenbach part of your Letter (indeed the whole Letter, but with that part of it marked) off to my Wife yesterday; recommending she should forward it to Reich<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and advise him to think seriously whether he could not in practical fact get home to Oppeln again. In America he does not in the least look like prospering.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reichenbach had written from Norristown, Pennsylvania, <date when="1856-07-18">18 June</date>, regretting his decision to emigrate in <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>: &#x201C;I feel more and more convinced what an utter blank I am, ignorant and hollow, sometimes deceiving others by mere outward appearances, besides I am declining in the stage of this money making society, by my inability, but withall, too proud to be intruder on anybody. Could my letters be agreeable to you certainly I would write, but I am convinced that all those who have known me prefer to loose sight of me.&#x201D; On TC&#x2019;s advice, Neuberg wrote a testimonial for Reichenbach and encouraged him to return to his home in Oppeln, Silesia. But Reichenbach was aware of the harsh political atmosphere in Prussia. The constitution, imposed by Friedrich Wilhelm IV, <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>, had secured the dominance of the small landowning <hi rend="italic">Junker</hi> class, which supported his brutal repression of dissent. Writing, <date when="1856-09-09">9 Sept.</date>, Reichenbach explained his reasons for remaining in America: &#x201C;I left only when there was no chance of any thing but arbitrary rule, for I would have even returned from Belgium if there had been. I may be <supplied>[far too]</supplied> sentimental and good natured to be practical but I am not so easily frightened out of my wits. I would be in prison now and for all time to come &#x2026; and would be so if I had idea to return. Besides it is not in my habits to implore pardon and grace. &#x2026; There is little chance of my returning to any other part of Europe. I think I told you already that since 48 my fortune has not been increasing, but by my fault undoubtedly, constantly decreasing. &#x2026; If it were not on account of the education of my children I think I would have gone already to some more remote part of the world.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; &#x2014; I here close this bulky deliverance; <pb id="pg-31-174" n="31:174"/>very much longer than I anticipated, and not containing almost anything,&#x2014;beyond a bit of my poor Time and yours! <closer><salute>Wishing you a pleasant route and happy return to us ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the time set, Yours always</salute></closer></p>

John Ferme, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. Aberlady is on the coast, ca. 6 mi. NW of Haddington.</note> When I come home it will be after the afternoon post hour.</p>
<p>I think the grey checked duffle very pretty, and that it is likely enough I should still abide by <hi rend="italic">it</hi> after looking at what others are to be had in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014; So I dont think it would be worth while to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r from here</hi> and back again&#x2014;to that end&#x2014;the journey would cost seven shillings, and it is a bothering, and tiresome journey, <hi rend="italic">for the distance;</hi> involving a change of trains, and a drive to and from the Station. If you couldnt have got any duffle <hi rend="italic">there</hi> but an ugly one, of course I shouldnt have thought of the seven shillings and the bother&#x2014;but it seems to me it would be just thrown away as it is&#x2014; I looked at duffles when I was <hi rend="italic">in</hi> Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> with view to a winter gown for myself, if I lived to need one; and decided that I could get better and cheaper in London. The Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Shops being all laid out now, to catch the eye and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> the idle strangers <pb id="pg-31-175" n="31:175"/>wandering about, and buying <hi rend="italic">something Scotch</hi> to take back as trophies&#x2014;of their idleness.</p>
<p>As to the cape I think unless you got a waterproof one, the same checked grey duffle would do very nicely. only it should be lined with flannel between the duffle and the linen&#x2014;to thicken it in appearance, as well as make it warmer.</p>
<p>I go from here next Monday&#x2014;and will stay at my Aunts till the Thursday. So if you have any commissions to give me still in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> they can be done there, in the course of nature.</p>
<p>I will answer Jane&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Carlyle Aitken.</note> kind letter tomorrow.</p>
<p>Poor Reichenbach will be glad to find his <hi rend="italic">character</hi> getting rehabilitated whatever else&#x2014;I will send the &#x201C;scrap&#x201D; by the first American post <closer><salute>Yours faithfully</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Very well, Dear;</salute> I am clearly of opinion you are right in regard to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; those drapery matters. Jean and I, with the aid of connexions she has in Glasgow if needful, will manage it all,&#x2014;we hope!&#x2014;in a way to meet approbation. I had already, for one prudent thing, <hi rend="italic">put off the Tailor</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> <hi rend="italic">till Monday,</hi> finding there was absolutely no time.</p>
<p>Yesterday after dinner (lightest of innocent dinners), I rode into Dumfries, 12 miles in a fine windy Autumn afternoon; spent 2 &#xBD; hours there; and came trotting home again, here few minutes after 10. One of the pleasantest rides I have had for many a year. The Country, after Dumfries and its suburbs, was perfectly solitary; the moon up amid driving clouds, wh<hi rend="italic">h pretended</hi> (to the unskilful) to threaten rain, but could bring none to speak of: the cornfields, moors, hills, kirks, and little cottages were strange, familiar &#x26; yet almost preternatural to me:&#x2014;one cannot in the world find many such <hi rend="italic">places</hi> for a ride.</p>
<p>Your visit to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> 3 nights there of waggons grinding, is not very pleasant to me; but I suppose you could not help it. How is that poor hurt you got on your breast? Too heavy a price for seabathing! Tell me that,&#x2014;tell me &#x201C;all things,&#x201D; when you have any leisure and humour to write.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">work</hi> was utterly knocked on the head by the Scotsbrig expedition; Could not till yesterday, shew the least sign of reviving. I also got two toe-injuries <pb id="pg-31-176" n="31:176"/>(owing to the mud, and my <hi rend="italic">gutta-perchas</hi> being left here)&#x2014;loss of skin to the extent of perhaps 1/20 inch; more important than half an acre of peeling on some places,&#x2014;in the <hi rend="italic">Flosh Moss,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Next to Gill; see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410724-TC-JWC-01"><sic>13:198&#x2013;99</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1841-07-24">24 July 1841</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410728-TC-JAC-01"><sic>201</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1841-07-28">28 July 1841</date></corr></ref>.</note> for example, which they are turning all into Cornground in that manner. It is very important that the Animal be <hi rend="italic">well let alone;</hi> the less he stirs abroad, and the less any one meddles with him, it is in general the better.</p>
<p>One of the absurdest watery blockheads I ever heard of, worse than America&#x2019;s worst, writes to me this morning from Stockholm (an English<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> of tremendous future genius, travelling for his health):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> I meant to send you the long rigmarole, but it is two big sheets, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> cost an additional stamp and only weary you in reading: so I burn it rather.</p>
<p>I have been in the sea again; rather confusing, so soon after breakfast. <closer><salute>With my blessing always.</salute></closer></p>

<p>Will My Lady deign perhaps to read that Kissingen Letter, from Neuberg, the faithful Hebrew, whose Letters are much preferable to himself? It gives a lively view of foreign doings by the idle of this world, in their pump rooms far away. When Tea is come in, when Sambo has retired from his destructive courses, and the deerhound and he are alike sleeping their dogsleep, only dreaming of battle,&#x2014;it may amuse the <hi rend="italic">Laird</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leddy</hi> in their Highland <foreign><hi rend="italic">Shealing</hi></foreign><hi rend="italic">.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A shepherd&#x2019;s temporary hut.</note></p>
<p>There has nothing new befallen me at all; I am still in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vacuis</hi></foreign> [emptiness] or in <foreign><hi rend="italic">Profundis</hi></foreign> [depths] as before, all things massed together round me in waste inarticulate condition, not apt for speaking of. I suppose that means the <hi rend="italic">Perfection of Idleness,</hi> which was in fact the thing I went in quest of hitherward. It is strange how one&#x2019;s whole day goes, in pitiful details, about the <hi rend="italic">body</hi> mainly; as if one had no soul, or merely a passive one, waiting on its <hi rend="italic">slave,</hi>&#x2014;a sadly rebellious anarchic state of matters. The Ocean, driven by Moon &#x26; Sun, is sending in high tides again into these remote creeks; at hours not convenient for me: I have been in the Sea today already (11 a.m.), and find the adventure confusing,&#x2014;questionable tho&#x2019; commended. However, I do surely, or should, go on to make progress in the matter of health: no regimen, or way of living and <hi rend="italic">non</hi>-employment, <hi rend="italic">could</hi> better correspond to the doctrines I <pb id="pg-31-177" n="31:177"/>have got in regard to that matter. There are still ten days of bathing: the future, beyond that, is still <hi rend="italic">blank</hi> to me. So let it rest for the present.&#x2014; Jane has come across to Haddington, and thence to Edinburgh (till Thursday next); after wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she returns to her old Fife Quarters,&#x2014;probably not for long. We had a week of furious heat; then &#x201C;60 hours of thunder,&#x201D; then about as many of rain, or drifting scotch-mist for variety; since which the Skies seem gradually gathering up their Skirts again, towards steady sunshine, and the weather is altogether recommendable after its sort. Yesterday afternoon I rode to Dumfries (where I have a Sister), twelve miles off, thro&#x2019; brisk cloudy winds (an excellent road, made by General <hi rend="italic">Wade,</hi> who came from Hampshire);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Wade (<date when="1673-00-00">1673</date>&#x2013;<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>; see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18470912-TC-JAC-01"><sic>22:64</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1847-09-12">12 Sept. 1847</date></corr></ref>), who oversaw a program of road and bridge building mainly in the Highlands during his period as commander-in-chief, North Britain, <date when="1724-00-00">1724</date>&#x2013;<date when="1740-00-00">40</date>.

Alas, Alas!&#x2014; And yet it is a grand destiny that of Mortals, too, something godlike in the very pain of it,&#x2014;had not the Infinite of Human Blockheadism (Devil as they call it) so conspired to crush it down wholly into vulgarity for a poor soul. That is really too bad, too unlucky; and sometimes one&#x2019;s rage blazes up to think of it,&#x2014;oftener only smoulders in a painful manner: &#x201C;No help for it, then; no help!

<p><salute>Oh dear me!</salute> I am back from Haddington; and a sad day yesterday was! The people at Haddington seem all to grow so good and kind as they grow old!

<p><salute>Thanks, dear little Goody,</salute> for your kind cheerful Letter of this morning, which has done me a real benefit in the way of spirits. Being altogether solitary here (tho&#x2019; indeed little more so than usual, and that little <hi rend="italic">mostly</hi> to my profit), I get a great result out of anything good put into me at starting for the day.&#x2014; I am very glad to figure you now in the Back room, waggons all hushed; you may do very well there till the visit has become of the length due. The trickling cistern is not bad. There is a similar sound at Scotsbrig; Middlebie Burn running into the Cauldron Linn,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460321-TC-JAC-01"><sic>20:147</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1846-03-21">21 March 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> at all hours and moments: the poor gurgle of sound, going on for thousands of years, mingles well enough with the strange tune one&#x2019;s play<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> in that room at any rate!&#x2014; &#x2014; I will be very good to the Canaries, provided they survive, and keep remote from my papers and me; they may depend on promotion according to their merits. I hope the <hi rend="italic">laird</hi> will not peck a hole in the <hi rend="italic">leddy&#x2019;s</hi> crown, however:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As did Chico (JWC&#x2019;s bird brought from Craigenputtoch); see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 90.</note> that also is one of the perils that environ living creatures.</p>
<p>I myself continue very well here, and ought surely to be making progress in health: never in my life had I more the kind of chance I am always grumbling to have. Perfect kindness, and nearly perfect solitude about me: the freshest of air, wholesomest of food; riding horse (&#x201C;carriage-horse&#x201D; even, after a sort, besides), and every essential convenience of life provided for me, with wonderful success, on the frugallest of terms. If you saw my little room, with the fire blazing in it, at night when I return from long roamings thro&#x2019; the twilight (6 to 8 miles the allowance), you would pronounce me right well off for the time being,&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">n</hi>better than I <hi rend="italic">n</hi>deserve!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS; &#x201C;as Coleridge said of his cold tea,&#x201D; coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491231-JWC-MR-01"><sic>24:319</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1849-12-31">31 Dec. 1849</date></corr></ref>.</note> I even get some work done; have made a real impression on the papers I bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with me; sometimes almost fancy I may get that ugly bit of the job (&#x201C;Book I, Part 2, &#x26; P<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 3&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Friedrich&#x2019;s Birth,&#x201D; bk. 1, pt. 2, and &#x201C;Father and Mother: the Hanoverian Connexion,&#x201D; bk. 1, pt. 3.</note>) fairly subdued here. Wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will be a nice thing indeed,&#x2014;done with two Books and a third I borrowed from John&#x2019;s Scotsbrig set.&#x2014; The feeblest part of my account is <hi rend="italic">sleep;</hi> no overplus of that yet, tho&#x2019; my bed is unexceptionable, and the quietness d<hi rend="italic">o;</hi> and my ridings and walkings and bathings in salt and fresh are so continual. However that is not <hi rend="italic">below</hi> the average either; &#x26; every other <pb id="pg-31-181" n="31:181"/>particular is far above it. The worst is, I have to experiment on all kinds of <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi> vegetables, Peas (<hi rend="italic">grey,</hi> of the field), Potatoes, Turnips; and <hi rend="italic">condemn</hi> every one of them, at the expense ultimately of one declared indigestion, and of several prior undeclared. However, that is now over I think; my last feat was the &#x201C;declared indigestion&#x201D; for the Turnips;&#x2014;and now I have been thro&#x2019; the list; and will stick to half a slice of toast and the excellent little Pudding I daily have. The weather has grown unpleasantly cold; wind east, and no steady sunshine till today: I had, on Monday, the ugliest bathe ever seen (eastwind a tempest, water shallow, muddy and only half salt); I in consequence omitted yesterday,&#x2014;and today the time will not suit. These are celebrated as &#x201C;big tides&#x201D;; but I privately find their bigness comes out of the <hi rend="italic">Lammas Floods,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Heavy Aug. rains; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250810-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:368</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-08-10">10 Aug. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> and their water is a sorry &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">joot</hi></foreign>&#x201D; of discoloured brackish fluid,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As in &#x201C;<foreign>joot</foreign>&#x201D; or &#x201C;jute&#x201C;: weak tea or sour ale.</note> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been mostly rain a few days ago! My riding, again, is excell<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> the wind favourable for it; d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> my walking. In fact, I (thrice import<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I), you perceive, am doing in all respects very well: the insects themselves seem now all dead of East-wind.</p>
<p>You were far wrong when you tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I was in the pet about your not going to Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Far from it, my <foreign>gleg</foreign> little woman; I was very well aware you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have gone ten times as far on any errand of mine; and well aware this was at last no-errand. But Jean&#x2019;s Boy<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James.</note> is in Glasgow, connected with &#x201C;Tweed-Warehouse&#x201D; Managers;&#x2014;has really sent superior specimens;&#x2014;and Jean was <hi rend="italic">here</hi> ready to do it all, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> pen to paper on my part. Which is now in process accordingly: <hi rend="italic">red-plaid</hi> dressing-gown, cape to be as near the <hi rend="italic">brown</hi> I now have as may be (and lined as you directed) &#x26;c &#x26;c, all very grand indeed; and will be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in a day or two. Alas, the Tailor,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> sawing a stick, has sawed his thumb in the interim; and begs to be still dispensed, some days, from beginning! Perhaps I shall have to wait for Scotsbrig and Garthwaite<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tom Garthwaite.</note> after all. Nothing pressing for a day or two.</p>
<p>Jean stayed her two days; went off on Monday ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> I driving her to the Station, thro&#x2019; a grim whirl of Eastwind, with her poor Boy very ill pleased.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Thomas, who had enjoyed his visit; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560728-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1856-07-28">28 July</date></ref>.</note> She was much hampered by the Child<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably her son, b. <date when="1855-09-00">Sept. 1855</date>; his name is unknown (wrongly named John in vol. 30).</note> all the time, and made out for herself or me only a stinted result. Your Letter came to her on the sunday morning here, and was very gratifying to the mind.</p>
<p>I perceive you say in that Letter, You wait for Mr C.&#x2019;s plans. Alas, my Dear, <pb id="pg-31-182" n="31:182"/>Mr C. has no plans that you do not long since know of; he means to be back in Chelsea at his work ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be well content to pass the whole time on these present terms, here and about here; has no theory of future movements or visits, except that one to the Inverness regions<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit the Ashburtons.</note>&#x2014;which he will avoid if he can! That is the whole truth; and you must shape your schemes accordingly, so far as I have any prophecy that can influence them.&#x2014; As to the Highland visit, I study never to think of it, for indeed I know not what to think or how. Lady A. writes absolutely nothing; no answer at all either to the Photographs or to Neubergs Letter wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I forwarded: &#x201C;All uncertain for some time&#x201D; was my word there. No <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> was ever given in London, nor was the thing spoken of above twice and very vaguely,&#x2014;but the sublime vehicle (of the glowing axle) and the visit <hi rend="italic">seemed</hi> always to hang together in her Ladyship&#x2019;s tho<hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and I had always to say, &#x201C;Doubtful, doubtful!&#x201D; So it stands at this moment.</p>
<p>Tell me, after considering, Have you any friendly house in the Inverness quarter you would <hi rend="italic">like</hi> at all to visit? That w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a decided inducement to get <hi rend="italic">me</hi> under way.&#x2014;(&#x2014;&#x201C;Post coming by!&#x201D; says Mary, cautiously gliding in: I must be brief)&#x2014; One other thing alone I had to mention on this score: When <hi rend="italic">harvest</hi> comes in farm houses, good visitors ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">rather not</hi>&#x201D; to be there. Harvest will be here (apparently) within a fortnight; at Scotsbrig not quite so soon.&#x2014; &#x2014; <closer><salute>Blessings evermore on my poor little Bairn!</salute></closer></p>

<p>For my part I think the bonnet very becoming, and &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">fit to appear in any society</hi>&#x201D; (the highest formula of praise in London; I have remarked&#x201D;) but prettier for me than the bonnet, and more gratifying to my thoughts, is the kind obligingness with which you put together the Ideal of it in your busy little mind, and the really <hi rend="italic">courageous</hi> persistence with which you brought your Ideal into form; thro all the difficulties that arose&#x2014;especially that weighing down <hi rend="italic">headach</hi>!

<dateline><place>The Gill</place>, Thursday, <date when="1856-08-21">21 Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 1856</date></dateline>
<p>This Letter has come this morning; and I send it off to put you in possession of the whole problem, for there is now no farther light to be expected in it. I cannot say I have much appetite for &#x201C;returning from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; in the way we came; even tho&#x2019; no axle took fire, it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be, with Poodle<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >F. G. Byng.</note> &#x26;c and for other reasons, a questionable method; <hi rend="italic">ties us up</hi> at any rate &#x26;c. But do you decide as <hi rend="italic">you</hi> find good. And if you can decide for me too; <hi rend="italic">and get me reasonably off altogether from that Highland business,</hi>&#x2014;the fact is certain, tho perhaps incredible, I shall be much obliged thereby! And so we will leave it today.</p>
<p>I have got worse on than usual with my &#x201C;work&#x201D;; nothing fairly down on the Paper at all: the whole matter is lying so <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbled</hi></foreign> as man never saw, at that particular point. I think the violent N.E. wind is not in my favour either. It is a perfect tempest howling round the chimnies; and Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> has an intolerable fire (intolerable with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> windows up) burning in this little Room. At 2 p.m. (in half an hour), I go out riding: that will be the best for me. No Tailor yet, nor any certain prophecy of him: Mary, at Annan market, will probably hear about him;&#x2014;at all events, will bring me up some excellent Brown Bread: &#x201C;genuine&#x201D; that, and if its natural price, cheaper than the white! I have quite ceased sea-bathing (tide past 4 today); plainly not adviseable,&#x2014;till a new Moon come, if I be here to see it&#x2014;</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Young</hi> Jamie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle.</note> from Glasgow is home at Scotsbrig on holiday;&#x2014;lasts, I think, till about Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> next. I have been in expectation (not very joyful, so busy and so abstruse am I) of a visit from him here; but he has not come: if his Father and he do not appear about Sunday, I must ride over some evening myself. Oh Goody, Oh poor Goody, Goody! How hard and cold is my talk in contrast to the tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> that lies in me,&#x2014;obstructed not by the East Wind alone! May God bless thee: that, any way, is one prayer that I can pronounce with entire completeness of utterance. But I think it now certain you will leave this world one day without ever knowing what my heart was towards you. For which I could lament much, poor wretch that I am, if it were of any service! Better try to get my work done perhaps? The Night <hi rend="italic">cometh</hi> wherein no man can work:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 9:4; see also <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560819-TC-CBU-01">TC to CBU, <date when="1856-08-19">19 Aug.</date></ref>.</note> that too is certain, most certain of all!&#x2014; Again, may the Maker of us both bless thee, my true loving woman, ever dear to me!&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Jean,&#x2014;</salute>There is little doubt the Parcel has come to Cummertrees as announced in Jim&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably young James Aitken.</note> Letter; it will be sent for in the evening,&#x2014;unless the Children perhaps bring it up of their own accord; warned by the Stationmaster in their school hours.</p>
<p>If you know precisely (as is likeliest) what the mountings buttons &#x26;c are,&#x2014;better get them at once. The Tailor undertakes to have thumb in order, and be <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on Monday morning. So that all will then go on, &#x201C;like a house on fire&#x201D; we may flatter ourselves.</p>
<p>The two Jamies of Scotsbrig are to be over here on Sunday; the alternative was my going thither, wh<hi rend="italic">h,</hi> or indeed going anywhither, I am glad to avoid,&#x2014;being deep in my Papers these two days past.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I have some thoughts of riding over to Dumfries for tea again: but do not look for me at all! Only you need not <hi rend="italic">send</hi> your mountings &#x26;c (but may have them ready) till you <hi rend="italic">have seen.</hi></p>
<p>The wretched Train kept you waiting half an hour that night: I was home, had smoked a pipe, and was at the Flosh Bar out on my walk of meditation, when you shot by, not guessing whose eye and thought were on you. I was very <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> (as I often am) in the wild gusty twilight.&#x2014;The N.E. tempest, <pb id="pg-31-188" n="31:188"/>really almost &#x201C;grand&#x201D; tho very troublesome, has now spent itself, and we shall do better.</p>

<p>Your letter of yesterday arriving at the same time with one from my Aunt Ann (away in Dumfriesshire) to Grace, just as we were going to breakfast, threw us into such a little flutter of excitement, that we all fell quite unconsciously into &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Sin</hi>&#x201D;!

<p>Your Program is altogether wise; and shall hold in every particular that depends on me. Right as to Cortachy &#x26;c; send emotional Cortachy altogether a-packing.

This is all I can say or guess:&#x2014;we <hi rend="italic">end</hi> in Annandale; can go by Liverpool if you like, and divide the journey. I hope you are much better, poor soul? I myself am perceptibly so: all owing to country regimen; never had such a chance at that in my life hardly as in these last 4 weeks.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-192" n="31:192"/>That was an excellent movement that shaking of hands with poor William Swan. That he is grown &#x201C;fat&#x201D; seems strange, like other things of the kind.

<salute>Dear Lady,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came four days ago; like a star, carrying light about it into dark places. It has been passing thro&#x2019; &#x201C;the Government Offices&#x201D; (so we may say) <pb id="pg-31-193" n="31:193"/>ever since;&#x2014;and I cannot expressly answer yet for a day or two, except in general that I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> I shall succeed to come for a couple of weeks!</p>
<p>Today my time is done altogether,&#x2014;wasted out in the vain struggle to <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> some Brandenburg rubbish, for much is wending towards a close in these parts:&#x2014;but this much I make haste to write. More in a short time.</p>
<p>Jane still continues with Fife for her headquarters; to which she was to return yesterday, after two weeks in Haddington, Edinburgh &#x26;c: she gives good account of herself; will not come into this southern country for some time yet. We are to meet, I rather think at <hi rend="italic">Linlathen</hi> (Dundee region) within a fortnight: she declines Cortachie, declines &#x26;c; is to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> in Annandale. So that I shall not have the Royal Vehicle again to go home in, but must leave Poodle and others in my place.</p>
<p>The route thro&#x2019; Loch Ness,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Caledonian Canal waterway included Loch Ness.</note> by Steamer from Glasgow towards you, does not seem to be clear. A Glasgow authority (perhaps not well informed?)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably his nephew, Jamie Carlyle.</note> threw nothing but darkness on the matter, when questioned. At any rate there is a known rail to Aberdeen; there is certainly a road, by land or water, to the Capital of the Highlands.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inverness.</note></p>
<p>I am doing still tolerably well in health, steadily profiting by my country regimen; but swim generally in a most <hi rend="italic">viscous</hi> and by no means luminous element of meditation in my solitude. As is the nature of the beast. Idle <hi rend="italic">gazing,</hi> for most part, into the dim element, instead of active <hi rend="italic">looking</hi> and discerning less or more.</p>
<p>The world is all yellow here from the knoll-tops far and wide. Two parties of mowers (with gatherers and binders,&#x2014;they do not use the hook) are visible to me here:&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">rain</hi> evident in Cumberland, but to us sunshine (temporary) and a brisk west-wind.</p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>I think I am likely to be with you about Saturday Ev<hi rend="italic">g;</hi> if I do not write farther, we will say Saturday.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> is pretty much done here; and it seems to be settled I am to go <pb id="pg-31-194" n="31:194"/>on the Highland journey,&#x2014;&#x201C;beyond Inverness for a fortnight or so&#x201C;,&#x2014;little as I feel disposed for locomotion. Ought to <hi rend="italic">start</hi> probably about this day week.</p>
<p>Jane, after a week of Haddington and a week of Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is back to Auchtertool for headquarters: we are to meet as I go northward: she will then still hold by Fife a little, but soon afterwards come down to these parts. She evidently intends to make Annandale (Scotsbrig in all likelihood) her, and my, last stage, on the way homeward. To <hi rend="italic">be</hi> home about the end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>
<p>I hope you got good accounts of Jamie&#x2019;s arrival in Glasgow again: he is a very definite-looking staid young man, and has done much for himself in that City.</p>
<p>I am thinking of Dumfries tomorrow; but it cannot be for more than two days: there are Tailors here doing some jobs for me, and I ought to be in at the ending of them.&#x2014;Saturday, as above said, if you hear nothing farther, I hope to be at Scotsbrig.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With kind regards to the Goodman and everybody,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your brief Note to Isabella was brought over to me on Sunday last, by the two <hi rend="italic">Jamies</hi> of Scotsbrig (junior home from Glasgow for a fortnight and now returned): that, with your Letter to myself from Vevay in answer to mine, is the sum of our Swiss news from you. We were getting rather anxious to hear;&#x2014;perhaps I ought to have written again; but I took you as meaning to write to Scotsbrig first. Let us hope you will get well to Paris in a couple of days hence; and find this waiting for you, which has no bad tidings to bring.</p>
<p>We are all well, to the common degree or better, in these parts. I have been here now into the fifth week; following out my Program; was away only 3 nights at Scotsbrig (bad weather, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> to me in consequence), and one afternoon over to Dumfries to tea and back again): the nearest approach to perfect silence, solitude, and unadulterated country regimen, I have almost ever made for so long. Mary has been kindness itself to me, as well as all the Household big and little; Margaret is one of the cleverest Lasses that ever waited on me: I have had a horse (<hi rend="italic">daily</hi>) Jamie of Scotsbrig&#x2019;s; item a Gig and horse (tho&#x2019; seldom using that): I bathed so long as weather and tide served:&#x2014;I have seldom been more comfortable in late years; and as to lodging &#x26;c was never better served in any house whatever. I brought some work with me too; <pb id="pg-31-195" n="31:195"/>wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has been a constant resource, and useful otherwise,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I am now pretty much at the end of my tether in that respect. We found your Key at Scotsbrig; I read the whole of <hi rend="italic">Suetonius</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560808-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-08-08">8 Aug.</date></ref></note> while lying there in the wet days (a very curious Book for one after 30 years of abeyance): your K&#xF6;hler (<hi rend="italic">Reichs Historie</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560813-TC-JN-01">TC to JN, <date when="1856-08-13">13 Aug.</date></ref></note> with two portabilities of my own are my whole Historical Library here: I also read in a volume of your <hi rend="italic">Plato</hi> at nights,&#x2014;but find him nearly insupportable, with definitioning and hair-splitting, tho&#x2019; there is a fine high vein too in him, of magnanimous perception, humour, godlike indignation veiled in silence, and other rare gifts.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC told William Knighton, <date when="1856-10-22">22 Oct.</date>, that he regarded Plato&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> as &#x201C;the best of his works by far. With what disdain he speaks of the great unwashed and their blatant democracies!&#x201D; (Knighton, <hi rend="italic">CWC</hi> 39:906).</note>&#x2014; I have ridden extensively on the Priestside sands, and by all manner of byroads and highways,&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">in by the Dowp,</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Closing quotation marks omitted. The Doup (a farm) bordered the N side of Gill, just within the parish of Ruthwell.</note> many a time. Nobody has spoken to me (tho&#x2019; some have put on their spectacles to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> at my beard and me), except two persons, half-<foreign><hi rend="italic">haverils</hi></foreign> both, and one of them deaf as a post,&#x2014;one Wightman a farmer, and one Johnstone a Smith:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both unidentified further.</note> whose elocutions did not harm me much! I seem to myself to have improved very perceptibly in health;&#x2014;find &#x201C;the Gill well&#x201D; (tho&#x2019; I do not use it much) superior even to Malvern as spring water; and rustic diet upon milk and meal (reinforced by eggs and chicken broth) a far more potent sanative than supernumerary &#x201C;sit-baths&#x201D; and other such puddlings.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-26/lt-18511010-TC-AC-01"><sic>26:200</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1851-10-10">10 Oct. 1851</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; But enough of all that.</p>
<p>Neuberg wrote to me, a few days after you did, from Kissingen,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">going</hi> towards <hi rend="italic">Geneva</hi> in about &#x201C;ten days time.&#x201D; I answered that you were in those parts, if he came soon enough; and gave him your &#x201C;Poste Restante, Vevay,&#x201D; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> too much encouraging him to use it. Apparently he has done nothing, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> perhaps was best. He is to be in London ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> &#x201C;the middle of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201C;: his details from Kissingen, about the foreign Notabilities King of Bavaria<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Maximilian II (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>), king of Bavaria from <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, aligned Bavaria with Austria, liberalized its society, and kept the company of artists and intellectuals.</note> &#x26;c were well worth reading. Dreadfully hot weather;&#x2014;as we had it here for above a week; tho&#x2019; after that, <hi rend="italic">not</hi>; &#x201C;60 hours of thunder,&#x201D; then 60 of rain &#x26;c having tempered that quite down, and left us with uncertain tho&#x2019; agreeable weather. Austin, like all the neighbourhood here, has begun mowing oats,&#x2014;Scotsbrig I suppose will before this week is out. A country all white, or whitening <hi rend="italic">fast</hi>; crops goodish, only the potatoes gone their usual road.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With potato blight; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560902-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; &#x2014; I <pb id="pg-31-196" n="31:196"/>have Tailors here, doing dressinggowns &#x26;c; and am now preparing to lift anchor soon. After long haggling, I seem to have settled at last upon a run to the Inverness region;&#x2014;cannot well be off, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">ease</hi> in the remote nooks here w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be welcomer to me.</p>
<p>All this while Jane has Auchtertool for headquarters (has been across to Haddington, and then to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> an 8-days each); will keep that as headquarters, I rather think, till about the time of my <hi rend="italic">return</hi> from the North. We are to meet, for 3 days at Linlathen, as I go North<hi rend="italic">d,</hi>&#x2014;end of next week probably? But that is yet all in program. The only fixed points seem <hi rend="italic">two</hi>: 1<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi> We are to be home in Chelsea ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the end of September; 2<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript">o</hi></hi> Jane means (I perceive) to take Annandale <hi rend="italic">last</hi>; and that we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> start homewards thence. It is not likely she will stay long at Scotsbrig, in the Shearing-time &#x26;c, and with me there; tho&#x2019; Isabella expresses the hospitablest intentions and anxieties. End of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> we ought to be in Chelsea; tomorrow I go to Dumfries for possibly 2 days: saturday over to Scotsbrig for perhaps 3 or 4;&#x2014;then wend Northward.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>I have been thinking many a time about coming to Dumfries; but weather, tailors, work, something or other comes always in the way.</p>
<p>My <hi rend="italic">Writing</hi> having now come to kind of pause, not quite disgraceful,&#x2014;I think of driving up to you tomorrow, unless the weather be wet again or very <pb id="pg-31-197" n="31:197"/>threatening. It is likely enough I may be over <hi rend="italic">before</hi> dining,&#x2014;but will be in time for your operations in that behalf (1 muttonchop with &#xBD; slice of toast,&#x2014;small breadpudding a &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D;): I will stay, if you have any bed for me, all night;&#x2014;or even, if I prosper, <hi rend="italic">another;</hi> cannot rightly more than one another;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> Tailors &#x26;c being here, and a good many things coming on now towards the point of <hi rend="italic">pressure,</hi>&#x2014;point of lifting anchor, alas!</p>
<p>Jane has been a week in Hadd<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> another in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> is now over to Auchtertool again;&#x2014;means, I can observe, to take Annandale <hi rend="italic">last,</hi>&#x2014;that will not be till the middle of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> at soonest. And I, meanwhile am bound to the <hi rend="italic">Dingwall</hi> region (where the Ashburton Lordships are) for a fortnight;&#x2014;cannot well be off, I perceive; and must go, however lazy.&#x2014; Jane and I are to meet at Linlathen (Mr Erskine&#x2019;s), it is hoped; and the next time in Annandale, going homewards.</p>
<p>A short Letter had come from John; the two Scotsbrig Jamies bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it over last Sunday: John to be in London ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the 1st of Sept<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> I have written to him, &#x201C;till called for,&#x201D; at Paris; poor wandering Jack, he always likes a Letter.</p>
<p>The Tailors, 2 or 2 &#xBD; are here since Monday; stitching away (I suppose), but under strict cover. All was <hi rend="italic">right,</hi>&#x2014;thanks to Jim and yourself, except some fractional elements, <hi rend="italic">thread</hi> &#x26;c, for wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Mary drove over to Annan yesterday in a gallantly prompt way.</p>
<p>I have never been in the Gig since that night you left us. I think of bringing it up tomorrow;&#x2014;perhaps you or some other charitable soul may get a drive (and give one) with me in some of your beautiful environs. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Globe Tavern, High St., Dumfries, once the haunt of Burns, which had space in front and at the side with a number of hitching posts for horses.</note> is the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> place to go to with both horse and gig, is it not?

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; apparently announcing the sending of a copy of <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> to TC.</note> alighted here yesterday, like a winged Mercury, bringing &#x201C;airs from Heaven&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 1.4.</note> (in a sense) along with his news. I understand very well your <pb id="pg-31-198" n="31:198"/>indisposition to write; we must conform to it, as to the Law of <hi rend="italic">Chronos</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >God of time.</note> (oldest of the gods); but I will murmur always, &#x201C;It is such a pity as of almost no other man!&#x201D;&#x2014; You are citizen of a &#x201C;Republic,&#x201D; and perhaps fancy yourself republican in an eminent degree: nevertheless I have remarked there is no man of whom I am so certain always to get something <hi rend="italic">Kingly</hi>&#x2014;and whenever your huge inarticulate America gets settled into <hi rend="italic">Kingdoms,</hi> of the New Model, fit for these Ages which are all upon the <hi rend="italic">Moult</hi> just now, and dreadfully like going to the Devil in the interim,&#x2014;then will America, and all nations thro&#x2019; her, owe the man Emerson a <hi rend="italic">debt,</hi> far greater than either they or he are in the least aware of at present! That, I consider (for myself) to be an ascertained fact. For which I myself at least am thankful and have long been.</p>
<p>It pleases me much to know that this English, so long twinkling in our expectations and always drawn back again, is at last visibly to appear:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> (Boston, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>), pbd. <date when="1856-08-06">6 Aug.</date> The English edn. was advertised by George Routledge &#x26; Co., <date when="1856-08-30">30 Aug.</date>, as &#x201C;Emerson&#x2019;s New Book on England &#x2026; &#x2018;Printed by arrangement with the Author&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> 1077).</note> I wish I could get hold of my Copy; there is no Book that would suit me better just now. But we must wait for four weeks till we get back to Chelsea,&#x2014;unless I can find some trusty hand to extract it from the rubbish that will have accumulated there, and forward it by post. You speak as if there were something dreadful said of my own sacred self in that Book:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote of their first meeting (20&#x2013;24), Wordsworth&#x2019;s uncomplimentary remarks about TC, including the fact that he thought TC &#x201C;somewhat insane&#x201D; (27), and their trip to Stonehenge, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, which Emerson said pleased him because &#x201C;it seemed a bringing together of extreme points, to visit the oldest religious monument in Britain, in company with her latest thinker, and one whose influence may be traced in every contemporary book&#x201D; (272).</note> Courage, my friend, it will be a most miraculous occurrence to meet with any said by you that does me <hi rend="italic">ill;</hi> whether the immediate task of it be sweet or bitter, I will take it with gratitude, you may depend,&#x2014;nay even with pleasure, what perhaps is still more incredible. But an old man, deluged for half a century with the brutally nonsensical vocables of his fellow-creatures (which he grows to regard soon as <hi rend="italic">rain,</hi> &#x201C;rain of frogs&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., rain that brings out such large numbers of frogs that they seem to have been rained down.</note> or the like, and lifts his umbrella ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with indifference,&#x2014;such an old gent<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> I assure you, is grateful for a word that he can recognise perennial sense in; as in this case is his sure hope. And so be the little Book thrice welcome; and let all England understand (as some choice portion of England will) that there has not been a man talking about us these very many years whose words are worth the least attention in comparison.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Post passing!&#x201D; I must end, in mid course; so much still untouched upon. <pb id="pg-31-199" n="31:199"/>Thanks for Sampson &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and let them go their course upon me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The proposal of Phillips, Sampson &#x26; Co., Boston publishers; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560916-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1856-09-16">16 Sept.</date></ref></note> If I can see Mrs Ward &#x201C;about the end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anna Barker Ward; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560524-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-05-24">25 [24<corr>?</corr>] May</date></ref>.

<p><salute>Dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I hope you are keeping well at Auchtertool: there has no Letter come today or yesterday, none from anybody; but I send you two that came the day before, and write a little word before getting on the road. I did not get to Dumfries yesterday according to program; the day was all tempestuous rain, from east and then from west steady batterings of pouring rain:&#x2014;I saved a ride out of it however, and two walks, one wet, the other dryish, in spite of the weather. Today is brisk and sunny; so clear that Criffel, 12 miles off, looks as if you might almost shout over, What o&#x2019;clock is it? All creatures shearing, here and far and wide, the country white to the scythe &#x201C;in all the ten parishes&#x201D; (if there are ten of them).<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the surrounding area, presumably; there were over 40 in Dumfriesshire.</note></p>
<p>To me it is sorrowfully apparent my days here ought to be drawing to an end. My feeling sometimes is almost that of a schoolboy going back from his vacation: I have had such a blink of perfect kindly repose here as has rarely been my lot in the last half century. Too good to last! I know not whether my progress in health is really considerable, but I suppose it is;&#x2014;except always sleeping but indifferently (rather less than at home) I have seemed to myself progressive every way: nothing has gone wrong with me,&#x2014;except indeed a <pb id="pg-31-200" n="31:200"/>new <hi rend="italic">toe,</hi> begun at Scotsbrig in the way you heard!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560815-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1856-08-15">15 Aug.</date></ref></note>&#x2014; &#x2014;My <foreign><hi rend="italic">terminus</hi></foreign> of writing was fairly reached the day before yesterday: this morning, awake in bed, I was seriously thinking whether I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not have struggled pretty much thro&#x2019; the other portion too, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> more Books, and how much usefuller as well as easier it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been to abide here and stick to that! But that will not do now either. I wrote to Lady A<hi rend="italic">n,</hi> vaguely predicting that I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come for a couple of weeks,&#x2014;&#x201C;most probably come,&#x201C;&#x2014;but c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not yet appoint time. So stands it at present:&#x2014;and I do not even know my road (till I get to Dumfries and look in some Railway Guide); I guess only that it must be by Aberdeen, by Linlathen; and that the <hi rend="italic">sooner</hi> we are upon it, the sooner we shall be off it. I want you therefore to <hi rend="italic">fix</hi> about Linlathen, <hi rend="italic">either</hi> yes or no. (truly which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like), but <foreign><hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;m prim&#xf9;m</hi></foreign> [quickly],&#x2014;and if it be &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; (between you and Erskinedom), I should say we ought to be <hi rend="italic">there</hi> by the end of next week if no sooner, and stay &#x201C;for 3 days [&#x201C;]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Omitted by TC.</note> (as I said) or what you like. I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> come to Auchtertool and pick you up. Kirkcaldy too, if that were in good humour, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> look in upon for a night or so, as I came back? But all this can be <hi rend="italic">any way.</hi>&#x2014; The clothes have prospered wonderfully: dressing<hi rend="italic">n</hi> very <foreign>bra&#x2019;</foreign> indeed, cape likewise good tho&#x2019; only black grey.&#x2014;I am due at Scotsbrig tomorrow (by <hi rend="italic">next</hi> day at latest); sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be better here <hi rend="italic">sitting,</hi> for my own part of it. Direct <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> still till you hear.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Here is a poor heather blossom I plucked for you this morning <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>There! I have put my foot in it!&#x2014;</salute>I was well to a wonder; hadn&#x2019;t had one hour of my <hi rend="italic">sickness,</hi> nor one wholly sleepless night since I left Chelsea! and the idea must needs take me, that Sunday I was in Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> to have out my humour to hear D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Guthrie!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Thomas Guthrie.</note> and so, for two hours I was slowly simmered as in one of Soyer&#x2019;s &#x2018;patent Stewpans&#x2019;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexis Beno&#xee;t Soyer; JWC is probably referring to his magic stove, brought out in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, with which food could be cooked at the table.</note> (the crush to hear him being quite as great in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> as in London).

Indeed last night I <hi rend="italic">never once</hi> closed my eyes.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more illtimed than this illness&#x2014;two dinner Parties having gone off here in the meantime to my honour and glory! And &#x201C;gone off without effect&#x201D; so far as I was concerned&#x2014;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Peter Swan (the other brother) was at the yesterday dinner&#x2014;Walter thinking, after my speech to the elder Swan,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Patrick Don Swan was sometimes called Peter; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380826-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:154</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-08-26">26 Aug. 1838</date></corr></ref>.

<p><salute>Dear Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>I send <hi rend="italic">Emerson</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced; acknowledged in <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560828-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1856-08-28">28 Aug.</date></ref></note> today, having got stamps: that is at least an excuse for scribbling again without having almost anything to say. One little thing there was;&#x2014;about Linlathen;&#x2014;but I seem nearly to have lost hold of it again in this evercircling element!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-203" n="31:203"/>It was, to say that if Linlathen at <hi rend="italic">the end</hi> will please you better, you can with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> scruple make it that way, and give up any negociations you may have entered on for doing the visit now. Also to urge (which I know is superfluous) the propriety of speed in settling some way, and letting me know: for I find I have properly speaking nothing to do till I know how it is settled! That was not a cunning arrangement on my part.</p>
<p>I learn here contrary to what Jamie Carlyle (of Glasgow) assured me that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a numerous set of steamer conveyances to Inverness such as might perhaps suit me better for a route: but I cannot ascertain or guess here (till the new &#x201C;Murray Time-tables,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Murray&#x2019;s Time Tables and General Advertiser of the Railways, Steamboats, Coaches, &#x26;c. throughout Scotland,</hi> pbd. by Thomas Murray &#x26; Son, 31 Buchanan St., Glasgow.</note> or some such miserable Document, &#x201C;for September&#x201D; arrive), what the fares are, the hours, or anything about them. So that perhaps Linlathen (per <hi rend="italic">se,</hi> that is, without any visit, any meeting &#x26;c) <hi rend="italic">may</hi> perhaps be the eligible route still, and perhaps <hi rend="italic">not:</hi>&#x2014;at any rate it shall be the eligible with the adjuncts thrown in,&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like to furnish them. I shall hear at The Gill soon after my return,&#x2014;on Monday as I at present calculate. I had better have staid there (as is usually my experience),&#x2014;I had very much better stay there just now, and wait the conclusion that way, as I often think,&#x2014;in a sufficiently haggard manner!</p>
<p>At present I am quite cut up with the loss (<hi rend="italic">half</hi> loss, to be exact) of my last night&#x2019;s sleep, in which article I have never shone since these Annandale affairs began. But I go to Scotsbrig this evening,&#x2014;a gig and good horse;&#x2014;and shall probably get what I am in want of in the sleep way there. Which will make a great change in one&#x2019;s ideas about everything.</p>
<p>Jean is as kind as can be, poor soul; and the loss of sleep was an <hi rend="italic">accident,</hi> not due to her arrangements, which were <hi rend="italic">good.</hi> But such are one&#x2019;s chances while roving in foreign parts. I have not seen Aird, seen anybody: went walking, thro&#x2019; the gray still Autumn, over a high tract called &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Craigs</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A strip of high land SE of Dumfries.</note>
; and am to drive off in about an hour. <closer><salute>God bless thee Dearest.</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jean expressly bids me find room for her respects.&#x2014; This is quite a queer place, with baths, playing fountains, thermometers, raingauges; James developing himself into a <hi rend="italic">virtuoso</hi> curiously more and more. Adamson was shut<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His bank.</note> when I called.&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p>As I wrote a long letter yesterday, and am still full of coughing and sneezing, and <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> little; this is merely a line to clear your programme from any <foreign><hi rend="italic">tag-ragery</hi></foreign> of uncertainties, depending on <hi rend="italic">me.</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >According to A. Carlyle, Lady Ashburton wrote to JWC: &#x201C;There is a comfortable, quiet room for you here, if you like to come any time before the end of September. The Ness and Canal to Inverness, which is no trouble; and from Inverness here, the Skye Mail,&#x2014;thirty miles of road; days of Mail passing by our door, Monday, Wednesday and Friday&#x201D; ([ca. <date when="1856-08-00">late Aug.</date>]; <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi> 2:118).</note></p>
<p>I have had no letter from the Erskines&#x2014; Indeed M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sterling<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Stirling.</note> did not say <hi rend="italic">she would write</hi>&#x2014;only, she inquired about my address so particularly, that I supposed it was in the view of writing. But for the rest she seems to understand <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had already written to her Brother promising him a visit&#x2014;and she herself <hi rend="italic">said</hi> enough in the way of invitation, to both of us.</p>
<p>If the weather had continued warm and if I hadn&#x2019;t gone and caught cold; I should have had no objection to going to Linlathen next week; tho&#x2019; at the same time&#x2014;I must say&#x2014;&#x201C;being an only child I never <hi rend="small-caps">wished</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; cf. <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:209</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1855-10-31">31 Oct. 1855</date></corr></ref>; a variant of &#x201C;poor ex-spoilt Child&#x201D; (see <ref target="volume-30/ed-30-jane-welsh-carlyle-journal"><sic>30:243</sic><corr>JWC&#x2019;s Journal, <date when="1856-04-15">15 April 1856</date></corr></ref>).</note> to go to Linlathen!&#x2014;there being places I should like better to stay at, all the weeks I remain in Scotland.

I thought if you did not, <hi rend="italic">when the time came,</hi> accept Lady A&#x2019;s offer to be taken home with them&#x2014;you might perhaps prefer going to London by Sea&#x2014;and in that case you might have found it most convenient to take Linlathen last of all, and sail from Dundee Pray don&#x2019;t &#x201C;feel it your duty&#x201D; in the slightest degree, to escort <hi rend="italic">me</hi> back to London&#x2014;if you can get there with more ease to yourself without me&#x2014;I am a very good traveller, you know&#x2014;and shall have my <hi rend="italic">canaries</hi> to keep up my spirits&#x2014;</p>
<p>If I get well enough for it I shall go to Miss Jessie<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Donaldson.</note> for 2 or at most 3 days this incoming week&#x2014;and next week set out on my other visits&#x2014;a day or two at my Aunts again in passing thro Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x2014;(<hi rend="italic">that</hi> I engaged for&#x2014;chiefly on Betty&#x2019;s account&#x2014;) then to Jeanie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Betty Braid and Jeannie Chrystal.</note> at Glasgow&#x2014;then to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell at Thornhill then <pb id="pg-31-205" n="31:205"/>to Scotsbrig&#x2014;And then south&#x2014;either with you, or alone as is found most suitable&#x2014;&#x201C;to take up the threads of&#x201C;&#x2014;what?&#x2014;Nero!&#x2014;Poor Dear <hi rend="italic">he</hi> at least will be glad!

<salute>My dear Major Davidson</salute>
<p>I hadn&#x2019;t forgotten my promise, to tell you when I came to Scotland&#x2014;tho it was binding myself to believe, for more than a year, in your caring&#x2014;in any one&#x2019;s caring&#x2014;whether I were in Scotland or at &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">The Back of Beyond</hi>&#x2019;! A grave engagement for one with so very limited an outfit of self-confidence as myself!</p>
<p>But on my first coming I didn&#x2019;t know your actual address&#x2014;nor could dear Betty tell it me; tho&#x2019; she spoke about you till your ear might have tingled!&#x2014;(the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> one.)&#x2014;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning that the talk was favorable.</note></p>
<p>So I waited till I should see your sister at Haddington whither I was bound&#x2014;Tho I was there ten days, being kissed and cried over by my dear old Ladies at Sunny Bank, and <hi rend="italic">crying</hi> myself pretty continuously out of sheer gratitude to every body for being so good to me, I did not see M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cook. I had no sooner arrived than M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Cook proceeded to have a Baby;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The birth of Helen Cook&#x2019;s da. Louisa Frances, <date when="1856-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, was announced in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman,</hi> <date when="1856-08-16">16 Aug.</date> She had four other das.: Martha Mary Chisholm, b. <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>, Diana Shank, b. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>, Helen, b. <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, and Harriet Anne Scott, b. <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>.</note> and that fact was communicated to me along with another similar fact viz: your own new baby.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Also a da., b. <date when="1856-08-08">8 Aug.</date>, announced in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman,</hi> <date when="1856-08-16">16 Aug.</date></note> And in such a domestic crisis, it was clearly expedient not to bother you with the idea of my presence in your neighbourhood since you might feel <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> obligation to invite me to your house, sooner than might be agreeable to your wife to receive any stranger&#x2014;</p>
<p>The Bishop, who has indeed being playing the part of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Pigs</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;in running thro<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Popular saying adopted as coterie speech.</note> my arrangements ever since I came, has run thro this <hi rend="italic">delicate silence</hi> also!&#x2014;it would seem. And so <hi rend="italic">he</hi> must bear the blame, if having done what flesh and blood <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do, towards not troubling you, I cannot positively do <hi rend="italic">more,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> to go and see you when you still ask me! I have not much time left. We return to London the end of the present month, and I have <hi rend="small-caps">six</hi> <pb id="pg-31-206" n="31:206"/>visits to pay still, among relations and&#x2014;old friends, chiefly in Dumfriesshire. Whence I proceed to London via <hi rend="italic">Carlisle</hi> without returning to Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> But when I leave this place, the middle or end of next week, I could go to you for two, or three days&#x2014;if your wife were really well enough and good natured enough to have me. Write with perfect frankness&#x2014;would that suit?</p>
<p>Mr Carlyle has been with his own family in Annandale all this while and is now just starting off on a visit to some London friends near Dingwall perhaps he will <hi rend="italic">sail</hi> to London&#x2014;at all events he wont rejoin me till we are just starting for home.</p>
<p>But I am not unaccompanied&#x2014;I have with me&#x2014;bound for Chelsea, two&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">canaries</hi>! bred at <hi rend="italic">Haddington,</hi> and adopted for <hi rend="italic">its</hi> old dear sake!&#x2014;And you will have to extend your hospitality to these blessed birds, to the extent of furnishing them with a nail to hang on out of the reach of any possible cat or dog!</p>

<p>I am not acquainted, as you may well suppose, with your arrangements for the <hi rend="italic">North British Review:</hi> but I think you will permit me to put before you, for such consideration as you may find it deserve, the following little fact,&#x2014;which cannot in any case do harm.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-207" n="31:207"/>Mr A. Gilchrist, a London friend of mine,&#x2014;probably not half my age, a Barrister by title, an ardent diligent Student and Writer and reader by employment; a man in fact of much intelligence, loyalty and ingenuity (first known to me by his <hi rend="italic">Life of the Painter Etty</hi> in which I found unusual merits<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of William Etty, R.A.,</hi> 2 vols.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I am happy to hear you are well, and busy with all kinds of labour,&#x2014;weighty labour for me and my affairs the most conspicuous kind!</p>
<p>That is certainly a very good idea, that of <hi rend="italic">dating</hi> every page of the F. R<hi rend="italic">n:</hi> do it by all means if you like,&#x2014;only I fear you will find it a trouble beyond what you are aware.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-208" n="31:208"/>I also am to be home &#x201C;at the end of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; (probably <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the month by a day or two days); it will therefore be clear wisdom to do as you have suggested,&#x2014;have a little meeting,&#x2014;before going to Press. I forget whether there is in my own head anything I tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to alter&#x2014;(Yes; please put a <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> where you find one &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Needham,</hi>&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;Nesham&#x201D;; Christopher John Williams Nesham (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), admiral; see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18540115-TC-JN-01"><sic>29:19</sic><corr>TC to JN, <date when="1854-01-15">15 Jan. 1854</date></corr></ref>, and <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 3:21.</note> an English <hi rend="italic">life-preserving</hi> man, mentioned, who gets a &#x201C;civic sword&#x201D; &#x26;c)&#x2014;I will endeavour to have that also ready when we meet. And so let it remain settled for the last days of Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> or first d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of October, if we and our purposes have no misluck in the interim</p>
<p>I have just written you a little Note for Fraser<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Campbell Fraser.</note> Editor of the <hi rend="italic">N. Brit</hi>h I have very little or rather no real acquaintance with him; but believe he is a very wholesome kind of man. The most questionable feature is the <hi rend="italic">length</hi> of your Article:&#x2014;try to make it into two? In some way shorten it?</p>
<p>That Note will introduce one of your own, with or with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> itself at that first interview: if Fraser &#x26; you cannot suit,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> is in the rear (or in fact is not the West<hi rend="italic">r</hi> gone into some other persons hands?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Still owned and edited by John Chapman, it had been in financial trouble; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550706-TC-JAC-01"><sic>30:5</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1855-07-06">6 July 1855</date></corr></ref>.</note>)&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Mag</hi>ne &#x26;c &#x26;c are in the rear. But they are all a sorry set of vehicles; and an earnest young soul has its own sorrows in learning the ways of them.</p>
<p>I have lain here as quiet as a mouse ever since the end of July; and seem to have made really notable improvement in health,&#x2014;if it will only hold out. I have now (most reluctantly) to lift anchor (just yoho-ing in these hours) and steer for <hi rend="italic">Inverness</hi> &#x26; beyond.

<p>There has been much fussing and hithering and thithering here (my own want of forethought chiefly), and then a kind of accident which occasions new uncertainty about my mode of reaching the Kinloch.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kinlochluichart, Dingwall.</note> Much ado about a small matter!&#x2014; The welcomer is your Letter to me, wise and kind, which lay waiting me last night on my return from a ride to Scotsbrig &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Poor Jane, in the ardour of her mind, went to hear a popular Dr Guthrie, with some Aunts of hers, the Sunday before last at Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> heard the popular Dr Guthrie, most &#x201C;artfully simple,&#x201D; thrice &#x201C;opulent in imagery&#x201D; (mirroring next to nothing of real), in fine supereminently excellent vender of melodious <pb id="pg-31-209" n="31:209"/>wind; but heard him as if in a stewpan; got east-wind coming home; got &#x26;c, poor soul,&#x2014;so that she lies for a week past, ill of a bad cold, with her Fife Cousins; and the route by Linlathen, at least so far as her visit there is concerned, goes out of the game again. This too I heard for the first time last night.&#x2014; On the other hand I somewhat shudder at the 3 nights (likely to be sleepless) which the Sea-journey presupposes: 1 at Glasgow, 1 at Bannavie,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Banavie, 3 &#xBD; mi. NNE of Fort William, at the W end of the Caledonian Canal, where a series of eight locks (&#x201C;Neptune&#x2019;s Staircase&#x201D;) began.</note> 1 <hi rend="italic">at Inverness</hi> (as I cannot but think,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; you seem to deny, and recommend me to Mrs Spicer:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proprietor of the Caledonian Hotel, 31 Church St., Inverness.</note> what is that?)&#x2014;however, I shall probably resolve on the sea method after all. A man ought not to <hi rend="italic">refuse</hi> a sight of the Picturesque when it comes in his way;&#x2014;it is perhaps the duty of a man to lie one night of his life, awake if not otherwise, at the foot of Ben Nevis<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Approx. 4 mi. SE of Fort William; the highest mountain in the British Isles, 4,406 ft. (1,343 m.).</note> when possibility offers?&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>It is thus however that I grope about, and waver in uncertainty over this tremendous expedition. Wednesday last I had fairly done with the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> cut out for me here, and could have started had the program been complete: program, as I then hypothetically completed it, tumbles all to staves again;&#x2014;and on Saturday last I could not get even a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Murrays Time-Tables</hi>&#x201D; at Dumfries; and only expect that invaluable work tomorrow or the day after!</p>
<p>One thing only I can announce as fixed That I do set out somehow or other on Friday next; and by Linlathen or by the Kyles of Bute,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The long strait curving round the N end of the Isle of Bute, Argyll, through which a boat from Glasgow would go.</note> and by some aquatic or terrestrial route (a&#xEB;rial and subterranean are out of the Question), do hope to reach you in the beginning of next week. What particular day, I will try to announce from some point of the journey,&#x2014;or at least after roasting the Murray Time-Tables in the crucible of my poor intellect, if haply they will yield anything.&#x2014; If I arrive in a state fit for the hospital, well you must put me into some fit ward, and feed me on spoon-meat for a day or two.&#x2014; Beauly<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town at W end of Beauly Firth, 10 mi. W of Inverness.</note> I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> much covet; but must not pretend <hi rend="italic">with</hi>t the strict warning. <closer><salute>Thanks anyhow. Thanks and again thanks. And good be with you Lady dear.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I bid you welcome home again: I found your Paris Note here last night, as I returned from a 3-days round, of Dumfries and Scotsbrig,&#x2014;in the dusk of the grey still evening. Pity you did not find that Paris letter of mine on your calling at <hi rend="italic">Poste Restante.</hi> However, I rather confidently hope you <hi rend="italic">would</hi> find it on Friday morning before quitting Paris: I think it was due then or on Thursday night. So far I can bethink me, it went off hence on the Wednesday afternoon: I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have written it 48 <supplied>[hours]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> sooner and no more; but I waited till the hurry of my job sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> end, not counting there was haste in the matter to that length. Thither at any rate a Letter went; and there or in your possess<hi rend="italic">n</hi> it must now be.</p>
<p>All is well as before, with me and among our connexions here. Harvest weather seems to have come steady at last; and all hands are busy,&#x2014;Scotsbrig since Saturday afternoon, Austin since a week earlier,&#x2014;the whole country white under the bright still &#x201C;mackerel-sky&#x201D; (totally windless and Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi>-like today, after much blowing, thundering and tossing); a <hi rend="italic">goodish</hi> crop I everywhere hear; only the potatoes gone their usual road, or worse,&#x2014;&#x201C;ruin like that of <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The potato blight began in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450923-TC-JWC-01"><sic>19:208</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1845-09-23">23 Sept. 1845</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450930-TC-AC-01"><sic>231</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1845-09-30">30 Sept. 1845</date></corr></ref>.</note> in some cases; comparatively little mischief done in others, as here at the Gill. Jamie&#x2019;s John was lashing and mowing (laid oats) wh<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Jamie and I visited him yesterday afternoon; Isabella is stronger than usual: her Letter at any rate you would find on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g,</hi> I think.</p>
<p>My own poor Jane was very prosperous, till she caught a bad cold ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a week ago, &#x201C;hearing Dr Guthrie in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D;; with wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> she has lain prisoner ever since at Auchtertool, cannot attend me to Linlathen, cannot have the least share in my adventures Northwards. So that I am thrown again upon my vague calculations as to all that (and can calculate nothing, not having yet got even a &#x201C;Murray&#x2019;s Time-tables,&#x201D; Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Copy not <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to Dumfries on Sat<hi rend="italic">y,</hi> August one quite done): at present I rather incline for Glasgow, Oban and the Lakes by <hi rend="italic">Steam;</hi> only the &#x201C;3 nights at inns&#x201D; make me shudder. One way or other I must settle it in 2 days. <hi rend="italic">Till</hi> Friday morning (after Post-time) I am here; on Friday some hour or other I must be off. Right sorry to go, and with very small hope of profiting by the change. However, it must be.</p>
<p>Why should you be in a bother about lodgings in London for a day or two, while N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5 is empty. Shew Anne that bit of Paper,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The enclosed note; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560902-TC-A-01">TC to A, <date when="1856-09-02">2 Sept.</date></ref></note> if you like, and take free <pb id="pg-31-211" n="31:211"/>possess<hi rend="italic">n</hi> till your own place is <hi rend="italic">deliberately</hi> &#x201C;quite ready.&#x201D; Jane, I think, will not be at Scotsbrig for about a fortnight; and then <hi rend="italic">for,</hi> say a week or 10 days.</p>

<salute>Dear Isabella,</salute>
<p>I am for Dumfries today, if it continue dry; to leave the Gig, and finish my affairs there. I am for being <hi rend="italic">off</hi> (so far as can now be computed) on Friday; to start for <hi rend="italic">Glasgow,</hi> by <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Rail, and go by the Steamers and Lakes after all. My poor Jane has caught a cold, which quite knocks out Linlathen at present: I do not think I can evenher well at Auchtertool, the House being so crowded. So I incline for the Sea way.</p>
<p>If the day is fair tomorrow (Thursday), and I am not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> busy, I design to ride over and see you again: I must <hi rend="italic">come back</hi> to my bed that night, so never mind till youme. If it is going to hurry or flurry me, of course I need not come at all just now. Jamie will have to send for the horse if he want it before Sunday <hi rend="italic">on</hi> Sunday (or Saturday night) Austin has somebody he can send up with it. Saddle and Bridle (which I would not now lose for something) I commit to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> keeping.</p>
<p>Jane evidently means for Annandale,&#x2014;I should say, within a fortnight or <pb id="pg-31-214" n="31:214"/>so. She knows well you expect her. Her address, if at any time you wanted to write anything, is</p>
<p><title>Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Walter Welsh</title></p>
<p><title>Auchtertool, Fife.</title></p>
<p><title>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</title></p>
<p>Jamie is to be good to that red mare for my sake. An excellent, wise, good-tempered beast. I decidedly reckon her <hi rend="italic">unsafe to ride,</hi> however (tell him this too[)], <hi rend="italic">till her corns mend.</hi> That is positive, and ought to be attended to. Perhaps the best way of treating <hi rend="italic">her</hi> corns w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be the way I have treated mine: to tear off <hi rend="italic">her shoes</hi> altogether, and let her run for six months?</p>
<p>The Doctor, as you perceive, may be considered at Brompton since Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g.</hi> I have written a second time; tho&#x2019; I think he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get the Paris letter after all. <closer><salute>Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<p>Linlathen after all turns out to be the road; and I leave <hi rend="italic">Ecclefechan</hi> on Saturday; am at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 11&#xBD; a.m. that day;&#x2014;and within hail of Auchtertool and you! Of course I cannot and will not pass with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a desperate plunge to get sight of you;&#x2014;if Walter&#x2019;s House were emptier, the plan w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be to stay there till <hi rend="italic">Monday;</hi> thence to Erskine&#x2019;s till <hi rend="italic">Tuesday morning</hi> (10 or 11) when a long day of railwaying and coaching brings me to Inverness &#x26; a Coach next morning to my journey&#x2019;s end.&#x2014;But that, I am well aware, will not do in the present state of the Manse.</p>
<p>I propose therefore to stop at Burntisland (<hi rend="italic">no,</hi> let us say <hi rend="italic">Kirkcaldy,</hi> as the suitablest,&#x2014;best road I think from Auchtertool);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Both on the N side of the Forth, Burntisland is 4 mi.

Or if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are well enough to come down to Kirkcaldy (Saturday 2 p.m.), it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> save a journey and be best of all.&#x2014; &#x2014; Do what utmost you can! That is the best I can devise.</p>
<p>I have written to Erskine in that sense: he is to have a Note for me &#x201C;Post Office Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201D; (for Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 11&#xBD; a.m.): if it is <hi rend="italic">possible,</hi> do you the like, best Goody, and it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a great encouragement to me.</p>

<p>I had formed again the nicest program; and was proceeding in beautiful calm towards fulfilment, by departure hence tomorrow noon; when, this morning the <hi rend="italic">Murray&#x2019;s Time-Tables</hi> (which had been <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>sent by way of double-speed)&#x2014;arrived. The <hi rend="italic">M&#x2019;s Time-Tables</hi> speedily taught me that the Steamer from Glasgow was not, as I had fondly thought, on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> morning, but on <hi rend="italic">Friday,</hi>&#x2014;tomorrow 7 a.m., and no mistake!</p>
<p>Whereupon ensued such a hurlyburly as cannot indeed have equalled the <hi rend="italic">Coup d&#x2019;Etat</hi> of December 2,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Napoleon&#x2019;s coup, <date when="1851-12-02">2 Dec. 1851</date>, when he proclaimed himself Emperor Napoleon III.</note> but must have approached it in intensity at some points! You, I consider, never witnessed anything like it,&#x2014;while the secret of fate was getting itself worked out of that thrice-abstruse Document, intelligible only to those skilled in Time and Tables!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The result of all is, I expect to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> into the Aberdeen Railway at Linlathan (Broughty Ferry station)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town on N side of Firth of Tay, 3&#xBD; mi. E of Dundee, the nearest station to Linlathen.</note> about 11 a.m. on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> next; to be tumbled along incessantly thenceforward by such conveyance as there is, rail or coach; and so to arrive towards midnight of the said Tuesday at the Caledonian Mrs Spicer&#x2019;s Inverness,&#x2014;there to lie horizontal for some hours, sleeping or not; and in fine to be shaken out along with the mailbag on your kitchen floor next day (Wednesday), and so to <hi rend="italic">end.</hi> That is the substance of the matter.</p>
<p>I had come to understand the <hi rend="italic">Beauly</hi> project; but that is all now off. Thanks, thanks.&#x2014;Leave me to the powers of gravitation: I expect to be found on your floor on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-31-216" n="31:216"/>I have to start therefore by the Caledonian Line,&#x2014;from Scotsbrig, that is.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC joined the Caledonian main line, Carlisle to Glasgow and Edinburgh (dividing at Carstairs), at Kirtlebridge stn., 2 mi.

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>My Glasgow plans are all suddenly knocked on the head by an inspection of <hi rend="italic">Murray</hi> this morning, and the grand fact <hi rend="italic">he</hi> announces (confirmed by a Note I had from Jack,&#x2014;indeed evident on the sheet your <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> sent me, but never noticed before), that there is no Glasgow-Inverness Steamer on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> (said Steamer sailing on the <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>), and there will be none till Monday following! Conceive the sudden upsetting of all my projects; the tumbling of me, in fact, with all my present businesses, heels over head in one moment! I have often had a more agreeable day than this has been to me. However, I am now again settled; off to Scotsbrig tomorrow morning; thence round by Linlathen (Dundee), by Kirkcaldy Auchtertool &#x26;c,&#x2014;and on Tuesday off by the Aberdeen rail (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> with Coaches &#x26;c takes one to Inverness at a single big stretch, 12 hours or so), and thus on the Wednesday (I hope I have not mistaken the day of the <hi rend="italic">Coach</hi> next!) &#x201C;the Skye Mail&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The mail coach going to the Isle of Skye from Dingwall, 14 mi. NW of Inverness, along the N shore of Loch Luichart.</note> tumbles me out at the place I was bound to. &#x201C;Probably just as well&#x201C;: who knows?</p>
<p>I enclose a Cover wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> will carry me a Note of yours whenever you have leisure to write one. Do not quite neglect. I am greatly obliged by all your punctual helpfulness to me; yours and James&#x2019;s, whom thank for me as you but can: I have put by the old <hi rend="italic">Tobacco-Box</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their mother&#x2019;s.</note> for you, it is all wrapped up in Mary&#x2019;s hands&#x2014; Keep it carefully I request you: there is something sternly sad in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> poor old memorial of one we shall see no more with these eyes.&#x2014; But no more of that.</p>
<p>A dismal suspicion crossed me yesternight on Mousewald Heights,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Lochar Moss.</note> that I had cheated James of his 5 / for the stamps! I did faithfully put down the 5 /,&#x2014;but did I not take it up again, and pocket it among James&#x2019;s return change for <pb id="pg-31-217" n="31:217"/>the Gig affairs? I hope better things, tho&#x2019; I thus speak. Nor does the state of my purse point clear to <hi rend="italic">guilt.</hi> But I must have James&#x2019;s assurance</p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>I have waited till I could fix a time for my long intended visit. But my programme having to adapt itself in some measure to my Husbands; it has been longer than I expected that I have been, myself, kept in uncertainty.</p>
<p>Now it is all right however! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is off to the Highlands without my needing to accompany him part of the way as was at first proposed&#x2014;and I may dispose of my two or three remaining weeks in Scotland according to my &#x201C;own sweet will&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>A great cold which I caught in an overheated Church&#x2014;just when I was thinking how wonderfully well I had been ever since my departure from London&#x2014;has curtailed my travels and curtailed my wishes too&#x2014;Yesterday I wrote execuses<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> to three different places where I had promised myself, and have settled to do no more visiting on my account, except the two visits I <hi rend="italic">heartily</hi> hold to&#x2014;to you and to my Brother in-law at Scotsbrig, the one of all my Husbands family that I like best I intend going to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> next Monday or Tuesday, staying there all night to take leave of my Aunts at Morningside&#x2014;then on to Scotsbrig the following day. From there I can easily get to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> by railway&#x2014;and if you are still able to have me&#x2014;I hope to be at Thornhill about Monday or Tuesday week&#x2014;If there be any hindrance arisen on your side send a line for me to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> James Carlyle&#x2019;s / Scotsbrig / Ecclefechan / about the end of next week If I hear nothing to the contrary I will write from there, fixing the particular day when, God willing, I shall give you a good kiss&#x2014;I try not to think of <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> but y<hi rend="italic">our own house</hi> where all are still alive&#x2014;and have a welcome for me still, after so many many years!</p>
<p>I hope in Heaven I shall be better before the time come for setting out on my travels again&#x2014; I would have gone to Dumfriesshire <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week&#x2014;but for that horrid cold which has kept me wretched this fortnight past I am staying with Miss Fergus (M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Chrighton&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly wife of Maj.

<salute>My dear Isabella</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle did not fail to give me your kind message&#x2014;and even without any message from you; I know your and Jamies kindness for me too well, for feeling any misgivings about my welcome at Scotsbrig. It is a place I always go to with the feeling of going <hi rend="italic">home</hi>&#x2014;unless indeed when D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle is there, &#x201C;taking (like the <hi rend="italic">Midges</hi> at <hi rend="italic">Craig o&#x2019;putta</hi>) the <hi rend="italic">hale yearth</hi> to himself.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., presumably, that when the midges are out at Craigenputtoch, they have the whole earth to themselves (because of their biting).</note> I hoped to have gone to you in great force this time&#x2014;I was so well and strong in the first weeks of my stay at Auchtertool&#x2014;But it was too good to last&#x2014;a great cold caught at <hi rend="italic">Church</hi> (no less!) came to remind me like the Annan Baillie that I &#x201C;was but a woman.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-09/lt-18370718-TC-JSM-01"><sic>9:256</sic><corr>TC to JSM, <date when="1837-07-18">18 July 1837</date></corr></ref>.</note> And my last three weeks have been quite wretched, so that all fancy for travelling and <hi rend="italic">visiting</hi> has gone out of me.</p>
<p>I was to have spent &#x201C;a few days at Stirling&#x201D; with a Major Davidson from dear old Haddington and some more days at Glasgow with my cousin Jeanie before going to you and to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell at Thornhill But these horrid snifters, and bothers in my head and stomach have made me throw over all that my <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> was not in&#x2014;and now I am intending to go from here straight to Scotsbrig and Carlyle said Jeamie would drive me to Cummertrees to catch the railway when I was ready to go to Thornhill&#x2014;and so I should get Glasgow &#x201C;well let alone.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I am staying with Miss Fergus just now, and dont mean to go back to Auchtertool except for one night before leaving this part of the Country. It is best I should stay quite quiet for some days to try to get rid of this cold or bilious fit&#x2014;The house is very large here, and I am no trouble; indeed it quite suits Miss Fergus&#x2019;s philanthropic turn of mind to have me <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> on her hands. I <pb id="pg-31-220" n="31:220"/>am sure she likes me better when I <hi rend="italic">need</hi> her kindness than when I am independent of it! At Auchtertool they have Babies now, besides one Invalid already&#x2014;and tho&#x2019; Maggie is an Angel of goodness one wouldn&#x2019;t impose on her too far.</p>
<p>My plan is, to start from here on Monday or Tuesday next week&#x2014;to stay one night with my Aunts to take leave of them, and of dear Betty&#x2014;and then go on to Scotsbrig next day (Tuesday or Wednesday&#x2014;) I will write again when I can say positively which day.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle arrived <hi rend="italic">here</hi> on Saturday&#x2014;like a man just escaped out of Bedlam&#x2014;in such a way about his Highland expedition as if it had been a <hi rend="italic">mission forced</hi> on <hi rend="italic">him</hi> to convert the Heathen in Central Africa&#x2014;He staid here Saturday night and <hi rend="italic">a dog having barked,</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I do hope I shall be well to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">enjoy</hi>&#x201D; my visit to you as William Graham used to &#x201C;en-j-oy&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430827-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:91</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-27">27 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> his breakfast&#x2014;</p>

<p>Here I at last am since 9 this morning. A most fatiguing confused and quite other than delightful journey;&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> real sleep-and-comfort I had being that at Scotsbrig from wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> your goodman roused me on Saturday. Here are my stages:</p>
<p>Saturday to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x26; Kirkaldy at 2 p.m. as proposed.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing to his family in Cheltenham, the poet Sydney Dobell (<date when="1824-00-00">1824</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/7713"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-26/ed-26-biographical-notes"><sic>26:293</sic><corr>26:biographical note</corr></ref>), described a meeting of his wife Emily, b.

Though of course they had no notion of who he was, he gradually got them into a sort of mesmeric possession that stilled every voice but his own and stretched every eye. &#x2026; In the midst of all this thunderous lava he was very kind and sweet to us, and his last words to E&#x2014;were a spontaneous assurance that he should seek us out when he returned from the North. All of his face that his moustache and thick beard left bare had a ruddy health upon it which contrasted pleasantly with his morbid London looks, and which showed that the weeks in the moorlands near which he was born (&#x2018;covered in with solitude and silence,&#x2019; and out of reach of any human being that knew him), where he had just, he declared, been spending the &#x2018;most altogether blessed days he could remember,&#x2019; had been of more than mental benefit&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">The Life and Letters of Sydney Dobell,</hi> ed.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter did accompany me in my wild ride; it was the first thing that welcomed me after I got hither this morning!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did go by Fife, but could not by Linlathen: Poor Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Paterson! He had suddenly died the Saturday before<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Capt. James Paterson d.

But I found Jane (by lucky accident) at Fergus&#x2019;s on a visit; there or at Auchtertool I abode (rather <hi rend="italic">sleepless</hi> at the former place) till Monday afternoon. Thence to <hi rend="italic">Aberdeen</hi> that same Monday <pb id="pg-31-222" n="31:222"/>Ev<hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Thence next day to Inverness (very miserably troublesome kind of journey): <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Inverness a <hi rend="italic">night</hi>-journey, and the painfullest haggling thro&#x2019; these mountains by Highland Coaches, bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me at last, safe and utterly tired, to my goal this morning; and here,&#x2014;after a good sleep of 6 hours, and the events of the day (if other events there have been,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Closing parenthesis omitted.</note>&#x2014;I write you a word before bed time, not to miss the first post tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>It is like a journey into Biscay or the vallies of Dauphin&#xE9;;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bay of Biscay, off the W coast of France and N coast of Spain, and Dauphin&#xE9;, part of SE France, between the Italian border on the E and the river Rh&#xF4;ne on the W; i.e., over heavy seas and wild, rocky land.</note> I have hardly in my life had such haggling &#x26; wraggling,&#x2014;the rather as I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> read Bradshaw;&#x2014;however it is all over with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> mischief, &#x26; that is good comfort.</p>
<p>We have little company here (Lord and Lady Grey<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry George and Maria Grey.</note> soon going, and then only two untitled bachelors of insignificant pretention left);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles R.

Place decided pretty, by the side of a pleasant Loch among fine mountains, and green patches or considerable tracts of primitive Forest at our right hand and left:&#x2014;finally to me a very quiet room.

<p><salute>Dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>Here I am, after much tribulation but without broken bones or accid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> of any kind;&#x2014;came in yesterday morning, totally unslept, with[<hi rend="italic">t</hi>]<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> form or cleanliness; but am on the whole undamaged hitherto. My hand you may see is going at a great rate; but I could not delay a moment to tell you so much.

I have just got breakfast and run into my own room to be out of the cackle and bad air so long.</p>
<p>To Dundee I got along very well that monday night (carriage all to myself, <pb id="pg-31-223" n="31:223"/>and the afternoon so beautiful); at Dundee <hi rend="italic">such</hi> luck ceased, and the ride to Aberdeen was saddened by baddish physiognomies, coal smoke, and other etceteras;&#x2014;nevertheless we got there duly and well, and had nothing to complain of, but the contrary,&#x2014;especially after <hi rend="italic">egg-tea</hi> at the Royal Hotel, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I took as Postscript to Miss Fergus&#x2019;s dinner.

I even got some considerable sleep, tho&#x2019; my room commanded one street and one Court-yard, paved with granite, and doing a good deal in the way of wheels.</p>
<p>Next morning to Inverness (11 a.m to 8 &#xBD; p.m.) by rail &#x26; coach, by a route you know, the sight of which at all turns bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> you in new vividness to my mind: especially from Huntly<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town 40 mi.

On the whole I had a wearisome, fatiguing day, and looked forward to the chance of sleep at Inverness with pleasure.&#x2014; Whew! Inverness was full to the ridge-stone (at least the Caledon<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Hotel was) with idle English tourists, Oxon-Cantabs and such like, ordering &#x201C;whisky and hot water&#x201C;: not a bed to be had;&#x2014;nay I learned straight that there was no need of one! That my coach consisted of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> coaches, the first of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> started at half past 12 (midnight): no help! I wandered into the street, at least to be out of gas and whisky; sauntered sadly smoking there; lay down on chairs afterwards; in fine got upon the coach at last, buckled to the size of a haystack, and after near an hour&#x2019;s haggling shot fairly away again, at a great pace. I shall not forget that curious Night-scene, with my Highland Driver, mid-night woods and Highland hamlets. Terribly cold, it <hi rend="italic">would have grown.</hi> But at 3 &#xBD; a.m. they shot me down on the street of Dingwall (a village like what Lockerby w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be if <pb id="pg-31-224" n="31:224"/>3-parts burnt), and there I had leisure to walk myself into heat again,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">second</hi> coach not to start till 6 a.m.&#x2014;The poor Highland Innkeeper people (all in shirts, <hi rend="italic">shifts</hi> and the house full of <hi rend="italic">gas</hi> without fire) were very kind in their invitations;&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">took</hi> some egg-tea from them, but c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not stand much of the inside gas. Happily the night was fair; and I had &#x2019;bacco at discretion: at length six came, coach crowded; distance hither, reported variously at from 9 miles to 30 d<hi rend="italic">o.</hi> proved to be 18, and I was safe set down in about 3 hours farther, viz 9 a.m.,&#x2014;breakfast just going to begin,&#x2014;for which I had not the least talent or wish, nor indeed for anything, except if possible for sleeping, after getting washed. The washing I accomplished, but could not get sleeping tried for about 3 hours or more (a Dr Kinnear needing to be turned out &#x26;c); in fine almost with a fight I got to a room wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be bolted, closed the shutters and actually fell asleep till close on <hi rend="italic">six</hi> the hour of dinner. My first taste of meat or drink was <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> in these parts: such the way of great houses.&#x2014;However, I got some 4 hours more of sleep in the night time; find the loveliest morning I almost ever saw for weather; a walk, breakfast (Miss Baring<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louisa Baring (d. <date when="1888-00-00">1888</date>), Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s sister.</note> administering very cold washy tea, Her Ladyship having &#x201C;got a chill&#x201D;)&#x2014;and in fact find myself visiting here, in quite tolerable case, considering.&#x2014; &#x2014; The Greys L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> &#x26; L<hi rend="italic">y</hi> are here, but I hope may not stay long.

<p><salute>Dear little woman,&#x2014;</salute>I looked for a Letter rather yesterday, our first post in 3 days; but had no reason to <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> disappointed, after all, that none came. You must have left Kirkcaldy,&#x2014;I have some dim intimation you may have gone <hi rend="italic">to Haddington</hi> again: no you could not get my Letter in time. Mondays, Wed<hi rend="italic">ys,</hi> Fridays (i.e. the <hi rend="italic">previous</hi> nights <hi rend="italic">from Inverness</hi>) are our only postdays. Tomorrow I shall have better luck perhaps.</p>
<p>I am not ill in health, but decidedly uncomfortable rather than otherwise: the weather is broken, blustery rainy; our life is altogether <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> of the idlest (as the wont is); no <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> can be allowed to burn (for over-heat to the Lady): &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">fa freddo</hi></foreign> [it is cold],&#x201D; as Pepoli said!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After a visit to Scotland in <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18441021-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:246</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-10-21">21 Oct. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> We have been to see waterfalls (i.e. The Greys &#x26; we strangers; the Lady goes her own roads, the Lord is always deer-stalking &#x26;c); we are much obstructed by the state of the weather, and alas good for almost nothing when <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is at the best.&#x2014;The grand concern is now that of getting <hi rend="italic">home</hi> out of these stormy regions!&#x2014;</p>
<p>If Gillespie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Gillespie.</note> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> really be glad to pick me up at Inverness some evening an 8 or 9 days hence, and put me on board a Glasgow Steamer next morning, I believe that w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be my best route, and I would join you at Scotsbrig for Chelsea with all despatch. Of all Inverness routes, bad all of them, this seems <pb id="pg-31-226" n="31:226"/>really the eligible. If you find is suitable, you may <hi rend="italic">really</hi> write to Gillespie about this (<hi rend="italic">committing</hi> me as yet to nothing): if you do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> find it fit, as is perhaps likeliest, then let it lie altogether. But in any case do this other thing, Goodykin: send me two &#xa3;1 Notes of money enclosed in your first Note! With these I shall struggle thro&#x2019;; without these hardly. Do not neglect.</p>
<p>The Greys are just off half an hour ago, which will perhaps be a slight improvement in our circumstances. Poodle goes tomorrow: d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o.</hi> We are then threatened with a visit of the other big Lord (Lansdown),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3d marquess of Lansdowne, influential Whig politician.</note> but perhaps he will take gout and give in.

<salute>Dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Your second Letter finds me up here, aloft among the Highland mountains (a Hunting seat of the Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s whither I have been tossed out of my snug Border solitude,&#x2014;not<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly &#x201C;nor&#x201D;; no closing parenthesis after &#x201C;solitude.&#x201D;</note> in good hour. The mountains and lakes are very beautiful; but the storms, in the equinoctial time, are already very loud, and I can do nothing with Deer, not even eat them.&#x2014; In a fortnight hence I hope to be back at Chelsea; but in the meantime will answer your magnanimous Bibliopolical Proposal<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The letter of <date when="1856-08-22">22 Aug.</date> enclosing &#x201C;the proposal in full of Phillips, Sampson &#x26; Co., in reply to my explanation of your design,&#x201D; i.e., TC&#x2019;s plan for sending &#x201C;British Stereotype Plates&#x201D; to reproduce Chapman &#x26; Hall&#x2019;s edn. of his <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> in the U.S.; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560720-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1856-07-20">20 July</date></ref>.</note> (yours or Sampson&#x2019;s thro&#x2019; you, is all one, in the haste I am in&#x2014;just waiting for the &#x201C;Skye Mail&#x201D; which passes once in two days),&#x2014;some word of answer or acknowledgement, not to lose more time than we can help.</p>
<p>I say then that the Project of Msr. Phillips Sampson &#x26; C<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> so far as I in my ignorance can judge of it, seems very rational; and that, once in London, I will make farther investigation into the practical particulars, and prepare myself to say Yes or No when the time comes for that finality. Meanwhile let Msr. Ph<hi rend="italic">s</hi> &#x26; S<hi rend="italic">n</hi> do one thing as preliminary, Tell me <hi rend="italic">how much,</hi> in current money, they will give for a Cast of those potential Stereotypes, to the extent of 2, 4, 6 or as many <hi rend="italic">thousands</hi> as they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to purchase at once;&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">how much per thousand,</hi> in fact? For it would not be convenient to <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> the Stereotypes otherwise, I think;&#x2014;and I suppose there are ways of making certain that the user of them should be <hi rend="italic">restricted</hi> to the Thousands covenanted for, &#x26; that the Plates could be put under lock and key till wanted again. Once knowing what the value per thousand from Messrs Sampson will be, and what the cost in London to myself as preliminary, I shall know the whole matter, and be able to pronounce some decision or other&#x2014; &#x2014; I am much ashamed to trouble <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with this matter; but what can I do at the present stage of it.</p>
<p>Your Book is to be here tomorrow by post. You shall hear soon all the faults I have against it. An Irish Newspaper (the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>) brought me some notice of it the other day, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> somewhat raises my interest.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The review of <hi rend="italic">English Traits</hi> said: &#x201C;Now comes a book on England from a friendly hand, <hi rend="small-caps">emerson</hi>, conscientious and therefore involved philosopher, who, after study through the foreign country, purified by reflections and repose in his own land, is as sagaciously, sententiously, impartial as <hi rend="small-caps">cicero</hi> upon Athens. The patient must shrink under the awful analysis. &#x2026; Emerson &#x2026; finds the Englishman a mighty worker but a deadly blockhead. He admires them as he admires ants&#x2014;their industry superb, but its objects being to him inscrutable, he declares the results nil outside the nest. &#x2026; The American spiritualist arraigns the hideous materialism of England&#x2014;her commercial cynicism&#x2014;her political infidelity&#x2014;her desperation of &#x2018;Dissent&#x2019;&#x2014;her Atheism, which does not even take the forlorn French form of a faith in humanity&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Nation,</hi> <date when="1856-09-06">6 Sept.</date>).</note> A <hi rend="italic">medicinal</hi> intention, <pb id="pg-31-228" n="31:228"/>then, on the Author&#x2019;s part? God knows there was hardly ever such a Hospital of Lepers. More power to such a Doctor, if that is his hest!</p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Both your Letters came to me with their Inclosures yesterday morning: today is the chance (very brief indeed) of writing some word in answer. I am much obliged by your punctual notices;&#x2014;have to reply, for my own behoof, little but that I am moderately well, <hi rend="italic">coldish,</hi> solitary, idle, and not in the gayest spirits amid these Highland rain storms and Hunters of Deer. However, the thing is new, partly worth seeing; and it will not last long.</p>
<p>I naturally got your <hi rend="italic">first</hi> set of Inclosures,&#x2014;naturally, for I think your Letter was in one Cover with them. Here is an answer to the Emerson Letter wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was an item in that Package. Will you be so good as seal it, put a shilling stamp on it, and despatch by post, <foreign><hi rend="italic">qu&#xE0;m prim&#xf9;m</hi></foreign> [as soon as possible]. The Yankee Booksellers (whom Emerson approves) want me to make a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> set of <hi rend="italic">Stereotypes,</hi> and send these to America for their use. I ask, <hi rend="italic">What</hi> will you give?</p>
<p>Where Jane is, or how, I do not know, except by Isabella&#x2019;s Note to you. She sent nothing yesterday; indeed had not <hi rend="italic">time</hi> if she were &#x201C;in Haddington.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Lord and Lady Grey are just gone off; they were pleasant enough while here; but we shall have more room and composure. Another goes tomorrow. If Lord Lansdown do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> one can now hope), our few remaining days (8 or 10 I should guess) may pass much more quietly and with proportional increase of <hi rend="italic">comfort</hi> to one of us. The equinoctial storms have broken out; we have <hi rend="italic">lit no fires;</hi> we are totally <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> except we hunt deer; and except tobacco and walking there is really almost no resource when you cannot <hi rend="italic">boat</hi> nor fish nor hunt nor read or write (for depth of temperature). One <hi rend="italic">might</hi> kindle peat and sit aloft here, but I do not quite like either. My bedroom is one of the best and quietest in the world, and I sleep rather well. It will soon <pb id="pg-31-229" n="31:229"/>be all over, at any rate. I think of returning by the Lochs.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >I.e., presumably, by the lochs that were part of the Caledonian Canal waterway.</note> <hi rend="italic">Return</hi> will be the interesting point! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">12 stamps</hi>&#x201D; here (for Emerson&#x2019;s Letter), but cannot just now find them. You must <hi rend="italic">trust</hi> me for the moment!</salute></closer></p>

The boat went like a swing&#x2014;and I became sick at once&#x2014;in the old inward, inexplosive fashion! The birdcage was caught out of my arms by a stranger Lady and M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lyon half carried me out of the Saloon and deposited me on a coil of dripping wet rope&#x2014;the only vacant spot outside&#x2014;and a horrible hour I spent there! but all hours come to an end&#x2014;and I was able to walk to the train&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the sickness continued for twenty four hours, and I was all trembling from head to foot&#x2014;as indeed &#x201C;there was nothing to <hi rend="italic">hinder</hi> the day mair than any other day&#x201C;&#x2014;All the visits and shopping, I &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">did intend</hi>&#x201D; to do, had to be thrown over and I went straight to my Aunts who received me most kindly&#x2014;really looked <foreign><hi rend="italic">waeer</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-31-230" n="31:230"/>for me than could have been expected of them&#x2014;gave me whisky&#x2014;then tea and <hi rend="italic">hurried</hi> &#x201C;Prayers,&#x201D; that I might be put to bed at eight oclock&#x2014; As I had <hi rend="italic">written</hi> to Jamie, I insisted on going on next day, tho&#x2019; pressed most earnestly to stay&#x2014;till I had recovered myself! and I think the railway journey did me good rather than harm&#x2014; I missed the forenoon train however, having mistaken the hour of starting and did not reach Ecclefechan till thirteen minutes after nine. not at all sure that anybody would be there to meet me!&#x2014;and the night quite dark&#x2014; But it was all right&#x2014; Jamie had <hi rend="italic">seen my mistake</hi> in the letter I wrote, and calculated that I would come by <hi rend="italic">that</hi> train&#x2014; Isabella had a bright fire and tea things ready&#x2014;but I &#x201C;took a notion&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See &#x201C;Paddy in Glasgow,&#x201D; Scottish folk song (P.

Yesterday I breakfasted in bed but I got up at eleven and am much better than could have been expected&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your letter this morning is <hi rend="italic">a degree</hi> more <hi rend="italic">legible</hi> than the first one!&#x2014;but dear me! what galloping and spluttering over the paper, as if you were writing in a house on fire! and bent on making <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> look <hi rend="italic">as much as possible</hi>! I have measured the distance between your lines in the letter just come, and it is precisely <hi rend="italic">one inch</hi>! In the first letter it must have been an inch and half!

<p>For the rest&#x2014;in spite of all objections &#x201C;for the occasion got up&#x201D;; I dare say you are pretty comfortable.

<p>As to Tom Gillespie; if you could have got into his hands I am sure he would have been useful to you, and been delighted to be so&#x2014;But the poor man is quite laid up; has been for long in a dangerous state&#x2014;His sister M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Binnie<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary (ca. <date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), widow of Thomas Binnie.</note> lives near the Caledonian Railway, and I spent the hours I had to wait for the train on Tuesday at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house, and she was speaking quite despondingly about him. So <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is <hi rend="italic">no go</hi>!</p>
<p>Five pounds is as easily sent as two one pound notes&#x2014;more easily indeed&#x2014;for I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> no one pound notes&#x2014;So I send a five pound note&#x2014;to put you out <pb id="pg-31-231" n="31:231"/>of all danger of running short&#x2014; It is a very unnecessary grievance <hi rend="italic">that</hi> to incur!&#x2014;so long as one <hi rend="italic">has</hi> money.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dearest Mr<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Russell!</salute> I will be with you on Monday next, God willing&#x2014;by the Train that passes Thornhill 20 minutes after five p.m.&#x2014; James Carlyle will drive me to Annan to meet it at four&#x2014;</p>
<p>You must not think me fallen into second childhood if I come accompanied by two&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">Canaries</hi>!&#x2014;It is not from any abstract love of that bird I carry them about with me&#x2014;but to take back to London with me <hi rend="italic">something living</hi> <pb id="pg-31-232" n="31:232"/>from dear old Haddington! Where these blessed little canaries of mine were born&#x2014;or (more properly speaking) hatched&#x2014; Indeed they first saw the light in our own old House! Perhaps I may leave them till my return from Thornhill in charge to my little niece-in-law.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Isabella&#x2019;s da., Jenny, now aged 13.</note> But <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will depend on the estimate I form in the meanwhile of her punctuality and <hi rend="italic">Humanity to Animals.</hi> I had a horrid rough passage last Monday from Fife&#x2014;was as sick as any number of <hi rend="italic">dogs</hi>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">horses</hi> to boot!&#x2014;in my own peculiar <hi rend="italic">unexplosive</hi> fashion, and arrived at <hi rend="italic">Craigen Villa trembling</hi> from head to (!!) foot like a sensitive horse that had been in a railway box!&#x2014; But I am all right now&#x2014;that is to say rather <hi rend="italic">less wrong</hi> than when I left Auchtertool</p>

<dateline><place>Kinloch Luichart, Dingwall</place> / <date when="1856-09-20">22 [20] Sept<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> 1856</date>&#x2014;</dateline>
<p><salute>Alas, my dear Jeannie, what is this!</salute> I cannot get a word from you since the day we parted in Kirkcaldy: I have written, I have sent Newspapers, this is the third Letter, and not a sound from you in return; I do not know how you are, not even in the least where you are.&#x2014;I try not to alarm myself; but I confess the thing begins to look questionable: if I could be well assured you were right, rid of your cold, and going on fairly, all the rest would be easier for me. Any way there is no remedy; and I must just wait. Till Monday (<date when="1856-09-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>) there is not even possibility of a Letter; unless you are writing from some place of the distance of about Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">today,</hi> I cannot hear of you sooner than Wednesday. Is that fair play?</p>
<p>We have had a week or more of the dismallest tempestuous rainy weather you ever saw. Raging wind, and no road sheltered; every ten minutes a roaring torrent of windy rain: one has to calculate <hi rend="italic">where</hi> walking with an umbrella will be possible (if anywhere); and doing one&#x2019;s best, it is a puddling and a wetting all day. Very cold too; and no fire, or none but an imaginary one, can be permitted in the drawing room. Her Ladyship, in worse humour than <pb id="pg-31-233" n="31:233"/>usual, is capable of being driven to extremities by your setting up a peat from its flat posture; so I have learned altogether to abstain! Nothing earthly to be <hi rend="italic">done,</hi> nothing good to be read, to be said or thought,&#x2014;this is not a luxurious kind of life for a poor wayfaring individual. My commonest resource is this: To walk out from 6 to 10 miles, ducking under bushes from the showers; return utterly tired; put on dressing gown, Cape, plaid &#x26;c, and lie down on one&#x2019;s bed, under all the woollen stuffs one can gather; with hat laid on cheek to keep out the light, I usually get to a sluggardly kind of warm half-sleep in this kind of way, and last till dinner-time not so ill off. The rooms are quiet and good;&#x2014;today I am shifted, making way last night for Lord Lansdowne, who is off again this morning, Carriage &#x26; four, towards Dunrobin:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dunrobin Castle, Sutherland, seat of the dukes of Sutherland.</note> so that I shall soon get back.&#x2014; The Greys are gone, Poodle, today Miss Baring goes; nothing but vulgar Kinnear and myself remain now in the shape of guests.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">All</hi> go on Monday come a week; my two weeks will be out on Wednesday next; but the Skye Mail and all conveyances are full full to overflowing (so many Tourists running home out of the bad weather); it is clearly easier that I wait till then and go with Rous and Co&#x2014; From Inverness on Tuesday there is a Coach to Dunkeld;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town 15 mi. NW of Perth.</note> on Wednesday (as computed), I am in Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi>&#x2014;after that, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> go off next day to London; but with me nothing is yet decided, or will be till I hear from you,&#x2014;if you ever write to me again, you hard, inconsiderate, angry or unlucky, or I know not what to call you! I shall be heartily glad to conclude this Hyperborean part of my Tour; which has made a <date when="1856-09-00">September</date> for me as unlike my <date when="1856-08-00">August</date> as is well possible! Today the showers have as good as ceased; the wind gone northerly and all very cold,&#x2014;except one could walk and wear clothes.</p>
<p>I got Emerson&#x2019;s Book <hi rend="italic">English Traits,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> gave me one comfortable day&#x2019;s reading: very good indeed: I have not found another Book here that I could stand.&#x2014; The old Marquis<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lansdowne.</note> was a brilliancy perceptible while he staid; very old, very weakly; but the perfect gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of his kind,&#x2014;holding on to the very last.</p>
<p>I wrote (seriously) for two one-pound Notes; but do not want them now; that is to say, can do very well without them. Nor Tom Gillespie either, unless you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> written to him.&#x2014;<closer><salute>God keep you, Dearest, wherever you are; you <hi rend="italic">should</hi> have written, and save me these anxieties.</salute></closer></p>

<p>I took the letter to Ecclefechan in the gig and Jamie posted it, while I bought envelopes&#x2014;there was no visibility of the note in it even when held between you and the light&#x2014;</p>
<p>Please to write immediately on receiving this to / M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russells&#x2014; Thornhill, Dumfriesshire to say if you have got the money&#x2014;Jamie is going to drive me to Annan&#x2014;and it is a day of heavy showers&#x2014; But I am to be met at Thornhill station and must go&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Well, thank Heaven I hear of you at last!</salute> The man, yesterday too, at first denied, &#x201C;No Letters for you, Sir&#x201D;; and I had three minutes of sceptical suspense, till he did produce the article. You have no idea how glad I am to hear of you on any terms. You, for your share, take it very lightly indeed; and by way of excuse for yourself set to criticcing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> my three Notes, and the wide <hi rend="italic">spaces</hi> left between the lines! One line, with half a mile on each side of it, would to me have been a godsend. Indeed all that second part of your Letter is far less pleasant to me than the first; it is wholly grounded in <hi rend="italic">mis</hi>knowledge or in deep ignorance of the circumstances; and deserves for answer&#x2014;no farther details, credible or incredible, about these Highland matters till we <pb id="pg-31-235" n="31:235"/>meet. There is for you! But you are a good body too for all your petulances; and I am right glad to know you safe where you are.</p>
<p>What you say about the regal vehicle to London from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is mostly right; and I have settled that it must be the way you want. On Wednesday week, namely, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> come on to Scotsbrig, you stay still: it is about the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> distance from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by the Carlisle route; and the preliminary 80 miles fall rather to me than to you. So let it be settled. Lady A., whose kind intentions and endeavours cannot be questioned, seems particularly anxious we should both profit by their Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> conveyance; and her maid has bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me the enclosed Note this morning tho&#x2019; I stated expressly last night that it was settled otherwise; nay just now Lord A. opens the door to ask the question again before writing, to which as before my answer is No with thanks. What pleasure or profit <hi rend="italic">they</hi> could get from it, is not apparent. But, any way, we have to stand by the above decision; which I think, and see that you think, the best for various reasons.&#x2014; I get to Inverness on Monday next, then (<hi rend="italic">dry</hi> so far); Tuesday an 100 ugly miles beginning 6 a.m. on the outside of a coach to Dunkeld, where the Lordships (coach and four) join Rous and me: Wednesday to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by rail, and I take the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian,</hi> same train as yours was, and am at Scotsbrig that night at the hour you know,&#x2014;if all prosper. If you are there, well and best; if not, I could come to pick you up at the Gill next day (Thursday) from Thornhill or Dumfries:&#x2014;and I think we should aim to be <hi rend="italic">home</hi> at Chelsea on Saturday night. This is the whole program.</p>
<p>I find it a pity you took Isabella&#x2019;s notion, &#x26; went to Annan instead of Cummertrees. It would really have been easier for all parties; and poor Mary w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been charmed by the visit; which she had well deserved, poor soul, by her fidelity to you and by a kindness without limit to your helpmate in late weeks. However, you perhaps <hi rend="italic">have</hi> done that visit since, or will do it. A word to Scotsbrig will bring the Gig any whither at any time; and there are two trains from Thornhill both early enough. Nor will you forget <hi rend="italic">Dumfries.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To visit the Aitkens.</note></p>
<p>I have to write to Ellice; refusing a Glen Quoich visit,&#x2014;gunroom Kinnear (a goodnatured smoking soul, not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> sense tho&#x2019; a snob) accepts. John saw Nero well and merry at London. Grateful regards to Dr. R. and Mrs.&#x2014; God bless you ever; and bring us to meet on Wed<hi rend="italic">y,</hi> if it may be!</p>

It was suggested that all lands to W of the line should belong to Tannich, and those to E to Kinlochluichart (copy of letter from Skene to Dundas &#x26; Wilson, <date when="1858-01-14">14 Jan. 1858</date>, MS: NLS Acc. 11388). The dispute was not settled until <date when="1893-00-00">1893</date>.</note> to help matters!</p>
<p>I have nearly sprained my ancles (not quite), and will avoid the hillsides henceforth, and stick by the flat road. Tolerably well in health, tho&#x2019; my Annandale cold still hangs by me.</p></ps>

<salute>Dear Mr Ellice,</salute>
<p>Rouse gave me your message, which I felt to be very kind and agreeable, tho&#x2019; I did not need it to assure me of a Highland welcome if ever I could contrive to take Glen Quoich in my course.</p>
<p>Alas, it is not possible at all on this occasion: I was half killed by my tumbling up hither so many hundred miles, in miscellaneous vehicles, no sleep to be had, and for breath in the rail trains nothing but foul air, and in the inns mostly coal gas, and the vapour of whisky punch: &#x201C;Waita! Dlass of wisky and hot wata&#x2019;!&#x201D;&#x2014;Oh, it is heartbreaking to the solitary meditative man! And now my beneficent hosts undertake to convey me safe from all that, as far as Edin<hi rend="italic">r;</hi> and thence the same evening (<date when="1856-10-01">Wednesday week</date>) to meet my Wife in Annandale; and so start, by Carlisle, for Chelsea on the <date when="1856-10-04">Saturday ensuing</date>. I have told the Lady I would fly to Glenquoich, had I wings; but having hardly hoofs, how under above conditions can I go!</p>
<p>My Wife has been tolerably well all this while; and both of us rather reckon ourselves improved by this long spell of rustication. We will hope to meet you in London in a few days; and to take Glenquoich some other time when the omens are better.</p>
<p>Will you offer my kind regards to the junior branches, Gentleman and Lady.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ellice&#x2019;s son by his first wife (Lady Hannah), also Edward (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>; <ref target="volume-31/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8651"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), M.P. for St. Andrews, his wife, Catherine Jane, b.

<salute>My dear Jamie</salute>
<p>At last I have, this morning, a letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C to tell me he had got the money all right&#x2014;adding (after all the botheration I have had about it) &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">it will do</hi> no <hi rend="italic">harm</hi> at least&#x201D;!! He is to come with the Ashburtons to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> on Wednesday morning, and in compliance with my notions about paying one&#x2019;s own way is to quit them there and to join me at Scotsbrig&#x2014;</p>
<p>But I have written today to beg him to do no such thing. as it is not to please himself he would reject their offer to take him all the way in that commodious carriage&#x2014;but merely because he thinks it his duty to come and pick me up; since I dont choose to go to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to be picked up by the Almighty Carriage!&#x2014;If he is to travel one half the way under their protection he may as well travel the other half&#x2014;and besides he makes me clearly understand that it is to meet <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wishes he imposes on himself an &#x201C;additional 90 miles.&#x201D; He will be no earthly help to me on the journey so for all sakes I trust he will revise his purpose&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This is probably the last Note I shall write to you from these Highland wildernesses. We are all to go on Monday next: to Inverness that night, in an <hi rend="italic">omnibus</hi> of our own where will be protection against rain; on Tuesday to Dunkeld, outside a Coach (&#x201C;Dr Rouse&#x201D; and I), for 12 hours, under such weather as there may be; lastly on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> by rail to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> where I break off, and hope to night at Scotsbrig, and pick up Jane who is in those parts, at <hi rend="italic">Thornhill</hi> I think in the present days. She will probably be waiting for me at Scotsbrig; or if not I must go and catch her at the Gill next day. My calculation is, we ought to be off for London on the <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> immediately following, and be at home that night.&#x2014; You, who understand the mystic Bradshaw and Murray, can perhaps point out the eligible train for us to come by on Saturday? The <hi rend="italic">Express</hi> I could myself discover;&#x2014;and it is horrible, yet probably the best, being the briefest. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> night <hi rend="italic">next,</hi> as I explained, there can nothing find me here from you; but on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> following, I am to be found at Scotsbrig.

<salute>Dear Jamie,</salute>
<p>I yesterday got Jane&#x2019;s second Letter, written in haste while you were waiting to drive her off to Annan: the first also had come, and all was right. She seems heartily content with the reception you all gave her.</p>
<p>I am now near the term of this tempestuous Highland sojourn,&#x2014;much disfigured by bad weather for one thing;&#x2014;we are all to be off for Inverness on Monday next (Monday 29<hi rend="italic">th</hi>), thence to Dunkeld on Tuesday; thence to Edin<hi rend="italic">r,</hi> on Wednesday about 1 p.m.;&#x2014;and that same Wednesday, by the same train as before, I for my part mean to be at Scotsbrig if all go right, and hope to find you as I did before hospitably ready to whirl me over in the gig to my night&#x2019;s quarters. Wednesday 1 Oct<hi rend="italic">r</hi> (Wed<hi rend="italic">y next</hi>), by the train that leaves Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> about 5 p.m.: let this stand fixed, if you hear nothing more.</p>
<p>I wrote to Jane to that effect two days since. Possibly she may be at Scotsbrig waiting for me; otherwise I said I could drive across next day, and pick her up at the Gill. We are to be off for Chelsea on the Saturday immediately following, and so to end these weary wanderings. I keep in goodish <pb id="pg-31-240" n="31:240"/>health; I believe I have very perceptibly improved in that particular: certainly I have tried two very opposite ways of <hi rend="italic">regimen</hi> since I first started!</p>
<p>There has been nothing but continual splashes of rain, and driving blasts of Scotch mist, with wild howling tempests of wind, for the last two weeks: one never stirs without an umbrella, and no umbrella will do on the unprotected road,&#x2014;you have to fly into some quarryhole of the roadman, if there be not some scrag of natural &#x201C;birch-forest&#x201D; within reach. A country <hi rend="italic">totally</hi> unimproved by the Natives; but considerably improvable,&#x2014;thanks to South country farmers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >During the first half of the 19th cent. many Highland estates were sold by hereditary owners to wealthy Lowland Scots and English. Some of the new landlords turned the estates into extensive sheep farms; others took advantage of the loans offered under the <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date> Land Drainage Act to create more arable land (see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560925-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1856-09-25">25 Sept.</date></ref>).</note> who are coming in here and there, with their draining apparatus<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly referring to the most recent innovation in land drainage, the introduction of cylindrical clay pipes, developed in England in <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date> (see T. C. Smout, <hi rend="italic">Nature Contested</hi> [Edinburgh, <date when="2000-00-00">2000</date>] 98).</note> and their Cheviot sheep<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Breed of hardy, white faced, hornless sheep, originating in the Cheviot Hills on the Scottish-English border. First introduced into the Highlands in the <date>late 18th cent.</date>, they are usually associated with the Highland Clearances, during which large parts of the Highlands were depopulated and estates turned over to sheep farming, <date>early 19th cent.</date> to the <date>1860s</date>.</note>&#x2014;very beautiful, too, in parts, if it were not so savage and wet.</p>
<p>I told Jane to take her choice as to Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> and Thursday; and that you would catch her up at the Gill if she liked that, any day, with the Gig. I rather hope she will be with you, when I come. I wish I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> &#x201C;come&#x201D;! But there are some very ugly hours and miles between me and that.&#x2014;<closer><salute>Give my kindest regards to Isabella, John &#x26; Jenny.

You might say, for example that I am going home by myself on Monday or Tuesday, which would at once cut away all shadow of <pb id="pg-31-241" n="31:241"/>reason for his separating himself from your party. I am getting rather tired of tumbling myself from place to place; especially since I caught a cold in &#x201C;hearing&#x201D; a popular preacher&#x2014;and Nero I am told is cultivating an undemonstrative but profound grief at my long absence&#x2014;so I shall be well enough pleased to find myself again at Chelsea&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hope I may see you before you start for Nice&#x2014;</p>
<p>I think M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C writes in good spirits and as if he had got good of his Highland expedition</p>
<p>If you send me word <hi rend="italic">to go</hi> on Tuesday or Wednesday as the only means to make M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C go straight from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I will go&#x2014;I am quite ready&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Mary</salute>
<p>You will know perhaps what time the train which leaves Dumfries at five p.m. reaches Cummertrees? Though I have a Bradshaw in my hand I cannot for my life make out that small fact!</p>
<p>But taking it for granted that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know it; this is to say if you will send some human creature to meet that train on Monday next (the day after tomorrow) I shall be deposited there, I and my carpet bag, to shake hands with you on my road to Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>I have written to Jamie to bring the gig to the Gill for me that night. It will be a long drive in the dark; but the drive will be less likely to hurt me than changing my bed for one night,&#x2014;and I must be at Scotsbrig on Tuesday, in case of having to start for London the following day</p>
<p>I go from here by the earliest train on Monday, but must stop at Dumfries to see Jane, and between the train that reaches Dumfries about eleven and that which leaves it at five, I can find no other.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was greatly pleased with his sojurn at the Gill, and wrote in raptures about your and everybody&#x2019;s kindness to him.</p>
<p>I dont know quite whether he will be at Scotsbrig on Wednesday or not. I will tell you all about him when I see you, dear Mary. I hope you will get this on time to meet me, as I don&#x2019;t know the road.</p>

<p><salute>My dear little Jeannie,&#x2014;</salute>Accept of one word more from me, empty as ever, the last I shall write from this place: I have no need to write at all, everything standing essentially as it <supplied>[was]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> when you last heard; but I write merely for the sake of writing. It is very cold, I can assure you, up here in my &#x201C;excellent bedroom,&#x201D; and the steel pen requires a set of far nimbler fingers than mine at present are. But in a day doomed to utter inanity and the doing of nothing, this little thing may be worth doing to begin with.</p>
<p>I enclose you Mary&#x2019;s Letter: if you have not seen her and Jean, pray take a little pains to do them due visit in passing. I know you will not neglect this little act of kindness to me and them. No ministering spirits could have been readier to serve me in all points, and no sisters could have been more kind, than they two were.&#x2014; I gave you the choice of <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> or an earlier day for the Gill; I still hold there; but feel I shall perhaps be very <hi rend="italic">tired</hi> on Thursday,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; whether a <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> might not be, also, a goodish way of <hi rend="italic">resting</hi>?: Do as you find pleasantest.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I have happened a&#x201D; considerable &#x201C;misfortune, Ma&#x2019;am&#x201C;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430813-JWC-TC-01"><sic>17:42</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1843-08-13">13 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> the day before yesterday, by some accident (for I was doing nothing unusual) I let my watch hustle out of my trowsers; down it came on the hard floor; broke the glass, and I hoped that was all,&#x2014;but, alas, on examining, tho&#x2019; nothing seemed wrong to the eye, I found the poor creature <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> for the moment, and fixed not to go; so wrapped up into my writingcase, a sorrowful man. The gloom and distress I have felt ever since about that small matter is evidence of the weak morbid state of mind I am in!&#x2014; Then yesterday morning, <hi rend="italic">running</hi> out for heat before breakfast, on roads smooth but slippery and glistening with rain just over, I,&#x2014;by what bad method or mistake I do not yet understand,&#x2014;came down flat and clean, like a felled tree, on the public highway; broke one of my finger-joints (the <hi rend="italic">skin</hi> only, n.b.!), dirtied my coat (mud mere <hi rend="italic">sand,</hi> when it dries), and ran on, heartily ashamed of myself. A bit of diacolon<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For &#x201C;diachylon.&#x201D;</note> is healing the worst consequences of that.</p>
<p>Lord A. is to the &#x201C;forest&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountainous bare ground for hunting deer: &#x201C;An Englishman, new to the Highlands, passing through a northern deer forest, remarked to his native companion that he was surprised to see no trees there. &#x2018;Trees!&#x2019; said the Highlander, with undisguised contempt, &#x2018;wha ever heard tell o&#x2019; trees in a forest?&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">SND</hi> 4:155).

<p><salute>My Dear little Goody,&#x2014;</salute>I recognise, in this Note wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> has just come, your desire to do what is kind to me: thanks, thanks;&#x2014;but we will go on no such foolish score; we will stand by what was already settled; and Jamie shall meet me at the Ecclefechan station on Wedn<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Night; and we will repose at Scotsbrig till Saturday, and get home <hi rend="italic">together</hi> that evening, if it please Heaven and you!&#x2014; I am not under &#x201C;the protection&#x201D; of the Ashburtons farther than to Inverness, where are human hireable vehicles to be had: you little understand what the degree of &#x201C;pleasantness&#x201D; that of my position here is and has been:&#x2014;in short, I am off from Edinburgh on Wednesday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at 5 o&#x2019;clock, and Jamie picks me up as above-said. And you will not find me a bad companion out of &#x201C;disappointment,&#x201D; but from some other cause, if at all.</p>
<p>Lady A. has made no appearance these many days at such hour; probably will not today either till night at Inverness, if then,&#x2014;for she is really ailing I believe with cold, and the weather &#x26;c are perfectly mortifying to the thickest-skinned people. She can say nothing of your Note therefore; nor would any saying avail.</p>
<p>We are not to get away till &#x201C;after luncheon,&#x201D; 2 p.m., 32 miles only; tomorrow is the tug of war.

<salute>My dear dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell.</salute>
<p>It is all right! that is&#x2014;all &#x201C;as well as can be expected.&#x201D; I got here last night at half after ten&#x2014;wearied in body and mind&#x2014;but certainly as <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> as a pie! There was no pleasure in my life after you went away&#x2014; Not even in the encounter with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fairie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Farie.</note> at the Dumfries Station! who had nothing to say that I cared to hear&#x2014;except indeed that he had seen <hi rend="italic">you</hi> safe back at Thornhill&#x2014;that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Gladstone had taken you home in his carriage&#x2014;and that &#x201C;both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Gladstone<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Steuart Gladstone (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1882-00-00">82</date>) of Capernoch, nr.

And M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fairie stepped into the carriage and sat down beside me, just as if we had appointed to meet!&#x2014; Jane&#x2019;s eyes bored into the affair, like <hi rend="italic">gimmlets</hi> (I dont know how to spell that) and I made haste to anticipate evil constructions, by introducing &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Fairie, <hi rend="italic">a friend of her Brother&#x2019;s</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; Happily she knew him by name and looked satisfied&#x2014;more or less!</p>
<p>James Austin was waiting with a gig at Cummertrees&#x2014;and in the two moments of stopping there, I shook hands with another &#x201C;Lady from London&#x201D; looking out of one of the carriages!! It was a Lady Bell, widow of Sir Charles Bell the Anatomist.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marion Bell, b.

<p>I told Mary Austin the kind things you had said of her and she seemed affected at the remembrance of that poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Maxwell.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the widow of William Maxwell of Carronhill, the duke of Buccleuch&#x2019;s factor at Thornhill (see <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420326-TC-WIMA-01"><sic>14:91</sic><corr>TC to WIMA, <date when="1842-03-26">26 March 1842</date></corr></ref>).</note> She said, &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Dobie was uncommon gude to them! it was aye an <hi rend="italic">yera</hi> in their lives when Uncle Dobie cam&#x201D;!</p>
<p>James Carlyle was already there with the gig to take me to Scotsbrig&#x2014; And when I had said all that was to be said under the circumstances and got some <pb id="pg-31-246" n="31:246"/>tea I undid my great green bundle and put on the green cloak, in which I looked, I flatter myself, like a gigantic <hi rend="italic">kail worm</hi>! But certainly it was made to turn any amount of cold! And I arrived at Scotsbrig <hi rend="italic">smoking</hi>!&#x2014;like your tea pot when you take the cloth off it! I think, even without any cloak, I should have been kept warm by the continual <hi rend="italic">shyings</hi> and caperings of our horse at any gleam of light that reached it thro the darkness. and by its descent, <hi rend="italic">on all fours,</hi> down a precipitous <hi rend="italic">brae</hi> covered with loose stones!&#x2014; But Jamie is a first rate driver&#x2014;</p>
<p>No letter from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle this morning, so I cannot know now till tomorrow morning whether he be coming tomorrow or not&#x2014; Cannot consequently start for London tomorrow by myself&#x2014; How tiresome!</p>

<p>I yesterday received here your Draught of Fourteen Pounds (New York, Aug<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 4), the Interest of the Bond you are kind enough to manage for me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Illinois bonds.

The interest was paid every six months.</note> and I can only again thank you for your friendly and most successful pains in that particular.&#x2014;My new monies for investment do not yet come in, for about a year:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC did not send Butler more money for investment until <date when="1859-04-00">April 1859</date>; see Kimball 288&#x2013;89.</note> when they do, I shall certainly bethink me of the indications you give, and of your kind offer to take farther trouble for me.</p>
