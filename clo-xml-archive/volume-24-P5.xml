<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your news about Duffy;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy&#x2019;s trial for high treason, <date when="1849-02-15">15 Feb.</date>, in Dublin, resulted in a hung jury (eleven for conviction, one against), and he was moved from Dublin&#x2019;s Newgate prison (where he was forbidden to receive letters or papers or visitors other than his wife, to Richmond prison, Dublin, which allowed more privileges), to await retrial. As he later wrote, &#x201C;After my recommittal to prison ten thousand of the citizens of Dublin of all parties, with many of the foremost names in commerce, literature, and the professions at their head, demanded that the prosecution should be utterly dropped. The jurors who had been willing to convict me united with them. Several of the principal towns in the north and south followed their example. The Irish electors in certain English and Scotch boroughs called on their representatives to interpose&#x201C; (Duffy, <hi rend="italic">My Life in Two Hemispheres</hi> [<date when="1898-00-00">1898</date>] 1:329&#x2013;30). Clarendon refused all pleas on Duffy&#x2019;s behalf, asserting that he was undoubtedly guilty and that there was no precedent for protest against the trial, especially by someone who expressed no regret and refused to promise not to repeat the offense. The next trial began <date when="1849-04-10">10 April</date> and lasted for three days. As before, the Crown attempted to pack the jury with sympathizers to the prosecution, but once again the jury did not agree, seven voting for acquittal. Duffy was finally released on bail.</note> concerning whom, tho&#x2019; the Newspapers are full of unreadable officialities this long while, authentic tidings are scarce and valuable to me.</p>
<p>You may believe me, and I hope he always believes, there is no honest thing I could do to help him which it would not be a pleasure to me to attempt. But the case has now assumed so monstrous a form, I confess there seems, by the method you speak of, no possibility. Everybody here has grown weary of it, looks upon it as a hideous farce,&#x2014;crossbones surmounted by a zany&#x2019;s Cap (the emblem too often of Irish History),&#x2014;and struggles to escape from it by entirely dismissing it from his mind. That Duffy is <hi rend="italic">legally</hi> guilty of the charge brought against him, no one here doubts, has doubted, or probably ever will doubt. Concerning his <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> guilt in the matter there are all varieties of opinion,&#x2014;from impatient resentment as against some disturber of the public thoroughfares (not deeper, I think), up even to belief that it is a moral merit. But that he did verily incite men to rebel against the Queen of England,&#x2014;of this, it is thought, there are no twelve men, and hardly twelve animals, you could consult on the subject who, if they were candid, would have difficulty about their verdict! To me also, I confess, it appears not more disputable than the existence of the sun at noonday. And yet here, for five months, have the chosen trained intellects of Ireland, furnished with wigs, parchments, precedents, and all the machinery accumulated by man&#x2019;s wit these four thousand years for eliciting solemnly <hi rend="italic">the truth</hi> in such cases,&#x2014;been busy over this case; and they have brought it to the condition we see! <pb id="pg-24-4" n="24:4"/>Whether a man has a nose upon his face or not, they cannot say.&#x2014; This view of the matter is to me (if perhaps to me <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>) entirely horrible: Skibereen Unions, Liberator O&#x2019;Connels, Tarah meetings, Battles of Vinegar Hill, of all these branches of the Upas-tree<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Skibbereen, co. Cork, where in the ruins of a Cistercian abbey victims of the <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date> famine, especially severe in this region, are buried. Daniel O&#x2019;Connell was called the &#x201C;Liberator.&#x201C; For Tara, see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18480205-TC-ADV-01">TC to ADV, <date when="1848-02-05">5 Feb. 1848</date></ref>. Vinegar Hill, co. Wexford, where Irish rebels were defeated, <date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>. The upas, or poison tree, of Macassar, which according to travelers&#x2019; tales poisoned everything around it.</note> this seems to me to disclose the essential sap and consummate flower;&#x2014;I really have in my heart no kind of advice that I should like to give concerning it, no word that I could think it profitable to speak on the subject at present. An <hi rend="italic">Abyss</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Lies</hi> yawning wide here, deep as the foundations of human life: Governors and Governed and all men ought to pause over it, and reflect on it,&#x2014;in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, if permitted!</p>
<p>Not that I have not tried what was feasible for me to do the brave Duffy, whom I always love, a little good when there seemed a chance; but unhappily with small effect at any time;&#x2014;and in that direction, apart from my own feelings and reluctances about it, I find that there is at present no likelihood whatever. The Government (anything called by the name of &#x201C;Government&#x201C; in any country or time would be obliged to do so) must of course strain all its energies to obtain a conviction in such a case: if they cannot do it by jury,&#x2014;they might have a case to come before Parliament with, and say, &#x201C;Do you mean to <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> Jury-trials in Ireland, then? Irish juries cannot find that there is a sun at twelve o&#x2019;clock noon!&#x201C;&#x2014; To which I think the Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> might do well to suggest in answer, &#x201C;Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> mean to continue such a set of laws and practices, disowned by Heaven, and on Earth productive of Skibereen unions, Liberator O&#x2019;Connels, and the exile of Ireland&#x2019;s bravest sons? To set your Attorney&#x2019;s wig ag<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the thunderbolt of the gods? Away with Irish juries; but away also with such insane Redtapisms, and know that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a Law of God, which you will be damned (to a certainty!) if you do not continue to follow!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x2014;</p>
<p>Pray do not tell poor Duffy a word of all this; for it will only grieve him. You and he may be sure always, if I have any possibility to do him service in his tragical distresses, I will not neglect it.&#x2014; &#x2014; The first gleam of real hope for Ireland seems to me that Speech of Peel&#x2019;s the other night;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490329-TC-JGL-01">TC to JGL, <date when="1849-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> the first wise word I remember in my life to have heard spoken by an official man on that subject. I do thank God for it. We shall perhaps get thro&#x2019; without street-barricades, we, after all!&#x2014; I need not say how interesting you can at any time be to me by a few lines of your pen,&#x2014;especially while this sad matter remains hanging. <closer><salute>Believe me always</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Sincerely Yours /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Ayscough Ms. is identical with the Reprint of Borlace,&#x2014;wants only a few lines at each end, has insignificant verbal variations &#x26;c.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490329-TC-TW-01">TC to TW, <date when="1849-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> Thanks to you for that fact;&#x2014;which the Keepers of the Museum <hi rend="italic">Mss.</hi> ought to have specified on their old Letter<supplied>[?]</supplied> of a &#x201C;Fragment&#x201C; a hundred years ago, for the benefit of the curious! It seems, this Ms. Fragment was given them by a &#x201C;Dean Milles&#x201C; (or Miller?),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeremiah Milles (<date when="1714-00-00">1714</date>&#x2013;<date when="1784-00-00">84</date>), antiquary and dean of Exeter. He collected a large number of books and mss., some of which he gave to the British Museum and some of which the museum acquired at auction.</note> whoever that might be. I have never seen any but the first edition of <hi rend="italic">Borlace;</hi> and that certainly is not an inviting work.</p>
<p>Thanks also for the Letter on Pickering&#x2019;s Burial; which is now stuck into its place, better or worse.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edleston wrote, <date when="1849-03-30">30 March</date>, enclosing a copy of a Cromwell letter &#x201C;relating to poor Col. Pickering from Polwhele&#x2019;s printed book.&#x201C; John Pickering (d. <date when="1645-00-00">1645</date>), parliamentary army officer. For the letter, see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:232.</note>&#x2014; Have you any Books near at hand that would discover with exactness what the relation of Poet Dryden to those Pickerings was? I have carried off from Sir W<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Scott<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Sir Walter Scott, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Dryden</hi> (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>).</note> (long since) the impression that they were his <hi rend="italic">uncles;</hi> but from certain poor <hi rend="italic">Baronetages</hi> here within reach, it rather seems as if John Dryden&#x2019;s Grandfather had been Pickering&#x2019;s uncle,&#x2014;which is a diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> relation; a half cousinship, I think.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This is correct. TC speaks of Pickering&#x2019;s &#x201C;Cousin Dryden&#x201C; <sic>(6:232)</sic><corr>(<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 9:232)</corr>.</note> Do not mind this in the least, if it do not lie in your way.</p>
<p>Could you now be so good as give me the exact reference to Hartshorne&#x2019;s Book for that Wyatt Letter: Hartshorne&#x2019;s Book Rarities (place? year?) p.&#x2014;? I will then indicate the Cambridge Copy and the Brit. Mus. one; and so I hope shall forever have done with Wyatt.&#x2014; Please also to tell me whether your right title is &#x201C;Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi>,&#x201C; or what I put on these Letters? The other night I spoke of you with Blakesley, a predecessor of yours,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Joseph Williams Blakesley (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2592"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), vicar of Ware and future dean of Lincoln; former fellow and tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>. Edleston replied, <date when="1849-04-03">3 April</date>: &#x201C;I put off the &#x2018;Esq&#x2019; at Ely about 22 months since,&#x201C; that is, at the time of his ordination to the diaconate.</note> but neglected to inquire into this point.</p>
<p>The remaining Cambridge, and I think now all other articles, important or the contrary, are once more packed into their places in that sorrowful Book; and I now feel as if I might wash my hands again.</p>

<p>No news at all today, and no Letter at all,&#x2014;unless we reckon Robson&#x2019;s long-delayed <hi rend="italic">Proofsheet</hi> a Letter.

No other <hi rend="italic">work</hi> done; alas, hardly any!&#x2014;</p>
<p>How did you do for rain yesterday, poor little soul? It began to be very heavy when Clough and I went out: I shook off Clough at the L<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Library, and took shelter. A not very entertaining man.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1849-01-00">Jan.</date>, after protracted negotiations, Clough accepted, with misgivings, appointment as principal of University Hall, London, beginning in <date when="1849-10-00">Oct.</date> For the first three months of the year he based himself at his mother&#x2019;s home in Liverpool and was often in Manchester, where he called on the Jewsburys and Espinasse. Clough was apprehensive about settling in London. His sister, Anne, who was attending a teachers&#x2019; training school in London, wrote in her journal: &#x201C;People seem very fond of Arthur &#x2026; , but Arthur does not seem to mind much about people here; they don&#x2019;t seem to suit him exactly. &#x2026; He does not appear at all to fancy coming to live in London. He says he prefers the North, and if he had a hundred a year, he would live in Liverpool with us&#x201C; (B. A. Clough, <hi rend="italic">A Memoir of Anne Jemima Clough</hi> [<date when="1903-00-00">1903</date>] 73). Espinasse says that &#x201C;the state of painful transition both of mind and circumstances, in which he then found himself, predisposed him to even more than his constitutional taciturnity&#x201C; (363).</note> Froude,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Anthony Froude (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1894-00-00">94</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10202"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), historian, biographer, and man of letters; educ. at Westminster and Oriel College, Oxford; B.A., <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; fellow of Exeter College, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; wrote a life of St. Neot for J. H. Newman&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Lives of the English Saints</hi> (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>). Like many of his Oxford companions, he was strongly influenced by reading TC, finding that &#x201C;I was no longer referred to books and distant centuries but to present facts and to the world in which I lived and breathed&#x201C; (autobiographical frag. in W. H. Dunn, <hi rend="italic">James Anthony Froude, A Biography</hi> [Oxford, <date when="1961-00-00">1961</date>] 1:72). Although he had taken deacon&#x2019;s orders in the Church of England on accepting his fellowship, he began to question his faith. He was influenced by Emerson on his Oxford visit at Clough&#x2019;s invitation, <date when="1848-04-00">April 1848</date>, and in Clough&#x2019;s company he attended one of Emerson&#x2019;s lectures in London, where he first saw TC. He had also heard much of TC through his cousin James Spedding (Froude&#x2019;s mother was b. Margaret Spedding) and through Clough, but did not meet him till <date when="1849-06-00">June</date>. This is TC&#x2019;s first mention of Froude.</note> he tells me, is now with young Kingsley;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He was visiting Charles Kingsley at Ilfracombe, Devonshire, and here met Mrs. Kingsley&#x2019;s sister, Charlotte Maria Grenfell (d. <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), whom he was to marry in <date when="1849-10-00">Oct.</date> Clough had been friendly with Froude at Oxford and had also resigned his fellowship, a few months earlier, for similar reasons. TC refers to Kingsley as &#x201C;young Kingsley&#x201C; to distinguish him from his father, Charles (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>), the Carlyles&#x2019; neighbor and rector of St. Luke&#x2019;s, Chelsea.</note>&#x2014;has &#xa3;100 a-year, father an Archdeacon of <pb id="pg-24-7" n="24:7"/>something, with landed property for his <hi rend="italic">eldest</hi> son;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Hurrell Froude (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), archdeacon of Totness, <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>.

The famine had not created but exposed the realities of the Irish problem. What was wrong, he argued, was the defective social and economic structure of the Irish nation: impoverished laborers, struggling small landholders, and debt-ridden, inefficient estates. A few good harvest years would only distract attention from the causes of Ireland&#x2019;s ills. What was needed, in addition to govt. supervision of poor law unions and support for public works and emigration, was improvement of landed estates and a shift from subsistence farming to large-scale agriculture. A govt. commission could take over insolvent estates, arrange for more efficient management, and possibly be the instrument for transferring property from one class of proprietors to another. In conclusion, he stated that Parliament ought to act because a sick Ireland affected the health of all Britain (N.

<p><salute>Upon <hi rend="italic">my</hi> honour, dearest Babbie,</salute> I am afraid you are growing into a&#x2014;Unitarian!&#x2014; You heap coals of fire on my head<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rom. 12:20.</note> with such an air of unconscious amiability!&#x2014;not that <hi rend="italic">unconsciousness</hi> of all things is a distinctive feature of Unitarianism but the <hi rend="italic">amiability!</hi>&#x2014;it is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than Christian this writing away&#x2014;all the same as if your letters got duly answered&#x2014; Well! you do quite right&#x2014;it is the only way of touching me in certain periods of devil-possessedness&#x2014;in which periods, by the way, the most striking symptom is a horror at letter-writing, similar to the horror mad-dogs conceive at water&#x2014; You might have sulked at me in silence a good while yet, or you might have written me several letters of&#x2014;</p>
<p>There&#x2019;s a fine go! The above was written at Chelsea three days ago&#x2014; I was interrupted by little Louis Blanc&#x2014;interruption followed interruption&#x2014;till here I am&#x2014;at Addiscombe&#x2014;for twenty four hours with my letter still just begun!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-9" n="24:9"/>This visit is one of the things that has been unsettling me&#x2014;it was to have come off a fortnight ago&#x2014;but Lady A fell ill&#x2014;or rather fell worse&#x2014;and could not move from London till the weather softened&#x2014; I am alone with her hitherto&#x2014; Lord A is in town and also M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;but the latter is asked to come on Thursday and will not fail, and we shall then stay, both, till Monday next.</p>
<p>It looks very sad here without Charles Buller&#x2014;everything reminds one of him&#x2014;there are two foolish strings of beads which he once brought to Lady A from some fair&#x2014;a red string and a blue one, hanging about the china candlesticks of a writing stand, that I could almost cry over&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x2014;! but Lady A has recovered entire composure on that subject&#x2014;speaks of him as unconcernedly as I do&#x2014; And his poor Mother is dead!&#x2014;better so&#x2014;her life was miserable and she died without pain&#x2014; I was with her the night of her death till within half an hour of her breathing her last&#x2014;but the scene was shocking for me in more ways than one&#x2014;and I could do no good by remaining as she was quite unconscious of my presence&#x2014;so I kissed her little cold hand and came away<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Amalie B&#xF6;lte wrote to Varnhagen, <date when="1849-03-19">19 March</date>, that JWC was with her during Mrs. Buller&#x2019;s last hours and that as she held Mrs. Buller&#x2019;s cold hand &#x201C;for a long time &#x2026; in mine&#x201C; she felt &#x201C;how dreadfully lonely I should be if Mrs. Carlyle were to go now too. Then I should have nobody! I have to confront this possibility &#x2018;en face.&#x2019;&#x201C; Then she recounts another bout of teasing with TC: &#x201C;Recently I have done all sorts of foolish things and even had fun with the solemn Carlyle. To tell you the truth, he has been really insufferable recently.&#x201C; After discussing the king of Prussia, &#x201C;he began asking me about German women, and when I explained to him very reasonably that the so-called emancipated women wanted equality before the law, he replied very charmingly: &#x2018;God bless me! First the women and next the dogs.&#x2019; You can imagine how I took that.&#x2014; Well I hoped to do better with the second point, and asked what a wife should do if her husband grows tired of her? &#x2018;That is her own fault,&#x2019; he said, &#x2018;why cannot she make herself agreeable?&#x2014; Well, she must patiently wait till he comes back to her and then behave better.&#x2019; Then he gave me his paradoxical idea about the beauty of obedience, that every woman should be pleased to find a wise man who would be glad to tell her what she should do and not do, until I grew quite wild; and laughing, but in all seriousness retorted that nothing in the world would bring me to allow any other will than my own to command me&#x2014;and that he could think himself fortunate that I was not his wife, because I would murder him for talking like that; it sounded like master and slave.&#x2014; After we had argued a lot, with me laughing a great deal, while he was very happy, he wanted to sing&#x2014;merciful heavens! If you had heard that!! Nothing but Scottish songs, it was desperate and I couldn&#x2019;t help laughing in his face, without mercy. &#x2026; Finally, despairing of satisfying my taste, he struck up a battle song, the most beautiful (he said) his people ever had, adding &#x2018;if that will not do for you, I have nothing more to offer.&#x2019; But there was so much that was laughable in the whole scene, that for me the evening was like the best theater, and his wife, who was watching us thoughtfully, remarked that she wished Thackeray had been there, to use us for a cartoon for &#x2018;Punch.&#x2019; But take his portrait, imagine him in his brightly coloured dressing-gown and a high cap, sitting in front of me solemnly erect like a Dalai-Lama, without moving a muscle, and it won&#x2019;t surprise you that both corners of the rogue&#x2019;s mouth were quivering.&#x201C; She adds that TC was at home only to Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;not even to John Carlyle&#x2014;so she felt honored that he did not flee from her own presence (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 67&#x2013;68, trans.).</note>&#x2014; That and other things put me on a tack of <pb id="pg-24-10" n="24:10"/>headachs&#x2014;which I cannot at all get out of&#x2014;perhaps the week here may break the spell&#x2014;</p>
<p>My new maid continues to give me great contentment&#x2014;she is far the most <hi rend="italic">loveable</hi> creature I ever had&#x2014;and a very fair servant&#x2014;not so good a cook as Anne&#x2014;but better than Helen<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anne Brown and Helen Mitchell.</note>&#x2014;and a more active housemaid then either&#x2014; I think she likes me already too well to dream of giving warning&#x2014;and I hope for a long term of peace again&#x2014;the nasty little beast<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Helen Mitchell.</note> got a place&#x2014;but how long she will keep it is the question! I never mean to set eyes on her again if I can help it&#x2014;or hold any communication with her.</p>
<p>Little Lewis came the other night with his little wife<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >G. H. and Agnes Lewes.</note>&#x2014;speaking gratefully of you all&#x2014;but it is Julia Paulet<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Da. of Elizabeth and &#xc9;tienne Paulet, whom, along with the Welshes, Lewes had met while lecturing in Liverpool in <date when="1849-02-00">Feb.</date></note> who has taken his soul captive!! he raves about her &#x201C;dark luxurious eyes&#x201C; and &#x201C;smooth firm flesh&#x201C;&#x2014;! his wife asked &#x201C;how did he know? had he been feeling it?&#x201C; In fact his wife seems rather contemptuous of his raptures about all the women he has fallen in love with on this journey, which is the best way of taking the thing&#x2014;when one <hi rend="italic">can</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I used to thing<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> these Lewises a perfect pair of love-birds always cuddling together on the same perch&#x2014;to speak figuratively&#x2014;but the female love-bird appears to have hopped off to some distance and to be now taking a somewhat critical view of her little shaggy mate&#x2014;! In the most honey-marriages one has only to <hi rend="italic">wait</hi>&#x2014;it is all a question of time&#x2014; Sooner or later &#x201C;reason resumes its empire&#x201C; as the phrase is Cultivate this new thought of writing off six lines at me whenever you have a movement that way&#x2014;</p>
<p>I hear her Ladyship gone down&#x2014;and must follow to tea&#x2014; God bless you&#x2014; This is as good as no letter tho&#x2019; long enough&#x2014;but I have not <hi rend="italic">settled down</hi> here yet&#x2014;indeed it is a while since I was settled down anywhere&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>I did not recollect till yesterday that on <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> shortly after noon I am to go out of Town, not to return till Monday. Let our meeting be on Friday, if any time that day will suit you failing that, on Monday or any following day.</p>
<p>With regard to the Fairfax Letters,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas Fairfax (<date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1671-00-00">71</date>), parliamentary gen.</note> at any rate, I intend decisively, such <pb id="pg-24-13" n="24:13"/>being your account of their importance, or rather of their <hi rend="italic">nihility</hi>, to spit them all, like pickled herrings on a rod, and hang them up to drip, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> commentary, at the end of the Appendix. Those and Donnadieu&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander (Alcide) Donnadieu (ca. <date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">1861</date>), b. in France; came to England, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>; worked as musician and singer, also sold autographs at 8 Duke St., Piccadilly.</note> and if it please Heaven, all the other Cromwell Letters (of no importance) that may turn up;&#x2014;my position otherwise threatens to become unpleasant. Equal to the Pillory or worse! But with an iron spit of the kind mentioned, which can be lengthened at will, a vast number of worthless bloaters may be strung up, and little harm done. So there is no haste about that part of our business; only moderate celerity required.</p>
<p>I am reading John Sterling&#x2019;s Letters; a strange and rather mournful occupation, too.&#x2014;Alfred,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson.</note> I think, has left his umbrella here; tell the oblivious Son of Apollo that comfortable truth.</p>
<p>Froude&#x2019;s Book<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. A. Froude, <hi rend="italic">The Nemesis of Faith</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), a novel in which Froude condemned much of the Old Testament and questioned much else. TC is mentioned in it as one of the chief influences on the hero&#x2019;s philosophy, though &#x201C;Carlyle! Carlyle only raises questions he cannot answer, and seems best contented if he can make the rest of us as discontented as himself&#x201C; (letter 5). Pbd. in <date when="1849-02-00">Feb.</date>, the novel scandalized orthodox Oxford. A copy was burnt before an audience in Exeter College Hall, <date when="1849-02-29">29 Feb.</date>, by the senior tutor William Sewell (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/25148"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390520-TC-JGL-01"><sic>11:104</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1839-05-20">20 May 1839</date></corr></ref>), and Froude was forced to resign his fellowship. In the second part the central character lapses into adultery and enters a monastery, thus offending liberals as well.</note> is not,&#x2014;except for wretched people, strangling in white neckcloths, and <foreign>Semitic thrums</foreign> [loose ends],&#x2014;worth its paper and ink. What on Earth is the use of a wretched mortal&#x2019;s vomiting up all his interior crudities, dubitations, and spiritual agonising belly-aches, into the view of the Public, and howling tragically, &#x201C;See!&#x201C; Let him, in the Devil&#x2019;s name, pass them, by the downward or other methods, in his own water-closet, and say nothing whatever! Epictetus&#x2019;s sheep, <hi rend="italic">intending</hi> at least to grow good wool,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently Forster reviewed the book in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1849-04-21">21 April</date>, making comments very like TC&#x2019;s: &#x201C;If a man finds his white neckcloth too narrow for him, let him remove it quietly, and then say why he has done so in such manner as may seem best to him. We cannot see what the public has to do with mere cries and shrieks of suffocation. &#x2026; We think it a book that should never have been written. It is &#x2026; the hardly articulate cry, as we have intimated, of a man strangling in a white neckcloth.&#x201C; He blames Oxford Puseyism for Froude&#x2019;s extreme reaction and expresses &#x201C;disgust at the doctrines and tendencies of the school of Dr. Pusey.&#x201C;</note> was a gentleman in comparison.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus (<date>1st cent. <hi rend="small-caps">a.d.</hi></date>) held that the good man will be driven like sheep, suffer stripes and indignities of all sorts, but will endure them without anger and in silence.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Well; shall it be Friday, Monday, or when?</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This is your American post-day; so I will write you a few words, tho&#x2019; I am in too great a haste for writing to the purpose, being just upon a small journey into the Country, and my time very limited. Your Letter came to me about three weeks ago; and gave us all, as you may suppose, real satisfaction. We were delighted with the account of your new purchase;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of 78 acres of farmland adjacent to his main farm, Bield.</note> and took it as a symptom that you were spreading your <hi rend="italic">roots</hi> in that new country, and seeing in it some of the comforts of a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> after all your sore battlings. A &#x201C;home,&#x201C; alas, in the old <hi rend="italic">boyish</hi> sense of the word we shall, none of us, ever find more in this world: poor old Mainhill, Ecclefechan and Annandale<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See vols. 1&#x2013;4.</note> are to me, when I do see them again, like a land of ghosts, so inexpressibly sad that I rather avoid than seek the sight of them; and feel that &#x201C;one&#x2019;s father&#x2019;s house in young days&#x201C; is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> &#x201C;home&#x201C; a human creature can look for under this sun! But what then? We are not to spend our time in grieving; we are to shake weak sorrows and regrets away from us, and do man-fully some good work for ourselves and others while time continues for us here. I rejoice much in the prospect for you of a grave earnest course of industry in your new field of labour; and can anticipate for you such serious profitable satisfactions, with your children growing up round you, and the fruits of your labour prospering in your hand, as are fit for a good man in this world. O my dear Brother, how thankful should we be that this, in any form, is granted us! Our young days are now far behind us; but the memory of them is sweet and sacred: we will struggle on, courageously yet to the end; and know well that no <hi rend="italic">good</hi> thing we can do will be lost to us or to any that relate themselves to us.&#x2014; The Dr,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle.</note> I suppose, did not fail to tell you how contented we were with this new purchase; and how entirely we declined having any part of the money back. I suppose he told you what arrangements to make on that head; so I need say no more of it just now.</p>
<p>We had good news from Scotland and Scotsbrig about a week ago: our Mother, they say, continues <hi rend="italic">unusually</hi> well all this winter; is spinning &#x26;c: good old Mother! It appears Jamie complains somewhat; and is in a weakly way owing to some kind of <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi> trouble: but this is a kind of troubles we are all pretty familiar with; and, in his particular case, as it necessitates him to greater regularity of life, and is not for the present dangerous, it is <pb id="pg-24-16" n="24:16"/>perhaps not without even some <hi rend="italic">advantage</hi>,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; an &#x201C;advantage&#x201C; not purchased for nothing. The rest, so far as we hear, are all well; and he, and they all, seem to be prospering very tolerably in their affairs.</p>
<p>Jack got his <hi rend="italic">Translation</hi> done several months ago, and <hi rend="italic">well</hi> done, which is still more. It has been very well received, acknowledged everywhere as a piece of real and faithful <hi rend="italic">work;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1849-03-10">10 March</date>, for example, said of it: &#x201C;Every serious attempt to render Dante more intelligible is worthy of respect,&#x2014;and no attempt has yet been made which can rival the present by Dr. Carlyle.&#x201C; John Carlyle had sent a copy of the book to Sir Robert Peel with a letter expressing his admiration of Peel. Peel replied and John Carlyle wrote once again, <date when="1849-04-07">7 April</date>, to say that he had &#x201C;sent the little book in token of real respect&#x201C; and to congratulate Peel &#x201C;upon your recent declarations in regard to Ireland&#x201C; (Brit. Lib. 40,600.553 and 40,601.158; Peel&#x2019;s letter not found). Clough wrote to a friend, <date when="1849-02-20">20 Feb.</date>: &#x201C;I am reading the Inferno with John Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, which seems good, and is certainly useful to me&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Arthur Hugh Clough</hi>, ed. M. Mulhauser [<date when="1957-00-00">1957</date>] 1:245).</note> and has indeed fully realised or exceeded all the expectations one could form about it. Perhaps by and by some <hi rend="italic">money</hi> even may be realised; but however that may be, I could say to myself confidently enough from the first examination of the thing, &#x201C;Very <hi rend="italic">well!</hi> This is rightly done, and is a work that will keep its value for a long time to come, with all that are fit to judge it!&#x201C;&#x2014; The poor Doctor has himself got great comfort, great improvement from it; and tho&#x2019; still a rather <hi rend="italic">fidgety</hi> character, has acquired more composure and dignity of deportment than he ever had before. He is very <hi rend="italic">grey</hi>, indeed looks considerably older than I do (who am beginning also to be grey, and to look like my years): nevertheless he is very lively, one might say cheerful and happy; and has very much more of light-heartedness and joyfulness in his composition than any one of us. There are yet two other Parts of <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, of about the same size as this first one; these also I suppose he silently calculates on doing; but is in no haste about it, till he grow at a <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> for employment, or see some definite <hi rend="italic">cash</hi> come out of the first.</p>
<p>I myself am not quite idle; but sore beset with the usual confusions; and by much struggling, realise an astonishingly small visibility of result! I have many things to say about the astounding revolutionary time we have got into; but find an almost impossibility of discovering the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> to say them! I hope I shall <hi rend="italic">get</hi> them said, before I go out of this world: I seem to have little other business to continue there. Jane is pretty well and has been; she is out on a little visit 10 miles off whither I am to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> today&#x2014;immediately. God&#x2019;s blessing be on you and yours, dear Brother. I will write again before long; and send you more minute news. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Mrs Macready,</salute>
<p>There is nothing so judicious to be done as what you propose: pray do it, therefore; and, unless this Donnadieu <hi rend="italic">volunteer</hi> to send me some Cromwell Letter which I have not, let the affair drop at this point.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I have read Sir George&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Speech;</hi> and have this day returned it to him, with a little Note expressing the satisfaction I had enjoyed from it: this, <pb id="pg-24-19" n="24:19"/>which was the briefest method, you had intimated, would also be the agreeable one to that worthy Gentleman.</p>
<p>I hope you and he, and others of patriotic mind in Scotland, may soon accomplish something towards settlement of that huge Pauper question there; which truly is at present, like much else in Scotland, in a frightful predicament. I can remember when there needed no Poor-Law for Scotland; when there was properly no &#x201C;Pauper&#x201C; in it,&#x2014;and the two or three poor destitute persons in a parish, known to all neighbours, and calling forth the pity and thrifty judicious <hi rend="italic">charity</hi> of all, were in reality a blessing and possession to the community. But that was before Steamers had swamped us under floods of ragged Irish savages;&#x2014;before Scotland&#x2019;s sons had quite renounced the faiths and heroisms of their Fathers, and taken to singing either &#x201C;Praise to Whisky,&#x201C; or else &#x201C;Glory to <hi rend="italic">Mammon</hi> in the highest.&#x201C;&#x2014; They will have to give up <hi rend="italic">both</hi> these Devil&#x2019;s-Gospels, in some measure, before long; or else <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to the Devil, not <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> only, but body and breeches-pocket and all!</p>
<p>I am much obliged by your regard for me; and heartily wish you good-speed in lifting up your testimony against an evil time. Every man, by act and by word, should testify against it; and will, if he is a good man, wherever strength and opportunity is given him. <closer><salute>I remain always Yours very sincerely</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My poor little Woman!</salute>
<p>I can quite understand your inclination &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">scream</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;I have the same feeling myself very often&#x2014;a notion to <hi rend="italic">scream</hi> for four and twenty hours without stopping!&#x2014;not over the treachery of one good for nothing Tizzy but over the treachery of the species generally&#x2014;and indeed over what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle calls &#x201C;the whole infernal caudle of things&#x201C;! What <hi rend="italic">I</hi> object to you is not so much what I call your <hi rend="italic">indiscretion</hi> as a certain <hi rend="italic">heedlessness of judgement</hi>&#x2014;thro&#x2019; which you fly at helping everybody in every difficulty, without having first satisfied yourself, that the difficulty <hi rend="italic">is soluble</hi>, or the person <hi rend="italic">capable of having it solved</hi>&#x2014;for you know the proverb? &#x201C;one man may take a horse to water but twenty cannot make it drink&#x201C;! And when one <pb id="pg-24-20" n="24:20"/>tries to lead a girl without truth or affection like Tizzy by noble ways to noble aims it is a labour which a little consideration of the laws of nature might have spared one&#x2014; all the trouble you take for an <hi rend="italic">unhelpable</hi> person is so much out of the packet of some other who <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been helped&#x2014; But you have heard enough of Tizzy for the present I should think&#x2014; I shall merely add that I have taken upon me to send those letters of hers to Lady Ashburton&#x2014;(desiring to have them back) that she might see how little the correspondence was of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> seeking&#x2014;and how detestably the girl had behaved to you&#x2014; They (her guardians) talked much of their <hi rend="italic">determination</hi> to put an end to your &#x201C;interference&#x201C; with her&#x2014;I said the girl had done that <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> I should suppose, when she carried your letter to Capt R.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robinson.</note> and declared she would &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">order</hi> you to write to <hi rend="small-caps">her</hi> (!) no more in such a foolish strain&#x201C;&#x2014;that if you found her <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> interferely <hi rend="italic">with after that</hi> you must be fit for bedlam! Capt R was going to write to you they said&#x2014;whoever writes to you, and whatever they say; I advise you to hold your peace altogether&#x2014;if permissable&#x2014;and if you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> answer something; to make your words as few and cold and impassive as you can&#x2014;</p>
<p>I did something after <hi rend="italic">your</hi> energetic fashion last night; Miss Heerman<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> came to me at seven, to say she must decide about the other situation today&#x2014;I liked her appearance and manner very much and so did M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle&#x2014; So rather than let her slip thro&#x2019; their fingers, I put on my things tired as I was with my journey and <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> off with<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> thro the dark lanes to Countess Pepoli at Kensington&#x2014; She (the Countess) was in a great quandary of indecision but promised to settle the matter in the morning&#x2014;and she did&#x2014;at eleven she came here, having first been to Miss Heerman; to tell me she had engaged her&#x2014; I hope it will answer on both sides&#x2014; I wish Capt S<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sterling.</note> had got <hi rend="italic">her</hi>&#x2014;he thinks his fat lump sadly ignorant&#x2014;</p>
<p>The habit-shirt is &#x2018;a great hit&#x2019;!&#x2014;the very sort of thing I have wanted for long&#x2014;something that would cover my neck which looks very bad at this date, and at the same time not give me the appearance of having a sore throat&#x2014;thank you heartily for your pains&#x2014;</p>
<p>My maid was so glad to get me back and had every thing so clean!&#x2014;a real jewel she is!&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> too I have to thank you every day&#x2014; <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="small-caps">i</hi></hi> you see am one of <hi rend="italic">the helpable</hi> so you had better stick to helping <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in my various needs&#x2014; I will go to see you some morning, if the weather mend <hi rend="italic">before</hi> Sunday</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I meant to have written you before now; but, as usual, too many things came always in the way, and cut me short! It is very silly to be driven from one&#x2019;s purpose in this foolish way: I must really learn to do better,&#x2014;in the matter of writing to my Mother, if in no other!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-22" n="24:22"/>We have in general been well here, since you heard last; Jane, the other night, had a very bad headache, which kept her extremely miserable from afternoon till towards bed-time; but it went away at last, and only left her weak and much &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">brashed</hi></foreign>&#x201C; for a day or two after. John came over to us, so soon as he heard of the business, about 8 o&#x2019;clock, and was very kind and helpful indeed; which was a real favour: kindness, indeed, and sympathy, is nearly all one can do for the poor Dame in those afflictions of hers.</p>
<p>Last week she was out at Addiscombe, keeping what they call the &#x201C;Easter holidays&#x201C; here; she staid a week, I came for the last 3 days; we returned on Monday last: I had a beautiful <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> (ten miles, of the brightest Friday) the day I went out there; one nice ride too, with the new Lord Ashburton; for the rest, did not <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> very well in their grand rooms;&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">di tha&#x2019; neither ill na&#x2019; guid!</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>They are busy printing Cromwell, as before; I try again to write something <hi rend="italic">else</hi>, but with little effect hitherto! I must, if possible, go on <hi rend="italic">trying.</hi> In the Spectator of this evening (which you will get with the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>) is an article by me <hi rend="italic">on Ireland and Sir R</hi>t <hi rend="italic">Peel;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ireland and Sir Robert Peel,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1849-04-14">14 April</date>. Referring to Peel&#x2019;s speeches, <date when="1849-03-05">5</date> and <date when="1849-03-30">30 March</date>, TC said: &#x201C;[A]s a foreshadow of coming facts for Ireland, these words, of such a man, are of moment to every British citizen; and to the considerable class of British citizens who, this long while past, look with despair on the red-tape doctrines and imbecile performances alone prevalent in official quarters as to this affair, they come like a prophecy of better things, inexpressibly cheering. / For it is a fact, however little it may be surmised in Downing Street at present, that a new condition of affairs has arrived for Ireland and us. &#x2026; The condition of Ireland &#x2026; is frightful. &#x2026; It is in fact <hi rend="italic">our</hi> English share of that &#x2018;General Bankruptcy of Imposture,&#x2019; which the events of the last year all over Europe have very loudly announced. &#x2026; What the fall of Louis Philippe, and the street-barricades of Paris, have been to Europe, the ruin of the potato has been to us. Frightful enough; yet not without some consolatory features. If &#x2018;Imposture,&#x2019; official routine, grimace, red-tape, and Parliamentary-eloquence, were really <hi rend="italic">insolvent</hi>,&#x2014;unable to perform the task of guiding men, and able only to perform the scandalous make-believe of it,&#x2014;the sooner that fact was rendered public, and put into the gazette, it will be the better and not the worse for all parties!&#x201C; The essay has not been reprinted, except by John Childs (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490419-TC-JCHI-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCHI</corr>, <date when="1849-04-19">19 April</date></ref>).</note>&#x2014;very fierce upon poor little Lord John Russel; of whom, in truth, I am wearying much, in these times. From Peel I still hope a beginning of real improvement for Ireland; and it seemed to me I was <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> to write this word. So there you have it.&#x2014; I send <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> this day; but it is possible you may not get <hi rend="italic">it</hi> either till monday.</p>
<p>The people are about setting up a Statue or memorial to Oliver Cromwell;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A committee was formed at St. Ives for the purpose.</note> are writing in the Newspapers, holding meetings &#x26;c; but do not seem to know well what will come of it yet. As for &#x201C;Memorials,&#x201C; the people having subscribed a &#xa3;25,000 one to an ugly bullock of a Hudson, who did not even pretend to have any merit except that of being suddenly rich, and who is now suddenly discovered to be little other than at heart a <hi rend="italic">horse-couper</hi> <pb id="pg-24-23" n="24:23"/>and dishonest fellow,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Because of public speculation in railway shares and his own questionable business transactions, George Hudson, the &#x201C;Railway King,&#x201C; was forced between <date when="1849-02-28">28 Feb.</date> and <date when="1849-05-17">17 May</date> to resign his chairmanship in various railway companies. Investigation showed that Hudson was personally indebted to these companies&#x2014;debts that he admitted and promised to pay off. On Hudson&#x2019;s statue, see <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi> 20:254&#x2013;92, where the opening paragraphs echo TC&#x2019;s comments here on Cromwell and Hudson. A horse-couper is a horse dealer.</note>&#x2014; I think they ought to leave Cromwell <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> of their &#x201C;memorials,&#x201C; and try to honour him in some more profitable way. By learning to be honest men like him, for example!&#x2014; But we shall see what comes of all this Cromwell work;&#x2014;a thing not quite without value either. A man wrote to me last night from &#x201C;St. Ives&#x201C; (where Oliver once lived) a queer letter on the subject, which I have not yet answered.</p>
<p>Mrs Anthony Sterling is again out of her wits, poor woman; her Mother<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Baird.</note> has come, who is an idle galloping fashionable woman (I understand) hardly <hi rend="italic">with</hi> much wits to get out of. Poor Anthony, who runs (twice a week or so) between his country place and his town one where his Wife now is, feels naturally extremely miserable; but he strictly holds his tongue about it, smothers it down within him;&#x2014;he is a fiery little stump of a man, very brave and generous, not very reasonable or sufficiently patient always; and often brings me in mind of my Brother Alick.&#x2014; Poor Alick, he is doing better now, let us be thankful to see! I wrote him a word last Friday (yesterday week, before setting off for Addiscombe); Jack too wrote then.</p>
<p>My dear Mother, what a wretched <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> is this for so dear a Mother as you are to me! &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">plans</hi> of mice and men,&#x201C;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;To a Mouse.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;alas, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are not the thing that is got executed!&#x2014; But you are very good always, and take the will for the deed. Thank Isabella very much; bid her write again. Tell Jamie the <hi rend="italic">Ham</hi> (daily yielding to fate) is unsurpassable. <closer><salute>My heart&#x2019;s blessing with you all!</salute></closer></p>

Blackie wrote: &#x201C;Thomas Carlyle is really a notable monster, and to be respected for the many noble thoughts he has elaborated and for the words of wisdom which he has flung abroad to bear divine fruit among foolish-hearted men; but I can&#x2019;t help thinking, face to face in a small parlour he is rather terrible, and I fancy prophets are best exhibited in the pulpit, or in the wilderness. A few grand moral instincts burn so intensely in the hearts of these men that they have no room for anything else: they rush out from the smoking sanctuary with a flaming sword in their hand, and whoever follows them not and fights is accounted a heretic. Scottish and English Universities, British Houses of Parliament, orthodox theologies, railroads, and free trade, were all shaken out and sifted under the category of Sham; while Oliver Cromwell and his Ironsides, and the old Covenanters who sang psalms and handled pikes on Dunse Moor, were held up to admiration as the only heroes in this country for the last two hundred years&#x201C; (Stoddart 1:241&#x2013;42).</sourceNote><head>

For what we wanted was not learned battlement about Greek Heroes and Myths, but wise speech, melodious by its depth and truth about British Heroes and Facts;&#x2014;good Heavens! it is strange that men ever could have forgotten this! However, we do expect now, as I say, a kind of real Heathen Greek Bible (or set of select small books we can read) from our expensive Professors of Classicality,&#x2014;terribly expensive if we compute <hi rend="italic">all</hi> they have cost us!&#x2014;and for this object I think they will never get a better model than the Divine Hebrew Bible, and the singularly successful method hit upon for &#x201C;translating&#x201C; this&#x2014;for carrying this over to us and making it ours.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC had recorded similar thoughts in his Journal, <date when="1848-03-07">7 March 1848</date>: &#x201C;How the ancient mythologies (religions) were merely religious readings of the Histories of Antiquity,&#x2014; genial apprehensions and genial (that is always, <hi rend="italic">divine</hi>) representations of the Events of earthly Life,&#x2014;such as occur yet, only that we have no &#x2018;geniality&#x2019; to take them up, nothing but stupidity to take them up with!

<p>In the Birmingham newspaper, some ten days ago,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> a blazing article was <pb id="pg-24-25" n="24:25"/>sent me about a general &#x201C;People&#x2019;s Statue&#x201C; for Oliver, to be set up at London, Huntingdon, or, failing both these, at St. Ives, or in Naseby Field. Some considerable notion, I find otherwise, has gone abroad of commemorating Cromwell in the public statue way. To all which I have hitherto made little answer or none at all.</p>
<p>My private suspicion I confess is that the present generation of Englishmen&#x2014;who have filled their towns with such a set of &#x201C;public statues&#x201C; as were never before erected by any people, ugly brazen images (to mere commonplace adventurers with titles on them, and even sometimes to mere paltry scoundrels, worthy of immediate <hi rend="italic">oblivion</hi> only), and who have winded up their enterprises in the statue or memorial line by subscribing &#xa3;25,000 to a memorial for King Hudson&#x2014;are not likely to do themselves or anybody much good by setting up statues to Oliver Cromwell. I fear they have forfeited the right to remember Cromwell in a public manner. Cromwell&#x2019;s divine memory, sad, stern and earnest as the gods, says virtually to them &#x201C;Forget me and pass on, ye unhappy <hi rend="italic">Canaille</hi>&#x2014;carry your offerings to King Hudson and strive to emulate him!&#x201C; Nevertheless I have privately resolved, if such a thing do go on, to subscribe my little mite to it on occasion, and to wish privately that it may prosper much better than I can with any assurance hope. I think it will be very difficult to avoid the introduction of such an ocean of flummery and mere idle balderdash into the affair (if the public are fairly awoken to it) as will be very distressing to any one who feels how a Cromwell ought to be honoured by the nation that produced him.</p>
<p>With regard to you and your townsmen, however, I perceive that, so far, you have sure ground to stand upon; ground that is sure, and will carry such an enterprise in all times, even in the Hudson, Dundas, and Brazen Duke of York times.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the monuments to Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville (<date when="1742-00-00">1742</date>&#x2013;<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>), Scottish statesman, a fluted column 150 ft. high supporting his statue, in St. Andrews Sq., Edinburgh; and to Frederick, Duke of York (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>), second son of King George III and commander-in-chief of the British army, a column 124 ft. high surmounted by his bronze statue, in Waterloo Pl., London.</note> St. Ives wishes to claim authentically for itself the honour of having once been Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s place of abode,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From <date when="1631-00-00">1631</date> to <date when="1636-00-00">1636</date>.</note> an honour that is likely to last it, and be its most peculiar one for a thousand years to come.</p>
<p>Proper, good every way, and right on the part of St. Ives: while you keep within these limits, the soul of Oliver himself, if he looked down upon you, could not disapprove. Not to do Cromwell honour&#x2014;that, owing to Hudson, etc., we unfortunately cannot at present pretend to try; not to do him honour, but to claim publicly our own property in him, and do honour to <pb id="pg-24-26" n="24:26"/>ourselves and our town&#x2014;that we can pretend to, and will! So far I say your enterprise is founded on the rock; and however much further it may go, I think you should take care to maintain that particular foundation, and let nothing shift you from it. Namely, that your enterprise is to point out Oliver Cromwell&#x2019;s indisputable connexion with you, and to claim this publicly, and assert it in brass or stone for the coming ages and all persons that may forget or do not know it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A statue of Cromwell was not erected in St. Ives till <date when="1901-00-00">1901</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Hunts County News</hi> report continues: &#x201C;Carlyle ended by recommending the market-place of St. Ives as the most suitable spot for the erection of the proposed memorial.&#x201C; TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1849-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x201C;Write a little; but it is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for nothing, it has to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> at last. &#x2018;Hudson&#x2019;s Statue&#x2019; (or rather Oliver&#x2019;s Statue, now proposed for St. Ives): have blotched some words, or mumblements rather, upon that.&#x201C;</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your little <hi rend="italic">Tract:</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ireland and Sir Robert Peel,&#x201C; TC&#x2019;s article, <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1849-04-14">14 April</date>, rptd. by Childs as a broadsheet; see Tarr 119&#x2013;20.</note> it is very cleverly managed; and will do no ill,&#x2014;perhaps a little good, if it can accelerate the <hi rend="italic">launch</hi> of little Lord John<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Russell.</note> into that &#x201C;Sea of Oblivion,&#x201C; towards which I see him sliding now pretty fast. By all methods the timbers ought to be soaped!&#x2014;</p>
<p>By the bye, there were two Papers on Ireland last year; or rather there was first one Paper (in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>), and then a second Paper (which, owing to Whig connexions of Editors &#x26;c, had to be <hi rend="italic">divided</hi> into three pieces, and came out in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> partly, and partly in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> of the same day):<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> appeared &#x201C;Repeal of the Union,&#x201C; <date when="1849-04-29">29 April</date>, and &#x201C;Legislation for Ireland,&#x201C; <date when="1849-05-13">13 May;</date> in the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, <date when="1848-05-13">13 May 1848</date>, appeared both &#x201C;Ireland and the British Chief Governor&#x201C; and &#x201C;Irish Regiments (of the New &#xc6;ra).&#x201C; Childs was to print as pamphlets <hi rend="italic">Legislation for Ireland</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ireland and the British Chief Governor</hi> later in the month.</note> the first of these Papers is obsolete; but the second, I imagine, is still rather <hi rend="italic">new</hi>, some of it even to Sir Rob<hi rend="italic">t</hi> himself,&#x2014;and might do a great deal of good if the purport of it were once <hi rend="italic">universally</hi> laid to Heart; which, alas, it will not be, this long while! For I consider the Irish Paupers, and indeed all &#x201C;Paupers,&#x201C; to be intrinsically by Nature&#x2019;s Act of Parliament (whatever Exeter Hall may say to it), reduced to the condition of <hi rend="italic">slaves</hi>, of Servants vitally needing some <hi rend="italic">Master</hi> wiser than they;&#x2014;and I believe we shall never, in this world or the next, get to the bottom of the &#x201C;Pauper question&#x201C; till we admit that fact!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am very glad Fitzgerald made out his visit, which he has long contemplated.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >FitzGerald visited him in connection with the forthcoming <hi rend="italic">Selections from the Poems and Letters of Bernard Barton</hi>, ed. Lucy Barton, but prepared by FitzGerald, who wrote the introductory memoir; see Terhune, <hi rend="italic">LEF</hi> 1:634, 632. Childs was to become FitzGerald&#x2019;s printer.</note> I always have a project too of seeing Suffolk again; and shall certainly accomplish Bungay, if I come within wind of it.</p>

<salute>My dear Emerson,</salute>
<p>Today is American Postday; and by every rule and law,&#x2014;even if all laws but those of Cocker were abolished from this universe,&#x2014;a word from me is due to you! Twice I have heard since I spoke last: prompt response about the Philadelphia Bill;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490206-TC-LOA-01">TC to <sic>Lord A</sic><corr>LOA</corr>, <date when="1849-02-06">6 Feb.</date></ref></note> exact performance of your voluntary promise,&#x2014;Indian Corn itself is now here for a week past.</p>
<p>Lord Ashburton has recovered his money; so he tells me, on inquiry, the other day; many thanks to you and the Pennsilvanian friends;&#x2014;Furness<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. H. Furness had asked in person the publishers Carey &#x26; Hart.</note> in particular has had his hands full with that business; of which, let us hope, he has now heard the last. Still more interesting is the barrel of genuine Corn ears, &#x26; Indian Cobs of edible grain, from the Barn of Emerson himself! It came all safe and right, according to your charitable program; without cost or trouble to us of any kind; not without curious interest and satisfaction! The recipes contained in the precedent Letter,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Lydia Emerson.</note> duly weighed by the competent jury of housewives (at least by my own Wife and Lady Ashburton), were judged to be of decided promise, reasonable-looking every one of them; and now that the stuff itself is come, I am happy to assure you that it forms a new epoch for us all in the Maize department: we find the grain <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi>, among the sweetest, with a touch even of the taste of <hi rend="italic">nuts</hi> in it, and profess with contrition that properly we have never tasted Indian Corn before. Millers, of due faculty (with Millstones of <hi rend="italic">iron</hi>), being scarce in the Cockney region, and even cooks liable to err, the Ashburtons have on their resources undertaken the brunt of the problem: one of their own Surrey or Hampshire Millers is to grind the stuff, and their own Cook, a Frenchman commander of a whole squadron, is to undertake the dressing according to the rules. Yesterday the Barrel went off to their country place in Surrey,&#x2014;a small Bag of select ears being retained here, for our own private experimenting;&#x2014;and so by and by we shall see what comes of it.&#x2014; I on my side have already drawn up a fit proclamation of the excellencies of this invaluable corn, and admonitions as to the benighted state of English eaters in regard to it;&#x2014;to appear in Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine, or I know not where, very soon.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Indian Meal,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> 39 (<date when="1849-05-00">May 1849</date>):561&#x2013;63.</note> It is really a small contribution towards World-History, this small act of yours and ours: there is no doubt to me, now that I taste the real grain, but all Europe will henceforth have to relie more and <pb id="pg-24-29" n="24:29"/>more upon your western vallies and this article. How beautiful to think of lean tough Yankee settlers, tough as gutta-percha, with most <hi rend="italic">occult</hi> unsubduable fire in their belly, steering over the western mountains, to annihilate the jungle, and bring bacon and corn out of it for the Posterity of Adam! The Pigs, in about a year, eat up all the rattle-snakes for miles round: a most judicious function on the part of the Pigs. Behind the Pigs comes Jonathan with his all-conquering ploughshare,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jonathan Ploughboy, a popular Yankee character&#x2014;shrewd and homely&#x2014;of the early American stage.</note>&#x2014;glory to him too! Oh, if we were not a set of Cant-ridden blockheads, there is no <hi rend="italic">Myth</hi> of Athena or Herakles equal to this <hi rend="italic">fact;</hi>&#x2014;which I suppose <hi rend="italic">will</hi> find its real &#x201C;Poets&#x201C; some day or other; when once the Greek, Semitic and multifarious other Cobwebs are swept away a little! Well, we must wait.&#x2014; For the rest, if this skilful Naturalist and you will make any more experiments on Indian Corn for us, might I not ask that you would try for a method of preserving <hi rend="italic">the meal</hi> in a sound state for us? Oatmeal, which would spoil directly too, is preserved all year by kiln-drying the grain before it is ground,&#x2014;parching it till it is almost <hi rend="italic">brown</hi>, sometimes: the Scotch Highlanders, by intense parching, can keep their oatmeal good for a series of years. No miller here at present is likely to produce such beautiful meal as some of the American specimens I have seen:&#x2014;if possible, we must learn to get the grain over in the shape of proper durable <hi rend="italic">meal.</hi> At all events, let your Friend charitably make some inquiry into the process of millerage, the possibilities of it for meeting our case;&#x2014;and send us the result some day, on a separate bit of paper. With which let us end, for the present.</p>
<p>Alas, I have yet written nothing; am yet a long way off writing, I fear! Not for want of matter, perhaps, but for redundance of it; I feel as if I had the whole world to write yet, with the day fast bending downwards on me, and didn&#x2019;t know where to begin,&#x2014;in what manner to address the deep-sunk populations of the Theban Land.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thebans were proverbially seen as sluggish and lazy.</note> Any way my Life is very <hi rend="italic">grim</hi>, on these terms, and is like to be; God only knows what farther quantity of braying in the mortar this foolish clay of mine may yet need!&#x2014; They are printing a 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition of Cromwell; that bothered me for some weeks, but now I am over with that, and the Printer wholly has it: a sorrowful, not now or ever a joyful thing to me, that.

Maurice wrote to Kingsley of Sterling as a dead friend whom &#x201C;one hardly likes to speak of to those one knows and loves best&#x201C;: that Sterling &#x201C;should be the subject of ribald jests in the religious newspapers &#x2026; is very painful. The Sterling Club had really nothing to do with him. &#x2026; Now [<date when="1849-03-28">28 March</date>] it has become a theological question&#x201C; (F. Maurice, <hi rend="italic">The Life of F.

It is very amusing that those people who take such care to guard their orthodoxy get nothing by it but to be more bitterly attacked.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is an Irish Paper<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> with that <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> Article in it; I wish, when you have looked at it, you would send it on to Jean at Dumfries, who probably has not heard of it, and might like to see it. This morning, too, I receive the enclosed <hi rend="italic">Tract</hi> or Handbill, which a certain energetic Printer in Suffolk, a fierce Radical and very honest sort of man, has made out of the Article, for purposes of general circulation!&#x2014; So that there is reception enough for that bit of Speech: indeed Lord Johnny, I perceive, is not far from <hi rend="italic">ripe</hi>, and a few <hi rend="italic">shakes</hi> more, from the bystanders, will make him <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> from his high tree.&#x2014; By the way, if Isabella like better, she may send <hi rend="italic">the Handbill</hi> forward to Jean, and send the Newspaper not to her but to Alick; it will go any time before Monday,&#x2014;and I here enclose an <hi rend="italic">Address</hi>, which, with two <pb id="pg-24-32" n="24:32"/>wafers, will do the business, if she judge that to be the preferable way. And so enough of that.</p>
<p>I have not yet got my day&#x2019;s work <hi rend="italic">begun;</hi> and it is high time I had it half ended! We have a tempest of sleet and wind; there has not been an uglier day this twelvemonth,&#x2014;a regular &#x201C;borrowing day&#x201C; tho&#x2019; almost 3 weeks after the date for that. Our weather, since the middle of <date when="1849-03-00">March</date>, has been the coldest, bitterest, most broken, I ever saw at such a season here. This tumultuous outburst of today, in the rear of snow-storms and north-wind, ought surely to <hi rend="italic">end</hi> the controversy.&#x2014; Shrink close in, my dear Mother, by the edge of a good fire; and let us hear soon that you are still standing it unharmed.</p>
<p>Poor Glen of Annan,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Glen (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>), Scottish missionary and trans.; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18150614-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:51</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-06-14">14 June 1815</date></corr></ref>, where death date incorrectly given.

<p><salute>My dear sir,&#x2014;</salute>It will not, I fear, be of much use to try a bookseller with the poems. Poetry of all kinds is a bugbear to the booksellers at present, for there is no kind of poetry that they find the public will buy. For my own part, too, I own I had much rather see a sensible man, like you, put down your real thoughts and convictions in prose, than occupy yourself with fancies and imaginations such as are usually dealt with in verse. The time is in deadly earnest; our life itself, in all times, is a most earnest practical matter, and only incidentally a sportful or singing or rhyming one:&#x2014;Let S. Bamford continue to tell us in fresh truthful prose the things he has learned about Lancashire and the world; that, I must say, would be my verdict too!</p>
<p>Lord Lansdowne has hardly come across me again at all&#x2014;I think only once&#x2014;since he commissioned me to bid you send your book.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480904-TC-SBA-01">TC to <sic>SB</sic><corr>SBA</corr>, <date when="1848-09-04">4 Sept. 1848</date></ref>.</note> In the huge whirlpool of things great and small, which the like of him lives in, he has <pb id="pg-24-33" n="24:33"/>doubtless let the transaction go out of his head; and had not you, according to my bargain with you, recalled the memory of it, all had remained forgotten. I have now communicated with his Lordship, and probably before long you will hear some farther account of it from him or me. Yesterday Lord Ashburton sent me the enclosed draft of &#xa3;25, which I was in some handsome way to present to you as a proof of his approbation. On being consulted I had said there was a public testimonial set on foot for your behoof some time ago, to which, tho&#x2019; it was no longer open to the public at large, his Lordship might still fitly contribute whatever acknowledgement of service he thought due to you.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Samuel Bamford Testimonial Committee raised about &#xa3;400, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>&#x2013;<date when="1850-00-00">50</date>, under the chairmanship of Joseph Brotherton (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3575"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), master cotton spinner and radical M.P. for Salford.</note> This draft is the result, which any Manchester banker who knows you, or knows a responsible man going with you to his bank will at once convert into cash, after which pray be so good as signify that you have received the amount, and that all is safe.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bamford replied, <date when="1849-04-22">22 April</date>, asking TC to thank Lord Ashburton for his &#x201C;munificent testimonial of approbation,&#x201C; not wishing &#x201C;to obtrude on his lordship any unnecessary correspondence.&#x201C; Further, he was &#x201C;quite willing to resign all thoughts&#x2014;for the present&#x2014;of publishing the few pieces in verse &#x2026; committed to paper.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; <closer><salute>With many good wishes, yours very sincerely,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Ashburton,</salute>
<p>I have sent away your munificent gift to Bamford: it seemed to me above twice too much; I at first thought of sending &#xa3;10 <foreign><hi rend="italic">meo periculo</hi></foreign> [at my risk], and returning the other &#xa3;15 as a future fund in the Bank of Faith;&#x2014;at last I perceived it was more burning to do at once as I was bidden.&#x2014; My Wife, on discovering what the Paper was, could not sufficiently admire the nonchalance with which she had taken it out of her Ladyship&#x2019;s hands,&#x2014;fancying it was some mere answer to the Emerson affair!</p>
<p>W. Squire, you can tell my Lady, proved madder than ever: the <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> gets into his eyes; forces him to blue <hi rend="italic">barnacles;</hi> his mind too, acted on by &#x201C;Puseyite Parsons,&#x201C; is getting quite truculent: a brother of his, a surgeon, used to say, &#x201C;Bill, you will go mad at last; jumble yourself out of your wits,&#x2014;that will be the end of you, I see!&#x201C;&#x2014;and so it is going to prove, said the poor man! Meanwhile, the ancient Cromwellian Squire, it appeared <pb id="pg-24-34" n="24:34"/>&#x201C;by <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>,&#x201C; had, in seizing the Cambridge Royalist Plate, <hi rend="italic">sunk</hi> a part of it for his own private behoof in Whittlesea Mere, <hi rend="italic">marking</hi> well the place by intersections of bearings and distances; so that W. S. remembers, his Grandfather would whisper, crossing this Mere in boats, &#x201C;Below us <hi rend="italic">now</hi> lies treasure, my boy&#x201C;&#x2014;only there was such a quantity of ooze! Now, however, they are publicly draining the Mere;&#x2014;and W. S., sly dog, is in correspondence with the Managers: we shall see what miracle ensues.&#x2014; He had never heard of Rushworth, of Whitlocke or any Book: I gave him an old copy of Whitlocke, an ugly folio, with which he went away rejoicing. Towards Bedlam, I really doubt, in the end!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Squire paid his second visit to TC, <date when="1849-04-19">19 April</date>. In his memorandum TC recorded that he was &#x201C;as flighty and crazy as ever.&#x201C; He claimed never to have heard of the great seventeenth-cent. chroniclers Rushworth and Whitlocke. He was &#x201C;a most entirely <hi rend="italic">ignorant</hi> man!&#x201C; He had not sent the extract about Peterborough because his wife was averse &#x201C;to having him farther plagued.&#x201C; &#x201C;Nothing can exceed his aimless incoherent way of babbling about these things: but &#x201C;an <hi rend="italic">impetuous</hi> truthfulness does shine thro&#x2019; all his crazy vehemences; and I still believe him to have some kind of &#x2018;Journal,&#x2019;&#x2014;what else <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I believe?&#x2014; But the matter has become such an afflicting mass of incondite darkness, I decide to have nothing to do with public scepticisms farther in regard to it; to leave it lying there as a <hi rend="italic">monstrosity</hi> of no moment.&#x201C; He took Squire, as noted, to the London Lib. to see works by Whitlocke, Rushworth, and Joshua Sprigge (see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440805-TC-JAC-01"><sic>18:166</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1844-08-05">5 Aug. 1844</date></corr></ref>) and was again impressed by his &#x201C;ignorant babble and wonderment&#x201C; (MS: Bancroft; pbd. Wright, <hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 341). In fact, inquiries would have shown that Squire was an amateur antiquarian, a subscribing member of the Norwich Museum from <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date> or before, and a committee member of the Norwich Lib., which held the works which so amazed him. Whittlesey is in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire.</note></p>
<p>Here is our Peel Manifesto in the shape of a Tract out of Suffolk; where a diligent Printer,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Childs.</note> one of the fiercest Radicals now alive, appears to be busy with it. The &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Launch</hi> of the Lord John&#x201C; into &#x201C;Oblivion&#x2019;s Sea&#x201C; is really the business, more or less, of every good citizen at present.</p>
<p>Tonight, or if I hear nothing, tomorrow, I hope to see Bath House again</p>

<salute>My dear Sister,</salute>
<p>I have been very remiss in writing; and have true reason for remorse,</p>
<p>now when I see what apprehensions my delay has given rise to! &#x201C;Offense?&#x201C; O Heaven, not at all, at all: you never gave me any &#x201C;offense&#x201C;; quite the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> was what poor <hi rend="italic">Crow</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s nickname for Jean Aitken as a child because of her black hair.</note> always gave me, since her first appearance in this world,&#x2014;a sunny sunday which I still recollect very well! Never dream <pb id="pg-24-35" n="24:35"/>of such a thing as that. But the fact is, I had somehow passed my tide in this matter; and tho&#x2019; frequently reminding myself of it, I fancied you yourself would perhaps write first, or that perhaps &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;in short the thing was put off from day to day; and <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the first day on which so simple a thing is actually done. After all, I believe it was <hi rend="italic">your</hi> blame principally, Missus. Did I not send a <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> by post, while you were at Gill, just before quitting it, I think? In that <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> were two pages (about poor Charles Buller),<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By TC, 50 (<date when="1849-01-00">Jan. 1849</date>):542&#x2013;44; rptd. from the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-12-02">2 Dec. 1848</date>.</note> on the margin of which I had marked that you were to cut them out and send them to me, as I had no other copy: you never sent them;&#x2014;you never read the Review at all, that is the fact! It was addressed to James;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Aitken.</note> it could not, I think, fail to arrive? I put it into the Post-Office myself. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">prime</hi> origin of all these dim delays! Which now have at last happily <hi rend="italic">ended.</hi></p>
<p>But indeed these many months, and years, I have been growing lazier and lazier as a correspondent; not writing to almost anybody at all except my Mother, when I could anyway help it. My internal affairs are not in a sunny or flowery condition, any more than they have ever been; nay, what with one thing what with another, the old remedy for all my sorrows, hard <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, has been as it were impossible to me: trying many things, I have got none yet that I could fairly <hi rend="italic">kindle</hi> upon; so that <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> really is the natural state, in some measure, for an animal so situated. The <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> I want to utter is abundantly plain to me: but, alas, the means of doing it? I shall never discover the &#x201C;means&#x201C; till I get so miserable that some means <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be discovered. That is the &#x201C;nature of the beast&#x201C;: heigho,&#x2014;so we must just hold on, and keep trying, keep hoping!</p>
<p>Did they send you from Scotsbrig a Newspaper with an Article of mine in it, this week? A fierce Article on Ireland; fiercely demanding that Peel should have a fly at it,&#x2014;that at least Lord John, and <hi rend="italic">his</hi> &#x201C;<foreign>waik</foreign> [weak] squad&#x201C; should give it up forever! This is the only word I have uttered for a long while: a word prompted by real <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> on my part; and to which, I see, the world is really like responding a little. Russell, it is conjectured everywhere, has got upon the <hi rend="italic">slide;</hi> all creatures are called to <hi rend="italic">soap</hi> the course for him, and get him down and out of sight <hi rend="italic">as</hi> soon as the Fates permit!&#x2014; I really ought to <hi rend="italic">stick</hi> to my paper; and work away till I get <hi rend="italic">heated:</hi> part of my big monstrous meaning, which every body would be apt to shriek over, might then perhaps be got uttered soon!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jack has said nothing to us about his journey to Scotland; I suppose he will wait for the green leaf: he seems wonderfully happy here; reading all manner of Dante matters, talking, calling &#x26;c,&#x2014;has not begun any more <pb id="pg-24-36" n="24:36"/><hi rend="italic">work</hi> of translation yet.

<salute>My dear Madam,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your beautiful Etchings: a perfect resemblance of an object well worth having its likeness taken!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See also <ref target="volume-23/lt-18480610-TC-CLB-01">TC to CLB, <date when="1848-06-10">10 June 1848</date></ref>. According to the <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/olddnb/3426"><hi rend="italic">DNB</hi></ref>, Brightwell pbd. etchings of &#x201C;Mr. Page&#x2019;s house, <corr>Ely,&#x201C;</corr> which was formerly Cromwell&#x2019;s. &#x201C;Of this House, for Oliver&#x2019;s sake, some Painter will yet perhaps make a correct likeness&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 6:94).</note> I am much gratified and obliged.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Your offer of the Plates is abundantly kind and generous: certainly they would be of real use to my Bookseller;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chapman &#x26; Hall.</note> but unluckily, so far as I can measure, the size will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> suit that of the Book; unfortunately you have forgotten that there must be a <hi rend="italic">margin</hi> to the Plate! How <hi rend="italic">much</hi> margin (whether the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> as the Letter-press has), I do not know, I suppose any Printer knows; but some margin there must evidently be, or the Print can never be <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> among these Leaves.&#x2014; However, that, as it happens, is of no consequence; the second edition of C&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Letters and Speeches</hi> being quite sold off some months ago;&#x2014;and the Book being now at press again, under <hi rend="italic">another form</hi> (4 volumes, with pages rather smaller), which it is likely to retain henceforth.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-37" n="24:37"/>I suppose there is no possibility of <hi rend="italic">reducing</hi> this Print so as to suit the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition (which is of the size of my other Books,&#x2014;I think, this here inclosed is a page of it)? What a pity!&#x2014; I did speak to the Bookseller about it; and probably he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have joyfully closed with such an offer as yours, the &#x201C;expence&#x201C; being his only objection.</p>
<p>Meanwhile please to keep carefully these Plates till we see what farther comes of them. And if you would be so kind as send, by any opportunity you have, a Copy of these Prints to Mr Childs of Bungay (&#x201C;John Childs Esq. Bungay&#x201C;), you will do a great favour to him,&#x2014;and a new one to me, who have (in a Note today) promised him that you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> send them.</p>
<p>Were you ever at Naseby? I could wish very much, a delicate firm hand and clear veracious mind like yours would try what really <hi rend="italic">faithful</hi> Art could do towards representing such an object as that. Old Hollar<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wenceslaus Hollar (<date when="1607-00-00">1607</date>&#x2013;<date when="1677-00-00">77</date>), Bohemian-born engraver of mid-seventeenth-cent. English subjects.</note> has many Prints which bring home such objects and render them to us to the very life. That seems to me the real mission of &#x201C;Art,&#x201C;&#x2014;if it could find that it had any mission!&#x2014;Of course before going thither (if the place ever lay in your way in this world), you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take care to inform yourself indisputably about the facts of it,&#x2014;and in particular to <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> that huge blockhead of a Pillar, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is near two miles from the real scene.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:110</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sept. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> <closer><salute>Yours gratefully</salute></closer> <name>T.

Really I am sick of all this Ballot-boxing and Parliamentary and other oratory; and wish, greatly, the <hi rend="italic">wiser</hi> (wherever they find themselves) would take practical <hi rend="italic">command</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">foolisher</hi> (who are amazingly plentiful, and discoverable everywhere just now), and guide them a little; which is the grand aim and end of all ballot-boxing, electioning and other social arrangement whatsoever!&#x2014; Alas, all this is a good way off yet: nevertheless we shall perhaps see it <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> in our time; and that will be an achievement for our poor babbling time: once <hi rend="italic">begun</hi>, it will not <hi rend="italic">end</hi> for five centuries, I think; not till it has made the whole world really <hi rend="italic">new.</hi></p>
<p>In this N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, you will find a word on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Indian Meal</hi>&#x201C;; which I wish all manner of corn-merchants &#x26;c &#x26;c would take thought of, and begin to act upon.</p>

<dateline>Tuesday night / <place>5 Cheyne Row</place> [<date when="1849-05-01">1? May 1849</date>]</dateline>
<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your kind letter and &#x201C;dainties&#x201C;; these I only realized today&#x2014;the weather having been bad, and my head not good, and no carriage turning up for me till today. I eat a little bit of the cake so soon as I got it home and pronounce it first rate; the marmalade I have not yet broken into. Poor Miss Grierson!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Grierson (see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18431112-JWC-JW-01"><sic>17:171</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1843-11-12">12 Nov. 1843</date></corr></ref>) died nr. Dumfries, <date when="1849-10-13">13 July.</date></note> she is still confined to her room. The Servant who took up my card to her left me and Capt Sterling who drove me there sitting in the lobby, where we were espied after a long time by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> <pb id="pg-24-42" n="24:42"/>Johnstone,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Johnston, mother of John Johnston, surgeon, both of 16 Dover St.</note> who passed into the dining room and violently rung a bell there, and sent another servant to ask us in. We found, her a fat goodnatured looking old Lady, <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to <hi rend="italic">enter into conversation;</hi> I enquired about Miss Grierson&#x2019;s illness, and the account she gave was very sad. Her son she said attended her, and feared that altho she was recovering, she would never be &#x201C;strong enough for business.&#x201C; &#x201C;there had been no press of work to cause her illness&#x2014;it had come on just after winter when there had been little to do&#x201C;&#x2014;but they did not hint this to herself, for fear of alarming her. I will call again in a few days and try to see herself and give you more particular accounts of her. Has she any one in Scotland to go to? it is very mornful to have spent so many weary years in learning a business which is now turning out too hard for her.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She had been working for Mrs. and the Misses Johnston, dressmakers and milliners to the queen and queen dowager. Mrs. Johnston was evidently the milliner, as the <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> GPO guide lists the Misses Johnston alone as dressmakers.</note></p>
<p>For ourselves we are all going on much as usual&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C not yet reconciled to his &#x201C;interior,&#x201C; nor I to my <hi rend="italic">head</hi>, with which indeed I have had several more terrible bouts lately than ever in my life before&#x2014;which is much to say! John is excessively kind to me on these occasions; has sat on his knees at my bedside for hours together, holding me down, and <hi rend="italic">being sorry for me</hi>, which is just all that can be done in the way of alleviation. &#x201C;On earth, the Living have much to bear&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Trusty Eckart,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">German Romance, Works</hi> 21:299.</note>&#x2014;the difference is chiefly in the manner of bearing&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> manner of bearing is far from being the best.</p>
<p>They would tell you of the final crash of my Maid Helen<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Poor Helen&#x2019;s Dublin glories ended (the second year, I think) in total wreck&#x2014;drink, quarrel with her fool of a brother, dismissal home or into outer darkness, and <foreign>adieu</foreign> of the <hi rend="italic">spitfire</hi> kind! From home she sent inquiries hither: old regrets, new alacrities, &#x26;c. &#x26;c. As our good little Anne was now to be wedded, and go to Jersey with her &#x2018;James&#x2019; (where she did well, but died in a couple of years, poor little soul!), we were glad to hear of Helen again. Helen came, a glad sight of her kind; to my eye nothing was wrong in her, but to <hi rend="italic">another</hi> better observer (though in strict silence towards me) much, much! Accordingly before long strange faults (even theft, to appearance) began to peer out; and, after perhaps four or five months, came the catastrophe described below! / My darling took all pains with the wretched Helen; got her <hi rend="italic">placed</hi> once, perhaps twice, candidly testifying to qualities and <hi rend="italic">faults</hi> alike (drove off with her once in a cab, as I can still pathetically recollect having seen):&#x2014;but nothing could save Helen! She was once, as we heard, dragged from the river; did die, an outcast, few months afterwards. Naivety and even geniality,&#x2014;imbecility, obstinacy, and <hi rend="italic">gin.</hi> Her &#x2018;sayings,&#x2019; as reported to me here, were beyond all Jest-Books,&#x2014;as gold beyond pinchbeck&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s headnote in Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014;how on our return from a visit to Cap<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Sterling, she first would not open the door, and at last did open it, like a stage-Gohst,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the MS TC corrects the spelling and writes above the line: &#x201C;<date when="1849-02-00">feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1849</date> (L<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>),&#x201C; referring to <ref target="volume-23/lt-18490222-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, [<date when="1849-02-22">22 Feb.</date>]</ref>, where she spells it correctly.</note> very <hi rend="italic">ill got up;</hi> blood spewing from <pb id="pg-24-43" n="24:43"/>her lips, her face whitened with chalk from the kitchen floor, her dark gown <hi rend="italic">ditto</hi>, and wearing a hideous smile of idiotic self-complacency! I thought M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C was going to kick his foot thro her when she tumbled down at his touch&#x2014;if she had been his <hi rend="italic">wife</hi> he certainly would have killed her on the spot, but his maid-of-all-work he felt could be got rid of without his being hanged for her. The young woman whom Providence sent me &#x201C;quite promiscuously,&#x201C; within an hour of this consumation, has hitherto given us the greatest satisfaction. She is far the most <hi rend="italic">loveable</hi> servant I ever had&#x2014;a gentle pretty sweet-looking creature with innocent winning ways, a very fair worker too, clean, orderly, and &#x201C;up to her business.&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;This must have been Elizabeth Sprague, from Exeter, a high-going, shining kind of damsel, who did very well for about two years; but then, like most of the genus, went away, and disappeared. What a province of the &#x2018;domesticities&#x2019; that is at present! Anarchic exceedingly; the funnel-neck of all our anarchies&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> My only fear about her is that being only four and twenty, and calculated to produce an impression on the other sex, she may weary of single service: unless indeed she can get up a sentiment for the Butcher&#x2019;s man, who is already her devoted admirer: but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">he</hi> is so desperately ugly&#x201C;!</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have been busy, off and on, for a great many weeks in pasting a screen, with four leaves, five feet high, all over with prints.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Stands here to this day, the beautifullest and cleverest screen I have ever seen. How strange, how mournfully affecting to me now!&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> It will be a charming &#x201C;work of art&#x201C; when finished, but of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> there is no near prospect. The prints are most of them very small, and it takes so much pondering to find how to scatter them about to the best advantage. What else I have been <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> it were hard to tell&#x2014; I read very little now adays&#x2014;not that my eyes are failed the least in the world&#x2014;but that books have ceased to take any hold on me&#x2014;and for sewing; you know that &#x201C;being an only child, I never wished to sew&#x201C;&#x2014; Still I have some inevitable work in that line, as even if I felt rich enough to have &#x201C;the family-needlework&#x201C; done by others, I dont know where to find others to do it for money&#x2014;without bothering me with their stupidity worse than if I did it myself. But the great business of life for a woman like me, in this place, is an eternal writing of little unavoidable notes&#x2014; It falls upon <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to answer all the invitations, and make lying excuses world without end, so that I sometimes look back with the tear in my eye to the time when we were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> celebrated, and were left to provide our own dinners as we could!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>We have very cold weather again here; I wonder what is becoming of you in the upstairs room yonder! We have got good news this long time, and ought to be right thankful for the same;&#x2014;but we cannot <hi rend="italic">always</hi> expect such, alas, no! And ever and anon, some fear comes, that you are ailing while I do not know it. Tell the good Isabella, or some of them, to write to us again: the smallest word is very welcome.</p>
<p>Both Jane and I have caught a little whiff of something like cold, from this pernicious grey East-wind; but it does not go the length of a <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> either, it only makes us feel uncomfortable, and have a longing for the return of soft brisk sunny breezes from the West. I believe London is <hi rend="italic">darker</hi>, in respect of sun and clearness of sunshine, than most place; so perhaps <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have the sun out along with this wind and are better off than we.&#x2014; In spite of the wind we are to go this day to Greenwich (a pleasant place, twelve miles off us), along with Captain Sterling (Anthony Sterling) and a pleasant little &#x201C;Party&#x201C; he has made up for dining there. I tried hard to be off; but Jane, I saw, wanted it; they agreed also to take my two <hi rend="italic">Duffys</hi> (Irish Duffy, the late State-Prisoner, and his Wife, good people, who were very kind to me in Ireland, and are now here for a day or two, rejoicing in their freedom from Botany-bay!)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Botany Bay, nr. Sydney on the E coast of Australia, named by Capt. Cook, <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>, nr. which a British penal settlement was established, <date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>. Duffy wrote: &#x201C;After my release from prison, I spent a few weeks in London, and saw much of Carlyle, Mrs. Carlyle, and their closest friends&#x201C; (Duffy 33). Susan, b. Hughes (d. <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>), was Duffy&#x2019;s second wife, m. <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>.</note>&#x2014;these are to go with us; Anthony brings a carriage that will hold everybody, bring everybody back too; clears all scores (being a munificent landlord); has plenty of <hi rend="italic">tobacco</hi> moreover:&#x2014;on the whole, what can one do but go? I have ended some little scraping of work;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An explanatory note to the &#x201C;Squire Papers&#x201C; (2:337&#x2013;420), dated <date when="1849-05-07">7 May</date>.</note> and have still time to write this word to my good dear Mother, before &#xBD; past 2, when the carriage comes.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-45" n="24:45"/>Of late days again I have had some new <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> with the Printing of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> &#x26;c: but all, I do think, is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> done; the very &#x201C;Preface to the Third Edition&#x201C; will be off <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hands, and fairly into the Printer&#x2019;s, the day after tomorrow;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As pbd. dated <date when="1849-10-16">16 October</date>.</note> after which he, not I, must fight with it, and I hope to be free again for other things.&#x2014;Plenty of &#x201C;other things,&#x201C; alas, and pressing enough to be done, this long while; but they are terribly difficult to do! I must <hi rend="italic">try</hi> them, and again try them, till once they be somehow got done!</p>
<p>In this <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> which I send to Jamie there is notice of a little Paper I wrote in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> about Indian Meal: if you sent it on to Alick, it would go free, and might perhaps interest him for a moment, poor fellow. The <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> itself you shall get by and by; we lent it to Lady Ashburton, and unluckily it has never been got back yet. The person who <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> us the real genuine &#x201C;Indian Corn in the natural state,&#x201C; as you will perhaps guess, is Emerson. He would not hear of my <hi rend="italic">bitter</hi> Indian Meal; determined to send us a sweet sample from his own Barn; and so, without cost, it came to us, and we have acknowledged it. The Lord-Ashburton people have undertaken to deal with <hi rend="italic">Millers</hi> in regard to it; some of the meal, I understand, is now ready; their Cooks are to act according to American recipe, upon the new substance; and I suppose we shall by and by get to make some experiment upon the <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> of it. All right then!</p>
<p>Jack was down last night; seemed very well and hearty: he got a Letter from Munich last week from one of the d&#x2019;Eichthals,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the d&#x2019;Eichthals, the wealthy German Jewish family, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18301019-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:173</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1830-10-19">19 Oct. 1830</date></corr></ref>, and later vols. John Carlyle had visited Baron David von Eichthal (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>) in Munich, <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>&#x2013;<date when="1828-00-00">28</date>.</note> which has opened some kind of negociation between him and them; which, for the present, gives him pleasure at any rate.</p>
<p>People are talking a great deal of Politics: it is not supposed poor little Lord Johnny can continue long where he is, so many people (self among the number) are picking holes in his coat. Today is to be a grand day in the House of Lords, upon the &#x201C;Navigation Laws,&#x201C; where certain people are resolute to throw them, and him the Author of them, <hi rend="italic">out</hi> straightway, in the course of this very week.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Under the established navigation laws coasting trade was wholly restricted to British ships, to be navigated by a British master and crews, a certain proportion of whom must be British subjects. The govt. had introduced an amendment permitting greater freedom of trade, and despite considerable opposition the second reading of the bill was carried, <date when="1849-05-08">8 May</date>, in the House of Lords by ten votes. It finally passed, <date when="1849-06-26">26 June</date>, and began operation, <date when="1850-01-00">Jan. 1850</date>.</note> But it will perhaps hardly be so; wise persons do not quite wish it so. <hi rend="italic">Peel</hi> is not ready to come in yet; nay I believe he thinks it nearly as much as his <hi rend="italic">life</hi> is worth (having a tendency to apoplexy) to come in at all; tho&#x2019; probably he will <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to come before long: but nobody can wisely wish any change <hi rend="italic">till</hi> then. Let them fight away, however; <pb id="pg-24-46" n="24:46"/>and the thickest skin hold out longest!&#x2014; &#x2014; It has struck two; I have still to put on clothes: I must not take another sheet. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> my own good Mother; Oh may all good be ever with you!

<salute>Dear Spedding,</salute>
<p>How can it be possible that we should, in any conceivable circumstances, &#x201C;forbid the Enterprise!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spedding wrote to TC, <date when="1849-05-11">11 May</date>, from the address above, to say that he was in London with his wife and would like to visit Cheyne Row: &#x201C;It may be well, however, to give you this notice, that you may either encourage or forbid the enterprise.&#x201C; Frances Emily, b. Headlam, was Spedding&#x2019;s second wife; see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380217-TC-TSS-01"><sic>10:32</sic><corr>TC to TSS, <date when="1838-02-17">17 Feb. 1838</date></corr></ref>.</note> The enterprise is good and indispensable, be the times or seasons what they may.&#x2014; Tonight we are out, and tomorrow and Monday Nights; the more is my sorrow like to be!&#x2014; But after that, we are yours for any evening Mrs Spedding and you will please to fix upon. And for your individual behoof, I individually am here between 2 and 3 o&#x2019;clock any day,&#x2014;tomorrow even; tho&#x2019; tomorrow, and next day, and next, I can expect to be nothing but very wretched, with a nervous-system all shattered to nonsense! The &#x201C;customs of society&#x201C; do not suit <hi rend="italic">me</hi> well in this present generation.</p>
<p>I will keep your address too; and see if at any time I can get so far to the North:&#x2014;but that is not very hopeful, while there is a prospect of your coming higher; I seldom get beyond St. James&#x2019;s Parish, and indeed am much overwhelmed in litter of various kinds at present,&#x2014;a third edition of <hi rend="italic">Oliver</hi>, and far <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> things than that!</p>
<p>Any day between two and three you may hit me here; any evening after Monday us both here. I could talk with you for about a month in proper situation it appears to me.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal, <date when="1849-05-17">17 May</date>, TC noted Spedding&#x2019;s visit &#x201C;the other night&#x201C; and his description of George Hudson&#x2019;s private life &#x201C;as S. himself and others had observed it.&#x201C; TC felt &#x201C;a real human pity&#x201C; for Hudson: &#x201C;His brother-in-law has drowned himself at York. What a world this ever is! &#x2026; The old laws are still alive. Even railway scrip is subject to them&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 3:455).</note></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Ashburtons will see us tomorrow evening. Come to us between 7 and 8 o&#x2019;clock, and we will have some tea, and then call together<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Neuberg wrote to his sister, <date when="1849-05-14">14 May</date>, about this visit: &#x201C;The doctor and a German lady were there. After a little while the master put on his coat with the velvet collar, and we went off together. He walks rather like a Catholic priest, his long, thin body somewhat shambling. He was in a serious and tender mood, and spoke earnestly and finely the whole way. At Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s we had a very friendly reception. My lord and lady were in the drawing-room, which is the richest room I have seen anywhere&#x2014;W&#xfc;rzburg and Munich royal palaces not excepted. Later, other gentlemen came; among them the Russian ambassador. Carlyle&#x2019;s unrestrained conversation with these people is very amusing. The general tone of the company was cultivated and simple. Not once did I hear the words &#x2018;my lord&#x2019; or &#x2018;my lady.&#x2019; At half-past eleven we left, and I accompanied C. a part of the way home&#x201C; (Sadler 281).</note></p>

Since <date when="1849-01-00">Jan.</date>, Austria and France had had discussions about his restoration. In Florence in <date when="1849-02-00">Feb.</date> when the Roman republic was declared, Mazzini became one of its three leaders who introduced social and ecclesiastical reforms. There was much liberal sympathy for Rome, but JWC oversimplified the situation. The mainly Roman Catholic French had turned against revolutionary republicanism. Louis Napoleon, newly elected over the republican Cavaignac, was actually fulfilling the latter&#x2019;s pledge to restore the Pope. At the end of <date when="1849-04-00">April</date> a French expeditionary force, intent on forestalling the Austrians and winning Catholic approval, attacked Rome and was repulsed.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Let me write you a little word today, in the middle of all the tumult, to say how we are coming on. An Italian vagabond is grinding his organ under my window, provoking me to go out and break his head; young ladies are playing pianos in the neighbouring house; a very great tumult everywhere going on indeed! I will endeavour to pay no regard to it whatever, nor to plenty of other <foreign><hi rend="italic">burbles</hi></foreign> [disorders] and businesses outward and inward;&#x2014;but will write my little word to you before I go farther.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-54" n="24:54"/>We have got beautiful warm weather now; after a heavy plunge of rain which lasted for several days, the sun has got out, and the soft west wind, and all things are looking green and fresh here: my only fear is now too <hi rend="italic">much</hi> heat; but that, at any rate, has not come on yet. We are tolerably well in health too, all of us; both Jane and I go grumbling on, as usual, not worse than usual; yesterday Jack was here, and he too was quite up to the average. My Printers still keep up a considerable bother now and then, especially with some <hi rend="italic">additions</hi> we are making to one of the volumes of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell;</hi> but that, I hope, will now soon be over, and I shall at least not be tied to continue <hi rend="italic">in their neighbourhood</hi> above a week or two more. I am thinking rather seriously of getting out into the country, so soon as the weather grows too hot: a Tour of a week or two in Ireland has often been in my head of late; <hi rend="italic">some</hi> kind of Tour that would take me away from the noise of this Babylon while the pavements are so hot and crowded. I do not expect to find much new knowledge in Ireland, if I go; but much that I have lying in me to say might perhaps get nearer to some way of utterance if I were looking face to face upon the ruin and wretchedness that is prevalent there; for that seems to me the spot of our dominions where the <hi rend="italic">bottomless gulph</hi> has broken out, and all the lies and delusions that lie hidden and open in us have come to their definite practical <hi rend="italic">issue</hi> there! &#x201C;They that sow the wind, they shall reap the whirlwind&#x201C;:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Hosea 8:7.</note> that was, from of old, the law!&#x2014; I also think sometimes of running to my Welsh Attorney friend;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Redwood. In his Journal TC wrote, <date when="1849-04-26">26 April</date>: &#x201C;Have often tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> of running off to Redwood&#x2019;s in S. Wales, to be at least alone there and in the country while the summer shines. Write a little; but it is <hi rend="italic">good</hi> for nothing, it has to be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi> at last.&#x201C; And, <date when="1849-05-17">17 May</date>, he noted: &#x201C;Am thinking of a Tour of Ireland: unhappily have no call of <hi rend="italic">desire</hi> that way, or any way; but am driven out <hi rend="italic">somewhither</hi> (just now) as by the point of bayonets at my back.&#x2014; Ireland really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> my problem; the <hi rend="italic">breaking</hi> point of the huge suppuration which all British and all European society now is. Set down in Ireland, one might at least feel, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Here</hi> is thy problem: in God&#x2019;s name, what <hi rend="italic">will</hi> thou do with it?&#x2019; Otherwise I do not expect to get much instruction by a look at Ireland. A little health I might (perhaps) get too; and that certainly is not superfluous just now.&#x2014; Cannot yet get at any rate, till they permit certain <hi rend="italic">lists</hi> in the new ed<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi> Besides the weather here, windy, westerly, moist, excellent for me as yet.&#x201C;</note> who is really very loyal to me, who lives like a hermit, by the sea-side, has horses,&#x2014;and is always urgent that I should come and see him. <hi rend="italic">Another</hi> course, you need not doubt, will lie in the rear of each or any and all of these projected excursions,&#x2014;the course to Scotsbrig, to see my dear old mother and kind friends there! There I design to be some time this season; whether after Ireland, or after Wales, or after or before whatever else it be. Surely while such a blessing is left to me on the Earth, it is not to be neglected! I cherish my heart with the thought of seeing you all once more, in not many weeks now. Thank Heaven there is still such a place in <pb id="pg-24-55" n="24:55"/>the world for me to go to. Oh my dear Mother, let us both be thankful,&#x2014;and acknowledge piously, as you often say, that &#x201C;we have many mercies&#x201C;!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The other evening Mr and Mrs Stewart of Gillenbie walked unexpectedly in upon us. Poor Stewart seems to have had some shock of palsy, and is terribly lamed. His Wife was evidently very anxious about him: one was <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> to see the stout little compact fellow so reft of his strength all at once. What hope there is of improvement for him I do not know. They did not stay long here: we asked them to come back in two nights; they gave a kind of half promise, but did not keep it: I suppose they are gone home again. One of the <hi rend="italic">Indian</hi> Sons<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the Stewarts&#x2019; surviving sons who worked in India.</note> was here, unwell but getting better, whom they hoped soon to have at Gillenbie too.&#x2014; I was really sorry indeed at what I saw.</p>
<p>Yesterday there came along with Jack (whose errand here indeed was to shew him the way) a certain Italian Political Character, one Marioni, who has come hither from Rome to negociate about the poor &#x201C;Roman Republic,&#x201C; and its many troubles.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In late <date when="1849-03-00">March</date>, Mazzini had sent Ubaldo Marioni, representative of Pesaro in the Roman constituent assembly, to England to procure arms; see <hi rend="italic">Scritti</hi> 40:35, 280. In early <date when="1849-05-00">May</date> the Roman republican govt. sent envoys to England to persuade the foreign sec., Lord Palmerston, to intervene on its behalf.</note> Mazzini had given him a card for Jane. I talked a long time with him; found him a rational, sincere-looking man: all people, he says, are clear against readmitting the Pope to temporal rule, at Rome; and will <hi rend="italic">fight</hi> violently before they be constrained to it. Nobody knows what way the French and others will settle that beggarly <hi rend="italic">bankruptcy</hi> of Imposture: to settle it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, will excel the power of them all united, I believe.&#x2014; Mazzini, an old friend of ours and one <supplied>[of]</supplied><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> the most zealous pious-minded men I know, is one of the Three Kings of Rome<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A triumvirate of Mazzini, Carlo Armellini (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), and Aurelio Saffi (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>) was set up to govern Rome, <date when="1849-03-29">29 March</date>.</note> just now, and I suppose is the most resolute of them all: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> lives in the Pope&#x2019;s Palace at present; the other day he was in a poor house somewhere here; which seems a change, when one reflects on it! Louis Napoleon too I have often seen in these streets, driving his <foreign><hi rend="italic">cabriolet</hi></foreign> (a kind of covered or hooded <hi rend="italic">gig</hi>); once I dined where he was, and talked a good deal to him,&#x2014;no great promotion for a man at that time.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis Napoleon was in exile in London, <date when="1846-05-00">May 1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1848-02-00">Feb. 1848</date>. Milnes had dined with him, &#x201C;my old London friend,&#x201C; on his Easter visit to Paris and thought he &#x201C;did not seem at all to enjoy his high state, but to be quite <foreign><hi rend="italic">affaiss&#xE9;</hi></foreign> with work and anxiety&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">RMM</hi> 1:432).</note> Alas, it is conjectured too that such a &#x201C;time&#x201C; may very easily <hi rend="italic">return</hi>,&#x2014;that Louis Napoleon is very likely to drive cabriolets here <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, poor fellow!

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>There has risen a speculation in me, which is getting rather lively in these weeks, of coming over to have a deliberate walk in Ireland, and to look at the strange doings of the Powers there with my own eyes for a little.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy explains that on his visit to London TC had not mentioned this (33).</note> The hot season here, of baked pavements, burning skies, and mad artificialities growing ever madder till in <date when="1849-08-00">August</date> they collapse by sheer exhaustion is always frightful to me; and during this season, from various causes, is likely to be frightfuller than common: add to which, that I have fewer real fetters binding me here than usual,&#x2014;nothing express at all but an edition of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, which the Printers, especially after two weeks hence, may manage for themselves:&#x2014;in short, all taken together, I incline much to decide that I ought to give myself the sight of one other Country Summer somewhere on this green Earth; and that Ireland, on several accounts, has strong claims of preference on me. I do not expect much pleasure there, or properly any &#x201C;pleasure&#x201C;: alas, a <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> is sticking in my heart, which cannot get itself written at all; and till that be written there is no hope of peace or benefit for me anywhere. Neither do I expect to learn much out of Ireland; Ireland is, this long while past, pretty satisfactorily intelligible to me,&#x2014;no phenomenon that comes across from it requiring much explanation;&#x2014;but it seems worth while to <hi rend="italic">look</hi> a little at the unutterable <hi rend="italic">Curtius&#x2019; Gulf</hi>&#x2018;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The legendary Marcus Curtius rode into a chasm in the Roman Forum; see <ref target="volume-16/lt-18430616-JWC-JOST-01"><sic>16:201</sic><corr>JWC to JOST, <date when="1843-06-16">16 June 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> of British and indeed of European things, which has visibly broken forth there: in that respect, if not in another, Ireland seems to me the notablest of all spots of the world at present. &#x201C;There is your problem, <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> too, my friend.&#x201C; I will say to myself: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">There;</hi> see what you will make of that!&#x201C;&#x2014; In short, why shouldn&#x2019;t I go and look at Ireland, and be my own (<hi rend="italic">Eternitys</hi>) &#x201C;Commissioner&#x201C; there?&#x2014; W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Edward Forster, the young Quaker whom you have seen, offers to attend me for at least two weeks, from the middle of <date when="1849-06-00">june</date> onwards; and, in truth, day after day the project is assuming a more practical form. Probably something really <hi rend="italic">may</hi> come of it.</p>
<p>My preparations hitherto do not amount to much; yet I am doing, under obstructions, what I can. Yesterday, not till after much groping, I did at last get a tolerable map of Ireland (the Railway Commissioners&#x2019;, in six big <pb id="pg-24-59" n="24:59"/>pieces); I have examined or reexamined various Books,&#x2014;but unfortunately find hardly one in the hundred worth examining. Sir James Ware&#x2019;s book (by Harris) is the one good Book I have yet seen:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir James Ware (<date when="1594-00-00">1594</date>&#x2013;<date when="1666-00-00">1666</date>), Irish historian; <hi rend="italic">The Whole Works of Sir James Ware Concerning Ireland</hi>, trans. from Latin by the Rev. J. W. Harris, 2 vols. (Dublin, <date when="1739-00-00">1739</date>&#x2013;<date when="1764-00-00">64</date>).</note> Flaherty says, &#x201C;Camden saw England with both eyes, Scotland with only one, and Ireland, <foreign><hi rend="italic">caecus</hi></foreign> [blind], with none&#x201C;&#x2014;nevertheless, Camden is yet by far my best guide in historical topography; indeed he, the very Apollo of Topographers, has rendered all others vile to me, unendurable on any ground that he has touched.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Camden (<date when="1551-00-00">1551</date>&#x2013;<date when="1623-00-00">1623</date>), author of <hi rend="italic">Britannia, sive Florentissimorum Regnorum, Angliae, Scotiae, Hiberniae, et Insularum adjacentium ex intima antiquitate Chorographica Descriptio</hi> (<date when="1586-00-00">1586</date>). Presumably the historian William Edward Flaherty (d. <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date>); the quotation is untraced.</note> I have also read the <hi rend="italic">Life of St Patrick</hi>, Jocelin&#x2019;s absurd Legend; the dreary commentaries of poor Bollandists; and St Patrick&#x2019;s own <hi rend="italic">Confessio</hi> (which I believe to be genuinely his, tho&#x2019; unfortunately it is lyrical, not biographical);<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saint Patrick (373&#x2013;463), Christianizer of Ireland. The &#x201C;Latin Narrative of the Life and Miracles of St. Patrick&#x201C; by the Cistercian monk Jocelin (fl. <date when="1200-00-00">1200</date>), first pbd. in Thomas Messingham&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Florilegium Insulae Sanctorum</hi> (Paris, <date when="1624-00-00">1624</date>); rptd. in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum</hi> under <date when="1849-03-17">17 March</date> by the Bollandists (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470109-TC-LHB-01"><sic>21:130</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1847-01-09">9 Jan. 1847</date></corr></ref>).</note> and one of the few places where I yet clearly aim to be is, on the top of Croagh Patrick,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A mountain, 2,510 ft., in S co. Mayo, where, according to tradition, St. Patrick began his missionary work in Ireland.</note> to wish I could gather all the serpents, devils, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">Malefici</hi></foreign> [Witchcrafts], thither again, and rolling them up into one big mass, fling the whole safely into Clew Bay<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Inlet of the Atlantic Ocean in co. Mayo. Many miracles were ascribed to Saint Patrick, the best known being his clearing Ireland of vermin, by throwing them into the sea.</note> again! St Patrick&#x2019;s Purgatory too (but the real one,&#x2014;in Lough Erne I think);<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A cave on Station Island in Lough Derg, co. Donegal; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470111-TC-LHB-01"><sic>21:131</sic><corr>TC to LHB, <date when="1847-01-11">11 Jan. 1847</date></corr></ref>. Lough Erne is in SW Donegal.</note> the Hill of Tarah likewise,&#x2014;and if I could find that Castle of <hi rend="italic">Darwarth</hi> (or &#x201C;Ardnochar and Horseleap,&#x201C; in W. Meath County) where the native Carpenter, when Hugh de Lacy was shewing him the mode of chipping and adzing, suddenly took his axe and brained De Lacy,&#x2014;I should esteem it worth while!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh de Lacy (d. <date when="1186-00-00">1186</date>), 5th Baron Lacy and 1st lord of Meath, one of the conquerors of Ireland, accused of mistreating the Irish and aspiring to the crown of Ireland, built a castle at Durrow or Dervagh. Here he was murdered, while giving directions in woodcutting, by the foster son of a local chieftain, his head being severed from his body by an axe. Ardnorchar was nearby, also in Meath; it had been one of the frontier forts of the English Pale, called &#x201C;Horseleap&#x201C; because of a jump over the drawbridge by an English knight fleeing pursuit. Duffy wrote to TC, <date when="1849-06-01">1 June</date>: &#x201C;All the things you desire to see are easily enough seen, except perhaps that castle of Derwarth of which I feel patriotically bound to deny the existence. At all events we dont now kill Englishmen who give us good advice; we only throw rotten eggs at them.&#x201C;</note> <pb id="pg-24-60" n="24:60"/>The famishing Unions<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Local administrative units, joined to administer rates, poor laws, etc. Duffy said, <date when="1849-06-01">1 June</date>, that he would complete his Dublin list of people for TC to see with &#x201C;two or three of the most sensible of the Poor Law Guardians.&#x201C;</note> I, of course, want especially to see; this of itself, I suppose, will take me into the &#x201C;Picturesque&#x201C; department, which, on its own strength, I must not profess to regard much. What remarkable <hi rend="italic">men</hi> have you in Ireland? There is a very wide question! But in fact I am still, as you perceive, in a dim inquiring condition as to this Tour; and solicit help from any likely quarter. Aubrey de Vere has undertaken to put down on paper, his notions of a set of Irish <foreign><hi rend="italic">notabiles</hi></foreign> and <foreign><hi rend="italic">notabilia</hi></foreign> for me: one of the purposes of this Letter was partly to try whether you perhaps w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> not contribute a little in the same way. Or in any other way? Write me a word so soon as you have leisure,&#x2014;on this and on other things.</p>
<p>Forster was greatly pleased with you both; and perhaps there may be an abatement of nonsense in one small province of things, by reason of that visit. What you are deciding on for your own future course, will be very interesting to me, so soon as it has got the length of being talked about. We send many kind regards to Mrs Duffy, last seen as a <hi rend="italic">Naiad</hi>,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently it had been raining.</note> then vanishing in the dust of the Strand,&#x2014;<foreign>eheu!</foreign> In Bagot Street there is a beautiful Sister, whom I remember well, and always wish to be remembered by.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Callan, b.

<salute>Dear A. de Vere,</salute>
<p>Accompanying this, is a terribly learned collection of Dilettantisms, on the thing they call &#x201C;Ancient Art,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but it could have been Anna Jameson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Early Italian Painters</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>), or <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, by Various Writers</hi>, ed. Dr. William Smith (2d edn., <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>). De Vere was interested in medieval and early Renaissance Christian art; see Ward, <hi rend="italic">Aubrey De Vere</hi> 148&#x2013;50, who says that De Vere&#x2019;s descriptions &#x201C;suggest a Catholic Carlyle.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;not by any means the most interesting of things to me,&#x2014;which collection of canonized Dilettantisms, worthy of a <pb id="pg-24-61" n="24:61"/>glance from one in your course, let me beg you to accept from me,&#x2014;were it only to take the Book out of my way, for there is another Copy here!</p>
<p>We missed you last time; and it is now many days ago. Pray do not neglect my Irish Expedition; which I really believe is ripening fast towards some fulfilment. I depend on you for light as to the Munster part of the affair: Traitor Duffy (one of the best Irishmen now living,&#x2014;probably the very best, present company alive excepted, that ever came across my orbit) furnished me with useful hints for the rest;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In a letter dated <date when="1849-06-01">1 June</date>. Munster is a province in S Ireland.</note> and will perhaps, if we can so shape it, go with me in person where he could be most available. I have likewise got a very fair Map (Railway Commissioners&#x2019;), the only tolerable map I ever saw of Ireland;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A General Map of Ireland to Accompany the Report of the Railway Commissioners Shewing the Principal Physical Features and Geological Structure of the Country</hi> (<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>).</note> have got varieties of Books (Sir J. Ware the only <hi rend="italic">good</hi> one), and am painfully delving my way thro&#x2019; mountains of nonsense to here and there a <supplied>[two or three words missing]</supplied>-y of cobweb, that overlie the <hi rend="italic">history</hi> (if they have any history) of all modern Nations whatsoever,&#x2014;is one of the frightfullest symptoms of them to me. Old Greeks, Old Hebrews&#x2014;alas, they understood that there actually were &#x201C;gods,&#x201C; that this tremendous Universe actually was Divine: they had what one calls an <hi rend="italic">open sense</hi>, knew what to speak of, what to be forever silent of; which we, poor devils, with <hi rend="italic">shut</hi> sense, shut these 2 or 3 hundred years under mountains of adscititious cobwebs, Heathen and Jew, are total<supplied>[ly ignoran]</supplied>t of, or almost totally!&#x2014;Except Friday, I do not recollect that I am to be out any evening. All morning till about 3, I am here; after which dinner about 5, tea between 7 and 8.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have had two very short Notes from you, since you quitted us that afternoon: thanks for them,&#x2014;in the absence of longer! Nothing in the least remarkable has passed here in the interim; but I must write you a word today, or you will have left Nottingham before anything can reach you. I have been sitting to a Painter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carrick (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">75</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4761"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), painter of miniatures.</note> and have got a headache, as well as lost most <pb id="pg-24-62" n="24:62"/>part of the available day; I was out yesterday at Darwin&#x2019;s to a miserable dinner (being quite ill before I went), then to a miserable Lecture from Lyell,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Lyell lectured at the Royal Inst., <date when="1849-06-08">8 June</date>, &#x201C;On the Delta and Alluvial Plain of the Mississippi, Ancient and Modern.&#x201C;</note> and before that to &#x26;c &#x26;c so that I am in no <supplied>[way?]</supplied> for writing,&#x2014;not to speak of the condition of my pen, sputtering as you see it do:&#x2014;be prepared therefore to take the will for the deed, as is so often necessary in this world.</p>
<p>I have continued my Irish studies, in the same abstracted fashion as before you went; have got my Map, especially, from the Binder; and feel myself slowly gathering some glimmerings of intelligence and interest about that unfortunate Island. My purpose to proceed thither still holds, tho&#x2019; not yet in a quite definite condition; Forster now cannot <hi rend="italic">go</hi> with me, will <hi rend="italic">join</hi> me &#x26;c (which will not suit half as well); I think of going direct by steamer from this Port to Dublin,&#x2014;next &#x201C;Thursday at 10 a. m.,&#x201C; or Thursday come aweek? The latter is the more probable of the two. Nay Aubrey de Vere writes to me today that I ought to <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> till the cholera have abated, for in some of the most interesting districts that is very prevalent just now.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1849-05-04">4 May</date>, reported cholera in Galway and then, <date when="1849-05-31">31 May</date>, in Mayo.</note> I think of Duffy for a first companion;&#x2014;to him I must write a note, had I done with this presently on hand. The best advice I expect to get tomorrow from Twistleton,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Turner Boyd Twisleton (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27915"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420815-TC-JWC-01"><sic>15:19</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1842-08-15">15 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>), recently resigned as chief commissioner of poor laws in Ireland.</note> who is appointed for that purpose: he came here, one day since you went; we talked of many things, but postponed our Tour speculation till &#x201C;Sunday at 2 o&#x2019;clock.&#x201C; Alas, my <hi rend="italic">appetite</hi> for travel, or for any earthly enterprise or work, is close upon zero, or altogether zero, at this moment! However, I must <hi rend="italic">not</hi> leave it there; l feel withal that I ought to go and that I must go. God help me! <hi rend="italic">Amen;</hi> let all the friends that I have left say, <hi rend="italic">Amen.</hi></p>
<p>Twistleton seems to me, as he has long done, a particularly honest faithful and worthy man. One of the things he spoke of was your <hi rend="italic">Dante;</hi> inquiring if that Carlyle was &#x201C;my cousin&#x201C;; testifying farther, with heartfelt emphasis, to the solid value and honourable completeness of that work; in which sentiment I could not but agree with him. More genuine praise I think I have not heard you get, than from this rather inarticulate man: &#x201C;Hm-m-m, very well done, hm-m, excellent <hi rend="italic">style</hi> of doing the work, m-m-m, brings Dante home to you, mhm,-m-m!&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c</p>
<p>The Painter who is doing me in miniature is one Carrick; a dextrous ingenious veracious-looking little body; sent hither by Frewen (one of my Cromwell Correspondents), or rather, I should say, <hi rend="italic">admitted</hi> by Frewen&#x2019;s means, for he is painting with an eye to engravers, I believe, and eagerly <pb id="pg-24-63" n="24:63"/>picks up all the faces that promise to avail in that direction. Jane encourages, says he will evidently succeed. He comes down <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>, every morning; wearies me, I must say, very much. He is from Carlisle City; and was a &#x201C;Chemist&#x201C; once: more like poor Badams than anybody I have seen.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Badams (d. <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), a friend of the Carlyles and an industrial chemist; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:94&#x2013;95</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Forster will be ready for you on Monday,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. E. Forster, at his home at Rawdon, nr. Bradford.</note> as probably you knew before now. I want much to hear from Scotsbrig; fear this headache will not let me <hi rend="italic">write</hi> thither today.&#x2014; We got your Emerson Note: E<hi rend="italic">n</hi> writes hither, announcing what speedily followed, a heavy Barrel of Indian Corn in the shape of <hi rend="italic">grain</hi> (without the internal waste substance), whereby the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of corn sent is greatly increased. This also has arrived in the most perfect state of freshness: inclosed in it, moreover, is a small bag of Indian meal or flour, about a stone of it; perfectly fresh that too, pure golden meal (most beautiful to look on), part of which is to be cooked this day for the mutton of dinner. If we had a <hi rend="italic">miller</hi> now, we should prosper in the Indian-corn direction: but where to find a miller? The Croydon Miller too, employed by the Ashburtons, has produced a distinctly sensible addition of <hi rend="italic">sand;</hi> and will not answer. It is very provoking not to know how so simple a service is to be attained in the centre of the world&#x2019;s business: amazing poverty from <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> of wealth! At Ecclefechan I could get it done; in London I believe I cannot.</p>
<p>We shall probably hear from you again on Monday morning? You will get this tomorrow early, and have leisure to write one of us a word. At all events, from Rawdon, where there will be ample space to turn within. And if there is anything you want me to do here before I go, certainly I shall be very ready.</p>
<p>Commend me to the excellent Neuberg;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >With whom John Carlyle was staying in Nottingham.</note> and say, if I had not such a set of <hi rend="italic">nerves</hi>, and such a clay dwellingplace and life-workshop generally, how glad I should feel to be on the road to Newstead<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Newstead Abbey, family home of Lord Byron, ca. 9 mi. from Nottingham.</note> also!</p>
<p>Jane is down stairs; and if not writing her own compliments to you, will be very glad that I send them. Your kindness to her during this last season has greatly advanced you in her regard and gratitude; nor am I quite blind on that side perhaps, tho&#x2019; hitherto silent. Alas, I have to be <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> about innumerable things, about <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things; my whole existence often seems to me a kind of infinite silence,&#x2014;not quite easy to live in at all times. <closer><salute>Good be with you, dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Many thanks for your comfortable kind and instructive Letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1849-06-01">1 June</date> from a hotel in Bray, NE co. Wicklow, where TC had visited in <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, and saying that he would accompany TC on a tour of two or three weeks.</note> I like well to fancy you fishing in the clear waters about Bray, in the still valley of the Dargle, in this weather; and do imagine that whatever else you may catch, there is a real chance of your achieving, in such scenes and employments, some addition of health and composure both to body and mind. Fear nothing for the &#x201C;<date when="1849-06-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date>&#x201C;; there is, I suppose, not the slightest purpose on the part of the official persons to try that operation again;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy wrote: &#x201C;I am waiting in some doubt for the 12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month; still uncertain whether I will be tried again.&#x201C;</note> they know too well that if they did, they have not the least chance to succeed. If it please Heaven, you shall <hi rend="italic">have</hi> passed victoriously thro&#x2019; that most dangerous experiment,&#x2014;dangerous not from Monahan<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Henry Monahan (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18934"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), attorney gen. for Ireland and chief prosecutor of the revolutionaries, <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>.</note> alone, or even chiefly, as I read it,&#x2014;and a new and clearer course will henceforth open for you, not to terminate without results that all wise men will rejoice at. You have an Ireland <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> to be taught by you, readier by you just now than by any other man; and God knows, it needs teaching in all provinces of its affairs, in regard to all matters human and divine! Consider yourself as a brand snatched from the burning;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Zech. 3:2.</note> a <hi rend="italic">providential</hi> man, saved by the beneficent gods, for doing a <hi rend="italic">man&#x2019;s</hi> work yet, in this noisy, bewildered, quack-ridden and devil-ridden world. And let it, this thought, in your modest ingenuous heart, rather give you fear and pious anxiety than exultation or rash self-confidence,&#x2014;as I know it will.</p>
<p>Certainly I mean to avail myself of your guidance, of your proffered company if it will at all suit; and we will take the &#x201C;three weeks&#x201C; in whatever quarter your resources can best profit the common enterprise. Meanwhile, as to time,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I feel that there ought now to be no delay on my part (for in fact I must soon go to Ireland or elsewhither), there has yet been no day fixed; and my speculations and inquiries, which still continue, yield me scattered points of interest all over Ireland; but except the &#x201C;famine districts,&#x201C; which one must see, but would not quite hasten to see, there is no point I am decisively attracted to beyond all others: so that the <pb id="pg-24-65" n="24:65"/>voyage hitherto is still <foreign><hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi></foreign> [vague] as to all its details,&#x2014;as to the day of its commencement, which is the first indispensable detail, A. de Vere advises that I should wait a little till the cholera abate in those sad regions. I myself think of coming by steam from London at once; speculate on starting second Thursday hence, sometimes (in sanguine moments) even <hi rend="italic">first</hi> Thursday!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-06-21">21</date> or <date when="1849-06-14">14 June</date>.</note> Tomorrow I am to consult with Twistleton (an excellent man, who loves Ireland, whom you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have loved had you known him); today I go for the Penny Cyclopedia affairs you spoke of.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy had said: &#x201C;As to Historical topography read the articles on the Irish writers in the &#x2018;Penny Cyclopedia&#x2019;&#x2014; They are the only attempts in that direction by a man who knew what he was about, with whom I am acquainted. The writer has imagination to clothe the dry bones of topography with an agreeable outer garment.&#x201C;</note> I read <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">A Handbook for Travellers in Ireland</hi> by James Fraser, &#x201C;Landscape Gardener and Designer of Rural Improvements&#x201C; (<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>).

<dateline>Friday / <place>5 Cheyne Row</place> [<date when="1849-06-15">15 June 1849</date>]</dateline>
<salute>Dearest Babbie,</salute>
<p>I have been putting off writing from day to day, in expectation of having either to notify to you my final death and burial, or some energetic resolution taken to deliver myself &#x201C;out of this&#x201C;&#x2014; You are to know that with the first warm days back came my <hi rend="italic">sickness</hi> with all its hideous accompaniments, depression of spirits, incapacity of exertion, &#x26;c &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014;enough to make a woman poison herself if she had only the courage; for I can never <pb id="pg-24-66" n="24:66"/>join in with the high flown twaddle about killing oneself being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">a piece of cowardice</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>John who was still here, seemed quite hopeless of any remedy, <hi rend="italic">did</hi> prescribe <hi rend="italic">vitriol</hi> before breakfast&#x2014;thought blue pill might be &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no harm</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;but evidently considered that nothing remained for me but <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>&#x2014;while <hi rend="italic">I</hi> again was of opinion that I had <hi rend="italic">exploited</hi> patience quite long enough. In fact <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the only remnant of health and sanity I find in myself, <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> beginning of <hi rend="italic">Volition</hi>&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">perception</hi> almost amounting to a <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> (and feelings with me become determinating fast enough) that I must not sit here <hi rend="italic">suffering</hi> and doing nothing earthly else, thro&#x2019; all this summer as I did thro all the last;&#x2014;must <hi rend="italic">stir</hi>, in short, under my burden&#x2014;if it were only turning it from one shoulder to another&#x2014; If change of air, or the mere movement do not help, I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> by experience that getting one&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">vicious circle</hi> of ideas broken up by the necessities and contingencies of movement is better for me than either blue pill or <hi rend="italic">vitriol before breakfast</hi>&#x2014; And so&#x2014;I must <hi rend="italic">try to try</hi> this remedy&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C has been talking for many weeks of a tour in Ireland sometimes it seemed quite near at hand, and then again fell back into the vague&#x2014;and when the idea of going somewhere myself came into my mind I postponed the practical consideration of it till he should have fixed his time for going&#x2014;or decided he was not to go at all&#x2014; There will be some difficulties about leaving the house with this new maid who is very trustworthy but dreadfully timorous, and hating loneliness&#x2014;but one cannot sit <hi rend="italic">always</hi> taking care of ones maid-of-all-work&#x2014; So I must just risk the driving her into giving warning&#x2014;tho she <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the very nicest servant I ever had. Once I thought, if M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C went; to stay still here, and ask Helen<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh.</note> to bear me company&#x2014;and that would have been very nice for her and me if&#x2014;I had been in tolerable bodily case&#x2014;but as it is I could not make her visit a bit more agreeable to her than the last was<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1846-11-00">Nov.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-12-00">Dec. 1846</date>; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461107-JWC-HW-01"><sic>21:86&#x2013;128</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1846-11-07">7 Nov. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;and should be losing an opportunity of making <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> a little more fit for the place I still hold among the Living&#x2014; Now for the <hi rend="italic">where?&#x2014;that</hi> is just the difficulty&#x2014; B&#xF6;lte is strong for me going with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to Germany, and she would be a capital person to travel with combining the <hi rend="italic">protecting</hi> powers of a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> with the nursing ones of a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently B&#xF6;lte raised this with Varnhagen, who wrote, <date when="1849-07-08">8 July</date>, expressing pleasure at the prospect of her visiting Berlin with JWC in the autumn, with some misgivings about how agreeable JWC would find the company at that time, though she could be sure that many could speak English (<hi rend="italic">Briefe an eine Freundin</hi> 159, 161&#x2013;62). B&#xF6;lte wrote Varnhagen, <date when="1849-06-15">15 June</date>, that she had discussed <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi> with TC: &#x201C;He looked out so wonderfully into the evening as it fell dark, so that regarding him was truly edifying. Look at his portrait, and imagine to yourself a sentiment [sensitivity] in it, and you will understand how immensely impressive such a countenance can become in that way. Oh! He is magnificent!&#x2014; But you have to intimate rather than say that he pleases you.&#x201C; TC offered her some of his works that she had intended to buy: &#x201C;He said it so calmly and casually&#x2014;you have to have known him for eight years if you are to understand how much kindness and good will he meant, and I had to reply with a desperately cold &#x2018;thank you.&#x2019; &#x2026; I find people in the mass so boring that I always ask myself, when I come back from a big social evening, how I can waste my time like that. What we mean by &#x2018;talking&#x2019; is quite impossible for me, except at the Carlyles&#x2019;, and life and the times are too serious for talking about the events of the day with a &#x2018;civil grin&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 71&#x2013;72, trans.).</note>&#x2014;but <pb id="pg-24-67" n="24:67"/>travelling with any comfort in foreign countries is expensive (tho M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would give me whatever money I ask for) and I fear the fatigue of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a &#x201C;stirring up&#x201C; would extinguish me altogether&#x2014;if that <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a thing to be <hi rend="italic">feared!</hi> Invitations I have in plenty&#x2014;to Rawdon Seaforth Barnsly<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Homes of, respectively, W.

She caught a glimpse of her profile the other day, and it gave her a great start, it looked such a gloomy headachy creature. Laurence she likes vastly, thinking that he alone of artists has a fund of unrealized ideas: &#x2026; there is more kept back than what is given. She talked with much affection and gratitude of W. E.

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Ever since Sunday last I have had a despicable snivelling cold hanging about me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat.</note> fruit of these grim North winds, which we enjoy here in the <hi rend="italic">grey</hi> condition with almost no sun. Add to this a most wearisome Miniature painter,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carrick.</note> who (with almost no effect) has cut out the flower of every morning for me; and has not yet ended, tho&#x2019; he is now reduced to after-dinner hours&#x2014;and in fact may end when he like, for he will never manage his affair, I perceive.</p>
<p>So that I have been obliged to give up Thursday <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, but do now definitely say <hi rend="italic">Thursday <pb id="pg-24-69" n="24:69"/>come a week.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-06-28">28 June</date>.</note> Barring accidents, I mean to sail on that day (10 a.m.) in the Steamer for Dublin from this Port; when the Steamer will arrive, you can perhaps tell <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, for I do not yet leave here, having hitherto been no farther eastward than the office in the Regent&#x2019;s Circus in prosecution of my inquiry. Expect me then however, if accidents befall not, and if with utmost industry I do not fail to get these innumerable ragtaggeries settled or suppressed in time for that morning; &#x201C;Thursday come a week,&#x201C; which I think is the 28th of the month, is announced as my day of sailing. Mrs Carlyle purposes, in a day or two after, to set out for Scotland and some secluded visiting among friends. Forster<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. E. Forster.</note> <hi rend="italic">may</hi> now, for what I know, appear in Dublin about the same time; his perennial cheerfulness, intelligent, hearty, and active habits would render him a very useful element in such an expedition, I believe. But at any rate, I am delighted that you go with me, and I really anticipate a little good from the business for myself and for all of us.</p>
<p>Twistleton, whom I see again to-morrow, will furnish the introductions you suggest. If the <hi rend="italic">Agent</hi> of any English Estate, or indeed I suppose of any chief Irish one, could prove serviceable, most probably some of my friends here could procure it for me; but that, at any rate, can be managed from Ireland quite as well. Of Irish aristocrats I remember only Stafford O&#x2019;Brien, Lord Bessborough, Castlereagh &#x26;c,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Augustus Stafford O&#x2019;Brien Stafford (<date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>), Tory M.P. for Northamptonshire N, <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>. John George Brabazon Ponsonby (<date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), 5th earl of Bessborough since <date when="1847-05-00">May</date> <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>; he wrote a letter of intro. for TC to his Irish agent, <date when="1849-06-29">29 June</date>, which TC docketed: &#x201C;Earl of Besborough to his agent, Kilkenny C<hi rend="italic">y</hi>&#x201C; (MS: NLS 1773.190). Charles William Stewart (<date when="1778-00-00">1778</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26467"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 3d marquess of Londonderry, Viscount Castlereagh.</note> none of whom, by the aspect of him, had much promise for me. I suppose the Imperial Hotel<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sackville St., Dublin.</note> is as good as any? Please say, and consider of tours and of methods, &#x26;c, for two persons, and for third Kildare, Maynooth,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kildare SW of Dublin, and Maynooth NW, site of the College of St. Patrick, the Roman Catholic seminary.</note> &#x26;c, and then southward along the coast. Three days in Dublin, or even two.&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>You have really been very ill served with Letters this long while; the more is the shame to us,&#x2014;but in fact all things have been lying in a <hi rend="italic">fallow</hi>, ill-conducted, unprofitable and ungainly state with me for one, which has impeded the discharge of a great many duties! My work has stood at a dead-lock, this long while; my poor <hi rend="italic">inner-man</hi> (meaning both soul and stomach by that term) has been in a bad way. I am only beginning <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> see, and that still a good way off, some kind of course for myself into rather clearer country.&#x2014; You have been terribly bothered too, in your household, I find, and little able to demand Letters from us. One little word, tho&#x2019; in great haste, I will despatch to you today.</p>
<p>Jenny wrote to me from Scotsbrig, last week; our Mother had caught a kind of cold, which Jenny represented as nearly gone again: the rest of them were all as usual. Jack is not arrived there, nor has he yet, I suppose, <pb id="pg-24-71" n="24:71"/>appointed any time; but he is on the <hi rend="italic">way</hi> thither; he left us, near a fortnight ago; went to Nottingham to a certain Mr Neuberg (a friend of ours who has become his); staid there about a week, and is now with one Forster (another of the same) at a place called Rawdon, near Leeds in Yorkshire. Whether he has any more visits to pay I do not know: but he is, you see, slowly proceeding Northward, and you may expect to see him before long.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote TC from Rawdon, <date when="1849-06-22">22 June</date>, that next day he was to go as far as Preston with Mrs. Paulet and perhaps also to Northwich to see Mrs. Watt.</note></p>
<p>As to us here, we have been in a weakly way of health &#x26;c, but have now decided in some measure what we are to do by way of trying to help ourselves. I, after much speculation and inquiry, have resolved upon a bit of a Tour into Ireland: I mean to go and look into that doomed Country, a little, with my own eyes; calculate in spending perhaps four weeks there,&#x2014;am engaged, at all events, to set sail for Dublin from this Port on <hi rend="italic">Thursday come a week;</hi> and shall then see how my subsequent journeyings are to be ordered. Duffy (late &#x201C;Rebel,&#x201C; a most excellent young man, much attached to me, and well acquainted with all that is Irish in Ireland) is eager to accompany me; Forster (the Young Quaker whom John is now with, and who has been in the West of Ireland with &#x201C;Quaker Deputations &#x26;c) will also attend whenever we summon him: Four weeks in the open summer air, and in continual locomotion, will surely do my unfortunate <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> some good;&#x2014;and from Ireland, if I learn little that I do not already know or guess, I calculate on getting a great many suggestions that will further me in spiritual respects. At all events, I shall have <hi rend="italic">the Problem</hi> lying visible before my eyes, all the while; for there, in that starving distressed Country, <hi rend="italic">there</hi> it is that the &#x201C;universal Imposture&#x201C; has fallen prostrate into due ruin,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 28:399&#x2013;400, and <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi> 4:322&#x2013;23.</note> and is demanding of all men, &#x201C;What will you do with me?&#x201C;&#x2014; My good old Mother protests vehemently, thro&#x2019; Jenny, on the score of &#x201C;danger&#x201C;: but I will assure her, and you must all assure her, that there is no &#x201C;danger&#x201C; at all,&#x2014;less, I do believe, than in any other home travelling whatsoever:&#x2014;so I go, as you hear, on the day named, and indeed must go, there being nothing so like helping me that I can think of just now.&#x2014; Of course, by the aid of penny stamps, I will keep you in some kind of communication; direct you where to write &#x26;c. And at the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of my Irish Tour I calculate on coming over by Steamer to some Scotch Port (Glasgow, Ardrossan, Annan itself), and seeing you all as my next step! That is my arrangement, let us hope it will all run right.</p>
<p>Poor Jane is very feckless, and the summer does not help her here: but <pb id="pg-24-72" n="24:72"/>she too means to have a little Country and I think in Scotland this time. She will go North into Fife first, where her Cousin the Minister, and a good little Sister of his are;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walter and Jeannie Welsh.</note> good people both;&#x2014;and, I hope, be decidedly better when I rejoin her, after my wanderings.&#x2014; Alas, alas, yearly I grow more averse to roaming of all kinds, more desirous to sit down and not stir again at all; but that will not do just yet, the rule lies the other way as yet for a space.&#x2014; I will send your Letter on today to John, who will perhaps write to you; but indeed he writes hardly to anybody (at least little to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>), and we have to give him credit for <hi rend="italic">wishing</hi> to do it. I am terribly bothered and busy,&#x2014;with hundreds of things! You had better forward this to Scotsbrig, till I write to my Mother herself in a day or two. Poor Jane Grierson,&#x2014;poor everybody! <closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here is a Note from Jean this morning; to whom I have written, hinting also that you perhaps would speedily write. But I added that you did not seem very alert at that species of employment just now! We will believe you to be doing well with your kind Host at Rawdon, and the kind summer sun and Yorkshire breezes, which does truly form a better occupation than writing Letters or whatever else if you are not obliged to it.</p>
<p>A second Note is come from Duffy,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1849-06-13">13 June</date>, at the top of which TC asked &#x201C;to return me this.&#x201C; Duffy said: &#x201C;If you leave home as you propose on Thursday the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> I will be quite disengaged on your arrival and ready to go anywhere. &#x2026; / If Larcom, Kane and the other men in Dublin whom I mentioned [in the letter of <date when="1849-06-01">1 June</date>], interest you I wish you would take an introduction to some one of them from Mr. Twisleton, or other official persons&#x2014; I know them all a little, but they are in the employment of Gover<hi rend="italic">t</hi> and my relation to the powers that be is not a friendly one.

<salute>Sir,</salute>
<p>You must in no wise dream of quitting your present situation till you have found footing on another. No man, by many interviews, could possibly judge of your fitness for any form of Authorship; and if I or anybody did ever know that you were fit, and could certify the same with never such assurance, it would still be far from surmounting the difficulty,&#x2014;your distance from actual employment would still be far, very far! In no province of human industry is there hungrier competition, and more dark stolidity awarding the decision, than in that same.</p>
<p>A man prepares himself for Authorship by silently amassing knowledge for a long time, above all by silently amassing <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi>, patience, perseverance and human virtues; he gradually tries (in Periodicals, Newspapers &#x26;c) whether he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write with acceptance, taking with loyal patience such answer as he <hi rend="italic">gets;</hi>&#x2014;and after that, looks out for some feasible engagement; very seldom, I believe, finding one that is not <hi rend="italic">un</hi>wholesome and wellnigh intolerable to him.</p>
<p>Your inexperience much misleads you, furthermore, as to the kind of associates, and form of companionship you might hope to fall into as Sub-editor or Author in general. Not here, any more than in your present place, will a wise and honourable soul feel himself in the least at home. To such a one the world is not anywhere a &#x201C;school of virtue&#x201C;; it is rather, at present especially, as an abominable kennel of mad dogs that a good man will have to view his co-mates in most professions,&#x2014;with pity, not with rage, in <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> generally, yet with a determined resolution to keep apart from <hi rend="italic">their</hi> downward course, and (with Heaven&#x2019;s help) by no means to do as they do.&#x2014; Authorship, I am sorry to say, offers no exception to this sad rule, but is rather one of the more flagrant instances of it.</p>
<p>Among the respectablest and <hi rend="italic">enviablest</hi> men I have ever known in this world have been three or four instances of handicraftsmen, mechanical labourers. With courageous patience, thrift, prudence, and piety of heart (very rare virtues at present) I know no situation in life more safe and wholesome. If you have superior gifts and strength, it is natural you should struggle upwards, but I would by no means recommend Authorship or any merely speculative and <hi rend="italic">talking</hi> trade, as the course.</p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I hope you got Alick&#x2019;s Letter, thro&#x2019; John, the other day; and also that Jean, as I requested her, forwarded a Note of mine,&#x2014;which would give you some light as to our situation and intended movements here, and satisfy you that at least nothing had gone wrong. Has your cold gone completely away yet? We have beautiful westerly weather, not too hot either, and I have quite shaken off a wretched snivelling ailment of the same kind, which had affected me during the easterly winds.&#x2014; I am, as you may fancy, exceedingly busy in these days; but I could not think of going out again today, without sending a salutation and assurance to my dear good mother, who is generally in my thoughts all days.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Note would inform you I am still bent for Ireland; appointed to go this day week. Various friends are waiting to see me, in parts of that country; my speculations too are all pointing towards remedy of the horrible misery which discloses itself more <hi rend="italic">there</hi> than anywhere else, but which exists <hi rend="italic">everywhere</hi>, in all countries, in these unhappy days: I calculate that I have a kind of secret obligation to go and look at it with own eyes, and ask myself, <hi rend="italic">What</hi> can be done with it? I too have a kind of duty laid on me to speak out, and say, if I at all know!&#x2014; Besides I am fallen dreadfully <hi rend="italic">torpid</hi> (quite <hi rend="italic">dazed</hi> and dull in the inner man of me) this long while, and feel that I shall be much better for a thorough <hi rend="italic">stirring up</hi> for 2 or 3 weeks. The Country is wholesome beyond others, and <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> for travelling, as Middlebie Parish itself:&#x2014;nay, as I said, I have more than one <hi rend="italic">friend</hi> in it, who personally likes me well. So let me go and look. I will write again before I go; and regularly while there. And the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of my Irish Tour, I calculate, will be far the nicest part of it all: a voyage across from the North to poor old Scotland and poor old Annandale again; where some time (perhaps early) in <date when="1849-08-00">August</date>, I may hope to see my dear old Mother, and kind Scotsbrig with its friends, once more! <hi rend="italic">Amen.</hi></p>
<p>We heard from John today;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter dated from Rawdon, <date when="1849-06-19">19 June</date>, returning Duffy&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1849-06-13">13 June</date>: &#x201C;I have shown your note to Forster, &#x26; he will probably write to-day or to-morrow to make suggestions for the journey which he thinks may prove useful. / I have had a great talent for silence ever since I left Chelsea &#x26; have written less fully than I ought.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>On Thursday next I am going off for Ireland; intending to have a stroll for three or four weeks there,&#x2014;my patriotic feelings, and my state of health bodily and mental, suggesting such an expedition to me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod faustum sit</hi></foreign> [May it be successful]. I do not well know my course yet; but think generally of crossing and thwarting the whole Island (perhaps going round by the Coast Towns mainly); so that I may carry off some real view of that unfortunate province of God&#x2019;s Creation, such as my own eyes and observation shall authentically yield. Duffy, Traitor Duffy, who, apart from the repeal frenzy which indeed he has now abandoned, is a really excellent fellow,&#x2014;will probably escort me thro&#x2019; part of my course; at least initiate me into the modes of Irish travel; after whom there is a certain English Forster, a young Devonshire-Yorkshire man, &#x201C;Transition-Quaker&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. E. Forster was from a Quaker family. TC may refer to his not wearing Quaker dress or using special forms of speech. When he formally left the Soc. of Friends, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>, it was because his marriage to the da. of a Church of England clergyman required him to leave. Duffy wrote, <date when="1849-06-21">21 June</date>: &#x201C;I will be ready and have cut and dry &#x2026; plans of a tour. I have spoken to one of the superiors of Maynooth, since you express a desire to go there, and the College will be open to you. / The Imperial Hotel is an unexceptionable one. &#x2026; My friends are on the eve of being removed from this, and under circumstances that make my heart sink to think of. I mean OBrien &#x26; Meagher.&#x201C; William Smith O&#x2019;Brien and T. F. Meagher were being transported to Van Diemen&#x2019;s Land (Tasmania).</note> and <pb id="pg-24-77" n="24:77"/>extensive man of business at Bradford, an excellent cheery friendly character too, who will perhaps carry me into Munster. I think of bathing once or twice at Kilkee,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kilkee, seaside resort on a small inlet, SW co. Clare.</note> and of looking in for half a day upon Gweedore and Lord G. Hill:&#x2014;in short, all is yet <foreign><hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi></foreign> [uncertain], and a most manageable matter; except that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> to sail from the Tower wharf for Dublin by steam on Thursday morning first, and that is a matter that can only be managed by such rules as are its own.&#x2014; Meanwhile I am picking up all manner of notices of <foreign><hi rend="italic">notabilia</hi></foreign>, a few introductions to desirable men included; these will constitute so many lucent-points in the dark labyrinth of Ireland, and serve to indicate routes for me when once in Dublin. It is partly with that view too that I now send you this advertisement.</p>
<p>If you were a sufficiently adventurous fellow, and would appear with your knapsack on board the Dublin Steamer on Thursday, and undertake to bear me company by sea and land,&#x2014;that would really be a handsome and hopeful thing; that would be the right thing! And I do believe good would come of it; and it might easily be made to answer very well. But failing that&#x2014;you see what it is I want. If you remember anywhere in Ireland a man whom you think would in real truth be mutually profitable that I should see in passing, give me a Note to him, and I will at least try to deliver it Failing men, or along with men, give me note of things worth seeing,&#x2014;such as rise <hi rend="italic">first</hi> in your mind; for these probably will be the truest;&#x2014;and indeed it is not worth while, either as to men or things intended here, that you should be at the cost of any study or bother: such hints as occur to you, dashed off in half an hour, will fully satisfy me; and if there should be no &#x201C;man&#x201C; mentioned at all, perhaps that would be no damage,&#x2014;for it is very uncertain whether, even with letters in my pocket, I shall be able to muster &#x201C;faith and hope&#x201C; enough to make many new acquaintances in the Sister Island, or penetrate into private houses there. Aubrey de Vere (of the Limerick Monteagle clan)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Monteagle was De Vere&#x2019;s maternal uncle.</note> has undertaken to present me to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Six</hi> really good Landlords,&#x201C; of whom I can remember only a Sir Charles Coote,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Charles Henry Coote (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), 9th bart. of Ballyfin, Queen&#x2019;s co.; M.P. for Queen&#x2019;s co., <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">47</date>, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>; premier bart. of Ireland.</note> and the Gweedore Lord above mentioned.

And to such length hitherto, and no farther, has the adventure proceeded; and there I leave it with you, to try what threads out of your skein will suit into the tissue of it;&#x2014;to beg your blessing on the business at any rate. If you would go with me indeed&#x2014; But you will not! Remember however that Thursday is the day, and that time is getting valuable.</p>
<p>I have nearly got the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> hustled off my shoulders, tho&#x2019; the Printers are yet far behind with it; hardly more than half done, I think. The <hi rend="italic">Squire Papers</hi> go as a kind of outlying baggage into a corner of one of the volumes, where a gap of room was at any rate ready for them; they and certain <hi rend="italic">Committee Lists</hi> &#x26;c, which you will get in a separate shape so soon as they are printed. I am utterly sick of that business; and often ask impatiently, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quando sit finis</hi></foreign> [When will it end]?</p>
<p>We are much interested in Mazzini and Roman matters during these weeks. It is beautiful and even solemn to me to reflect on poor Mazzini (one of the purest and highest souls now in this world, but filled with democratic and other nonsense in the head of him); and how the Eternal Destinies take note of what real good is in a man, and do at last <supplied>[bring]</supplied><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS cut, but word added in an unknown hand.</note> him to the place where he can to right profit expend the same! It is Mazzini&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">shrill</hi>, religious, enthusiastic spirit that I believe to be now principally animating Rome to this resolute resistance: a <hi rend="italic">protest</hi> against the &#x201C;wretched old Chimera of a Pope,&#x201C; which is fast becoming important, and is already impressive to all the world. Honour to the poor noble Mazzini; and joy to him if he even leave his life there,&#x2014;as he will be right willing to do, I believe, if there be a call for <hi rend="italic">it</hi> among other things.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The position of the defenders was now desperate. Mazzini and Garibaldi were for continuing the fight from the mountains, but the assembly voted, <date when="1849-06-30">30 June</date>, for surrender, the triumvirate resigned, and, soon after, Mazzini took refuge on a ship at Civitavecchia. The French occupied Rome, <date when="1849-07-03">3 July</date>.</note></p>
<p>London offers no point of news to me that is in the least worth transmitting by pen and ink. Flunkeyism, Fashionablism; idle talk, idle thought, and still idler action fill up as heretofore the (intrinsically scandalous) <pb id="pg-24-79" n="24:79"/>course of men&#x2019;s life in this place. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Quamdiu, Domine</hi></foreign> [How long, O Lord]!&#x201C;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. 6:10.</note></p>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>Your Dublin Agent for Ships is right, and I am wrong: the big &#x201C;Thursday&#x201C; <pb id="pg-24-80" n="24:80"/>with a constant &#x201C;10 a.m,&#x201C; which figures on the Bill, I now find is applicable only to <hi rend="italic">Cork</hi> &#x26;c,&#x2014;while for Dublin the days of sailing are &#x201C;Wednesday and Saturday&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Duffy had written to TC, <date when="1849-06-21">21 June</date>.</note> (if one look narrowly, with spectacles, into the corners of the thing); and what is more, their <hi rend="italic">hour</hi> of sailing seems to be variable, sometimes so early in the morning as would not suit me at all! So that what to do I now know not,&#x2014;for the hour of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> day (either Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> or Saturday next) does not stand on this Bill, and is still a matter of investigation for me up in Town. Add to which, I am sunk over head and ears in a new avalanche of Cromwell rubbish all this day (the <hi rend="italic">last</hi>, I do hope, of that particular species of employment!)&#x2014;and I have barely time to save the Post, and send you a word <hi rend="italic">postponing</hi> the exact decision. <hi rend="italic">About</hi> Thursday, since not on that day, it shall still be: Saturday following would suit, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> the hour of the morning suited, but that is yet <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub lite</hi></foreign> [pending].&#x2014; On the whole, Holyhead<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On Anglesey, NW Wales, the nearest port for Dublin.</note> and the Railway still survive. My attraction for the other route was partly that I might see once the Southern Shores of England; also that I might be left <hi rend="italic">entirely alone</hi> which, for two days in a returning Dublin Steamer, calculated might well be my lot. Alone, and very <hi rend="italic">miserable</hi>, it will beseem me to be, a good deal, in this the most original of my &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Tours.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; Brief, on Monday will try to settle it, and then tell you.</p>
<p>Forster does not come with me; will <hi rend="italic">join</hi> me where I like after &#x26;c &#x26;c. I mean that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> shall initiate me into the methods of Irish Travel, and keep me company (perhaps parting for a day or two, here and there) so far as our routes, once fixed upon, will go together. Your friendly cheerfulness, your knowledge of Ireland, all your goodness to me, I must make available. Define to yourself what it is <hi rend="italic">you</hi> specially aim towards in travelling; that I may see how far without straining I can draw upon you.</p>
<p>People are giving me Letters &#x26;c; Aubrey de Vere has undertaken for &#x201C;Six <hi rend="italic">good</hi> Irish Landlords,&#x201C;&#x2014;vehemently protesting that &#x201C;Six&#x201C; (suggested by me) is not the maximum number. He wishes to send me across direct to Kilkee (Clare Co<hi rend="italic">y</hi>) where his friends now are. A day or two of pause at some nice bathing-place, to swim about, and then sit silent looking out on the divine salt-flood, is very inviting to my fancy; but Kilkee all at once will not be the place, I find.</p>
<p>Twistleton brought his successor Power down with him last night; I hoped Power might have been an Irishman, but I do not think he is. T<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is decidedly a <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> to Ireland, I reckon, as matters now stand: a man of much loyalty, pious affection, stout intelligence, and manful capability every way.</p>
<p>I have read a good many of your friend Ferguson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Irish Counties</hi>, which <pb id="pg-24-81" n="24:81"/>is slow work, if one hold fast by the Map, but is very instructive: I wish these Articles existed as a separate Book; I would take them with me as the best <foreign><hi rend="italic">Vademecum</hi></foreign> on such a journey. Have you got the Book <hi rend="italic">Facts from Gweedore?</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490618-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1849-06-18">18 June</date></ref>.</note> I never could see it yet, but consider it well worth seeing. Irish <hi rend="italic">Songs</hi> you also remember.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy replied, [<date when="1849-06-26">26 June</date>], that he had the <hi rend="italic">Facts</hi> and the songs, which he had held back, meaning to show TC &#x201C;the half dozen out of as many hundred which have taken universal root in the country.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>A Mr Miley,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Miley (<date when="1805-00-00">1805?</date>&#x2013;<date when="1861-00-00">61</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18705"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), priest and ecclesiastical historian; educ. at Maynooth and Rome; curate of metropolitan parish, Dublin, <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>; accompanied O&#x2019;Connell on his final journey to Italy, 1847; rector of the Irish College, Paris, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>.</note> a Catholic Priest of your City, was to have come to me one day; but I think the unfortunate Painter<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carrick.</note> must have deterred Lucas and him; at all events, they did not appear.</p>
<p>Enough for this day; on Monday a more definite prophecy, as to time at least.</p>

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Your Note did not reach me till today; the Book did, safely and at once; for which many thanks. I mean to read it as I sail.</p>
<p>By all means send me a Note to Pym,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jonathan Pim (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1885-00-00">85</date>), partner in Pim Bros. &#x26; Co., poplin manufacturers, cotton spinners, linen weavers, and flour millers, 22 William St., Dublin; author of <hi rend="italic">The Condition and Prospects of Ireland</hi> (<date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>). Duffy had mentioned Pim, <date when="1849-06-01">1 June</date>, as someone TC might want to meet, a person &#x201C;who has introduced one or two new fabrics among our small manufacturers, and written a book on the commercial capacities of the country.&#x201C;</note> if it can readily be done. I am getting Notes for all manner of <hi rend="italic">Note</hi>worthy people (to express myself in a <hi rend="italic">pun</hi>); and can either deliver them or not, as I find on the spot to be best. Both ways they are worth having; even as a chance or possibility, there is some good in such a Letter.</p>
<p>So far as I can calculate appearances, my Wife seems likely to lift anchor shortly after me; that is, some time next week: I go, the end of this. She has Rawdon decidedly in her eye, after Nottingham and perhaps a day at Barnsley.</p>
<p>What my Irish movements are to be, hangs in the clouds till I get to <pb id="pg-24-82" n="24:82"/>Dublin, and see Duffy, and hear and see a great many testimonies and monitions.</p>

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>I had to go deep into the City yesterday in quest of precise information; did not see the Steamer itself after all; but found authentically that its name was &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">The Athlone</hi>, Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Williams,&#x201C; and the hour &#x201C;10, on Saturday morning next,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-06-30">30 June</date>.</note>&#x2014;with expected arrival in Dublin on the morning of <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> following. Even this bit of information I did not get till the Post-hour was gone; so could not write till now.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, by the Athlone, or by something else and better if I fail in the Athlone (of which you shall have notice), expect me, therefore; not <hi rend="italic">later</hi> than that day: and so let one point, the preliminary of all, be <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>, at last.</p>
<p>A stock of Letters, to be used or not, for Dublin and other places, especially for the ruined West, is accumulating on me: in Dublin I have a Dr Stokes, Dr Kennedy, Chambers Walker,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Stokes (<date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>&#x2013;<date when="1878-00-00">78</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/26561"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician, regius prof. of medicine in Dublin Univ. since <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>. Evory Kennedy (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1886-00-00">86</date>), M.D., <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>; master of Dublin lying-in hospital. Roger Chambers Walker (d. <date when="1851-00-00">1851</date>), lawyer; B.A., Trinity College, Dublin, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>; M.A., <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>; called to Irish bar, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>; Q.C., <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; lived at 2 Upper Granby Row, Dublin, and had a country home at Sligo.</note> and various military and official people;&#x2014;certainly longer than &#x201C;two days&#x201C; will be needed in Dublin, if I am to get much good of these people; but I will make what despatch proves possible.</p>
<p>You, have your &#x201C;routes&#x201C; in a state of readiness; that we may be able at once to get to business. At present Maynooth, Kildare Town, and then some march across to Glendalough, or through Wicklow Gap, is figuring in my imagination; after which Wexford, Ross, Waterford &#x26;c&#x2014; But in my present state of insight all hangs in the clouds. I wish only I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> fairly among the Hills and Green Places, with the summer breeze blowing round me, and a friendly soul to guide and cheer me in my pilgrimings. Kildare I respect for St Bridget&#x2019;s sake,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Bride</hi>kirk (her Kirk, I suppose) was almost the place of my birth; and Bridget herself, under the Oaks 1400 years ago, is for her own sake beautiful to me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bridget (453&#x2013;523), a patron saint of Ireland; da. of an Ulster prince, she was freed from parental control by an Ulster king because of her extraordinary piety and founded four monasteries. Her cell, the first in Ireland, was erected under a large oak tree in what is now Kildare, 30 mi. SW of Dublin nr. the river Curragh. TC&#x2019;s grandfather, Thomas Carlyle, often visited his kinsman Adam Carlyle, the laird of Bridekirk, in Annan, where possibly TC&#x2019;s mother visited just before TC&#x2019;s birth.</note> One Fitzgerald, a <hi rend="italic">Suffolk</hi> <pb id="pg-24-83" n="24:83"/>Irish friend of long standing, offers me introduction to some specifically Irish family of his kindred in that region,&#x2014;on the Curragh itself, if I remember.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward FitzGerald wrote to TC, [ca. <date when="1849-06-25">25 June</date>]: &#x201C;I will send a note to my Kildare relatives to apprize them of your probable approach&#x2014; Their address is / M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Purcell&#x2014; / Halverstown / <hi rend="italic">Kilcullen</hi>&#x2014; / in County Kildare, about 30 English miles from Dublin: and going through some of the best cultivated part of Ireland&#x2014; / You do not love the picturesque for picturesque&#x2019;s sake&#x2014; But go into Wicklow so far as the &#x2018;Seven Churches&#x2019; by the side of their lake in Glendalough&#x2014;spend a summer&#x2019;s evening there. &#x2026; You should get letters to the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Leinster</hi>, who is, I was told, a very good sort of man in all ways.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This morning, I hope, you received two foolish American Magazines, containing a Review of E. Irving and of myself;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly essays on <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heroes</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">American Whig Review</hi> 9 (<date when="1849-02-00">Feb.</date> and <date when="1849-04-00">April 1849</date>): 121&#x2013;34, 339&#x2013;44.</note> which would be a token from us to my Mother, and might entertain for a while when reading-time came. The review is by a seemingly very young and silly fellow,&#x2014;and is worth nothing at all or thereby.</p>
<p>Today and every day I am still busy with my Irish preparations: but my Steamer, I now find, does not go <hi rend="italic">for Dublin</hi> on Thursday morning; it goes <pb id="pg-24-84" n="24:84"/>on &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> at 10 a.m.&#x201C; (an &#x201C;excellent large ship,&#x201C; I hear, and &#x201C;few likely to be in it&#x201C;): it is by that conveyance I am now to go, so far as yet decided. The voyage is of &#x201C;four days,&#x201C; till Wednesday,&#x2014;almost half to America! But on the other hand, one will be left entirely <hi rend="italic">private</hi>, will see the Southern Coast &#x26;c, not otherwise likely to be seen;&#x2014;can <hi rend="italic">read</hi>, I suppose, and may expect from the fresh breezes and other influences some benefit perhaps. <hi rend="italic">On Wednesday</hi> (tomorrow week) I have engaged to be in Dublin: one <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get, by Holyhead &#x26;c, in 13 hours; I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> go by Nottingham, with a little rest there, and sight of the &#x201C;new bridge&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning that he might go by rail to Holyhead via Nottingham, catching sight of Telford&#x2019;s new Britannia railway bridge over the Menai Straits between Anglesey and the mainland. The first tube of the bridge had been successfully raised, <date when="1849-06-20">20 June</date>.</note> (hardly worth a doit to me): but feel at present as if I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to prefer the Steamer way. With what despatch I can I am getting all sorted towards that object; you shall hear of me again before I set off on Saturday. Jane, after my departure, is to be carried out to Addiscombe till Monday; after which begins the <hi rend="italic">thorough</hi> hurlyburly (lifting of carpets, scouring of blankets &#x26;c), and in the end of that same week she will probably herself go.</p>
<p>I have packed <hi rend="italic">all</hi> your Books with some of my own, and old clothes &#x26;c atop: the <hi rend="italic">Goldsmith&#x2019;s History</hi> is for Jamie; the <hi rend="italic">Dombey and Son</hi> can go to Jean; the <hi rend="italic">Howe</hi> (unfortunately too unwieldy) my Mother will accept.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No doubt a reprint of one of Goldsmith&#x2019;s histories of Rome, England, or Greece.

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>The &#x201C;Athlone,&#x201C; which is to sail with me tomorrow at 10 a.m. promises to arrive in Kingston<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Kingstown, city and extensive harbor on S shore of Dublin Bay, named after George IV, but once Dunleary or Dun Laoghaire, which it is now renamed.</note> about 5 on <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>,&#x2014;or perhaps it may come up to Dublin altogether, if at a <hi rend="italic">later</hi> hour: that is the program they gave me yesterday. The Imperial H&#xF4;tel, you know, is my place after that.</p>
<p>I have an immense sta<supplied>[c]</supplied>k<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> of Letters, chiefly to people in Kerry, Clare &#x26;c, and one or two for Cork, Limerick and Donegal Counties: Poor Law Inspectors, Agents of big Estates, Gentries, Nobilities &#x26;c:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ulick John de Burgh (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), 1st marquess of Clanricarde (see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18470205-JWC-HW-01"><sic>21:155</sic><corr>JWC to HW, <date when="1847-02-05">5 Feb. 1847</date></corr></ref>), sent TC, <date when="1849-06-27">27 June</date>, a number of letters of introduction to various persons in Ireland. On his letter TC later wrote: &#x201C;Marquis of Clanricarde to me. Didn&#x2019;t deliver any of his letters.&#x201C; At Lord Clanricarde&#x2019;s request his nephew, the 3d marquess of Sligo, wrote to &#x201C;one Goldea, a Priest&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note), <date when="1849-06-26">26 June</date>: &#x201C;Carlyle the author is making a tour of the West of Ireland &#x26; I doubt not will visit Westport &#x26; Newport&#x2014;upon which I take the liberty of introducing him to you, as I am sure you will give him every facility for dispelling that ignorance of our state and our wants, which is after all our greatest practical enemy.

<p>As want of <hi rend="italic">faculty to sleep</hi> is my <foreign><hi rend="italic">b&#xEA;te noire</hi></foreign> in all travelling, and the Athlone is likely to emit me in rather a questionable state in that respect, I have more than once had a notion that perhaps some quiet <hi rend="italic">Lodging</hi> for a week,&#x2014;such as one of your benevolent Ladies could have soon sought out for me, in a house of clearly sober people who had an unexceptionable <hi rend="italic">Bedroom</hi> (and such <hi rend="italic">Sitting</hi> Room as pleased Heaven,&#x2014;might have suited me better, me to whom noise is horrible: but the whole matter has hung so vague hitherto I never &#x201C;could propose it definitely, or bring it farther than the form of an <hi rend="italic">aspiration</hi>,&#x201C; in which state you now have it!

<salute>Dear Mr Neuberg,</salute>
<p>Whatever your answer be tomorrow, I already find on reflexion that the thought of Nottingham and your hospitable home is nothing but a cowardly shirking from the real tug of difficulty, which first of all presents itself to me, in the shape of a Steam Voyage &#x201C;by the Athlone&#x201C; round by the Southern Coast and the Land&#x2019;s End<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cape on SW coast of Cornwall, westernmost point.</note> to Dublin: a most ugly operation, but one predetermined on, and which no <hi rend="italic">cowardice</hi> ought to make one flinch from! Alas, I go by that route tomorrow; and your hospitable program, if you have formed one (which means, I think, if you are at home), is already cancelled: I shall be near London Bridge <hi rend="italic">on my voyage</hi> about the time your answer arrives here! Mrs Carlyle in about a week afterwards will explain everything, my part is to <hi rend="italic">go</hi> by this ugly route, instead of sneaking from it for a pleasanter one.</p>
<p>Nottingham I mean to try if I can hit on my return hitherward. If I do not see it while you are there, it will be a disappointment.</p>

<p>When I could not distinguish your white hat any longer, I went home, and sat down to cry a little; but Elizabeth<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sprague.</note> put a stop to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, by coming in with&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">your plaid</hi> over her arm! and expressing her surprise that master hadn&#x2019;t taken it,&#x2014;the plaid forgotten! and the day so cold!&#x2014;for one frantic moment I was for running back to the pier and plunging into the water on my own basis, and swimming after you with the plaid in my mouth; but a very little reflection turned me from this course, and instead, I proceeded to the kitchen and silently boiled my strawberries&#x2014;like a practical woman. Then I stowed away some of the valuables, and dressed myself, and, no one having come for my portmanteau, I took it with me in the omnibus to the top of Sloan street, where I had it and myself transfered to a cab;&#x2014;for greater dignity&#x2019;s sake!

<p><salute>My dearest little Goody and friend of friends!&#x2014;</salute> Here I am since about an hour, right glad to be off the boisterous deep, to be <hi rend="italic">in</hi> clean linen with a shaven chin, and writing to my little Jeannie again. I have just had one great disappointment, however: I have run over to the Post-Office, and find that it all <hi rend="italic">shut</hi>, (except the <hi rend="italic">receiving</hi> offices) at 7 o&#x2019;clock! So that Letters of yours and perhaps of Jack are perhaps there, and not obtainable till tomorrow morning. Patience, patience: I made sure of finding something, and found only that.</p>
<p>Our voyage has been boisterous, adventurous to a degree, and worst of all, has been nearly <hi rend="italic">sleepless;</hi> yet I find it to have been <hi rend="italic">successful:</hi> I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> the Coast, seen many curious persons, objects and oddities, which will serve us many a night for talk, I hope,&#x2014;or in some future Letter I may <hi rend="italic">write</hi> them; but I must <hi rend="italic">hurry</hi> and not write just now. Oh me, after all!&#x2014; Ventnor,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Town in S Isle of Wight, where John Sterling died.</note> to which we hung close for about an hour on Sunday morning, you may well believe, was interesting to me. So was Looe in Cornwall<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Home of the Buller family.</note> the next morning. I <hi rend="italic">left a card</hi> for Barclay Fox at Falmouth,&#x2014;for the curiosity of the thing. Not that I landed myself (I durst not risk for time), but I sent my card ashore by a clerk that had to land. We staid <hi rend="italic">all night</hi> in Plymouth Harbour: O unforgettable night, supreme in wretchedness, a heavy rain falling, our little cabin a-choke of foul air, and a huge porpoise of a fellow-passenger <hi rend="italic">snoring</hi>, next berth to us, like a walrus! I rose to write to <hi rend="italic">thee</hi>, the thought occurring to me that I <hi rend="italic">could;</hi> what I made of it, at the cabin table, amid a crowd of people talking and twaddling,&#x2014;here is the <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> itself still sticking in the blottingbook, and I will send it for a sign. It was <hi rend="italic">after</hi> that that the Walrus (a fat one-eyed man, of dreadful <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> powers) who came in while I was writing, had <hi rend="italic">resumed</hi> his snoring practice,&#x2014;unexampled, I believe, in the world. God help us&#x2014;I fled from him into the wet in despair, then into the dark main cabin, and at length found a Corner where on a sofa I was out of hearing of him, and then (in my clothes, with some rubbish thrown over me) I actually did get some sleep. O Jeannie, Jeannie, be wae for me:&#x2014;I know thou wilt. The figure of my poor Goody at the end of Cadogan Pier<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the Thames, just E of Cheyne Row.</note> has been often with me since Saturday last. Your chicken did serve me well for dinner two days; I also found the leather <pb id="pg-24-94" n="24:94"/>drinking-<hi rend="italic">caup</hi> [bowl] do excellent duty: I sank the <hi rend="italic">salt</hi>-box in the sea about the Land&#x2019;s End&#x2014; You shall have a description of the Land&#x2019;s End one day&#x2014; To conclude: <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the Land&#x2019;s End to &#x201C;Tuscar Light&#x201C; on the Coast of Wexford 130 miles, all last night,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 27&#x2013;29.</note> and thence to Dublin all this day, we had wild blowing weather, and a wild tumbling ship, with discomforts enough but with no injury to any one of us,&#x2014;I was right glad to get into Dublin River, and thence in a car up to this place, where in a very quiet-looking bedroom I am now writing to you. Enclosed is a letter which Duffy had left for me: what on Earth to do with it? For Duffy has not left the smallest address:&#x2014; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eu, eae</hi></foreign> [Bravo]! I had just, after deliberation, decided to write a little Note to Duffy by the <hi rend="italic">Post-Office</hi> Address, when John O&#x2019;Hagan enters; explains to me (on being questioned) that Mrs Dr. Callan<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Callan.</note> does not <hi rend="italic">let</hi> lodgings at all at all,&#x2014;but will be proud to take me as <hi rend="italic">guest</hi> &#x26;c. So <foreign>adieu</foreign> forevermore to that&#x2014;if I can <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> here (as I think I can), and know what is to be <hi rend="italic">paid</hi>, it will be infinitely freer <hi rend="italic">here</hi> than there!</p>
<p>But Duffy is appointed to come in &#x201C;half an hour,&#x201C; and I have still a Letter to write to my Mother. Enough therefore Dearest&#x2014; Tomorrow I will write a word more;&#x2014;and in the meantime, address, as before, &#x201C;Post-Office&#x201C; (it is just across the street from this), and I will take care to call again <hi rend="italic">before</hi> 7 in the evening. Letters come in 13 or 14 hours. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jeannie. God bless thee now and ever. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>If Mother and you as proposed went to Dumfries today, as I often on the &#x201C;high seas&#x201C; fancied you doing, the directest way of hitting you, and her, and Jean and everybody will be <hi rend="italic">Dumfries;</hi> to that therefore I address this small single word.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote TC from Dumfries, <date when="1849-07-03">3 July</date>: &#x201C;I brought our mother across from Scotsbrig yesterday forenoon, &#x26; have found all well here. We had a strong north-west wind ahead of us in driving along the Annan road, &#x26; our mother&#x2019;s imagination could not be prevented from dwelling on the perils of your voyage in that Dublin steamer. &#x2026; But our mother says she is not half so frightened for the voyage as she is for the dangers of travelling in a country like Ireland, where treacherous assassinations have been so frequent, of late years especially.&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>According to Program I went off on Saturday (from Chelsea at 8 a.m.), and after many adventures none of them detrimental (except want of sleep), tho&#x2019; several were very <hi rend="italic">stirring</hi> to my stagnancy, I arrived here about 7 this Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>,&#x2014;right glad indeed to get myself cleaned, and a Christian meal to eat on the firm land! They have put me into an excellent-looking bedroom&#x2014;(the qu<supplied>[ietest]</supplied> I think will really prove tolerable in that respect), and on the whole in no respect have I <hi rend="italic">not</hi> made an excellent change since my late berth on board the <hi rend="italic">Athlone!</hi>&#x2014; Yet I believe it was a really <hi rend="italic">successful</hi> voyage. It has <hi rend="italic">awakened</hi> me, as if you had flung me over a precipiece<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> into the sea!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-96" n="24:96"/>Duffy to whom I had hinted something of my fears about sleep, and &#x201C;aspirations&#x201C; after a quiet &#x201C;lodging,&#x201C; has a Letter waiting me here, offering rooms at his sister-in-law&#x2019;s (Dr Callan&#x2019;s); but she does not <hi rend="italic">let</hi> lodgings by any means,&#x2014;and that therefore I <hi rend="italic">decline;</hi> and indeed shall stick here, if I do not find it impossible to sleep. Duffy is to <hi rend="italic">call</hi> (as one O&#x2019;Hagan comes to intimate) in &#x201C;two or 3 minutes&#x201C;; therefore I must end.&#x2014; Whether you wrote or not I cannot say tonight, for the Post-Office (all but the receiving boxes) <hi rend="italic">ceases</hi> at 7 p.m., but we will try again tomorrow. Address &#x201C;Post-Office&#x201C; as before till <supplied>[MS torn]</supplied>. <closer><salute>Reassure my mother, comfort and be <supplied>[MS torn]</supplied> on you all. I will write again</salute></closer></p>
<ps><p>P.S.</p>
<p>I saw Ventnor and the South side of the Isle of Wight very beautifully; indeed we saw almost all the coast from <hi rend="italic">Battersea Bridge</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Land&#x2019;s End</hi> extremely well;&#x2014;and the <hi rend="italic">Land&#x2019;s End</hi> itself, which is the strangest memorablest Cape I ever saw, of which you shall have a description one day&#x2014; We had few passengers in the Cabin, only 3 or 4, and they <hi rend="italic">characters</hi>, but one a dreadful <hi rend="italic">snorer;</hi>&#x2014;the deck was filled with a Miscellany of common soldiers, <hi rend="italic">recruits</hi>, invalids, a perfect Donybrook;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Donnybrook, see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18421121-TC-JOST-01"><sic>15:198</sic><corr>TC to JOST, <date when="1842-11-21">21 Nov. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> into which I looked from the gangways above, and read off many strange Irish physiognomies.&#x2014; One of the wretched persons (an old Irish soldier, a lean man of 40: whom I had seen struggling on the quarter-deck, insisting that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would and should continue there too), fell overboard (it was supposed) that same night, and was never more seen! An invalid gentleman from Devonshire, paralytic in the lower extremities, was conveyed on board in a wicker cradle, what old Spalding<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> calls a &#x201C;wand bed,&#x201C; and came on the deck all the way&#x2014;a most affecting sight. In short I shall not soon forget this voyage of mine;&#x2014;I wish the rest were all ended in this Ireland as happily.</p>
<p>Dublin looked <foreign><hi rend="italic">ourie</hi></foreign> [gloomy] and <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>, compared with London, in the streets I came along. There has been a high wind by land too, all day, I find,&#x2014;as perhaps you also had.</p>
<p>From moment to moment I now expect Duffy&#x2014;and shall <hi rend="italic">end</hi> again; for in fact why sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I have begun a second time. Of course Jean too will get the contents of this, and take it as a message to her too. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>. It is now 10&#xBD; p.m. nearly.</salute></closer></p></ps>

<p><salute>No Letter, alas,&#x2014;or none from my own little Woman!</salute> But I console myself with imagining that you got home <hi rend="italic">too late</hi> on Monday afternoon, and did not know of the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> or morning post, which quits Chelsea till 8 at night, and Sloane Square and any part of paved London till early next morning, arriving <hi rend="italic">here</hi> in the afternoon some <hi rend="italic">thirteen hours</hi> afterwards. So I must wait, wait in patience.</p>
<p>Duffy came punctually last night, assisted me to arrange my Dublin introductory Notes, so that I may deliver them all in one journey of a Car,&#x2014;in about two hours, he thinks. I also gave him the other Letters home, that by studying the Addresses, he might say a little more nearly what he could advise as to routes.&#x2014; Address you to me while I remain in Dublin, &#x201C;Imperial Hotel, Sackville Street&#x201C;; that will be better than &#x201C;Post-Office,&#x201C; and I find I shall decide on <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> here during my short stay. Really, Dear, I had next to nothing else to tell thee but this: &#x201C;Imp. H&#xF4;tel instead of Post-Office.&#x201C;</p>
<p>For you would infer from that what next follows: That I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> last night (Thank God!)&#x2014;and find myself in general well situated here. The people,warned indirectly thro&#x2019; Fitzgerald I presume,&#x2014;seem aware of my high quality here; and do their very best to use me handsomely! Duffy told me the Head Waiter himself had a touch of the Hero-worshipper in him for &#x201C;Thomas Cyarloil!&#x201C;&#x2014; So be it, this once: they have put me into their quietest room; have brought in a kind of <hi rend="italic">cloak</hi>pin (to hang coats upon), promise to bring a tub or hip-bath, in short will do the impossible to make me happy. A special valet starts up whenever I ring, and with a high Irish accent, flings himself as it were at my feet, ready to do all things from murder to cheese-toasting on my behalf. Might I not go farther, and fare worse?&#x2014; It was a blessed luxury to lie down yesternight (towards 1 o&#x2019;clock) in clean sheets in a right Christian bed: I slept like a stone till towards six; then rose (burning), smoked, washed or spunged in a kind of <hi rend="italic">bidet</hi> (poor substitute for my tub); then to bed, cool enough, and gradually slept again above two hours more. Great work, you perceive.</p>
<p>And now, after half a word, about the new address, to my Mother again, let me out&#x2014;with my cards and fly or car,&#x2014;close car for it falls an occasional scud of rain. Dublin is beautiful; but it is idle; not one waggon, or business-looking <hi rend="italic">cart</hi> have I yet seen; only one gentleman&#x2019;s carriage, with two gig-looking <pb id="pg-24-98" n="24:98"/>ditto; the vehicles otherwise are mere <hi rend="italic">cars</hi>, trucks and trashery of that nature. Sackville Street is broad, high and really splendid, but in population does not equal S. Bridge Street Edin<hi rend="italic">r.</hi>&#x2014; Fitzgerald had a letter for me this morning; and his Aunt, from Kildare,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monica Purcell; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490626-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1849-06-26">26 June</date></ref>.</note> already writes inviting me to her house there. You shall have the Letter itself soon. <closer><salute>God forever bless thee, Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>This is the shortest of Notes, merely to let you know, after what was written and despatched last night, that <hi rend="italic">I have slept well</hi>, and that I decide to <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> here while in Dublin; so that if you write, which I hope you will at once,&#x2014;address &#x201C;Imperial H&#xF4;tel Sackville Street&#x201C; instead of &#x201C;Post-Office&#x201C;: that is all.&#x2014; I have got my Dublin Introductions (10 or so of them) arranged by place, and am about getting into a vehicle to deliver them. Skin still very <hi rend="italic">hot;</hi> liver none of the completest; otherwise all well.&#x2014; The people of this Inn treat me, I find, as the literary man; warned, I perceive, by Fitzgerald&#x2019;s Aunt (who is their mistress),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> (38) TC calls &#x201C;Miss Purcell&#x201C; (either Anne or Isabella) &#x201C;the proprietress.&#x201C; Thom&#x2019;s Dublin directory (<date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>) gives the proprietors as Purcell and [John] Jameson and lists Jameson and Peter Purcell &#x26; Co., coach proprietors, at the same address.</note> and are ready, in the headlong Irish way, to fling their heads under my feet. The Hotel too, as you know, is really superior of itself. I expect to do very well here, till the end of the week or perhaps beginning of next, when one may perhaps calculate on being off <hi rend="italic">at the very latest.</hi></p>
<p>Dublin looks amazingly thin and idle to me after London: nothing but little flimsy cars, and whirligig insignificancies of vehicles going about; the population, itself scant on the streets, and of miscellaneous cheap character.&#x2014; Here is Fitzgerald&#x2019;s Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of [ca. <date when="1849-06-25">25 June</date>], at the top of which TC wrote: &#x201C;To send this on to Jane at Chelsea, who will <hi rend="italic">keep</hi> it,&#x2014;please.&#x201C;</note> which lay waiting for me this morning; it, and one <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the Mrs Purcell <hi rend="italic">inviting</hi> me specially to Kildare; these two and as yet no other Letter at all. I expected something from Jane, perhaps from you&#x2014;but no, I must have patience.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-99" n="24:99"/>Enough for today. Tell my good Mother and assure her that I am doing</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">well;</hi> and would fain hear that she is and you all are.</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Clarendon,</salute>
<p>You are very good to me, and surely it would give me the highest pleasure to meet you in your house as man meets with man, to say nothing of the honour of being guest to a Viceroy as one passes thro&#x2019; his kingdom!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC called at the viceroy&#x2019;s house, Thurs. afternoon, <date when="1849-07-05">5 July</date>, when Sir Philip Crampton (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6596"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), bart., surgeon-gen. to the forces in Ireland and surgeon in ordinary to the queen, drove him there: &#x201C;House with wings (at right angles to the body of the building) with esplanade, two sentries, and utter solitude. &#x2026; Sir Ph., some business inside, tho&#x2019; Ldship. <hi rend="italic">out</hi> &#x2026; ; I write my name, with date merely, not with address, in Lordship&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">book</hi>&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 46&#x2013;47). Lord Clarendon wrote to TC, early morning, <date when="1849-07-06">6 July</date> (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490706-TC-JWC-01"><sic>TC-JWC</sic><corr>TC to JWC</corr>, <date when="1849-07-06">6 July</date></ref>): &#x201C;I was very sorry to have been from home when you called here yesterday. If you are not engaged will you dine with us tomorrow at &#xBD; past 7.&#x201C; Dr. Evory Kennedy had written to TC, <date when="1849-07-04">4 [?] July</date>, inviting TC to leave his hotel and stay with him while in that part of Ireland. Evidently TC replied accepting his invitation for <date when="1849-07-07">7 July</date>. Kennedy then wrote to TC, <date when="1849-07-06">6 July</date>: &#x201C;I have just had a command from Lord Clarendon to meet you at Dinner tomorrow&#x2014;therefore pray do not stand on ceremony with me but if you have not as yet accepted his Excellency&#x2019;s invitation do so. You are no doubt aware that the L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Lieut&#x2019;s invitation in Ireland (as the queens in England) supercedes all other arrangements&#x2014; / I am collating &#x26; arranging your letters: &#x26; shall propose &#x2018;a plan of Campaign for you.&#x2019;&#x201C; At Kennedy&#x2019;s request, the Quaker William Todhunter wrote TC, <date when="1849-07-07">7 July</date>, an introductory letter supposed to include a list of people in the south and west &#x201C;with whom the members of the Central Relief Committee of the Society of Friends had become connected &#x2026; during their &#x2026; labor in ameliorating the condition of the suffering people of this Country.&#x201C;</note> But, alas, I am not allowed to continue here: I leave for Kildare and the Cork and Tipperary regions tomorrow afternoon; and must postpone until the time of my return hither (if I do return this way) the great pleasure you offer me. At worst, may I not look forward to England, and a similar meeting there some good time that is coming.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC would not have really been welcome. Clarendon wrote to Lord John Russell, the prime minister, <date when="1849-07-31">31 July</date>, that there was fear at &#x201C;the reappearance of the Nation and it is melancholy that there should be no power to avert an evil that everyone deplores. Duffy accompanied by that double-barrelled coxcomb Carlyle has been perambulating the provinces collecting abuses and I believe has met with considerable success which proves that the apprehensions about [Duffy&#x2019;s] pestilent paper are not unfounded&#x201C; (MS: Clarendon papers, Bodleian Lib.).</note></p>
<p>I saw Lady Ashburton the day before leaving London; Lord A. had gone into the West, on business, for a few days: these, and the others in whom I <pb id="pg-24-102" n="24:102"/>have the honour to claim some interest along with you, were all well, and mindful of the Lord Lieutenant, at my departure.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many respects, acknowledgments, and sincere wishes of a private and a public kind, I subscribe myself always,</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Most truly Yours /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>Dear Lord Clarendon,</salute>
<p>Once more many thanks. Twistleton has furnished me with Letters to Inspectors &#x26;c; from Lords Lansdowne, Clanrickarde, Sligo and other friendly authorities, I carry Letters to various sorts of persons, far more than I shall be able to deliver; so that for the present I will not draw on your resources; but if, at any point, I find myself open to specific profit by so doing, I will freely apply; and at all points it will surely be a pleasure and honour to reflect that I have such a possibility in store. Accept my grateful acknowledgments for such a favour.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-104" n="24:104"/>Ireland with its raging controversies and hungry necessities already painfully represents itself to me as a country scourged by angry gods,&#x2014;painful to see and hear. Yet it demands to be seen and heard; is one of the notablest spots in the whole world just now. May God Almighty prosper your true endeavour in the matter; that each good man contribute what little is in him, by act and by forbearance to act, by speech and by silence,&#x2014;this unhappy country, in its present crisis, has surely need of it all.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many regards and wishes</salute></closer></p>

Howth had &#x201C;several comfortable bathing lodges&#x201C; (Fraser, <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> 146).</note> after which, at the expense of rational Socinian conversation, fiercely trampled down by me, but met by divine patience and even by some lurking assent from both Father &#x26; Mother (excellent people, on my honour!) I did at last get to bed,&#x2014;oh joy, a quiet bed, where almost six hours of real sleep fanned by the clear sea-breeze, and infinitely refreshing, were vouchsafed me. Ten o&#x2019;clock set me down again this morning at the further (Eastern) verge of Dublin, Station of the Cashel Railway; and two hours more at the edge of Kildare town, where, after some <hi rend="italic">burbling</hi> avoidable enough but not avoided, &#x201C;Peter Fitzgerald&#x201C; and his Wife, fresh from divine (Catholic) service, caught me up surveying the gaunt old Monastery and Round Tower, and seeking for &#x201C;St Bridget&#x2019;s Fire House&#x201C; (now demolished): and amid a crowd of beggars of all ages, sexes and figures, our acquaintance was begun. &#x2018;P.

Fraser, <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi>, notes that Kildare is &#x201C;now a small and poor town possessing few attractions for the traveller not imbued with a love of antiquarian inquiry&#x201C; (260). The &#x201C;Fire House&#x201C; was part of a chapel to Saint Bridget (5th cent.) in which a ceaseless fire is said to have been kept till <date when="1220-00-00">1220</date>. Nearby were ruins of a Franciscan abbey, cathedral, and round tower.</note> The House, not very large, not larger perhaps than Addiscombe with a wing or two, is full of originality, hall all carpeted, sofaed, dining room lighted from above, and tolerable oil-pictures on the walls; chapel (Mass-priest is to appear at dinner), greenhouse,&#x2014;a big crag lying on the lawn, where I have already sat and smoked a pipe. My bedroom is superb: I am to be forwarded tomorrow to the vale of Glendalough and back (round tower, and churches, older than the deluge; beautiful Lake, hills and valley d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> or at least <hi rend="italic">as</hi> old) next day the Curragh of Kildare,&#x2014;and <supplied>[name illegible]</supplied> a Friend of A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Sterling <hi rend="italic">might</hi> by hard driving be included, but I decide, <hi rend="italic">not;</hi>&#x2014;and then at 6 p.m. I am to be put into the Railway again; and so to Kilkenny at 9&#xBD; p.m. where Duffy waits me, and is guest of &#x201C;Dr Cane the Mayor,&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Cane (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4548"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), writer on Irish history; M.D., Dublin, <date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>; practiced medicine in Kilkenny, where elected mayor, <date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>; refused to take part in the rising but was imprisoned, <date when="1848-07-29">29 July 1848</date>; founded Celtic Union, <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Celt</hi>, 1857.</note> a sensible man, with whom I also have consented to lodge.&#x2014; Oh Heaven, there are two Letters more to be written, and only about half an hour remains,&#x2014;half past five at present, 6&#xBD; is dinner.</p>
<p>I forgot to tell you of my dinner with Sir Duncan Macgregor, an excellent old Scotchman,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">voice</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> (allowing for sex) strikingly like Mrs Rich&#x2019;s: a pleasant dinner; two native Irish there, of singular <hi rend="italic">vernacularity</hi>, yet gentlemen both, one of whom brought me home in his car. National School of <hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> (whither a Dignitary Macdonnell had driven me in the afternoon) was far the hopefullest thing I saw yet in Ireland: 45 rough peasant Lads, from the far west as from other regions, all getting themselves actually trained and bred not to be Irish blackguards, but effective, cleanly, decent methodic men and tillers of the soil,&#x2014;sure to be missionaries of Order, irrefragable preachers of much that is needfullest here, wherever they go. Larcom, whom I saw first at M&#x2019;Gregor&#x2019;s, seemed to take to me, as I did to him.&#x2014; The aspect of Dublin generally is sad and distressing to me: class filled with raging animosity against class; and <pb id="pg-24-109" n="24:109"/>idleness, and <hi rend="italic">sumptuously-housed poverty</hi> looking out everywhere; and one black ruin seeming to be imminent over all that is established there. Groups of ragged savages are more, but not so very <hi rend="italic">much</hi> more, numerous than one has seen them as imported in London: Kildare first showed me Irish <hi rend="italic">beggars;</hi> a wretched little ruined Town, half the size of Ecclefechan, nearly all of huts, and with hardly anything but <hi rend="italic">beggars</hi>, all in rings<supplied>[?]</supplied>, some of them above half naked to be seen in it. Oh me! I was deaf to all solicitation; at length two young <foreign>rag-scruns</foreign> [thin scraggy persons] who had long stood <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> within sight of the carriage where I sat waiting a little, attracted me (the rest had all gone in despair): these I called to me, gave them 4 pence in silver to divide: &#x201C;Long life to your honour! Oh may the Almighty &#x26;c!&#x201C; and so off they went: but presently one, rather the bigger one, came back, &#x201C;<foreign>Ach</foreign> yor honor! he&#x2019;s gone and tuk it from me, won&#x2019;t give me any of it!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Then why don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,&#x201C; I said, &#x201C;go and lick him till he cannot stand, and make him give it you?&#x201C; With which decision two <hi rend="italic">un</hi>begging men within reach of us seemed to be well satisfied;&#x2014;feeling, I suppose, like myself that it was all fudge. A Hawker <hi rend="italic">did</hi> me in Dublin out of a penny,&#x2014;they are apt to think all things allowed in that game, poor wretch.</p>
<p>Alas, how I am clatter-clattering; and you tomorrow, all day, will be whirling thro&#x2019; the world, full of wild bustle too!&#x2014; Here actually is the man with hot water: warning to dress: Oh my dear!&#x2014; But you may <hi rend="italic">send</hi> this Letter to Jack and my Mother, that will save me all but a few short words at present on that quarter? Yes, send it;&#x2014;only bid Jack send it back to you, that it be not lost; for I cannot get the smallest leisure to jot a word on paper; and if this go on, all memorials of me on this expedit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> may be useful one day.</p>
<p>Your Letter yesterday waited when I returned from the zoological,&#x2014;read (only <hi rend="italic">half</hi>, then) along the streets toward the R<hi rend="italic">l</hi> [Royal] I. A. (Irish Academy, that is): many thanks to thee, Goodykin!&#x2014; This will get to Nottingham I compute on Tuesday: whither can I bid you write? Cork, I think: &#x201C;Post-Office, Cork&#x201C;; and to attain even that you must not delay beyond two days. Waterford, I give up as too hurried for you: but there also I will <hi rend="italic">call</hi> at the Post-Office on chance. Dublin is arranged to forward thither.</p>

<p><salute>My dear good Mother,&#x2014;</salute>Take one word from me before my eyes close in sleep; I meant to have written at great length, but not a moment is left me to myself, and at this time I am really worn down with sleep, and much in need of it, Dublin having proved a very noisy place to lodge in.</p>
<p>I am now some 40 miles on my road forward <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Dublin; having quitted that City yesternight, and again run thro&#x2019; it this morning on my way hither; where kind friends have received me, put me into the best of lodgings, and taught me to feel that man is kind to man,&#x2014;and that surely a good Providence watches over all! This is the place of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s Brother (known to the Doctor), an excellent house; I am safe here, and in spite of all my tossings and tumblings getting <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> from my tour, so healthy is the summer air, so useful to me this stirring up of my stagnant humourly locomotion. Poor Jane is to set out Northward tomorrow, I believe; I have written to her, a Letter which probably she will forward to you (if it catch her rightly at Neuberg&#x2019;s); it will explain to you a little what my history since you last heard is. Bid Jack write to me, &#x201C;Post-Office, Cork&#x201C;: if he do it <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi> I may calculate on getting his Letter there.&#x2014; I should not have run from Dublin quite so fast, except to avoid the Lord Lieutenant&#x2019;s dinner, which could not otherwise be done. I am to go and see some places here tomorrow, and next <hi rend="italic">morning;</hi> then in the <hi rend="italic">Evening</hi> (of Tuesday) I am to go (by rail, mainly) to Kilkenny, and lodge with the Mayor there, one Dr Cane with whom Duffy now is; after which, having looked at all things rightly in Kilkenny, we set forward in good earnest on our Tour. Such a country for ragged beggars I never saw or dreamed of: but it is full of hospitable kindness too, and I hope to gain several advantages by seeing it. Jane&#x2019;s Letter, I hope, will reach you the day after this, or the second day after. <closer><salute>Good night, dear Mother; my eyes are quite falling together.

<salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute>
<p>I enclose for you, by way of symbol, a twig of heath plucked yesterday among the ruins of Glendalough; whither your Brother honourably escorted me, where we had a day full of interesting adventures, a day which I find I shall very long remember. No more striking object, full of ragged tragical pathos, ever offered itself to my contemplation than those old black ruins and the crowds of famishing beggars that hovered round us all the time we were there. Thanks for your mention of Glendalough; I had meditated the thing before, but perhaps might have omitted it had not your suggestion come to second me.</p>
<p>All Ireland seems as if it flung its arms open to receive me; in Dublin I <pb id="pg-24-112" n="24:112"/>really was like to be done to death by the civilities of men,&#x2014;all sorts of men from the King or Vice-King upon the throne to the Theology Professor of Maynooth:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >P. A. Murray.</note> surely a <hi rend="italic">social</hi> race of men, for one thing! Your Kinsfolk here have welcomed me as if I had been their own Brother; and have done, and are doing, the sacred rites in a way to touch the heart of the Pilgrim who, for the time, has no home of his own. Long life to them; and, as the people yesterday said, &#x201C;St Kevin&#x2019;s be their bed!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A rock at Glendalough is said to be the bed of Kevin (6th cent.); see <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 78.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>This afternoon (it is now close on breakfast, in a room you well know, one of the nicest in Ireland, looking out on the &#x201C;big stone&#x201C; I have heard of your sitting on while reading), I set off (after the Curragh<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A bleak plain of 4,858 acres of crown lands used for grazing sheep, also for racing and coursing. See <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 75 and Fraser 260.</note> &#x26;c) for Kilkenny, and thence to Waterford, Cork and the barbarous regions of the West. Pray for me,&#x2014;and pray for those! The potatoes, numerous beyond former years, are all in luxuriant flower, and everybody looks at them, for the next two weeks especially, as at the horn of Doom,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The horn given Astolpho by Logistilla in Ludovico Ariosto&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso</hi>, bk. 8.</note>&#x2014;for countless multitudes will again die starved, if the potatoe still fail. Good Heavens! In spite of my indignation, I have almost lost the heart to continue my old prayer on that point, That the potatoe might <hi rend="italic">continue</hi> dead. Breakfast bell! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear F.&#x2014; Your Letter waited me at Dublin, and you perceive it is all right.</salute></closer></p>

<p>&#x201C;All well, sleep hardly to be had&#x201C;: that is still the bulletin, and so in great hurry before 12 o&#x2019;clock come, when this City and Castle are to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, I must send you a word, you still safe at Neuberg&#x2019;s I hope, and only meditating still to go ahead. Oh what a life, oh what a life! But we shall get thro&#x2019; it and have much to tell when we meet.</p>
<p>That monday morning at 8&#xBD;, Fitz<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter FitzGerald.</note> and I set out in our car; went whirling towards the Wicklow Hills very prosperously for some ten miles, I with plenty of tobacco, and almost nothing to talk (having got <foreign><hi rend="italic">dos-&#xE0;-dos</hi></foreign> [back-to-back], cunningly on the opposite side of the car, and only talking to the <pb id="pg-24-113" n="24:113"/>driver, a very hardy intelligent little fellow, worth talking to): for ten miles or more; but after that, we got a new driver, new horse <hi rend="italic">that wouldn&#x2019;t go</hi>, and had adventures enough! At 12&#xBD; however we, walking and otherwise, ere fairly in the Pass of &#x201C;Wicklow Gap,&#x201C;&#x2014;a wild scene of black stony boggy mountains (altogether like Galloway and the land beyond Puttock, very interesting <supplied>[to]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> me); full of scarecrow <hi rend="italic">ragtails</hi> all in grey rags, busily looking after their <hi rend="italic">peats.</hi> Conversed with wandering herdsmen &#x26;c, looked with wonder upon the aspect of all. Thro&#x2019; Wicklow Gap, in wild stony country, lead-mines and a little more of substance in men&#x2019;s existence (tho&#x2019; not much) begin to shew themselves. Finally at 1&#xBD; in a kind of narrow long Pit, with two lakes (<hi rend="italic">loughs</hi>) in it, among the Hills, appears the scene of St Kevin&#x2019;s hermitages and world-old devotional exercises, and as memorial of him, <hi rend="italic">Seven</hi> Churches, ruinous all, gone to the foundation some of them, which ancient Irish piety had set up to pray in, at least to be buried in, for that is what it amounts to now. Old damp mouldering ruins, made of granite flag-stones, the arched-roof of one of them still standing; girt with thistly rubbish graves (still new graves), and eternal silence of the mountains, and their melancholy water-pools: <hi rend="italic">7</hi> churches, all huddled into one close space&#x2014;I can only fancy the ancient Irish tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> get to Heaven by being buried here.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two lakes are Lough Tay and Lough Don. Glendalough is a &#x201C;narrow space&#x201C; bounded by mountains, reaching from Laragh to the Cascade of Glenealy and containing the Seven Churches. TC marked in his copy of Fraser&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> the remark that Laurence Sterne (<date when="1713-00-00">1713</date>&#x2013;<date when="1768-00-00">68</date>) stayed at the gatehouse, Annamoe, as a child, where he fell through a millrace, noting, &#x201C;Annual Register 18<hi rend="italic">0</hi>(2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>)51.&#x201C; The church ruins of Glendalough, apparently founded by Saint Kevin, its first bishop. His bed is a small ledge or cave nearby, &#x201C;not larger than many a pig-sty,&#x201C; attractive to visitors, in front of a rock overhanging the lake (Fraser 98&#x2013;99).</note> No more tragic scene of ragged pathos, and inexorable pious-impious desolation ever struck me in this world. For, alas, the eternal &#x201C;silence&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">was</hi> broken by one sound, and only one&#x2014;that of tattered wretchedness in every figure howling on the right and the left, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Lave</hi> a penny for the love of God!&#x201C;&#x2014; Coming back thro&#x2019; Wicklow Gap in the grey dusk, a man galloping downhill met us,&#x2014;galloping for surgeon and priest: a miner was <hi rend="italic">killed</hi>, but whether <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> or only &#x201C;kilt entirely,&#x201C; one could not learn. The howl of a woman from the opposite flank of the valley, in wild rage of lamentation, came across to us, belike his poor wife, sister, mother; the cruellest sound ear ever heard, it sounded to me like the <hi rend="italic">voice</hi> of wretched Ireland at large, that night.</p>

Dr Cane is a tall solemn man of 45; black well-formed head, clerical aspect,&#x2014;who, apart from repeal jealousies, is very easily talked to, and worth talking to. Kilkenny is a ruinous old and venerable City of 20,000; &#x201C;cloth-trade quite gone to England, all but a few coarse blankets: this morning was market on the streets; ragged wild people with strong sprinkling of soldiers and police: on the open street; for one thing, sat a row of coblers, mending <foreign><hi rend="italic">extempore</hi></foreign> the country people&#x2019;s shoes.&#x2014; Enough of me, O Goody, enough of me!

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here I am safe since the night before last (since Tuesday night, that is), in the house of Dr Cane, Mayor of the City, a very worthy and certainly a very hospitable man, tho&#x2019; he had to rub shoulders with the authorities lately for his Repeal Affairs, and is not many months yet out of prison.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although he had no part in the insurrection of <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>, Cane was charged with treason and imprisoned for several months.</note> Duffy waited me here after my visit to the Fitzgeralds; yesterday we saw all about this ancient singular-looking place; saw Poor-Houses (with 3,000 in them, a pretty batch!), saw round Towers, Cathedrals, Ormond Castles, a market day and cobblers mending country people&#x2019;s shoes <hi rend="italic">on the street.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Principal town of the county with the cathedral of St. Canice, dating from late twelfth cent., a round tower nearby, and the Dominican or Black Abbey, founded <date when="1225-00-00">1225</date>. Kilkenny Castle, built <date when="1192-00-00">1192</date> and frequently altered, seat of the marquess of Ormonde. TC&#x2019;s interest in it lay primarily in its being the residence of James Butler (<date when="1610-00-00">1610</date>&#x2013;<date when="1688-00-00">88</date>), 12th earl and 1st duke of Ormonde, royalist gen.; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell, Works</hi> 6:250, 284. For further details of the day, see <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 81&#x2013;86.</note> I sent you a Newspaper last night; Jane will probably forward a letter I wrote to her.&#x2014; In the Evening was a dinner, consisting chiefly of <hi rend="italic">repealers</hi> in no great number, rather foolish kind of men: the Doctor himself is a considerate grave person, and thinks of what he is doing, which is rare here.&#x2014; My ink is run out, so I will write the rest in pencil, which Jack will be able to read!&#x2014;</p>
<p>After dinner yesterday, I suppose about 8 or nearer 9 o&#x2019;clock, I took myself up stairs to my room for a whiff of &#x2019;bacco; and then, being very weary, and much out of sleep, I flung myself down to rest for 5 minutes before going down to join the company: but behold, in the course of that five minutes I fell sound asleep, and <hi rend="italic">at 1 in the morning</hi> for the first time Duffy was awakening me to a sense of my situation! Nothing more opportune could have befallen, for sleep was of all things the thing I wanted, and as I pretty soon fell asleep <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, and so continued till about 6 this morning,&#x2014;and then awoke a much refreshed man. It is now towards 8; I have as good as done all my packing, will finish this, and still have time to shave before breakfast which is at 9. After that, we set out, Duffy and I, uncertain yet by what conveyance, to <hi rend="italic">Waterford</hi> where I hope to find a letter from Jack, and news about you all.&#x2014; My journey hitherto may well be said to have been prosperous; I have rather gathered in health, in spite of continual deficiency of sleep. All people are kind to me; it is as if poor ould Ireland flung her arms open to receive.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-117" n="24:117"/>The weather since this <supplied>[journey?]</supplied> began is glowing hot, very bright, airy and beautiful, quite pleasant when one is in the shade. Pieces of the Country are extremely beautiful, and it might all be beautiful if well tilled. But Idleness sits cowering under &#x201C;the ditches&#x201C; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">dike-backs</hi></foreign> is the Scotch word), a prey to hunger, and with no scheme of help but that of begging. Since the world began there surely was never seen such a scene of mendicancy. The face of the Earth is defiled with flight of <hi rend="italic">winged</hi> tatterdermalions everywhere: I shall not soon forget the sight of the 3,000 of them yesterday,&#x2014;2 of the thousands, I think, all in one house. A kind of order was enforced, and loose<supplied>[?]</supplied> stone-breaking, I perc<supplied>[eived]</supplied> <supplied>[words obscured]</supplied>: but who could get work or order out of such a set of creatures in circumstances like these!&#x2014; Ireland cannot long last as it is; no country ever saw itself in such a state before. And the one hope of all persons, or nearly all, seems to be that the Potatoe may come back, when it will be &#x201C;as you were!&#x201C;&#x2014;which is not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> hope or wish, for I think it really were better to die than to live as the Irish have long been doing.&#x2014; You see I have got ink again: it came a while ago, but I did not think we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> much require it till after turning the leaf.</p>
<p>Jane I suppose to be at Neuberg&#x2019;s, perhaps about quitting it this very day. I hope to be at Waterford, then at Cork.&#x2014; Here are a twig of heath and a leaf of ivy from the Seven Churches of Glendalough, where I was on Tuesday;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Above the line TC has written &#x201C;Monday,&#x201C; perhaps at a later date.</note> a strange almost ghastly-looking old place, about which I hope to give you account one day.&#x2014; For the present dear Mother, <foreign>adieu</foreign>. By Newspaper or a line of writing you shall soon if I can manage it, hear of me again.&#x2014; Mrs Cane made me yesterday a canvas cover for my new writing case: kind Lady!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Strange dialect of M<hi rend="italic">rs.</hi> D<hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Cane, a Wicklow lady,&#x2014;made a canvas case for my writing case this day, good hostess! came of Scotch people; rings with such a <hi rend="italic">lilt</hi> in speaking as is unexampled hitherto; all is <hi rend="italic">i&#x2019;s, oi&#x2019;s</hi>, &<hi rend="italic">c.;</hi> excellent mother and wife, so far as heart goes, &#x2018;surely&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 85).</note> <closer><salute>My blessings with you all. /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> de Vere,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-07-07">7 July</date>, enclosing Lord Monteagle&#x2019;s proposed report on the Irish poor law; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490707-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1849-07-07">7 July</date>]</ref>.</note> which found me here yesterday; thanks too for your bundle of blue-book papers, which got safe to the &#x201C;Imperial&#x201C; in Dublin, but which, alas, <hi rend="italic">fell overboard</hi> there in the universal tempest and whirlpool of people and things that marked all my days and moments in that City. I will try somewhere to get <hi rend="italic">another</hi> copy, and to have it conveyed to &#x201C;Scotsbrig, Ecclefechan, N.B.,&#x201C; where (and not here) there is some chance of getting them duly read. Your Papers are lost, you see; but your Letter I have, and like well, and thoroughly agree with in all essentials;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Vere wrote: &#x201C;You have &#x2026; such an object for philosophical inspection as is not often in the world&#x2019;s history laid before the eyes of men or angels&#x2014; A notion often manages to turn itself upsidedown; but does not so often turn itself inside out so as to lay bare its awful anatomy &#x26; all its internal processes before the eyes of astonished empires&#x2014; &#x2026; . A thousand villanous devices &#x26; villanous omissions of legislation have been brought suddenly to book by the <foreign>&#x2018;Deus intersit&#x2019;</foreign> of this potatoe failure. It is as if that odd piece of patch work, an individual man, were stripped in a moment of all his plausibilities, while his neighbors continued to enjoy their masquerade dresses.&#x201C;</note> and in fact receive as a very welcome and friendly voice from over the water just now.</p>
<p>I have seen an immensity of <hi rend="italic">kinds</hi> of people; find them all distinguished by two qualities: generous warmth of hospitality, welcoming the stranger of whatever colour with open arms; and secondly by mutual animosity, each class bitterly accusing every other, and in fact blaming and accusing all things, except its own self the one accusable thing! This temper of theirs, in this condition of theirs, saddens me exceedingly. The land is covered with winged flights of migratory beggars,&#x2014;past computation, past imagination! True human beggary I never dreamed of till I got to the ancient &#x201C;City&#x201C; of Kildare,&#x2014;a place strange to me almost as a village in Timbuctoo. The crops are beautiful beyond precedent, the weather beautiful and bright;&#x2014;and far and wide, waves once more in boundless breadth the fatal Potatoe; as yet quite luxuriant, but which all people are regarding as their Hour of Doom: the reasonablest men I talk with, not to speak of poor wretched serfs and savages miscalled free citizens, seem to consider the Potatoe their one chance of salvation: if the potatoe will revive, we live; if it die, what can we also do but die? More grievous stupor and stolidity I never witnessed on as wide a scale before.&#x2014; It seems to me the sufferings of this people will be great before they <hi rend="italic">learn</hi> their lesson. Learn it, <pb id="pg-24-119" n="24:119"/>however, they must; continue on upper earth <hi rend="italic">without</hi> learning it they cannot, let the potatoe do its best.</p>
<p>Lord Stuart de Decies, warned I find by some Dublin hand, had a kind Note waiting me here; I enclosed Lord Monteagle&#x2019;s Letter, and engaged to see Dromana this evening;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Villiers Stuart (<date when="1803-00-00">1803</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), Baron Stuart de Decies, M.P. for co.

Wexford.</note> servant happened to be in this H&#xF4;tel; the Master, 8 miles off, was inaccessible; I sent my Note by the accidental opportunity, along with my regrets. It is Assize-time; which hinders various people: but on the whole <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> is the error of my fortune in that particular, by no means <hi rend="italic">defect.</hi> The Duke of Devonshire&#x2019;s Agent, a very pleasant clear experienced Englishman,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Mr. Currey &#x2026; from Lismore,&#x201C; W co. Waterford, site of Lismore Castle, a seat of the duke of Devonshire; with him TC had &#x201C;much negociation&#x201C; as he was &#x201C;eager to do the honours to me, in which enterprise he persisted and succeeded&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 90&#x2013;91). Fraser calls him F. B. Curry and praises his &#x201C;liberality and skill&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> 234).</note> is here in this place too, waiting as grand-juror: I spent a comfortable hour with him last night, but beyond a <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> of Lismore prohibited farther efforts or regrets on his part. No Priest that I have yet seen pleases me at all; and no Repealer except Dr Cane of Kilkenny&#x2014;a man to be warranted genuine. The rest are a sad imbroglio, to be shunned and not sought, except for scientific purposes. Poor Ireland!</p>
<p>Will you join me at Limerick then about the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month?

<p>I left Nottingham on Thursday morning according to programme with the dear Neubergs whom I am deeply in love with&#x2014;the man on <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> account and the little sister on <hi rend="italic">yours</hi> (I am quite serious and determined&#x2014;you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> marry her&#x2014;she will make you an excellent wife&#x2014;would like it extremely&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> would like to have her for a sister-in-law) Well I left with them in the train which goes by Derby and Mattlock&#x2014;as far as Rowsley where there is a beautiful &#x201C;little rural Inn&#x201C;&#x2014;close by the railway station&#x2014;where we deposited our carpet bags&#x2014;then we went in an open carriage to Chatsworth and saw all the house and grounds&#x2014;a thing very pleasant to <hi rend="italic">have</hi> seen&#x2014;we returned to Rowsley for &#x201C;a rough tea&#x201C; and slept there or to speak accurately so far as <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> was concerned&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">lay in bed there broad awake</hi> till six in the morning&#x2014;walked before breakfast apparently gathering strength and appetite from having slept almost <hi rend="italic">none</hi> since I left London&#x2014;then off in the train again to Matlock where the Neubergs parted from me to return to Nottingham and I proceeded to Barnsley dined and had tea with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Newton who told me that &#x201C;if she were going to fall in love with any man besides her own husband it would be with <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;that she &#x201C;never in fact saw any one she thought so good and liked so much to be with&#x201C;&#x2014;and then she reproached me with never having sent her the ugly little box you <hi rend="italic">turned</hi>&#x2014; I promised she should have it on my return; but I think you might bestow <hi rend="italic">your other work</hi> on her with more fitness I dont think you have given a Dante to any one that values it more than this woman would do&#x2014; She drove me back to the station&#x2014;three miles&#x2014;in a gig&#x2014;a capital &#x201C;whip&#x201C;&#x2014;she is!&#x2014;(Nodes is in London) and again at eight at night I was <hi rend="italic">squealing</hi> towards Leeds&#x2014;where William Edward was to meet me&#x2014;but with his usual impatient impetuosity he sprang into the carriage beside me at Normanton!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 5 mi.

<p><salute>Goodness gracious! what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to be done?</salute> Will a letter directed <hi rend="italic">postoffice Cork</hi> be still in time to find you? &#x201C;It may be be<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> strongly doubted&#x201C;! so I will make a compromise betwixt a letter and no letter,&#x2014;will write what Magazine would call &#x201C;a pair of lines&#x201C; to notify my safe arrival here, leaving all the details till a more <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> opportunity.</p>
<p>I wrote to you on Monday before starting&#x2014;on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Monday I wrote&#x2014;to the Imperial Hotel&#x2014; Your <hi rend="italic">first</hi> letter to Nottingham reached me on Wednesday morning; the second has only come to hand <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning&#x2014;here at Rawdon&#x2014;the first contained an address where to write&#x2014;but&#x2014;you bade me send it on to John, and in my hurry to obey your instructions before setting off with the Neubergs to Newstead Abbey, I enclosed it to John with a few hasty lines from my self, and only be thought myself that I had not taken down the address either on paper or on my memory (bad as that is); whilst I was standing in Lord Byron&#x2019;s bedroom looking at the identical basin in which he used to wash his face!&#x2014; You see what comes of writing letters to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> for the public good&#x2014;</p>
<p>On Thursday after breakfast I left Nottingham with Mr Neuberg and his dear little sister&#x2014;and went partly by railway partly by open carriage to Chatsworth and returned to Rowsley to sleep&#x2014;in a beautiful little rural Inn&#x2014;about half a mile from Haddon Hall<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seat of the duke of Rutland, ca. 2 mi. from Rowsley, parts dating from the 12th cent., said to be the most thoroughly preserved of medieval houses.</note>&#x2014;It was very strange to go squealing in a railway train past all those crags and paths at Matlock where I had wandered so silently with <hi rend="italic">you!</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In <date when="1847-08-00">Aug. 1847</date>.</note> At midday yesterday (Friday) I parted with the Neubergs at Matlock station, they returning to Nottingham, I proceeding to Barnsley, where I was received with transports of affection by poor Mrs Newton, a very loving woman if not a brilliant one,&#x2014;dined and had tea with <hi rend="italic">her</hi> (Nodes is in London) and then she <hi rend="italic">drove me herself</hi> in a gig to the station&#x2014;three miles off&#x2014;where I again deposited <pb id="pg-24-122" n="24:122"/>myself in a railway carriage at eight at night; expecting to meet Forster at Leeds&#x2014;but at Normanton two stages from Leeds the door of my Coup&#xE9; where I sat all alone was thrown violently open and a man jumped in&#x2014;rather impertinently I thought&#x2014;and seated himself&#x2014;and then said; &#x201C;Well how are you?&#x201C; and I turned and stared, and behold it was Forster! at Apperly the gig was waiting with <hi rend="italic">a very frisky horse</hi>&#x2014;and also Nicol the Glasgow man, who was to come here to sleep on his way to the water-cure, whither he is now happily gone&#x2014; Forster too is off to Bradford to be back in two hours, perhaps with Mrs Paulet&#x2014; And so you see &#x201C;how I am situated&#x201C; (as your own phrase is&#x2014; For the rest I am precisely in your own case&#x2014;&#x201C;well&#x2014;really well ever since I got out of London, but &#x201C;hardly any sleep to be had&#x201C;</p>

<p>My Barnsley friend<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Anne Newton.</note> was very kind to me, and if she failed to &#x201C;make me happy&#x201C; under the circumstances; she made me at least much obliged to her.&#x2014; I was in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">coup&#xE9;</hi></foreign> of that train&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> to Normanton when the door was flung open, rather impertinently, I thought and a man jumped in, and sat down beside me, and said; &#x201C;Well! how are you&#x201C;? and I looked at his face and it was Forster!</p>

I at least always sense the truth about her with pain, and now, strangely enough, since she has given it a certain expression, it has lost all bitterness for me&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 70, trans.).</note></p>

<p><salute>Well, dear Goody, here I am, and your Letter is here;</salute> safe both, tho&#x2019; exposed to injuries and the chances of travel: but where <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are is much a mystery to me at present, for you make no prophecy of times to me after Rawdon, and it is somewhat dubious to me whether you are still there, or gone forward into the twilight region that intervenes between Fife and the Yorkshire Hills. Good weather, and all good,&#x2014;including, if it were possible, a little good <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>,&#x2014;go with you whatsoever the steps of your course be! Yesternight I shot a Newspaper off to &#x201C;Liverpool,&#x201C; but with hardly any expectation of its finding you on that side of the Island; I will write to Rawdon, all will surely follow you from that, were it even with a day or two days of delay. From Waterford I told you my next &#x201C;Post-Office&#x201C; was Limerick (probably 4 days hence), to which I hope some Letter from you is now under way: after Limerick comes &#x201C;Galway&#x201C; (but observe, very <hi rend="italic">shortly</hi> after, 3 days at most); after Galway, &#x201C;Sligo&#x201C; is likely, but I have written to <pb id="pg-24-126" n="24:126"/>Lord George Hill this moment, and he must decide as to Sligo. At any rate a Letter thither <hi rend="italic">would</hi> get to me, for if I do not pass that way, I will write to the Postmaster.&#x2014; And this is all I can say at present as to routes and times; for all ahead is one unravelled mass, depending on possibilities not yet disclosed, and many details of it are obliged to change from day to day. Do you write to Galway (I will make them <hi rend="italic">forward</hi> it, if needful); and say there, if you can, about what date I may begin addressing you at Walter&#x2019;s (Auchtertoul, is it not?) in Fife. Somehow I shall feel more easy about you there. Poor Goody,&#x2014;I know it well, that of wandering about, without sleep, with a sick body, with an escort only of sad thoughts for company! I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> I could but pluck away that latter element from you; but, alas, I cannot, and my poor wish is not worth the ink it costs. Insist at least on the hospitable people leaving you <hi rend="italic">alone:</hi> that is an immense point, not to be tormented with talk, to lay oneself down on a sofa, and say, &#x201C;Silence in the name of Allah!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I continue to get on admirably in all respects except that one fatal respect of the faculty of sleep. Little sleep going; too little for a wae fellow like me! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign>, I have been dreadfully off for a little quietude more than once; at Waterford the morning after last writing, I <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">awoke</hi>, very ill fitted indeed for breakfasting with rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Fathers<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps remembering his own time at Kirkcaldy, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">18</date>, TC noted that the priest&#x2019;s situation was &#x201C;that of a poor schoolmaster &#x2026; living in lodgings with a rude old woman and her niece or daughter: talk also similar,&#x2014;putting Irish for Scotch, the thing already known to me&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 93).</note> and seeing sights in the hot weather: accordingly about one o&#x2019;clock I resolutely struck work; gave up, went home to my inn, and lay down on two chairs, deciding to speak no more till the hour came for leaving Waterford. Which really did somewhat relieve me!&#x2014; What negociations I had with the Duke of Devonshire&#x2019;s Agent at Waterford, and how he <hi rend="italic">would</hi> take no denial, but do the impossible to entertain me at Lismore (which really, with the Lord Stuart so close, was quite needless, nay superfluous), I will tell you some other day: also of the said L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Stuart and Dromana House (the <hi rend="italic">Drum</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Ana</hi>), a huge grey pile in the middle of woods and lawns in the grey of 9 p.m. with a traveller in pilot-jacket, all one heap of road dust, and dreary dispiritment,&#x2014;which the social welcome, polite mild-toned, hearty, and the blessed stillness of the place dispatched. L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Stuart a man about my own age, is altogether English in manner and character; his Wife had gone to the German Baths, a step-daughter Irish-German, Baroness (I really never can remember what), whose Husband it is hoped will soon thrash the Hungarians,&#x2014;she a little talking, musical, melodious-insipid Lady, and his L<hi rend="italic">p</hi> a man of <hi rend="italic">Twistleton</hi> dialect and manner,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord Stuart de Decies; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490713-TC-ADV-01">TC to ADV, <date when="1849-07-13">13 July</date></ref>. He married, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, Theresia Pauline Ott (d. <date when="1867-00-00">1867</date>) of Vienna, but the supposed Roman Catholic marriage followed by another under Scottish law was ruled invalid when his son, Henry Windsor, tried to establish his succession to his father&#x2019;s title, <date when="1876-00-00">1876</date>. Presumably, since it was judged that his wife had not been free to marry in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, his unidentified Irish-German step-da. came from Theresia Ott&#x2019;s previous marriage.</note> were our only company in the huge <pb id="pg-24-127" n="24:127"/>house,&#x2014;where doubtless any one to talk a little must be welcome enough if there were food going! I had a room (best bedroom, I suppose) of almost an acre in extent; and silent, Oh with the silence as of the flight of Time. Had I not been driven nearly out of my skin by former excitations, I must have slept here;&#x2014;indeed I did sleep, and Devonshire Currey let me alone, I should have quite <hi rend="italic">recovered</hi> here before Monday. But no, that was not to be: after one night there, I was bowled away late next night to &#x201C;the Duke&#x2019;s&#x201C; big palace,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lismore Castle; see <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 103&#x2013;4.</note>&#x2014;room almost for a little House of Peers in it,&#x2014;and no soul visible there but one or two domestics, especially one old halting Irishwoman, who seemed to keep the rooms, and have an eye for shillings: truly a place <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> seeing however, and which could not under better auspices, or at <hi rend="italic">less</hi> expenditure of comfort by me, <hi rend="italic">be</hi> seen. From Currey too, and from Dromana, I learned a variety of things. Finally I passed the Sunday night in Sir Walter Raleigh&#x2019;s House (or College) at Youghall,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Raleigh (<date when="1552-00-00">1552</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>) lived at Myrtle Grove in the port of Youghal, of which he was mayor, <date when="1588-00-00">1588</date>&#x2013;<date when="1589-00-00">89</date>, and allegedly planted the first Irish potato. It may have been built for him or been the house of the warden of the adjacent college (see <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 109&#x2013;10) and the headquarters of Sir Walter&#x2019;s Munster colony.</note> and there&#x2014;had a sleep; two sleeps, amounting in sum to almost 8 hours! So that yesterday Evening on getting hither, to rendezvous again with Duffy I hoped the bitterness of misery was past! Alas, last night, the wind blew rattling my window (my bed one of those accursed &#x201C;French&#x201C; crotchets), so that with all my industry I could not get adjusted till 3 a.m; and then I did fall <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> asleep, and then,&#x2014;O Heaven!&#x2014;a voice was heard, and again and again ever louder heard, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="small-caps">Seven</hi></hi> <hi rend="italic">O&#x2019;clock</hi>, Sir! <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="small-caps">Seven</hi></hi> <hi rend="italic">O&#x2019;</hi> &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x201C; till I did awake, and there stood a little bottlebrush head of the infatuated Boots, with a little jug in his hand:&#x2014;a mistake of &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">slate</hi>,&#x201C; my name was on the slate. A malison rest on thee, wretched Boots. And so my head again is aching; and busy sight-seeing, dinner with some Cork dignitary being unavoidable, my outlooks are none of the best. Courage, however; we are getting thro&#x2019; it, and if Heaven will, we shall get some benefit of it too.</p>

<p><salute>Thanks, dear Brother;</salute> I got your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-07-12">12 July</date>, from Scotsbrig.</note> here last night, and was very glad of it as you may fancy. One from Jane too, and several others waited: all my Letters seemingly have hitherto gone right, notwithstanding some confusion in the posts in this quarter just now. Your Newspaper I <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> last night,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle had sent TC a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Evening Mail.</hi></note> for a sign; probably you will get it along with this,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; it is now next day, 2 p.m., &#x26; there are 2 daily posts from Cork. Limerick is the next &#x201C;Post-Office,&#x201C; pray be smart:&#x2014;I will leave notice to <hi rend="italic">forward</hi> at the several stations. &#x201C;Galway&#x201C; follows next, at the interval probably of some 6 days from this: &#x201C;Sligo&#x201C; is then next in view; and certainly I will <hi rend="italic">send</hi> to, if not visit, the Post-Office there; but my motions in that quarter depend a little on Lord George Hill, to whom I have written this day, expecting answer at Limerick or Galway.</p>
<p>Duffy and I have been parted since Friday night at Cappoquin, till last night again here. I was at Dromana (Lord Stuart de Decies, an amiable intelligent man, whose mild manners and big grey mansion over the Blackwater is pleasantly memorable to me), then at Lismore nearby, with the Duke of Devonshire&#x2019;s man, an instructive, assiduous, polite and even <hi rend="italic">excessively</hi> hospitable gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi> named Currey (Scotch, Corrie), who brought me down to Youghal (pronounced &#x201C;Yo&#x2019;al&#x201C; or even &#x201C;Yachal&#x201C;), the &#x201C;Yougal Harbour&#x201C; of a song of poor Alick&#x2019;s out of old years,&#x2014;ah me!&#x2014; where I lodged in a &#x201C;College&#x201C; (queer old habitation, very <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi>) of Sir Walter Raleigh&#x2019;s, and thanked the D. of Devonshire, the old Earls of Cork, and the beneficent upperpowers. An excellent night&#x2019;s sleep was vouchsafed me there; of which I had some need. Everywhere I got beautifully along; have nothing to complain of, except that the people are <hi rend="italic">too</hi> assiduous <pb id="pg-24-130" n="24:130"/>about me, and that I cannot well manage to secure enough of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> in my various quarters. Cork is a beautiful bright City, wearing more an air of <hi rend="italic">business</hi> than any I have yet seen in Ireland: all <hi rend="italic">white</hi>, rough cast &#x26;c, built at the bottom of woody hills, close by the shore of meandering creeks and tideways, with many quays and bridges, &#x201C;by the pleasant waters of the river Lea.&#x201C; We are to sail down this afternoon, and dine and sleep, with an admiring Samaritan,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Denny Lane (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1895-00-00">95</date>), lawyer and poet; educ. Trinity College, Dublin; M.A., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>; called to Irish bar, <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>; pbd. poems in <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, some of which, Duffy said, &#x201C;are not excelled in the whole circle of Irish song&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">My Life in Two Hemispheres</hi> 1:64); briefly imprisoned for sedition but released. TC describes him as &#x201C;distiller&#x2014;ex-repaler; frank, hearty, honest air; like Alfred Tennyson a little&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 118).</note> in some Cottage on the banks of the beautiful gulflet, or gut of the sea called Cork Harbour. So be it; for I slept ill again last night.&#x2014; The next day we go towards Killarney, or <hi rend="italic">to</hi> it, a 60 or 70 miles by Mail-Car, where a &#x201C;Shine Lawlor,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">repeal</hi> Landlord, is to, not lodge us, but lionize us. Then comes another, a <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi> Landlord, before whom Duffy will <hi rend="italic">abscond.</hi> Limerick follows, as I said, and Galway, and&#x2014;?&#x2014; In <hi rend="italic">fifteen</hi> minutes hence (for Duffy has <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> me all morning, happily, and only now discovered me in my bedroom), we are to be off to our Samaritan&#x2019;s, and have still to <hi rend="italic">pack:</hi> therefore I must needs be brief:&#x2014;alas, here is the Samaritan himself, a lusty effectual sagacious gallant-looking fellow! So I must even break off, and <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> at once. O dear Mother, dear Brother and you all,&#x2014;I will tell you so many things, everything when once we meet, which I surely trust will be soon.</p>
<p>The crops are <hi rend="italic">excellent</hi> all round and round; immense quantities of potatoes all flourishing too&#x2014;tragical to behold. They are not blighted <hi rend="italic">yet;</hi> men wait as upon the cast of the die, Yes or No; keep obstinately hoping. Beggary, tho&#x2019; abated, continues rife and great; rags, even in this City, abundant. Ireland however <hi rend="italic">will</hi> surely improve; seeds of great improvement are germinating visibly everywhere.&#x2014; To Limerick then, and next to Galway; do not let me want for a line of writing. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother,&#x2014;dear good Mother, my blessing be with you and them all! Ever affectionately,</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I got Jean&#x2019;s Letter; you can send her this forward, by way of thanks and acknowledgement, till better come&#x2014; We are <hi rend="italic">respited</hi> till 11 (hour and 1/4 hence) and come up again <hi rend="italic">tonight</hi>, as the better way. Once more <foreign>adieu</foreign>. My Samaritan is &#x201C;Denny Lane.&#x201C; &#x201C;Father Shea&#x201C; too is here, the earliest admirer of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> in this Empire, a worthy Shea!&#x2014;</p></ps>

<p>It is &#x201C;all right&#x201C;&#x2014;I am thus far on my road to you!&#x2014;have been waiting till I had settled <hi rend="italic">the day</hi> in my own mind, before writing to you&#x2014;that&#x2019;s all!

<p><salute>My Dearest,&#x2014;</salute>The night before last I wrote to you copiously from Cork; but being desolate, weary, and for an hour yet incapable of trying my cabin for sleep, I turn (as in all such moods) to my own poor Goody, as if <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would surely pity me; and will soothe myself by writing a little word to her. I had two nights in Cork, two hours sleep apiece, and a bustling flary hot day intervening,&#x2014;you may figure what a piece of work it was! Today, windy, cold and at last wet and utterly bleak and bitter, has been passed on the Coach-roof from Cork to this Lake Country, 70 miles or so; and it is now 10 o&#x2019;clock, in the public room of a Lake Inn,&#x2014;terribly ill-ventilated too,&#x2014;Good Heavens, what a comfort travelling is to the sick soul of man!&#x2014; But to take the matter historically.</p>
<p>All the morning while I sat last writing to you, to Jack, and others, Duffy and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (most luckily) had <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> me, the waiters reporting me <hi rend="italic">out;</hi> so that til 2 o&#x2019;clock, I had the day to myself; and not till 4 did the aquatic excursion down Cork Harbour to dine with &#x201C;Denny Lane&#x201C; (a big fine Irishman, much like Alfred Tennyson) take effect.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC&#x2019;s party took the steamboat from Cork Harbor to Cove Harbor, ca. 2&#xbe; mi., which included Spike Island (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18480526-TC-LC-01">TC to <sic>Lord C</sic><corr>LC</corr>, <date when="1848-05-26">26 May 1848</date></ref>) and was guarded on the E by Carlisle Fort. Fraser reports it &#x201C;greatly frequented as a bathing place&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> 248&#x2013;49). See also <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 117&#x2013;23.</note> The sail was really beautiful, &#x201C;nothing equal to it but the Bay of Naples&#x201C; say the Natives: I was very ill, but struggled to keep quiet, and make what out of it I could. An excellent bathe in sea water, I did make; I struggled to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> none, not being able for it; the people were all friendly and merry,&#x2014;and finally in a little cottage hanging over the bright blue ocean-stream, we did dine, and got into great spirits indeed. One other scene of Irish Life, the like of which, in any form, I had not seen for 20 years or more. We were Cork Trading-people, two Editors,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the eds. was Michael J. Barry (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>&#x2013;<date when="1889-00-00">89</date>), barrister, Young Ireland supporter, poet; pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Nation;</hi> ed. of the Cork <hi rend="italic">Southern Reporter;</hi> later a police magistrate in Dublin.</note> two Snuff-manufactures, one ironmonger (or some such thing),&#x2014; <pb id="pg-24-133" n="24:133"/>lastly two Catholic Priests: figure it! Father O&#x2019; Shea, I remember he wrote to Fraser about Sartor and me (as already said); I thought he had been dead, but behold here he was alive: a small innocent-hearted, loud-spoken gesticulating little creature; he and Father O&#x2019;Sullivan, his Curate, a middle-aged man, of brick-coloured skin, and brown-yellow wig, who as the wine took effect, developed himself into a Cork Wit of the first magnitude, and did in fact produce an immense quantity of <hi rend="italic">shallow laughter</hi> (from me as well as others), and came forth very strong as an Embodiment of Irish Botheration in the human form. Ah me!&#x2014; But we sailed too, over to Cove Island and Town, saw Spike Island and Fort Carlisle;&#x2014;finally got all home to Cork in cars at one in the morning; and I, who had to start after breakfast, <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to sleep soon after <hi rend="italic">five</hi> in the morning. Oh my Dear, how many things I shall have to tell you of when once we meet again!&#x2014;</p>
<p>This day has been a rapid wild journey, thro&#x2019; 70 of the saddest miles I have seen; land drearier almost all than most Scotch moors, and filled with the horridest scenes of human beggary. We met once a heap of human males and females, huddled into carts, escorted by green Police,&#x2014;criminals going to Cork for trial. Another time we passed thro&#x2019; two long rows of tattered wretches, sitting under the screen of the hedges waiting for &#x201C;outdoor relief.&#x201C; In every village were <hi rend="italic">hordes</hi> of beggars,&#x2014;scrambling, sometimes fighting for the coppers, or even for the hope of them. Ruined huts; &#x201C;hedges&#x201C; all of <hi rend="italic">whins</hi> exclusively; mossy fields everywhere <hi rend="italic">scabbed</hi> with peat-pits: a roaring grey wind, laden with showers, blowing in our faces to heighten the charm. Mallow however was beautiful; and &#x201C;the Rakes,&#x201C; I suppose, are all quieted now.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mallow, N cen. co. Cork, has mineral springs and the ruins of a castle. &#x201C;The Rakes of Mallow,&#x201C; a popular Irish song about local rakes, &#x201C;Bold and reckless, wild and daring,&#x201C; with a jaunty tune, which gave TC the title and theme for an unpbd. piece on the follies of landlords. It has been misleadingly used as a general title for a misc. collection (copied by Neuberg with TC&#x2019;s changes and corrections) of unpbd. passages about Ireland written <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">49</date>, apparently what was left after TC abstracted passages to be rewritten for <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets.</hi> In his &#x201C;Abstract&#x201C; of a batch of various papers in which this is included, Neuberg writes in summary of the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Rakes of Mallow</hi> (to go with the former Irish papers)&#x201C;: &#x201C;Foolish peasants require wise landlords. Magic of a bit of sheepskin: changes Potatoes into Champagne. &#x2026; The Universe does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> accept the Rake of Mallow&#x201C; (MS: Yale).</note> Somebody said, he had yesterday <hi rend="italic">got</hi> spoiled potatoes to dinner:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>), 3d bart, or Cecil (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">53</date>), sons of Valentine Lawless (<date when="1773-00-00">1773</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), 2d Baron Cloncurry, co. Kildare; see <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 128.</note>&#x2014;think what an omen, for the whole hope of Ireland just now seems to lie in that one fatal root!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But finally across the dreary naked, peat-pit wastes the Killarney Hills, crowned with flowing storms, looked forth, and the sun bleakly at intervals gave promise of a Lake (or Tourist) Country, where at least a Cup of Tea for thy servant might peradventure be procurable. In fact we saw clearly the <pb id="pg-24-134" n="24:134"/>big ugly hill called Mangarton<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mangerton, 2,756 ft., with a lough, &#x201C;the Devil&#x2019;s Punch Bowl,&#x201C; nr. the top, in a &#x201C;deep and secluded dell&#x201C; (Fraser, <hi rend="italic">Handbook</hi> 298).</note> near by and &#x201C;the Devil&#x2019;s Punch-bowl&#x201C; we <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> to be on its top (a dismal Lakelet there); we actually skirted Macgilliecuddy&#x2019;s Reeks (the highest land in Ireland), found ourselves in a planted, really pleasant country, got into Killarney Town, a place such as Annan (swarming with waiters, beggars and other fatal creatures),&#x2014;I rather wish we had <hi rend="italic">staid</hi> in the Town; but Duffy drove down hither, a strange kind of <hi rend="italic">country</hi> Inn or rather agglomerate of <hi rend="italic">Lodgings</hi> for people of taste, where, to judge by the bedrooms, the accommodation is none of the brightest!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >They went on to Roche&#x2019;s Hotel, Cloghereen, nr. Muckross, ca. 2&#xBD; mi. from Killarney (cf. <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 130&#x2013;31).</note> However the people, to whom Duffy is a venerable martyr and &#x201C;patriot of his Country,&#x201C; do their best: tomorrow Shine Lawlor, a mighty man in these parts, makes his entrance, and&#x2014;we shall see. My room, tho&#x2019; one of the smallest ever built, looks quiet, and has a <hi rend="italic">curtained</hi> bed.&#x2014; The &#x201C;Lake of Killarney,&#x201C; tho&#x2019; we are close by it, cannot be seen.&#x2014; I tried on all sides, found it everywhere padlocked under walls and grated gates, beset with guides, whom in my spleen I determined not to employ. Lawlor&#x2019;s <foreign>ch&#xe2;teau</foreign>, I believe, lies on it;&#x2014;nay, at worst, I do not care a penny whether, I see &#x201C;the picturesque&#x201C; of this place, or go without seeing it.&#x2014; Duffy, &#x201C;dead with sleep,&#x201C; is now gone to bed; I too will take a little whiskey punch and go. Good night, Dearest; I wish to Heaven thou wert here to screen me from myself and from all the world, poor little soul! God keep thee. Tomorrow morning I will add a word, when the Post hour is. <foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Jeannie; sleep if thou canst.</p>
<p>19<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Perceptibly better this morning; have slept till six, then sorted my things (cigar-case broken) in my little cabin,&#x2014;feeling as if tied up <hi rend="italic">in a sack</hi> there;&#x2014;breakfast is coming now; the morning is the fine one of a rainy country: and now for a sight of Killarney Lake and the visage of illustrious Shine Lawlor, about both of which, to say truth, my soul feels dreadfully indiff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> just now.&#x2014; Duffy, who indeed is very good, I think I shall nevertheless part with about Limerick if not sooner.&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, Dearest.</salute></closer></p>

I got on to the floor in a very bewildered state, and she proceeded to double back one half of my bed clothes and feather-bed, spread a pair of blankets on the matrass; then a sheet rung out of cold water; then bid me strip and lie down, I lay down and she swathed me with the wet-sheet like a mummy, then swathe me with the blankets, my arms pinioned down, exactly in fact like a mummy then rolled back the feather bed and original bedclothes on the top of me, leaving out the head&#x2014;and so left me&#x2014;for an hour&#x2014;to <hi rend="italic">go mad</hi> at my leisure!&#x2014; I had no sooner fairly <hi rend="italic">realized</hi> my situation&#x2014;of being bound hand and foot under a heap of things, than I felt quite frantic, and cursed my foolish curiosity, and made horrid efforts to release myself&#x2014;thought of <hi rend="italic">rolling</hi> to the bell and ringing it with my <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi>, but could not shake off the feather bed!&#x2014;did ultimately get one of my hands <hi rend="italic">turned round</hi>&#x2014;and was thankful for even <hi rend="italic">that</hi> change of posture&#x2014;D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Nichol says the bath-woman should have <hi rend="italic">stayed</hi> with me during the first &#x201C;pack&#x201C; and put a wet cloth on my head&#x2014;that it was the blood being sent to my head that &#x201C;caused all this wildness&#x201C;&#x2014;whatever it was; I would not undergo the thing again for a hundred guineas When the Bath-woman came back at seven I ordered her to take me out instantly&#x2014;&#x201C;But the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi>&#x201C;?&#x2014;the D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I told her had no business with <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, I was not a patient&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh! then you have only been <hi rend="italic">packed</hi> for <hi rend="italic">foon</hi>, have you?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Yes&#x2014;and very bad fun&#x201C;! so she filled a slipper-bath to &#x201C;put me to rights again&#x201C;&#x2014;and I plunged into <hi rend="italic">that</hi> so soon as I was set loose, and she plashed pitcher after pitcherful of water on my head&#x2014;and this shall be the last of my water-curing&#x2014;for the present. I feel quite shattered still, with an incipient headach. and am wishing much that Forster would come, and take me back to Rawdon&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-137" n="24:137"/>I suppose Forster has sent you a Bradford paper containing the report of our meeting for &#x201C;Roman Liberty&#x201C;&#x2014; It went off very successfully <hi rend="italic">as a meeting</hi>, but did not bring in to Forster all the &#x201C;virtue&#x2019;s own reward&#x201C; he anticipated&#x2014;and he was out of humour for twentyfour hours after&#x2014; His speech was long-winded, not good, and his delivery the worst in nature<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The meeting to persuade the govt. &#x201C;to protest on behalf of the British nation, against any further foreign interference with Rome&#x2019;s freedom and independence&#x201C; was initiated by Forster, held in Temperance Hall, and reported by the <hi rend="italic">Bradford Observer</hi>, <date when="1849-07-19">19 July</date>. The hall was crowded with &#x201C;a large body of operatives&#x201C; and a &#x201C;numerous sprinkling of middling classes.&#x201C; JWC and Elizabeth Paulet were mentioned as on the platform; Forster spoke at length about papal misgovernment, after which the <hi rend="italic">Observer</hi> gave up detailed reporting, and left out the interruptions, as his speech was &#x201C;chiefly a recapitulation of recent events.&#x201C; J. P. Nichol spoke, mainly about Hungary, then Marioni and others followed, and resolutions were passed in support of the Romans and Hungarians.</note>&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">people</hi> (<foreign><hi rend="italic">il populo</hi></foreign>) often cried &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Time&#x2014;time</hi>&#x201C;! to him&#x2014;and once they cried &#x201C;sweet soap&#x201C;!&#x2014;the yorkshire for &#x201C;soft sawder&#x201C;&#x2014; In fact the Bradford <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen</hi> on the platform were like Bess Stodart&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Aitken, b.

<p>Today I am pretty well finished off for all practical purposes, by that confounded <hi rend="italic">pack</hi>&#x2014; My head is getting every moment hotter and heavier&#x2014;and the best I can do is to get out on the hillside and think of nothing!&#x2014; Lucas&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick Lucas. &#x201C;Catholic editor, Irish M.P., poor soul!&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in LM).

<p>After Monday address to Auchtertool Manse Kircaldy I wish to heaven I were fairly there&#x2014;I could almost lose heart, and turn, and go back to London&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> go&#x2014;as I used to say when a little child and they asked if anything was too hard for me&#x2014;&#x201C;Me can do what me&#x2019;s bid&#x201C;&#x2014; The difficulty is still chiefly to <hi rend="italic">bid myself</hi>&#x2014;and I <hi rend="italic">have bid</hi> myself go to Scotland&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Well, my little Goody, here again goes off a Note to you;</salute> but in fact it is rather to save <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> from being walked about the premises farther, than to favour you with news, that I have taken to my desk just now.

<p>Last night when I rang the bell, the Post was &#x201C;gone 10 minutes&#x201C; ago; so here follows part 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, an interval of &#x201C;10 minutes&#x201C; being now conceded <hi rend="italic">me</hi> before Church time.</p>

She was a striking figure, but she had cold, cruel eyes, and a silent, reserved air, which was altogether disagreeable. She lived in stern reserve, and imposed her rigorous formal character upon her household. &#x2026; She lived in constant obedience to what she called her duty, a sort of thrall of the Thirty-nine Articles and that sort of thing.&#x201C; When TC arrived, &#x201C;she had evidently not liked him, and peered at him, through her cold blue eyes, half shut with anxious scrutiny; but she came to like him better afterwards, and opened them a little. &#x2026; She spoke about her former connection with the stage &#x2026; as a sovereign might speak of some incident of her early life in exile. There were two young daughters, the youngest really a lovely little lassie, and three boys. &#x2026; The old baronet, who was stricken with disease, was a fine simple old gentleman&#x201C; (Duffy 98&#x2013;99).</note> Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> and two Brothers appeared at dinner; <pb id="pg-24-141" n="24:141"/>good gentlemen all, especially the Baronet, who is unfortunately lamed with some kind of palsy, but carries still the aspect of courteous benevolence, and great intelligence and human worth.&#x2014; The young ladies,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >No doubt the Bechers&#x2019; two das.: Mary Sarah (d. <date when="1899-00-00">1899</date>) and Elizabeth (d. <date when="1906-00-00">1906</date>). Lady Becher wrote, <date when="1849-07-25">25 July</date>, to Anthony Sterling, who had given TC a letter of introduction to her (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 155), of the pleasure she and her family had had in TC&#x2019;s visit: &#x201C;I dont exactly know the sort of information he wished for, but he talked upon various subjects&#x2014; &#x26; I hope <hi rend="italic">my Gentlemen</hi> may have been of use to him&#x201C; (MS: NLS Acc. 8140).</note> innocent gay creatures, sang me Irish and Scotch-Jacobite songs for evening amusement; and the elder Lady herself condescended to do &#x201C;King of the Heeland hearts, bonny prince C<hi rend="italic">ie</hi> [Charlie]&#x201C; tho&#x2019; with voice suffering from <hi rend="italic">rust</hi> or cold.&#x2014; Better still there is no train this Sunday to Limerick; so I may sleep again here, and find that an excuse for setting Duffy on his way <hi rend="italic">without</hi> me.

It may not be tomorrow night however&#x2014;for I am determined not to overdo myself&#x2014;as Jenny Clow used to say; &#x201C;theres nought <hi rend="italic">pushing;</hi> the rowans is a i the loft&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451001-JWC-TC-02"><sic>20:6</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-10-01">1 Oct. 1845</date></corr></ref>.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>On the <date when="1849-07-29">29<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of the month, which I think will be Sunday next, it appears, so far as I can calculate, that I shall be in Sligo, preparing to journey onwards to Donegal and Gweedore, the route for which according to my best knowledge hitherto seems to lie thro&#x2019; Letterkenny. I could quicken or retard my steps a little to intersect you, if there were any real chance of your coming; but I doubt there is now none. A Letter, &#x201C;Post-Office, Sligo&#x201C; will find me if you are speedy about it; and if you come there in person, and be waiting at &#x201C;the chief Hotel&#x201C; (title as yet unknown to me), of course it will be far welcomer. Duffy and I have coincided with one another, parted and again come in contact; we met here last night and part again today<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC inscribed a photograph of himself, &#x201C;My best wishes and regards / from Limerick / this 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of <date when="1849-07-00">july, 1849</date>. / T. Carlyle&#x201C; (Photo: Trinity; pbd. Duffy frontispiece).</note> but I think may very probably have rallied about Sligo again,&#x2014;for the purpose of parting <hi rend="italic">finally</hi> at Gweedore, his affairs calling him thence in haste to Dublin.</p>
<p>From him I have seen the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> or Catholic side of things all along, as from others I have amply enough seen what is represented as the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> side. A very ugly bit of tapestry on whatever side seen!</p>
<p>Nevertheless great seeds of improvements are visibly sown: the next generation of Irishmen may fairly hope to be ahead of any of its predecessors,&#x2014;nearer to a level with English<hi rend="italic">n</hi> than has ever been the case before.&#x2014; Meanwhile the fatal Potatoe blooms everywhere (blight, I am <hi rend="italic">told</hi>, now making its appearance), and every kind of rags and incoherencies are the staple products of the land.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-145" n="24:145"/>My Wife I suppose left you for Auchtertool yesterday? <closer><salute>Thanks for your goodness to her; and <foreign>adieu</foreign> with many blessings.</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I got Jack&#x2019;s two Newspapers at Limerick the night before last, and returned one of them to him; I wish I had found a Letter too,&#x2014;but there was none! I heard from Jane however; who, I think, is now on the last stage <pb id="pg-24-146" n="24:146"/>of her road towards Auchtertool, if not arrived there by this time. Tell Jack my next &#x201C;Post-Office&#x201C; after Galway is <hi rend="italic">Sligo;</hi> but this I think will be too late now for a <hi rend="italic">Letter:</hi> however, if he will bestir himself within a day or two after receipt of this, and address &#x201C;Post-Office, Londonderry,&#x201C; I could hope to find it there after getting out of Gweedore and the Donegal wildernesses; which would be a great pleasure to me at the end of my pilgrimings! For this Irish Tour of mine is now looking towards its close; I have been travelling ever since Killarney with my face rather homewards; and once at Derry I shall have only to look out for some Steamer towards <hi rend="italic">Scotland</hi>, there or at some other Northern Port, and so come home to you after all! Belfast I think is the only Port that communicates with Annan: it will depend purely on the <hi rend="italic">days</hi>, whether I shall go on to Belfast, or take the sea at Derry for Glasgow, and so arrive upon you by rail. Bid the Doctor ascertain if he can what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the Belfast and Annan days; that I may see at Derry what is to be aimed at.&#x2014; Everything is very <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi> in this region; everybody seems to answer your question, not according to what the fact is, but according to what he thinks will <hi rend="italic">please you:</hi> you cannot till you <hi rend="italic">see</hi> it, in general, <hi rend="italic">ascertain</hi> any point, even the sailing of a Steamer or the hour of a Coach-departure. Woe is them that do not stand by the <hi rend="italic">truth:</hi> truth <hi rend="italic">forsakes</hi> them (very naturally), and they come at last to be in want of all that truth gives,&#x2014;even of a morsel of food!</p>
<p>I forget where it was I wrote to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> last; was it at Killarney, my next stage after Cork? Or perhaps I only wrote to Jane there? I was much hurried, and had nothing but galloping to and fro while in those regions. I wrote to <hi rend="italic">Jean</hi>, to Dumfries, three days ago; which news she may perhaps have forwarded to Scotsbrig. I was there reposing for two days (Saturday till Monday morning) at a beautiful place called Ballygiblin near Mallow; the Lady of which was the once celebrated Actress Miss O&#x2019;Neil (ask John about her), now a most strict religious Lady, of very high paces indeed; with a sumptuous well-ordered House, and the stamp of her own rigorous correct character impressed on all her people and possessions. A woman worth seeing once and away. Her husband, Sir W. Beecher, an excellent elderly gent<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, brought me strongly in mind of Johnstone of Grange:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Johnston(e); see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250826-TC-MRSWJ-01"><sic>3:372</sic><corr>TC to MRSWJ, <date when="1825-08-26">26 Aug. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> I also found other good people there, went to (Protestant) Church &#x26;c; but next door to them in both cases is an &#x201C;Absentee,&#x201C; whose tenants are all in ruin; whose very lands are now lying desolate, nothing growing on them but a wood of <foreign><hi rend="italic">dockens</hi></foreign> [weeds]&#x2014; The potatoes are said to be now declaring themselves <hi rend="italic">blighted</hi> again in whole or in part is yet uncertain. Unhappy people!</p>
<p>I sent a <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> once to Mary at Gill; tell Jamie I hope to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> him soon, at Annan or otherwise. <closer><salute>Blessings on you all!</salute></closer> <name>T. Car<supplied>[lyle]</supplied></name></p>

Mr Bourke, an extensive Poor-Law Inspector, hopes after that to contrive some opportunity of looking at Westport or even Ballina (which is his special quarter) on the route towards Sligo: but this of course still depends; and only the arrival in Galway, where you of course are to be expected in person, is yet fixed.</p>
<p>If the H&#xF4;tel is not &#x201C;Kilroy&#x2019;s,&#x201C; I have forgotten it. Or perhaps the Coach itself will spontaneously land me there? Otherwise perhaps you might wisely send some &#x201C;Boots&#x201C; or other the like Official to be in waiting for me.</p>
<p>The day is balm and sunshine itself; and grateful is the prospect to me of spending it mostly in silence,&#x2014;sauntering among these graves, &#x201C;thinking and smoking tobacco&#x201C; as the Poet&#x2019;s old Precept is.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300615-TC-HI-01"><sic>5:115</sic><corr>TC to HI, <date when="1830-06-15">15 June 1830</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>

<p><salute>My dear Dear&#x2014;</salute>I wrote you a long&#x2014;very long letter last night, at midnight, from this same place&#x2014; But this morning instead of posting it in the postoffice I have torn it up. You may fancy what sort of a letter, &#x201C;all about <hi rend="italic">feelings</hi>&#x201C; (as Lady A would say) an excitable character like me would write in such circumstance, after a long railway journey, and a three hours-pilgrimage all up and down and accross and round about Haddington&#x2014; And you can also understand how after some hours of sleep, I should have reacted against my last nights self, and thought all that <hi rend="italic">steam</hi> best gathered back into the Vale of <hi rend="italic">Silence</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have now only time to write the briefest of notes&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">a blessing from here</hi> I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> send you&#x2014;to no other mortal would I or indeed <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I write from this place at this moment&#x2014;but it comes natural to me to direct a letter to <hi rend="italic">you here</hi> and that is still <hi rend="italic">something</hi> is it not?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I will give you all my news so soon as I have slept a night at Auchtertool&#x2014; I expect Walter and Jeanie will meet me at the station in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, where I shall be at a quarter after twelve&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am not too much tired&#x2014;my journey has been made as easy for me as possible&#x2014; From Rawdon to Morpeth, on Tuesday; William Edward most kindly accompanying me there, and seeing me off next day&#x2014; &#x201C;I looked so <hi rend="italic">horribly helpless</hi> he said, that he could not reconcile it to his conscience to leave me <hi rend="italic">a chance</hi> at losing myself&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was wandering about till after dark last night and out again this morning at six&#x2014;but I must leave all particulars till a more leisure moment&#x2014; and till my heart is a little calmer than just at present I am so glad I came here on this incognito principle&#x2014; It is the only way in which I could have got any good of the dear old place&#x2014;God bless it! how changed it is and how changed am I!&#x2014;but enough just now</p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>I duly found your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-07-20">20 July</date>.</note> yesterday at Galway, and was very glad indeed to have a word of news from you again. I got <hi rend="italic">newspapers</hi> at Cork and some other place, but of articulate writing nothing for a good while before. To my Mother I have written repeatedly; I wrote also to Jean once: but indeed my existence of late has been such a swift-rushing whirlpool, I have hardly memory of whom I wrote to or what I did.</p>
<p>After Limerick, the Bourke of whom I wrote last, the <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> Bourke, accompanied me in a Car to Killaloe, then along to Scariff (one of the wretchedest spots in Nature), and so along to Gort, an &#x201C;insolvent union&#x201C; 16 miles to the east of Galway,&#x2014;a drive in all of some 30 or 40 miles. We got there latish; he had a friend, &#x201C;Inspector Horsley&#x201C; (grandson of Bishop Horsley)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Horsley (<date when="1733-00-00">1733</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>), bishop of St. Asaph&#x2019;s, <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1806-00-00">6</date>, prominent ecclesiastical statesman, high church theologian, scientist, and ed. of Isaac Newton&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Omnia Opera</hi>, 5 vols. (<date when="1779-00-00">1779</date>&#x2013;<date when="1785-00-00">85</date>); had connections with Edinburgh Univ. His son Heneage Horsley (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>) had been apptd. to a chaplaincy in the Episcopal church of Dundee after his rapid promotion was stopped by financial scandals. He had married Frances Emma Bourke (d. <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), Sir Richard Bourke&#x2019;s sister and a cousin of Edmund Burke, who was their guardian after their father&#x2019;s death. The grandson Samuel (b. ca. <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), temporary poor law inspector, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, and inspector, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, was &#x201C;a Dundee man, well enough and very hospitable, not a man to set the Thames on fire&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 185).</note> with whom I also had some talk and tea; with him B. staid, I went to the inn to sleep,&#x2014;but, owing to a <hi rend="italic">snoring</hi> neighbour &#x26;c &#x26;c, had rather indifferent success. Next morning, a bright sunshiny morning, I got on the Coach-roof for Galway: 16 miles of the <hi rend="italic">stoniest</hi> country I ever beheld; infinitely stonier than any Craigenputtoch, indeed in many places nothing else but stones. A very poor and desolate country indeed. Yet when cultivated and cleared, the soil proves excellent, and everything, shaded and fringed with wood and vegetation, grows really beautiful. Galway itself at length hove in sight, on the northward side of the bright Bay, a very curious, much poverty-struck, yet still respectable old &#x201C;Spanish&#x201C; City;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Galway&#x2019;s foreign trade was mostly with Spain.</note> where Duffy, parted from me since Limerick, was again in waiting to welcome me to land. It was Assize-time; the Town one vortex of lawyers, not a quiet nook to be had for love or money: so I decided to see swiftly whatsoever was to be seen and then take myself away. Letters once read <pb id="pg-24-150" n="24:150"/>&#x26;c, I accordingly <hi rend="italic">did</hi> the sights, Duffy and an Able Editor<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Butler (<date when="1823-00-00">1823</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">79</date>), journalist and politician; educ.

He remained in touch with Gavan Duffy.

<p><hi rend="italic">Castlebar</hi> (same day 8 p.m).

In short here we are; some 50 miles from Sligo, face decidedly <hi rend="italic">northward</hi> and homeward; and the next thing you hear of me, I hope, will be that I am at Londonderry (say, about 6 days<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote &#x201C;six&#x201C; above &#x201C;6.&#x201C;</note> hence), and preparing to run homewards!</p>
<p>Duffy keeps with me to Sligo, where a certain &#x201C;Counsellor&#x201C; Walker<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Roger Chambers Walker.</note> (friend of A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Sterling&#x2019;s) has invited both of us to stay in his Country-house certain days; we intend to stay <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day (at least, I do), and then I fancy D.<hi rend="italic">y</hi> and I will finally part; he towards Dublin, I towards Lord George Hill&#x2019;s place (Ballyare, and then Gweedore), from whom I had a very kind Letter<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-07-25">25 July</date>.</note> at Galway, inviting me, describing the roads and so forth. <hi rend="italic">After</hi> him (whom I intend to be with on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>), comes Londonderry in a day,&#x2014;or Belfast in some two, if I can learn rightly on what the Steamer <hi rend="italic">sails</hi> there.&#x2014; And this, dear Brother, is what I can write just now, while the evening twilight is fast thickening, and it is getting time to close. My dear Mother will be <pb id="pg-24-151" n="24:151"/>very glad to hear I am coming home: of that I am sure enough!

<salute>Dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I should have written you a long letter today&#x2014;on &#x201C;the voluntary principle&#x201C;&#x2014;had there not arrived, along with <hi rend="italic">your</hi> most provoking note from Rawdon, some letters of a business sort absolutely requiring answers&#x2014; And the post it seems leaves here at three oclock and we breakfasted this morning at&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">eleven!</hi> Alas!&#x2014;so the <hi rend="italic">long</hi> letter must lie over till another day&#x2014;and meanwhile here are two lines&#x2014;just to tell you that I am safe at my Cousin&#x2019;s and dreadfully in need of being written to!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Why on earth did not you have business in Bradford a few days sooner? But no matter! John Carlyle writes to me this morning of an &#x201C;economical question&#x201C; which holds out compensation in no distant future. Because, you see, as to the question of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">permanency</hi>&#x201C;; there is no doubt of it!&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">instinctive</hi> sympathies never yet deceived me&#x2014;only my factitious&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">got up</hi> sympathies&#x2014;so you will have that &#x201C;possession,&#x201C; (such as it is) as long as you can find room for it&#x2014;</p>
<p>I left Rawdon on Tuesday morning&#x2014;Forster accompanying me to Morpeth, where we staid all night and till two next day&#x2014;for I did not wish to reach Haddington till the evening&#x2014;when few people would be going about&#x2014;I might have spared the precaution, being as I afterwards found almost wholly irrecognisable!&#x2014; Forster having seen me settled in the train, returned to Rawdon and is now off to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C in Ireland, and I was whirled on to my native town where I staid from six in the evening till eleven next morning&#x2014;feeling as like a ghost as a living woman could well feel&#x2014;Changed&#x2014;and all around me, changed still more&#x2014;alone&#x2014;unknown&#x2014;undreamt of!

<p><salute>Thanks, dearest John, for your note and for your kind &#x201C;anxiety&#x201C;!</salute> I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> had my humour out, and no harm done. It was very sorrowful&#x2014;in fact I can imagine nothing <hi rend="italic">more</hi> sorrowful than that inspection of poor old Haddington all alone, and unknown, undreamt of by any one! but it was a sorrow more <hi rend="italic">satisfactory</hi> to me than any <hi rend="italic">pleasures</hi> could be at this date&#x2014; And after all it was no worse than what I am in the habit of <hi rend="italic">dreaming</hi> at Chelsea every time there is a headach in the wind! If I was to go there at all it was much the best way of going; to have had almost irrecognisable people receiving me with kisses and tears and &#x201C;all that sort of thing&#x201C; would have upset me altogether; as it was, I played my part of Stranger at the Inn very well, and got thro the whole business with wonderfully little <hi rend="italic">crying</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>But mercy of Heaven how changed is everybody and everything! The town is ruined&#x2014;the railway has ruined it they say&#x2014;almost all the names I knew had disappeared from the <hi rend="italic">signs</hi> and I found them on the tombstones of the Church yard&#x2014;my Fathers tombstone was grown over with moss&#x2014;the inscription illegible, except the first two lines that somebody had quite recently cleared! who? who was there still caring for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> besides myself?</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-153" n="24:153"/>Forster came to Morpeth with me on Tuesday&#x2014;and we stayed there till Wednesday at 2 o&#x2019;clock&#x2014;that I might not get in to Haddington till evening, when few people would be about&#x2014; I went to the George Inn (where the people were all strangers&#x2014;had been there <hi rend="small-caps">only</hi> <hi rend="italic">twenty years</hi>&#x2014;) and settled my things for the night, and had some tea&#x2014; I then told the Landlord I should like to &#x201C;look at the old church there,&#x201C; if the key could be got&#x2014;and immediately the man who kept the key was sent for&#x2014; When he had opened the outer gate I told him to wait for me&#x2014;that I only wished to walk thro&#x2019; the church yard&#x2014; But when I had to come back with my face swelled with crying, he was sure I was no stranger&#x2014;and after a fruitless question or two which I staved off by questioning <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, when I asked if he lived far from the Inn (I was thinking how I should get into the Churchyard again before breakfast) he answered looking sharply at me&#x2014;&#x201C;just next door to the House that was D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Welsh&#x2019;s&#x201C;! then he said &#x201C;Excuse me mentioning <hi rend="italic">that</hi> but since ever I set my eyes on you, I have had a notion it was her we used all to look after when she went up or down&#x201C;! I gave him half a crown not to tell anyone, and to leave the gate open for me next morning, and then I walked two hours all about the places I remembered best, and returned to my Inn after dark&#x2014;and sat up till one in the morning writing to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C (and tore up the letter next morning and wrote a brief business-like note instead) and I should actually have slept&#x2014;so worn out I was!&#x2014;if it had not been for a cat-<foreign>soiree</foreign> on the opposite roofs&#x2014; Then at six I was up and out again Examined the <hi rend="italic">out</hi>side of our own house&#x2014;while its occupant young Thomas Howden<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas, son of Dr. Thomas Howden, surgeon, her father&#x2019;s medical partner.

<p><salute>Well, Dearest, I trust you have got safe to Auchtertool, and are quiet in Walter&#x2019;s Manse this day:</salute> here also am I arrived safe&#x2014;2 o&#x2019;clock of a showery day,&#x2014;and the first thing I do after washing my face, is to write you account of myself. My poor little Goody, to whom else can I write my sorrows, my &#x201C;complaints,&#x201C;&#x2014;my joys, if I had any considerable?&#x2014; Bad luck to that quavering, trilling musical jackass with mustachios, a Lieutenant of Foot I judge, who scared us out of one room with his tobacco, and is now singing audibly over all the house, Sabbath tho&#x2019; it is, and interrupting me here!&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2026; The day before yesterday I wrote to you from Tuam, under the shadow of the big Cathedral of &#x201C;John of <hi rend="italic">Chume!</hi>&#x201C; A nasty product, &#x201C;John of Chume&#x201C;: we passed his birthplace today; a wild grim patch of farm by the shore of a big desolate lake among the wilderness of stony moors and mountains: a place to nurse a man of some talent into a priest of much fanaticism,&#x2014;poor &#x201C;John of Chume,&#x201C; cursing with bell, book and candle, according to his trade!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John MacHale (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1881-00-00">1881</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17528"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), archbishop of Tuam since <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>, opposed to everything English. &#x201C;Chume&#x201C; is the Irish pronunciation of Tuam. See <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 194&#x2013;95, 209.</note>&#x2014; From Tuam, after a baddish night, we got under way upon the Mail for Castlebar, the County Town of Mayo, and thence for Westport, some forty miles in all: the morning was wettish, but I preferred the outside; smoked and looked, pretty well wrapped up, and nothing to complain of; Duffy inside, and <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> allowed me. At Castlebar, the rain increasing, Duffy proposed to stop, and not see Westport the <hi rend="italic">acme</hi> of the <pb id="pg-24-155" n="24:155"/>Beggary in these parts: I again was clear for persisting; sat accordingly, swiftly wafted into the teeth of a fierce wind and rain, tobacco and my poor umbrella being my only comfort, for the next ten miles; when Westport came in view, a nice-<hi rend="italic">looking</hi> Town (for all those towns had corn-factors, butter, bacon, land-factors, who built big houses), and the mountain behind it called &#x201C;Croagh Phaedrig&#x201C; (Patrick&#x2019;s Hill), where St. Patrick gathered all the serpents and also all the devils, and making a big mass of them all, in one night, hurled them next morning into Clew Bay and the general Atlantic,&#x2014;more power to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> elbow! &#x2026; The &#x201C;Dean Bourke,&#x201C; Catholic Priest to whom I had a letter from Lord Sligo<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Middle-aged, middle-sized figure, rustyish black coat, hessian boots, white stockings, good humoured, loud-speaking face, frequently Lundy-foot snuff&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 202). For Lord Sligo&#x2019;s letter, where &#x201C;one Goldea&#x201C; is said to be the addressee, see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490629-TC-CGD-01">TC to CGD, <date when="1849-06-28">28</date> <date when="1849-06-29">[29] June</date></ref>. Neither Goldea nor Dean Bourke has been traced.</note> never shows his face but forty or fifty scarecrows of both sexes fasten on him, soon swelling to four or five hundred; and the poor man, a good-humoured elderly fellow with much snuff on his breastworks, has a sad time of it. &#x201C;Go, I don&#x2019;t <hi rend="italic">keer</hi> if ye were dead,&#x201C; he says to them, and doesn&#x2019;t affect any sensibility he cannot feel. A short look at all <hi rend="italic">this</hi>,&#x2014;where every second soul is a pauper, and some three score Mothers with infants were to be seen, at the national charges nourishing a <hi rend="italic">chattery</hi> of new paupers,&#x2014;sufficed us, and we decided to come back to Castlebar that same night, instead of on the morrow (to-day); and there accordingly, we staid, doing all that was doable with <hi rend="italic">new</hi> Pauper Unions, etc.;&#x2014;and were about to start this morning hitherward at 11 o&#x2019;clock, when, lo, the coach horn from the westward sounded; and very blue in the face, but otherwise brisk and lively there rushed in,&#x2014;W. E. Forster! Shot like a bullet all the way from Rawdon, by excellent calculation he had there hit us! I laughed at the singularity of the thing, and again laughed; and in fact was and am very glad at the rencounter. He stept into our Car, public Car occupied by us alone; and here he is, as large as life, and as full of locomotion as ever!&#x2014; Let me tell thee now what awaits of motion for the coming few days. My <hi rend="italic">pen</hi> is very bad; and in addition to the <hi rend="italic">music</hi>, here are able editors coming, etc., etc.!</p>
<p>To-morrow Duffy and I go to Sligo (only 20 or 30 miles); there, Walker (A. Sterling&#x2019;s friend) keeps us as guests till Wednesday morning; Forster in the meanwhile has other excursions to make along the shore here, and will rejoin us on Sligo Streets, and mount the Coach or Car with us,&#x2014;for 30 or 40 miles on; to a little town called Donegal, there I leave <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, to make his way round by the <hi rend="italic">coast</hi> to Gweedore; &#x2026; Enough, enough, my poor little wearied woman. To-morrow I expect to hear of you at Sligo; on Wednesday, I am to ask for Forster&#x2019;s Letters at &#x201C;Letter Kenny,&#x201C; and will ask for <pb id="pg-24-156" n="24:156"/>myself too, he having <hi rend="italic">advised</hi> you to write thither, tho&#x2019; I guess there will be nothing, you being rather <hi rend="italic">un</hi>advisable!</p>
<p>My poor little Goody&#x2014;ah me, my heart is sore for thee, and that sad Haddington night (for I have got all your bits of news out of Forster as we came along, having the whole side of the Car to ourselves): however, it was perhaps <hi rend="italic">right;</hi> indeed I imagine I should have done the very same myself. God help thee, my little one; think that, beside that Grave, there is also one soul still alive who can never cease to love thee. Yes, after his own wild way,&#x2014;stern as the way of death,&#x2014;to love thee: that is a truth, and will remain one. <foreign>Eheu, eheu</foreign> [Alas, alas]!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But now having got safe to Auchtertool harbour, you will send me Letters in plenty, will you not? At any rate you will lie quiet, and get into heart and health again. And you have your <hi rend="italic">MS.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the account of her visit to Haddington (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18490802-JWC-MAAN-01"><corr>JWC&#x2019;s</corr> MAAN, <date when="1849-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref>), but TC says that he &#x201C;had never heard of it before&#x201C; (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi> 2:52).</note> with you to copy, if you like; a precious thing indeed!</p>
<p>Duffy has always been kind and loyal to me; but he is not half so good a manager as Forster is: &#x2026;</p>
<p>But, alas, my Dear, I am leaving the able editor to rot; I really must give up.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here I am safe since last night in L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> George Hill&#x2019;s Establishment; just about proceeding to Gweedore, which is some 20 miles off thro&#x2019; the mountains to the sea-coast: in half an hour we are to be under way, and my packing is not yet done, so I must be brief!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday I got your Letter at Sligo, the Newspaper the night before, which latter I <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> for a sign. All has gone well with me, and indeed I feel generally <hi rend="italic">well</hi> in health, and getting forward with good success towards the end of my Irish Tour. At Castlebar (did I tell you?) Forster shot in upon Duffy and me, proceeding really almost like a cannon-ball, with such velocity had he come from Rawdon; and <hi rend="italic">hit</hi> us just in the nick of time; for in five minutes more we sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have been off by another coach. A very welcome rencounter!</p>
<p>Yesterday we all started together from Sligo; Forster we left at Donegal, some 40 miles of road done, to prosecute his way to Gweedore by the Coast, where I expect to find him under Lord George&#x2019;s escort <hi rend="italic">today;</hi>&#x2014;then forward some 20 miles Duffy and I rode together, thro&#x2019; the Gap of Barnesmore, on our Public Derry Car; about a mile from Stranorlar (16 miles off this), a fat figure in grey hodden, and rather hairy about the chin, met us, cried, &#x201C;Ya it is all right!&#x201C; and took to running with us: It was poor Plattnauer! He had come thus far to meet me; he had luncheon laid out in the Inn at Stranorlar,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 228.</note> cars all ready, tobacco &#x26;c&#x2014;poor fellow;&#x2014;and so I came along much at my ease to this quiet abode, and found myself in moorings again, mildly and cordially welcomed, about 6&#xBD; p.m. I have slept well since; and now &#x201C;his Lordship&#x201C; (an excellent mild pious yet soldier-like little man) will drive us both over in his Car, and &#x201C;shew us <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Gweedore.&#x201C; Forster I am to introduce to him; we pass the night at the Inn; return on the morrow hither,&#x2014;Forster will go to some Inn, I opine, for this of mine is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> spare bed in this frugal very curious place!&#x2014;and on Saturday we are to rally at a certain Mr Otway&#x2019;s (a squire of some degree on Loch Swilly, whom we have seen),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Otway is unmentioned by name in <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> but was presumably a certain &#x201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Something, a retired merchant of full purse, our intended host&#x2019;s father-in-law&#x201C; (252).</note> and on Monday after 7 miles travel we are to be in Derry, if all go right,&#x2014;and find word from you and others. Pray forward <pb id="pg-24-159" n="24:159"/>this immediately to Jane, for I have not an instant today.&#x2014; And observe farther a request: If you have a spare Copy of your <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> about you, pray address it, &#x201C;<supplied>[E?]</supplied>.

<p>On Tuesday <date when="1849-07-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> July 1849</date>, I left Rawdon<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Nr. Bradford Yorkshire&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note on MS). Morpeth is 15 mi. N of Newcastle.</note> after breakfast, and at five ofthe afternoon reached Morpeth; where I had decided to pass the night. William Forster escorted me thus far, and stayed to start me by the 2 o&#x2019;clock train next day;&#x2014;out of pure <hi rend="italic">charity</hi>, having adopted Donovan&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote &#x201C;Donavon,&#x201C; which TC changed to &#x201C;Donovan,&#x201C; noting on MS &#x201C;a quack Physiognomist &#x26;c. of the time.&#x201C; See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490812-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1849-08-12">12 Aug.</date>]</ref>.</note> theory of me, that I am wholly without <hi rend="italic">observing Faculty</hi>, with large <hi rend="italic">Reflectiveness</hi> turned inward;&#x2014;a sort of woman, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, ill adapted for travelling by railway, alone, with two boxes, a writing-case, and carpet-bag. Anyhow, I was much the better of such a cheerful companion; to stave off the nervousness about Haddington; not to speak of the <hi rend="italic">material</hi> comforts,&#x2014;a rousing fire, brandy-<foreign>negus</foreign> &#x26;c,&#x2014;which he ordered for me at the Inn, and which I should not have had the audacity<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC wrote &#x201C;face&#x201C; and then &#x201C;audacity&#x201C; without deleting &#x201C;face.&#x201C;</note> to order on my own basis.</p>
<p>After a modest dinner of chops and cherrytart; we walked by the River-side in a drizzling rain (<hi rend="italic">that</hi> was at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> suggestion); then back to the Phenex for tea, chess, and speculative talk till midnight: when I went to bed <pb id="pg-24-160" n="24:160"/>expecting no sleep to speak of, and of course slept unusually well; for the surest way to get a thing in this Life is to be prepared for doing without it,&#x2014;to the exclusion even of <hi rend="italic">hope.</hi></p>
<p>Next morning was bright as diamonds, and we walked all about the Town and neighbouring Hights; where, rendered unusually communicative by our isolated position, I informed William Edward that my maternal Grandmother was &#x201C;descended from <hi rend="italic">a Gang</hi> of Gipsies,&#x201C;&#x2014;was in fact grandniece to Matthew Baillie who &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> at Lanark,&#x201C;&#x2014;that is to say, was <hi rend="italic">hanged</hi> there,&#x2014;a genealogical fact Forster said which made <hi rend="italic">me</hi> at last intelligible for him,&#x2014;&#x201C;a cross betwixt John Knox and a Gipsey how that explained all.&#x201C;&#x2014; By the way, my uncle has told me since I came here, that the wife of that Mathew Baillie, Margaret Euston by name, was the original of Sir W Scott&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Meg Merrilies.</hi> Mathew himself was <hi rend="italic">the last of the Gipsies</hi>,&#x2014;could steal a horse <hi rend="italic">from under</hi> the owner, if he liked, but left always the saddle and bridle; a thorough <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> in his way, and sixfeet four in stature!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Yowston or Yorkston, &#x201C;gypsy queen,&#x201C; wife of Matthew Baillie, who was tried, <date when="1732-05-00">May 1732</date>, and transported for theft; see David MacRitchie, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Gypsies under the Stewarts</hi> (<date when="1894-00-00">1894</date>). Scott&#x2019;s Meg Merrilies is based on several characters, including Mary Yowston; Scott noted in <hi rend="italic">Guy Mannering</hi> that &#x201C;Meg should be considered as representative of her sect and class in general, rather than any one original&#x201C; (Border Edn. [<date when="1892-00-00">1892</date>] 2:339&#x2013;40). Matthew Baillie, who succeeded his murdered father as Gypsy king, <date when="1726-00-00">1726</date>, was imprisoned several times, but there is no reliable trace of his being hanged. He had the reputation of being noble and gentle and was succeeded by four sons. JWC is wrong to call him the last of the Gypsies.</note></p>
<p>But to go back to Morpeth, we again dined at the Phenex; then Forster put me into my carriage, and my luggage in the van and I was shot off towards Scotland; while himself took train for&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Ireland!</hi></p>
<p>From Morpeth to Haddington is a journey of only four hours; again &#x201C;the wished for come too late&#x201C;!<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440805-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:170</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-08-05">5 Aug. 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> rapidest travelling to Scotland now, and no <hi rend="italic">home</hi> there any more!</p>
<p>The first locality I recognised was <hi rend="italic">the Peas Bridge:</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC went by rail from Newcastle to Tweedmouth (opened <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>), by ferry to Berwick, then on the North British Railway&#x2019;s main line N from Berwick (opened <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>) to Edinburgh, which had a branch from Longniddry to Haddington. The gap at Berwick was bridged, <date when="1850-08-00">Aug. 1850</date>. Pease Bridge, nr. Cockburnspath, Berwickshire, built <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date> over a large ravine, is 300 ft. long and 127 ft. high.</note> I had been there <hi rend="italic">once</hi> before, a little child, in a postchaise with my Father; he had held his arm round me while I looked down the ravine; it was my first sight of the Picturesque, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, I recognised the place even in passing it at railway speed, after all these long long years.</p>
<p>At the Dunbar station an old Lady in widow&#x2019;s dress, and a young one, her daughter, got into the carriage which I had had so far all to myself; a <pb id="pg-24-161" n="24:161"/>man in yeomanry uniform waiting to see them off. &#x201C;Ye&#x2019;ll maybe come and see us the <hi rend="italic">morn&#x2019;s <foreign>nicht</foreign>?</hi>&#x201C; said the younger Lady from the carriage. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">What for</hi> did ye <hi rend="italic">no</hi> come to the Ball? answered the yeoman, with a look &#x201C;to split a pitcher&#x201C;? The young Lady <foreign><hi rend="italic">tchick-tchicked</hi></foreign>, and looked deprecatingly, and tried again and again to <hi rend="italic">enchain</hi> conversation; but, to every thing she said, came the same answer; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">what for</hi> did ye <hi rend="italic">no</hi> come to the Ball?&#x201C;&#x2014; The poor young Lady then tried holding her tongue; her lover (only her <hi rend="italic">Lover</hi> would have used her so <hi rend="italic">brutally</hi>) did the same; but rested his chin on the carriage-window to scowl at her with more convenience. The interest was rising; but one could see who of them would speak first. &#x201C;Oh!&#x201C; broke out the young Lady, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just mourning!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">What for?</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh just <hi rend="italic">that</hi> Ball!&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">What for</hi> then did <hi rend="italic">no</hi> come?&#x201C; growled the <hi rend="italic">repeating decimal;</hi> &#x201C;I waited an <hi rend="italic">oor</hi> for ye!&#x201C; and he got his upper lip over the strap of his cap and champed it&#x2014;like a horse!&#x2014; Squeal went the engine; we were off; the young Lady &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">just mourned</hi>&#x201C; for a minute or two, then fell to talking with her Mother; for me, I reflected how &#x201C;the feelings were just the same there as here,&#x201C;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;My mother, on reading <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> and the Devil every where busy!</p>
<p>Before these Ladies got out at Drem, I had identified the pale, old, shrivelled widow with a buxom bright-eyed rosy Mrs Frank Sheriff&#x2018;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Helen Walker, m. <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>, Francis Sheriff, Athelstaneford; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250522-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:331</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-05-22">22 May 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> time. The Daughter had not only grown up but got herself born in the interval. What chiefly struck me, however, indeed confounded me, was to be stared at by M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Sheriff as a stranger, or even <hi rend="italic">foreigner !</hi> (for, when I asked her some questions about the road, she answered with that compassionate distinctness which one puts on with only <hi rend="italic">foreigners</hi>&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">idiots.</hi>) I began to think my precautions for keeping <hi rend="italic">Incognita</hi> in my native place might turn out to have been superfluous.</p>
<p>One of these <hi rend="italic">precautions</hi> had the foolishest little consequence. In leaving London, I had written the addresses for my luggage on the backs of other peoples visiting-cards; &#x201C;without respect of persons&#x201C;;&#x2014;a stupid practice when one thinks of it!&#x2014;but at Morpeth I removed three of the cards, leaving one to the carpet-bag; carpet-bags being so confoundable; I was at the pains however to rub off <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> name from <hi rend="italic">that</hi> card, which, for the rest, happened to be M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Humphrey St John Mildmay&#x2019;s. Well! at Longniddry, where I had to wait some fifteen minutes for the cross-train to Haddington, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">there came to pass</hi>&#x201C; a <hi rend="italic">Porter!</hi> who helped me with my things, and would not leave off helping me&#x2014;quite teazed me in fact with <hi rend="italic">delicate attentions.</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> At last he made me a low bow and said he was &#x201C;not aware that any of the family were in this quarter.&#x201C; I believe I answered; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">quite well I <pb id="pg-24-162" n="24:162"/>thank you</hi>&#x201C;; for I was getting every instant more <hi rend="italic">excited</hi> with my circumstances. He shut the carriage-door on me, then opened it again and said with another low bow; &#x201C;Excuse me, Mam but I was in the service of the Brother of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Humphrey St John Mildmay.&#x201C;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marianne Frances, b. Vernon (d. <date when="1873-00-00">1873</date>), 2d wife (m. <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) of Humphrey St. J. Mildmay (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490417-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1849-04-17">17 April</date></ref>); they lived at 45 Berkeley Sq., London. Mildmay had three surviving brothers&#x2014;George William, Edward, and Carew&#x2014;and the porter might have worked for Hugh (d. <date when="1849-01-00">Jan. 1849</date>) or Paulet (d. <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>).</note> I am positive as to my answer this time, that it was; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Oh thank you No! I am quite another person!</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>A few minutes more and I was at the H. Station; where I looked out timidly, then more boldly, as my senses took in the utter <hi rend="italic">strangeness</hi> of the scene; and luckily I had &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the cares of <hi rend="small-caps">luggage</hi></hi>&#x201C; to keep down <hi rend="italic">sentiment</hi> for the moment. No vehicle was in waiting but a dusty little Omnibus licenced to carry&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">any number</hi>, it seemed! for on remarking there was no seat for me I was told by all the <hi rend="italic">Insides</hi> in a breath; &#x201C;never heed! come in! <hi rend="italic">that</hi> makes <hi rend="italic">no</hi> difference!&#x201C;&#x2014; And so I was trundled to <hi rend="italic">The George Inn</hi>, where a Landlord and Waiter, both strangers to me, and looking half-asleep showed me to the best room on the first floor&#x2014;a large old-fashioned, three windowed room, looking out on <hi rend="italic">The Fore Street</hi><note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now the High St., with JWC&#x2019;s house (open to visitors) and the George at opposite ends.</note>&#x2014;and, without having spoken one word, shut the door on me, and there I was at the end of it!&#x2014;actually in the George Inn, Haddington, alone, amidst the silence of death!</p>
<p>I sat down quite composedly at a window, and looked up the Street,&#x2014;towards our old House; it was the same street, the same houses; but so silent,&#x2014;dead,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">petrified!</hi> it looked, the old place, just as I had seen it at Chelsea in my dreams&#x2014;only <hi rend="italic">more</hi> dreamlike!&#x2014; Having exhausted that outlook, I rung my bell, and told the silent Landlord to bring tea, and took order about my bedroom. The tea swallowed down; I notified my wish to view &#x201C;the old church there,&#x201C; and the keeper of the keys was immediately fetched me. In my part of stranger-in-search-of-the-Picturesque, I let myself be shown the way which I knew every inch of,&#x2014;shown the &#x201C;the school houses,&#x201C; where myself had been <hi rend="italic">Dux</hi>,&#x2014;&#x2018;the play-ground, &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Bool</hi>ing reen,&#x201C;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The bowling green, reputedly the oldest in Scotland, used till the present cent., still to be seen S of Nungate Bridge over the river Tyne.</note>&#x2014;and so on to the church-gate, which so soon as my guide had unlocked for me, I told him he might wait&#x2014;that I needed him no further.</p>
<p>The Church-yard had become very full of graves. Within <hi rend="italic">the Ruin</hi> were two new <hi rend="italic">smartly got up</hi> tombs; <hi rend="italic">His</hi><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Her father&#x2019;s&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note> looked old, old; was surrounded by <pb id="pg-24-163" n="24:163"/>nettles; the inscription all over moss; except <hi rend="italic">two lines</hi> which had been quite recently cleared.&#x2014;by <hi rend="italic">whom?</hi> who had been there, before <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, still caring for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> tomb after 29 years? The old <hi rend="italic">Ruin</hi> knew, and could not tell me! that place <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> the very centre of eternal silence&#x2014;silence and sadness world without end! When I returned to the sexton, or whatever he was, he asked would I not walk thro the church; I said yes, and he led the way, but without playing the Cicerone any more; he had become pretty sure there was no need. <hi rend="italic">Our</hi> pew looked to have never been new-lined since <hi rend="italic">we</hi> occupied it; the <hi rend="italic">green</hi> cloth was become all but <hi rend="italic">white</hi> from age! I looked at it in the dim twilight till I almost fancied I saw my beautiful Mother in her old corner, and myself a bright-looking girl in the other! it was time to &#x201C;come out of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x201C;! Meaning to return to the Churchyard next morning, to clear the moss from the inscription; I asked my conductor where he lived&#x2014;with his key. &#x201C;next door to the house that was D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Welsh&#x2019;s; he answered, with a sharp glance at my face; then added <hi rend="italic">gently;</hi> &#x201C;excuse me mem for mentioning <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, but the minute I set eyes on ye at the <hi rend="italic">George</hi>, I <foreign><hi rend="italic">jaloosed</hi></foreign> [suspected] it was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> we all looked after whenever she went up or down.&#x201C; &#x201C;You won&#x2019;t tell of me?&#x201C; I said crying, like a child caught stealing apples; and gave him half a crown to keep my secret, and open the gate for me at eight next morning. Then turning, up the waterside by myself, I made the circuit of <hi rend="italic">The <foreign>Haugh</foreign></hi> [low-lying ground by a river], <hi rend="italic">Dodd&#x2019;s Gardens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Babbies Butts</hi><note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Haughs, Dod&#x2019;s Gardens, and Babbie&#x2019;s Butts (now &#x201C;the Butts&#x201C;)&#x2014;still identifiable&#x2014;lie on JWC&#x2019;s walk from her former home, round by the riverbanks to the rear of St. Mary&#x2019;s, a partly ruined abbey church (<date>12th</date> or <date>13th cent.</date>) known as &#x201C;the Lamp of Lothian.&#x201C; After restoration, <date when="1811-00-00">1811</date>, it had a central tower and five bays of the nave in use as a parish church, but the rest was ruinous, including the E end where JWC and her father are buried, now enclosed.

The sexton is unidentified.</note>&#x2014;the customary evening walk in my teens; and except that it was perfectly <hi rend="italic">solitary</hi> (in the whole round, I met just two little children walking hand in hand, like the <hi rend="italic">Babes of the wood</hi>)<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Traditional tale and ballad; see <hi rend="italic">Percy&#x2019;s Reliques</hi> 3.7.18.</note> the whole thing looked exactly as I left it 22 years back! the very puddles made by the last rain I <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> to have stepped over before.&#x2014; But where were all the living beings one used to meet? What could have come to the place to strike it so dead? I have been since answered; the railway had come to it, and ruined it.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The railway drew local business away from Haddington but was downgraded, <date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>, to single track for lack of traffic.</note> At all rates &#x201C;it must have taken a great deal to make a <hi rend="italic">place</hi> so dull as that!&#x201C; &#x2014; Leaving the lanes I now went boldly thro&#x2019; the streets, the thick black veil, put on for the occasion, thrown back; I was getting confident that I might have ridden like <hi rend="italic">the Lady Godiva</hi><note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Legendary Mercian countess who protested against a local tax by riding naked through Coventry.</note> thro Haddington, with impunity,&#x2014;so <pb id="pg-24-164" n="24:164"/>far as recognition went.&#x2014; I looked thro&#x2019; the <foreign>sparred</foreign> [fastened shut] door of our old coachhouse, which seemed to be vacant; the House itself I left over till morning, when its occupants should be asleep.

He was the very man for me, being ready to talk the tongue small in his head about his town&#x2019;s-folks, men, women, and children of them. He told me amongst other interesting things, that &#x201C;Doctor Welsh&#x2019;s death was the sorest loss ever cam to the Place&#x201C;;&#x2014;that myself &#x201C;went away into England and&#x2014;died there!&#x201C; adding a handsome enough tribute to my memory&#x2014;&#x201C;Yes! Miss Welsh! he remembered her famously,&#x2014;used to think her the <hi rend="italic">tastiest</hi> young Lady in the whole Place&#x2014;but she was very&#x2014;not just to call <hi rend="italic">proud</hi>,&#x2014;very <hi rend="italic">reserved in her company.</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; In leaving this man, I felt more than ever like my own gohst; if I had really been <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> after my death and burial, there could not I think have been any material difference in my sensations.</p>
<p>My next visit was to the front gate of the Sunny Bank,<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sunny Bank, now modern apartments named Tenterfield, is a large house in W Haddington, less than &#xBD; mi. from JWC&#x2019;s home. The Donaldsons sold it, <date when="1860-00-00">1860</date>. JWC&#x2019;s godmother&#x2019;s father Hay Donaldson (<date when="1738-00-00">1738</date>&#x2013;<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), had been town clerk, as had his sons George and Alexander (d. <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>).</note> where I stood some minutes, looking up at the beautifully quiet House; not unlike the &#x2018;outcast <hi rend="italic">Peri&#x2019; done into prose.</hi><note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Thomas Moore, &#x201C;Paradise and the Peri,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Lalla Rookh:</hi> &#x201C;One morn a Peri at the gate / Of Eden stood, disconsolate.&#x201C;</note> How would my old godmother and the others have looked, I wondered, had they known who was there, so near them? I longed to go in and kiss them once more, but positively <hi rend="italic">dared</hi> not; I felt that their demonstrations of affection would break me down into a torrent of tears, which there was no time for; so I contented myself with kissing&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">gate</hi>(!) and returned to my Inn, it being now near Dark.</p>
<p>Surely it was the silentest Inn on the Planet! not a living being male or female to be seen in it except when I rung my bell, and then the Landlord or Waiter (both old men) did my bidding promptly and silently and vanished again into space. On my reentrance I rung for candles, and for a glass of sherry and hot water; my feet had been wetted amongst the long grass of the churchyard, and I felt to be taking cold; so I made myself <foreign>negus</foreign> as an antidote, and they say I am not a <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> woman! Then it struck me; I would write to Mr Carlyle,&#x2014;one more letter from the old place, after so <pb id="pg-24-165" n="24:165"/>much come and gone. Accordingly I wrote till the Town clock (the first familiar voice I had heard) struck eleven, then twelve, and near <hi rend="italic">one</hi> I wrote the Irish address on my Letter and finally put myself to bed&#x2014;in the George Inn of Haddington, good God!&#x2014; I thought it too strange and mournful a position for ever falling asleep in; nevertheless I <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> in the first instance; for I was &#x2018;a-weary a-weary,&#x2019;<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Tennyson, &#x201C;Mariana.&#x201C;</note> body and soul of me! But, alas! the <hi rend="italic">only noise</hi> I was to hear in Haddington &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">transpired</hi>&#x2019; exactly at the wrong moment; before I had slept one hour I was awoke by&#x2014;an explosion of cats! The rest of that night I spent betwixt sleeping and waking, in night-mare efforts to &#x201C;sort up my thoughts.&#x201C; At half after five I put my clothes on, and began the business of the day by destroying, in a moment of enthusiasm&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>&#x2014;the long letter &#x201C;all about feelings&#x201C; which I had written the night before. Soon after six I was <hi rend="italic">haunting</hi> our old house, while the present occupants still slept.&#x2014; I found the garden door <hi rend="italic">locked</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">iron staunchions</hi>,&#x2014;my Heavens!&#x2014; on the porch and cellar windows, &#x201C;significative of much!&#x201C;<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. No stanchions remain on Dr. Welsh&#x2019;s old house, but there are stanchions on the house of his former partner, Dr. Thomas Howden, immediately in front.</note> for the rest, there was a general need of paint and white wash: in fact the whole premises had a bedimmed melancholy look as of &#x2018;having&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">seen better days.</hi>&#x2019; It was difficult for me to realise to myself that the people inside were only <hi rend="italic">asleep</hi>&#x2014;and not <hi rend="italic">dead&#x2014;dead since many years.</hi> Ah! one breathed freer in the church-yard, with the bright morning sunshine streaming down on it than near that (so-called) habitation of the Living! I went straight from the one to the other. The gate was still locked; for I was an hour before my time; so I made a dash at the wall, some seven feet high I shoud think, and dropt safe on the inside&#x2014;a feat I should never have imagined to <hi rend="italic">try</hi> in my actual phase, not even with a mad bull at my heels, if I had not trained myself to it at a more elastic age. Godefroi Cavaignac&#x2019;s &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">quoi donc je ne suis pas mort?</hi></foreign> crossed my mind but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had none of that feeling&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">moi</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;was <foreign><hi rend="italic">morte</hi></foreign> enough, I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi>, whatever face I might put on it. only, what one has well learnt one never forgets.</p>
<p>When I had scraped the moss out of the inscription, as well as I could with the only thing in my dressing case at all suited to the purpose, namely <hi rend="italic">his own</hi> button hook with the mother-of-pearl handle, I made a deliberate survey of the whole church-yard, and most of the names I had missed out of the <hi rend="italic">signboards</hi> turned up for me once more on the <hi rend="italic">tomb-stones.</hi> It was strange the feeling of almost <hi rend="italic">glad</hi> recognition that came over me, in finding so many familiar figures out of my childhood and youth all gathered together in one place. But still more interesting for me than these later graves were <hi rend="italic">two</hi> that I remembered to have weeped little innocent tears <pb id="pg-24-166" n="24:166"/>over before I had a conception what real weeping meant,&#x2014;the grave of the little girl who was burnt to death, thro&#x2019; drying her white muslim frock at the fire, and that of the young officer (Rutherford)<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rutherford&#x2019;s grave is close to the W door of St. Mary&#x2019;s, a flat stone now illegible. A monument records that he was Capt. Hugh Blair Rutherford (<date when="1776-00-00">1776</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>), 25th regt. Anne Cameron&#x2019;s grave is not found.</note> who was shot in a duel. The oval tablet of white marble over the little girl&#x2019;s grave looked as bright and spotless as on the first day&#x2014;as emblematic of the child existence it commemorated; it seemed to my somewhat excited imagination that the youthfulness and innocence there buried had impregnated the marble to keep it snow-white for ever!&#x2014; When the sexton came at eight to let me in, he found me ready to be <hi rend="italic">let out.</hi> &#x201C;How in the world had I got in?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;over the wall.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;No! surely I couldn&#x2019;t mean <hi rend="italic">that</hi>?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Why not?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Lordsake then, cried the man in real admiration, there is <hi rend="italic">no <hi rend="small-caps">end</hi></hi> to you!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>He told me at parting, &#x201C;there is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> man in this Town, Mem, you might like to see&#x2014;James Robertson.&#x201C;<note n="25" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See below and <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490728-JWC-JN-01">JWC to JN, [<date when="1849-07-28">28 July</date>]</ref>.</note> Your Father&#x2019;s old servant.&#x201C; Our own old Jamie! he was waiter at <hi rend="italic">The Star</hi> good gracious! had returned to Haddington within the last year. &#x201C;Yes indeed&#x201C;&#x2014;I said, &#x201C;he must be sent to me at the George an hour hence, and told only that <hi rend="italic">a Lady</hi> wanted him.&#x201C;</p>
<p>It was still but eight o&#x2019;clock, so I should have time to look at Sunny Bank from the <hi rend="italic">back</hi> gate, and streamed off in that direction; but passing my dear old schoolhouse, I observed the door a little a-jar, walked in and sat down in my old seat; to the manifest astonishment of a decent woman who was sweeping the floor. <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Ach gott!</foreign> our</hi> maps and Geometrical Figures had given place to <hi rend="italic">Texts from Scripture</hi> and the foolishest <hi rend="italic">half-penny pictures!</hi> it was become an <hi rend="italic">Infant School</hi> Good God! and a <hi rend="italic">Miss</hi> Alexander was now Teacher where Edward Irving and James Brown had taught!<note n="26" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC had been taught first by Edward Irving, <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">12</date>, and thereafter by James Brown (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), at the mathematical school; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18121119-JBW-MWE-01"><sic>1:3</sic><corr>JBW to MWE, <date when="1812-11-19">19 Nov. 1812</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Miss A and her Infants were not, it seemed early risers; their schoolroom after eight oclock was only <hi rend="italic">being swept;</hi> it was at <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> of the morning that James Brown once found <hi rend="italic">me</hi> asleep there&#x2014;after two hours hard study&#x2014;asleep betwixt the leaves of <hi rend="italic">the Great Atlas</hi>, like a <hi rend="italic">keep-lesson</hi> [pupil&#x2019;s book mark]! but &#x201C;things have been all gone to the Devil ever since the reform-bill&#x201C;; as my Uncle is always telling us.

<p>Not the vestige of a Boy or even of a <hi rend="italic">girl</hi> was to be seen about <hi rend="italic">the Grammar</hi> School either; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> school, I afterwards heard from Jamie &#x201C;had <pb id="pg-24-167" n="24:167"/>gone to just perfect nonsense&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;There was a <hi rend="italic">Master</hi> (one White) but no <hi rend="italic">scholars.</hi><note n="27" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham was a successful rector of the Burgh School (also known as the grammar school), <date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>; his successor, William White, was apptd., <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.

But I am not gone to Jamie yet; another meeting came off before that one.</p>
<p>Sunny Bank looked even lovelier &#x201C;in the light of a new morning&#x201C; than it had done in the evening dusk. A hedge of red roses in full blow extended now from the House to the gate; and I thought I might go in and gather one without evoking any&#x2014;Beast. Once inside the gate I passed easily to the idea of proceeding as far as the back door, just to ask the servant how they all were, and leave compliments without naming myself; the servants only would be a-stir so early. Well! when I had knocked at the door with my finger &#x201C;sharp but mannerly&#x201C;; it was opened by a tidy maidservant exhibiting no more surprise than if I had been the Baker&#x2019;s boy!&#x2014; Strange, was it not, that <hi rend="italic">anybody</hi> should be in a calm state of mind, while <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was so full of emotions? Strange that the Universe should pursue its own course without reference to my presence in Haddington!!&#x2014; &#x201C;Are your Ladies quite well&#x201C;: I asked nevertheless. &#x201C;Miss Jess and Miss Catherine are quite well; Miss Donaldson rather <hi rend="italic">complaining;</hi> you are aware Mem that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Donaldson is dead?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh dear yes!&#x201C; I said, thinking she meant Alexander. &#x201C;At what hour do you Ladies get up?&#x201C; &#x201C;They <hi rend="italic">are</hi> up Mem and done breakfast, will you walk round to the front-door?&#x201C;&#x2014; Goodness gracious! <hi rend="italic">should</hi> I &#x2018;walk round,&#x2019; or not?&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">own</hi> nerves had got braced somewhat by the morning air; but <hi rend="italic">their</hi> nerves&#x2014;how would the sight of me thus &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">promiscuously</hi>&#x201C; operate on <hi rend="italic">them?</hi> &#x201C;You had better go round and let me tell the Ladies,&#x201C; put in the servant, as if in reply to my cogitations; &#x201C;what name shall I say?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;None, I think, perhaps my name would startle them more than myself; tell them; <hi rend="italic">someone they will be glad to see.</hi>&#x201C; And so, flinging the responsibility on <hi rend="italic">Providence</hi>, who is made for being fallen back upon in such dilemmas, (&#x201C;Providence must have meant me to see them in raising them out of bed so betimes!&#x201C;), I did &#x2018;go round,&#x2019; with my heart thumping, &#x201C;like,&#x2014;like,&#x2014;like&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">anything.</hi>&#x201C;<note n="28" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note></p>
<p>The maidservant met me at the front-door and conducted me to the Drawingroom, where was&#x2014;nobody; but on a table lay a pile of <hi rend="italic">black</hi>-bordered note-paper which explained to me, that it was Mr Donaldson of <pb id="pg-24-168" n="24:168"/>London who was <hi rend="italic">dead;</hi> the last Brother&#x2014;dead in these very days! I wished I had not come in; but it was out of time now.&#x2014; The door opened and showed me Miss Catherine changed into an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> woman, and showed Miss Catherine <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, changed into one of&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> age! She remained at the door, motionless, speechless, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn&#x2019;t rise off my chair, at least I didn&#x2019;t; but when I saw her eyes staring &#x201C;like watch-faces,&#x201C; I said, &#x201C;Oh Miss Catherine don&#x2019;t be frightened at me!&#x201C;&#x2014;and then she quite <hi rend="italic">shrieked</hi> &#x2018;Jeanie! Jeanie! Jeanie Welsh! <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jeanie! <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Jeanie!&#x2019;&#x2014; Oh mercy I shan&#x2019;t forget that scene in a hurry! I got her in my arms and kissed her into her wits again; and then we both cried a little&#x2014;naturally&#x2014;; both of us had had enough since we last met to cry for. I explained to her &#x201C;how I was <hi rend="italic">situated</hi>,&#x201C; as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. would say, and that I was meaning to visit them after&#x2014;like a Christian; and she found it all &#x201C;most wisely done&#x2014;done like my own self.&#x201C;&#x2014;Humph!&#x2014; Poor Miss Catherine! its little she knows of my own self&#x2019;s and perhaps the less the better! She told me about their Brother&#x2019;s death, which had been sudden at the last.<note n="29" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Stuart Donaldson d. <date when="1849-07-09">9 July</date>, age 72, at Craven Hill, Hyde Pk.</note> Supposing me still in London as usual, and that in London we hear of one anothers deaths; they had been saying it was strange I did not write to them and my Godmother had remarked; &#x201C;it is not like her!&#x201C;&#x2014;just while I was standing at their gate most likely; for it was &#x2018;the evening before, about dark,&#x2019; they had been speaking of me.</p>
<p>But again the door opened and showed Miss Jess&#x2014;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>Ach!</foreign>&#x2014; She</hi> had to be <hi rend="italic">told</hi> who I was, and pretty <hi rend="italic">loudly</hi> too; but when she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> take in the immense fact, oh <hi rend="italic">my!</hi>&#x2014;if she didn&#x2019;t &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">show feeling enough</hi>&#x201C; (her own favourite expression of old!)&#x2014; Poor Jess after all! We used to think she <hi rend="italic">showed</hi> even more <hi rend="italic">feeling</hi> than she <hi rend="italic">felt</hi>, and nothing came out on the present emergence to alter our opinion of her. But enough&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">the very old</hi>, it seems to me, should be admitted, by favour, to the privelege of <hi rend="italic">the Dead</hi>,&#x2014;have &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">no ill</hi>&#x201C; spoken of them, that can possibly be helped.</p>
<p>My &#x2018;Godmother&#x2019; was keeping her bed &#x201C;with rheumatism&#x201C; and grief; as I &#x201C;would <hi rend="italic">really</hi> come back soon&#x201C; it was settled to leave her quiet. They offered me breakfast,&#x2014;it was still on the table: but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">horrible was the thought</hi>&#x201C; to me! It was all so solemn and doleful there that I should have heard every morsel going down my throat! besides I was engaged to breakfast with <hi rend="italic">myself</hi> at <hi rend="italic">the George.</hi> So, with blessings for many days, I slipt away from them like a knotless thread.</p>
<p>My friend the Cooper, espying me from his doorway, on the road back, planted himself <hi rend="italic">firmly</hi> in my path: &#x201C;if I would just comple<hi rend="italic">mennt</hi> him with my name, he would be <hi rend="italic">terribly</hi> obliged; we had been <hi rend="italic">uncommon comfortable</hi> together, and he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> know what they called me!&#x201C;&#x2014; I told him, and he neither died on the spot nor went mad; he looked pleased and asked how <pb id="pg-24-169" n="24:169"/>many children I had had. <hi rend="italic">None</hi>, I told him. &#x2018;None!&#x2019; (in a tone of astonishment, verging on horror) &#x201C;None at all! then what on the Earth had I been <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> all this time?&#x201C; &#x2018;Amusing myself,&#x2019; I told him. He ran after me, to beg I would give him a call on my return (I had spoken of returning) &#x201C;as he might be making something, belike, to <hi rend="italic">send south</hi> with me, something <hi rend="italic">small</hi> and <hi rend="italic">of a fancy sort, liker myself</hi> than <hi rend="italic">them</hi> I had bought.&#x201C;</p>
<p>Breakfast stood ready for me at the Inn and was discussed in five minutes. Then I wrote a note to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C, a compromise betwixt &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">all about feelings</hi>&#x201C; and &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">the new silent system</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;of the <hi rend="italic">Prisons.</hi><note n="30" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The silent system was a current practice in prison discipline; seen by TC at Coldbath Fields (where introd. <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>) and described in &#x201C;Model Prisons,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 20:52&#x2013;56.</note> Then I went to my bed room to pack up.

Douglas Charteris.</note> in three <hi rend="italic">years</hi>, never to say &#x201C;three weeks.&#x201C; But &#x201C;a waggon came in atween ten and eleven and he must be stepping west.&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;he was glad to have seen me looking so (dropping his voice)&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">stootish!</hi></foreign>&#x201C; (I saw him, from the Omnibus, after, unloading the waggon, in his workday clothes, almost on the very spot where, for a dozen years, he had helped me in and out of our carriage!)</p>
<p>And now there only remained to pay my bill and await the Omnibus I <pb id="pg-24-170" n="24:170"/>have that bill of 6/6 in my writing case; and shall keep it all my days; not only as an eloquent memorial of human change&#x2014;like grass from graves and all that sort of thing; but as the first Inn bill I ever in my life contracted and paid <hi rend="italic">on my own basis.</hi></p>
<p>Another long look from the George Inn window,&#x2014;and then into the shabby little Omnibus again; where the faces of a Lady next me and a gentleman opposite me tormented my memory without result.</p>
<p>In the railway carriage which I selected, an old gentleman had taken his seat, and I recognised him at once as M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lea&#x2014;the same who made the little obelisk which hangs in my bedroom at Chelsea.<note n="33" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Thomas Lea, former provost. <hi rend="italic">Carlyle&#x2019;s House</hi> 59 notes that no record exists of what pictures JWC had hanging in her bedroom. The obelisk is untraced.</note> He had grown old like a golden pippin, merely <foreign><hi rend="italic">crined</hi></foreign> [shrunk], with the bloom upon him. I laid my hand on his arm, turning away my face, and said, &#x201C;Thank God here is one person I feel no difficulty about.&#x201C; &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know you,&#x201C; he said in his old blunt way, &#x201C;who are you?&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Guess!&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Was it you who got over the church-yard wall this morning? I saw a stranger-lady climb the wall and I said to myself that&#x2019;s Jeanie Welsh!&#x2014;no other woman would climb the wall instead of going in at the gate&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">are</hi> you Jeanie Welsh?</p>
<p>I &#x2018;owned the soft impeachment&#x2019;;<note n="34" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sheridan, <hi rend="italic">The Rivals</hi> 5.3.</note> then such shaking of hands! embracing even! But so soon as things had calmed down a little between us; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lea laid his hand on my shoulder and said as if <hi rend="italic">pursuing knowledge under difficulties</hi>, &#x201C;now tell me, my Dear, why <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you get over the wall instead of just asking for the key?&#x201C;</p>
<p>He spoke of William Ainsleys<note n="35" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220220-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:45&#x2013;48</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-02-20">20 Feb. 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> death; I said I had never known him, that he went to India before I could remember. &#x201C;Nonsense,&#x201C; said Mr Lea; &#x201C;not remember William Ainsley? Never knew William Ainsley? What are you thinking of? Why; didnt he wrap you in a shawl and run away with you to our house <hi rend="italic">the very day you were born</hi>, I believe?&#x2014; I said it might be very true but that the circumstance had escaped my recollection. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lea was left at Longniddry where he came daily, he said, to bathe in the sea. What energy!</p>
<p>While waiting there for the train from London, I saw again my Lady and Gentleman of the Omnibus<note n="36" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> and got their names from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Lea; they were not people I had ever visited with, but I had been at school with them both; We passed and repassed one another without the slightest sign of recognition on their side.</p>

To be sure I had seen <hi rend="italic">him once</hi> since we were at school together, had met him at Craik&#x2019;s some twelve years ago.&#x2014; Such as he was; we stood together till the train came up, and &#x201C;talked of geography, politics, and <hi rend="italic">natur.</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p>At Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Jeanie&#x2019;s<note n="38" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Cousin from Liverpool (now Mrs Chrystal&#x201C;) (TC&#x2019;s note on MS).</note> sweet little face looked wildly into the carriage for me, and next minute we were <hi rend="italic">chirping</hi> and <hi rend="italic">twittering</hi> together on the platform whilst the eternal two boxes writing case and carpet-bag were being once more brought into one focus.&#x2014; &#x201C;Look look Cousin&#x201C; said Jeanie <hi rend="italic">there</hi> are people who know you!&#x201C; and looking as I was bid; who but the pair who had accompanied me from Haddington were standing, with their heads laid together, and the eyes starting out of them <hi rend="italic">me</hi>-ward! The Lady the instant she saw I noticed them sprang forward extending her hand; the Husband &#x201C;emboldened by her excellent example&#x201C; did the same; they were &#x201C;surprised,&#x201C; &#x201C;delighted,&#x201C; everything that could be wished; &#x201C;had not had a conception of its being me till they saw me <hi rend="italic">smiling</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Eh Sirs!&#x201C; said my Mother&#x2019;s old nurse to her after a separation of twenty years there&#x2019;s no a <hi rend="italic">featur</hi> o&#x2019; ye left, but just <hi rend="italic">the bit smile!</hi>&#x201C;</p>

<salute>Dear Lord Clarendon,</salute>
<p>As I do not return by Dublin, but quit Ireland at this point for Scotland, will you accept from me a word of <foreign>adieu</foreign> in writing, which I had hoped to have offered by word of mouth, had the course of travel allowed.</p>
<p>I have roamed extensively over this unfortunate Ireland; round all the coast, by Waterford, Cork, Killarney, Galway, Sligo, with excursions into the interior in various quarters; I have seen many kinds of men, and in some places the <hi rend="italic">strangest</hi> figure of Human Society that memory ever had to record, or even imagination to conceive; and certainly one ought, in looking at all, to have laid up &#x201C;materials for reflexion&#x201C; for some time to come! My surprise, however, if I have been at all surprised or disappointed, has rather been of the joyful kind; that of finding <hi rend="italic">more</hi> good men, of all descriptions, busy in their places, and more germs of hope and benefit, discoverable in this waste scene of Human Distractions and Delusions, than I had dared to anticipate. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> the Potatoe will but honestly die, and keep dead, the people will have to <hi rend="italic">admit</hi> that it is dead; and close on the rear of that discovery, the possibility of a new Ireland (which ought to mean a new England and a new Scotland, both somewhat desirable withal, in various respects!) will dawn upon the astonished imaginations of Irishmen. The universe is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> built upon potatoes; it was not a good universe while it rested on that sad basis! But &#x201C;the insolvent Unions&#x201C; of the West are certainly at this moment the miracle of the world; the Connaught of these years is paying the full score for the sins of many past generations;&#x2014;and, I calculate, will teach all men that &#x201C;indolent <foreign><hi rend="italic">Laissez-faire</hi></foreign> plus a <hi rend="italic">Poor-Law</hi>&#x201C; is not, by any manner of means, the solution of Human Society; that actual <hi rend="italic">command</hi> of the Foolish Multitude by the Wise Few is once more (in spite of all our modern philanthropies) becoming clearly, what it always from the beginning of the world till late times was, the indispensable necessity, if human beings would live together in any but the savage state. Alas, alas, what a sea of nonsense we have got to get across before there can be any steady progress towards that result! The thought of this has kept me <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> these several years; and is indeed enough to sadden any considerate person&#x2019;s heart.</p>
<p>Wheresoever I went, one thing struck and gratified me: the position of the Lord Lieutenant, and the estimate formed of his conduct, in the minds of all manner of men. The &#x201C;native Irish,&#x201C; Priests, repealers (Ex-repealers) &#x26;c &#x26;c all bitterly dislike the English; but on all of them it has got, or is <pb id="pg-24-174" n="24:174"/>getting, clearly impressed, that Ireland has no better friend than its present Viceroy. Even Duffy of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> volunteered to admit that Lord Clarendon&#x2019;s demeanour, throughout that infatuated (and to Duffy not tragicomical but tragic) business of Repeal and its Results, had been that of a man of dignity and honour,&#x2014;unexceptionable in all particulars, except that of some Dublin Newspaper (whose name I forget) set to abuse and calumniate him (Duffy) with <hi rend="italic">which</hi> operation, I ventured to assure him, Lord Clarendon had no very intimate concern!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Clarendon was not above doing this. He had written to Sir George Grey, <date when="1848-03-28">28 March 1848</date>: &#x201C;I have entered into an agreement with the Editor of the World, who is a clever, experienced unscrupulous man &#x26; has engaged to fight the Nation &#x26; United Irishman&#x2014; I think he will be able to administer some antidote.&#x201C; He was to be paid from the secret service fund (MS: Clarendon Papers, Bodleian Lib.).</note> These were Duffy&#x2019;s own voluntary sentiments, perhaps worth recording here, and submitting to a very unexpected audience.</p>
<p>At several points in my journey I fell in with Duffy, and went a day or two along with him. The depths of Native Irishism (which has not grown much lovelier for being looked at) were thereby laid bare to me: many Priests, only one or at most two of whom did I much have to esteem; Repealers (all hopeless Ex-repealers now), among whom the Mayor of Kilkenny<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Cane.</note> seemed to me a man of real honesty, of intelligence (strangely cultivated), and elevation of mind, a man really worthy of esteem. Duffy himself is now in Dublin; intent, as you already know, on recommencing his Newspaper; but I greatly mistake if his views are not wholly altered, or altering, in regard to all manner of Anglo-Irish questions; if you do not see a &#x201C;Nation&#x201C; very different indeed from what the late one was. Duffy&#x2019;s popularity among all classes of the <hi rend="italic">Irish</hi> population (innkeepers, populace, priests &#x26;c) surpasses all my conceptions; my notions of his personal character and qualities you already know, and have forgiven; but I have now good hopes of the man,&#x2014;hopes that even you may admit the intrinsic worth of this poor misguided soul and see him effect real benefit to his bewildered countrymen. He has in him many <hi rend="italic">truths</hi>, which it is highly important they were taught, and which there is surely no man living that has now such an opportunity to teach them. If the &#x201C;Martyr of Repeal&#x201C; (say, surviving Martyr of Ex-repeal) turn out as I expect, the day may come when honourable Persons in Authority may find some worth in him too.&#x2014; In all things, Let us <hi rend="italic">hope!</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>Forgive me, dear Lord Clarendon, for this long incoherent story, little to the purpose after all, and little expressing the things I wished to say. The hurry of a traveller, whose poor brain is set whirling, like all his bodily adjuncts and his bodily self, in the incessant locomotion must plead my <pb id="pg-24-175" n="24:175"/>excuse.&#x2014; Lord George Hill was the last person I saw; after his Gweedore the last object is to be the School at Temple Moyle in this neighbourhood.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Captain <hi rend="italic">Something</hi> [George Archibald Leach, Royal Engineers Corps], a chief of Engineers (surveyors, map-makers in these parts) comes to take us out to &#x2018;Temple Moyle&#x2019; an agricultural school, and to show us about. A clean, intelligent <hi rend="italic">thin</hi> little soul; of Twistleton&#x2019;s introducing? &#x2026; Good enough country, <hi rend="italic">part</hi> well cultivated, part ill;&#x2014;to London agent of Fishmongers&#x2019; (?Mercers?) Company a brisk impetuous managing little fellow,&#x2014;who escorts us to Temple Moyle;&#x2014;&#x2018;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Campbell&#x2019; the Scotch manager, is overtaken by us on the road. Temple Moyle very good indeed, so far as <hi rend="italic">cultivation of the ground goes;</hi> questionable perhaps, on its <hi rend="italic">human</hi> side? A dozen of the boys, Catholics, and very ugly were at dinner. The &#x2018;teaching,&#x2019; our brisk Londoner indicated was rather in a staggering way. &#x2018;Acre of turnips <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than one of potatoes,&#x2019; testifies Campbell &#x2018;and <hi rend="italic">easier</hi> to cultivate if you do both <hi rend="italic">well</hi>&#x2019;&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 256&#x2013;57).</note> After which, to Glasgow on the morrow, and then home to native Annandale for a while. I saw one Mr Boyne (an agent of the Board of Works) at King William&#x2019;s Town;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC met Boyne, <date when="1849-07-20">20 July</date>: &#x201C;a Meath man, Land-surveyor&#x2019;s son, who had already &#x2018;cut the Galtee mountains in four&#x2019; by roads thro&#x2019; them and was known &#x2026; for an excellent &#x2018;colonel of spademen&#x2019;. &#x2026; Boyne has now been 17 years there: a most solid, eupeptic, energetic, useful-looking man; whose <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> stands indelible on this bog. &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t stand without sinking here, when I first came&#x2019;&#x2014;excellent rye and oats growing now, hedges of thorn, bright copious green of grass, 100 head of &#x2018;specimen cattle&#x2019; (among others), clean cottage-farms; a country beautiful to eye and mind&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 148).</note> and greatly admired him and the works he is doing there. A most effectual <hi rend="italic">Triptolemus;</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Remarkable Triptolemus, this Boyne&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 152).

I deign to ask Captain Larcom shortly for some further details about Boyne.</p>
<p><closer><salute>And so farewell, dear Lord Clarendon: be pleased to accept my cordial thanks, and all the honourable wishes I can form while quitting your shores.</salute></closer></p>

Four hours will take me down to Scotsbrig; some <pb id="pg-24-176" n="24:176"/><hi rend="italic">few</hi> hours (way and manner yet unknown) <hi rend="italic">would</hi> take me (or <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, for F.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. E. Forster.</note> sticks by me) to Auchtertool: how to do I know not yet: but in <hi rend="italic">some</hi> place of rest, there to sleep for 10 days to come, I do soon hope to be! Thank Heaven. Your Letter waited me here, last night, along with a poor line from John; your <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Galway Letter, the one from Haddington, is yet flying abroad; I have written for it, to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> Sligo and Galway; at Scotsbrig it will certainly arrive, and I shall find it too; the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> Letter I have now to desiderate, one I should little like to lose. Your news yet are not later than what I had thro&#x2019; Forster at Gweedore; let me hope they are good to you, and leave you to <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi>, and that a speedy meeting may be appointed us <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi>, to compare Notes after such an absence. Ah, me! I am weary, weary; and my heart, amid all this noise, remains very <hi rend="italic">still</hi>, and in its sadness says nothing at all while so much speech is going on.&#x2014; I wish you had spoken of the feasibilities of Auchtertool, the routes &#x26;c; above all, of the <hi rend="italic">spare rooms</hi> (if any), and of your own wishes! As it is, I must try to do the wisest by guess. F. is a much merrier companion than Duffy, whom we quitted handsomely on Wed<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last, and who is now safe in Dublin. Good go with him, poor fellow; for he is a good man too, and to me has been always loyal.</p>
<p>Lord George&#x2019;s visit was what we call successful; for my sake and for F.&#x2019;s he was very kind to F. too; brought him along with us to Ballyare, did <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things to oblige him and me to the very last moment of our stay on his shores. We parted with him yesterday on the farther coast of Lough Swilly, whither he had himself driven us and our luggage, with Plattnauer <hi rend="italic">smoking</hi> in silence in the body of the carriage, I d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> on the box beside his Lordship,&#x2014;onward thro&#x2019; difficulties, mistakes and confusions, dextrously to the very deck of the Ferry-boat;&#x2014;and there, at last, we took a really affecting kind of leave. I think he rather grew to like me; him I partly fell in love with at sight, and grew to like better and better. A prettier human soul I have not seen these many years. Courteous as an ancient chevalier, mild, low-voiced (beautiful kindly mellow voice), valiant, consciencious, determinate: where can one see a beautifuller man?<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In all Ireland, lately in any other land, I saw no such beautiful soul&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 253). W. E. Forster doubted &#x201C;whether a man could be found more possessed with a sense of duty and active benevolence than Lord George, and yet with a stern resolve and patient determination, which no difficulty can daunt or tire. The tone and the manner of fatherly love with which he spoke in sympathy and encouragement to every one he met, knowing the names and circumstances of every cottier, were most beautiful to witness. &#x2026; Everything in his house is very complete, and there is the elegance of high breeding beaming over a most well-ordered household; but the utmost simplicity, not to say economy, which I fear his benevolence compels him to exercise. Breakfast at eight, dinner at one, and the like. His effectiveness, his happy blending of love and justice, and his utter absence of all cant, make him a man after Carlyle&#x2019;s heart, and he is in raptures with him. I am glad he should meet so good a specimen of the high evangelical school&#x201C; (Reid, <hi rend="italic">Life of William Edward Forster</hi> 1:250&#x2013;51).</note> His Enterprise at Gweedore <pb id="pg-24-177" n="24:177"/>appears to me as good as hopeless, under present conditions; but to himself in all ways it has been and will be blessed, if not economically profitable. The <hi rend="italic">dumb</hi> pathos of poor Plattnauer was also really touching: in fact the whole business of Ballyare has been really <hi rend="italic">affecting</hi> beyond what I expected; and I am glad to leave Ireland with <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a taste upon my lips, <foreign><hi rend="italic">con la bocca dolce</hi></foreign> [with a sweet taste in the mouth], as I said to his L<hi rend="italic">p</hi> today; for you must know my invaluable <hi rend="italic">writing-case</hi> proved at the Ferry to have been <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi>, it was <hi rend="italic">sent</hi> this morning over the Frith (&#x201C;Lough&#x201C; so-called) before breakfast, and I had to acknowledge such a last favour. Plat<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is grown very <hi rend="italic">fat;</hi> wears <supplied>[rough?]</supplied> beard; and goes in grey Irish Hodden (coarse as Carrier&#x2019;s pack sheet) with a Pipe stuck in his Coat-pocket. <supplied>[For]</supplied> the rest, seems very familiar with the people, and quite domesticated in his situation. Poor fellow, after all!</p>
<p>11&#xBC; p.m.&#x2014; One &#x201C;Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Leach of the Royal Engineers&#x201C; entered; to whom I had brought a Letter, from I really know not whom. He, intent to do the rites, took us out, driving in a Car, to see the beauties, to see especially Temple Moyle, an Agricultural school some 6 miles off,&#x2014;very little worth seeing: but the man&#x2019;s own knowledge of this country, and of various military matters was considerable; and so the afternoon was spent till 7 p.m. and dinner, to which on slight invitation the Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> consented to attend us,&#x2014;and is just gone; sorrow on him, for I had various things to do! Tomorrow is breakfast with a radical Editor,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> M<hi rend="italic">c</hi>Knight (editor, pamphleteer &#x26;c)&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi> 255). James MacKnight (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1876-00-00">76</date>), journalist; ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Derry Standard</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Banner of Ulster</hi>, the official organ of the gen. assembly of the Presbyterian church; joined the Tenant League, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>, and fought for tenants&#x2019; rights; highly regarded by Duffy.</note> and I shall not <hi rend="italic">then</hi> have a moment. I had written a long Letter to L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Clarendon, about Duffy, Ireland &#x26;c, <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the Cap<hi rend="italic">n</hi> came in,&#x2014;happily. I shall have to end everything <foreign><hi rend="italic">taliter qualiter</hi></foreign> [one way or another] before I go to bed. I have dined <hi rend="italic">without</hi> vegetables and perhaps shall escape my full headachy condition (due to the new potatoes, the peas &#x26;c as I now discover), and sleep a little in preparation for tomorrow night&#x2019;s deficiency. O Goody, Goody! Oh me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to my destination <hi rend="italic">after</hi> Glasgow, all I can say is: If this Letter come fairly <hi rend="italic">after</hi> me, what is the use of writing it! If I be not there <hi rend="italic">when</hi> it comes then really there is little chance of me; for I find now, <hi rend="italic">it</hi> goes round by Belfast, and I myself go a directer road. Did you ever hear of such a <foreign>burble</foreign> [tangle]! I wish you had written a word. In fine, I will consider <hi rend="italic">well</hi> of it on board tomorrow; and not give up Auchtertoul without a struggle.&#x2014; <closer><salute>And so good night my Dearest. Forster is reading newspapers at this table, uncertain too what <hi rend="italic">he</hi> will do tomorrow. Good be with thee ever.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks for your letter, dear John&#x2014;</salute>come an hour ago&#x2014;with one from Plattnauer&#x2014;giving the news of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C which he has not time it seems to write himself&#x2014; I send <hi rend="italic">it</hi> at once, as your Mother will find any news better than none&#x2014;</p>
<p>Certainly the letter-department here is arranged on an entirely wrong basis&#x2014;the delay is monstrous&#x2014; I cannot write at any length today, for fear of stirring up my head into a <foreign><hi rend="italic">prononciamento</hi></foreign>&#x2014; The late hours here dont suit me&#x2014;in fact there is a <hi rend="italic">good deal</hi> in life here that don&#x2019;t suit me&#x2014;and which is the more trying, because it is <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> and because &#x201C;one feels it ones duty&#x201C; to be in revolt against it&#x2014;breakfast at ten&#x2014;dinner nearer seven than six&#x2014;&#x201C;dandering Individuals&#x201C; constantly dropping in&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">dressings</hi> and undressings world without end!&#x2014;all <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is so wholly out of place in a Scotch manse!&#x2014; and then the chitter-chatter! If my uncle could only speak <hi rend="italic">intelligently</hi> I should get good talk out of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>&#x2014;but since he lost his teeth his articulation is so imperfect that it needs one to be used to it to catch one word out of ten&#x2014;</p>
<p>By the way I must not forget to tell you his criticism on your <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>&#x2014; We had been talking about you the other night&#x2014;and then we had sunk silent, and I had betaken myself to walking to and fro in the room&#x2014; Suddenly my Uncle turned his head to me, and said shaking it gravely; &#x201C;he has made an awsome <foreign>plooster</foreign> [mess] of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> place!&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Who?&#x2014;what place Uncle?&#x201C;&#x2014;&#x201C;Whew!&#x2014;the place ye&#x2019;ll maybe gang to if ye dinna tak care&#x201C;!&#x2014; I really believe he considers <hi rend="italic">all</hi> those <hi rend="italic">circles</hi> of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> invention!</p>
<p>You are going to let Rosette slip thro your fingers&#x2014;her Brother is going to take her home to Germany in two months!&#x2014; Or will you go and propose to her <hi rend="italic">there</hi> and take me with you?</p>
<p>Walter performed the marriage service over a couple of <hi rend="italic">colliers</hi> the day after I came&#x2014; I happened to be in his study when they came in, and asked leave to remain&#x2014; The man was a good looking man enough&#x2014;dreadfully agitated&#x2014;partly with the business he was come on, partly with <hi rend="italic">drink</hi>&#x2014;he had evidently taken a glass too much to keep his heart up&#x2014;the girl had one <hi rend="italic">very</hi> large inflamed eye and one little one&#x2014;which looked perfectly composed while the large eye <hi rend="italic">stared</hi> wildly and had a tear in it&#x2014; Walter married them <hi rend="italic">very well indeed</hi>, and his affecting words, together with Bridegroom&#x2019;s pale excited face, and the Brides <hi rend="italic">ugliness</hi>, and the &#x201C;poverty, <pb id="pg-24-179" n="24:179"/>penury, needcessity,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> and want imprinted on the whole business&#x2014;and above all, fellow-feeling with the poor wretches there rushing on their fate&#x2014;all that so overcame me that I fell a-crying as desperately as if I had been getting married to the Collier myself&#x2014;and when the ceremony was over, extended my hand to the unfortunates and actually (in such an enthusiasm of pity did I find myself!) presented the new Husband with a snuff-box (!) which I happened to have in my hand, being just about presenting it to Walter when the creatures came in&#x2014; This unexpected <foreign><hi rend="italic">himmel-sendung</hi></foreign> [gift from heaven] finished turning the mans head; he wrung my hand over and over, leaving his <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> for some hours after&#x2014; And ended his grateful speeches with&#x2014;&#x201C;Oh <hi rend="italic">Miss!</hi>&#x2014;Oh <hi rend="italic">Leddy!</hi>&#x2014;may ye hae mair comfort and pleasure in your life than ever you have had <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>&#x201C;! Which might easily be!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Walter infected by my generosity presented the Bride with a new Bible&#x2014; The coal pit would ring next day with the &#x201C;gootlook&#x201C; which had &#x201C;followed them in the Orient&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A foolish, fluffy Dane, one Brandes [see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18451227-TC-CKJB-01"><sic>20:80</sic><corr>TC to CKJB, <date when="1845-12-27">27 Dec. 1845</date></corr></ref>],&#x2014;from whom I had some lessons,&#x2014;was narrating something to her, about somebody&#x2019;s history, How &#x2018;he went to India, Ma&#x2019;am, and good luck followed him to the East,&#x2019; but smothered it into &#x2018;Gootlock followed him to the Orient!&#x2019; which was not forgotten for a long time here!&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>).</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>But there you see <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a long letter&#x2014;and my head aching&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is stupid I must go and sit in the garden&#x2014;all the house is at church&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>J W C</name></p>

<p><salute>Well, Dearest,</salute> here we are; wearied to death, one of us, with trotting over the <hi rend="italic">wet wet</hi> beauties of this City,&#x2014;and latterly with circling far and wide to find Andrew Chrystal<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeannie Welsh&#x2019;s future husband who lived in Glasgow.</note> and the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> route to Auchtertoul!&#x2014;and, at a blessed interval of locomotion, I throw you off a line, to say, among other things, how the route <hi rend="italic">is</hi> settled. And <hi rend="italic">W</hi> is not at home for the moment; but his Partner describes the road, round by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, Kirkcaldy, with railways, firths and ferries, horrible to the wearied soul, and <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> (in point of difficulty) than from Scotsbrig itself: by Scotsbrig, tomorrow at 11&#xBD; a.m., I accordingly settle to go; and have written to Jack to meet me at the due hour with Gig and superintendance: so <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is fixed; and I must take my first sight of poor Goodykin by some other arrangement. <hi rend="italic">Write</hi> to me, write to me, <hi rend="italic">forthwith!</hi> Say how you are, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> you are after so many separate adventures: <hi rend="italic">ay de mi!</hi></p>
<p>We had a beautiful swift ship from Derry yesterday; the beautifulest sail (by Mull of Cantire, Arran &#x26;c) so long as daylight lasted; after dark, I flung myself upon a sofa, fell into leaden sleep, awoke at 1&#xBD; a.m., grey and windy weather, saw on reaching deck <hi rend="italic">two cotton chimnies</hi>, found Glasgow was but five miles off, and proceeded to rouse the lean body of W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Edward, whose good humour didn&#x2019;t quite return till this morning&#x2019;s tea, I think! After infinite haggling, bawling, hitching and hobbling to and fro under the grey sooty canopy of what even here is called Heaven, illuminated in fierce glowing pulses by certain Ironworks familiarly denominated &#x201C;Dixon&#x2019;s Blast,&#x201C;&#x2014;we did at last get ashore, amid tumults of dissolute Irishry, copassengers, &#x201C;the finest peasantry&#x201C; flying from beggary along with us; and found ourselves seated on our luggage on the pavement; Porter gone to seek a barrow, a <foreign>noddy</foreign> [one-horse coach], <foreign>shandrydan</foreign> or any human vehicle; finest peasantry exclaiming as it tumbled past &#x201C;Wish I were in the station-house itself till morning!&#x201C; No Handcar, noddy, nor barrow were attainable by the fallacious Porter; so he <hi rend="italic">carried</hi>, with creaking shoulders, to a &#x201C;Clyde H&#xF4;tel,&#x201C; dark hospice, the resort of traders, pirates and sea-faring people; where in a dingy apartment, dirty little French bed, with window which let in the roaring noise of an adjoining mill, I nevertheless fell asleep again (I am <hi rend="italic">green</hi>-coloured with <hi rend="italic">bile</hi>) and so <pb id="pg-24-182" n="24:182"/>lay till 8 o&#x2019;clock. After breakfast, and bill paid, a <foreign>noddy</foreign> brought us and our things hither; the ever-hospitable Hope (almost my <hi rend="italic">oldest</hi> friend now living) offered us escort, dinner &#x26;c &#x26;c, especially offered <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of us a quiet room and bed, at which I eagerly grabbed, Forster putting up with a civilized H&#xF4;tel not far off. And so here I am,&#x2014;alone a little while, thank God!&#x2014;and within an hour of dinner-time. Forster goes with me tomorrow, right on to <hi rend="italic">Carlisle</hi>, and the Lakes; I have given him a line to T. Spedding, and so will handsomely <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> him too. Thank God, they are all dropped!

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here, on getting to anchor after my Irish roamings, I last night found the accompanying Letter;&#x2014;to which let us confine our attention in the first place.</p>
<p>Miss Margaret Fuller is an American Lady, of ripe years, perhaps 40 and odd;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was 39.</note> deformed and lean in person, but full of ardent soul to the finger-ends; enthusiastic, resolute, eloquent; writes really strikingly and well, with a constant noble <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> pervading all she says; style clear, brief and vivid; meaning high and true, tho&#x2019; occasionally somewhat airy and vague. The Books that I have read of hers (which can be had at your Namesake&#x2019;s,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Chapman.</note> I suppose) give me somewhat the notion of a <hi rend="italic">spiritual Aurora Borealis.</hi> She is a great ally of Emerson&#x2019;s, but deeper in German and Foreign things than he; and indeed a much more vehement and self-reliant, not to say dogmatic, autocratic and practically positive character. She adores Mazzini; has lived in Rome, I think, these three years or more. Her Book,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;History of the late Italian Insurrections&#x201C; (see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490810-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1849-08-10">10 Aug.</date></ref>). The MS was lost in the shipwreck in which she was drowned with her husband and child, <date when="1850-07-16">16 July 1850</date>. A friend records that as Mazzini&#x2019;s admirer, Fuller &#x201C;took pains&#x201C; to learn about the situation in Italy &#x201C;with a view to write a history of the period&#x201C; and that those who knew her saw the loss of her &#x201C;history and notes as a great and irreparable one&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli</hi>, ed. J. F. Clarke, R. W. Emerson, and W. E. Channing [<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>] 3:239&#x2013;40).</note> I have little doubt, will be a striking thing in its way; and, as she will probably be <hi rend="italic">brief</hi> withal, I do not consider it quite unlikely that you also might find your account in it. But on that latter point, let me abstain from all shadow of judgement. I give <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the truest account I can of the Lady and her talent; <pb id="pg-24-184" n="24:184"/>and bid you judge for yourself. She is, so far as I may note, <hi rend="italic">considerably</hi> a higher-minded and cleverer woman than any of the Lady Lions yet on your Books; and if you and she could make any arrangement useful to both parties, I should be very glad indeed.</p>
<p>At all counts, pray read her Letter carefully over; look into her published Books if you think proper; ask <hi rend="italic">me</hi> farther about any dark point you may think I can elucidate;&#x2014;and on the whole, having made up your mind, be so good as write <hi rend="italic">something definite</hi> to the address given there; and let me know what it is. And, above all, pray lose no time; for you perceive too much has been already lost. If Forster is with you, the case may be freely imparted to him, and sight of the Letter, which otherwise you perceive is a private one. Finally, if you had rather <hi rend="italic">not</hi> write to Rome yourself (tho&#x2019; that I think will save some days and otherwise answer better), write to me, and I will transmit. <hi rend="italic">Item</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">return</hi> Miss F.&#x2019;s Letter when you have done with it. And that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> all.</p>
<p>Is <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> come out yet? Tell me a word of that, please; for something depends on it. <closer><salute>Yours always t<supplied>[ruly]</supplied></salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Thanks to thee, Dearest;</salute> and thanks to Heaven, here are 3 Letters all at once; and finally I have news, and this infatuated <foreign><hi rend="italic">burble</hi></foreign> of a correspondence disembroils itself at last, and all is well!&#x2014;The Kirkcaldy Letter of Wednesday must have been too late for the Post; it arrived an hour ago, <hi rend="italic">along</hi> with the Auchtertoul one of yesterday;&#x2014;and happily also the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Galway Letter (the Haddington one), for which I had written to the Postmaster from Derry, has arrived at the same time. These, with one from <pb id="pg-24-185" n="24:185"/>poor Farie,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Robert Farie rather than Archibald Glen&#x2019;s partner (<ref target="volume-07/lt-18340318-TC-AG-01"><sic>7:115</sic><corr>TC to AG, <date when="1834-03-18">18 March 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> for whom I had left a kind of reminiscence at Glasgow, form a goodly batch, my share for one day. Post has to go again at <hi rend="italic">five</hi>, with dinner in the interim,&#x2014;alas, also with <hi rend="italic">calomel</hi> in one&#x2019;s inner man!&#x2014;but I will not lose a Post, especially as, it seems, there are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days on the road <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Auchtertoul, tho&#x2019; one suffices for the road <hi rend="italic">from</hi> it.&#x2014; Thanks to my clever little Goody; an excellent <hi rend="italic">despatching</hi> little body; who well deserves despatch in return!</p>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">got</hi> the scrawl I sent you from Gweedore? I think now all the Letters in both hands are got: but I cannot without considerable effort remember when or where I wrote; it was all done as in the throng of battle; and if it had not been for this invaluable writing-case (an implement which I shall much respect), it many a time could not have been done at all.&#x2014; A Letter from Margaret Fuller at Rome lay waiting me here; about helping her to publish some &#x201C;History of the late Italian Insurrections,&#x201C; so as to get <hi rend="italic">money</hi> out of it: I sent the Letter on to Chapman (C. <hi rend="italic">&#x26; Hall</hi>) yesterday, with a Note of my own, and a request that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would write to Margaret; I believe I must write myself too, but have not yet done it. Two other Notes, one from an Irish Fool, one from an English d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> (a Cheltenham Clericus), both &#x201C;claiming my acqu<hi rend="italic">a</hi>ntance&#x201C; if possible:&#x2014;nothing else lay for me here, and these now are in the fire.</p>
<p>I read in John&#x2019;s Note clear account of your poor sorrowful proceedings at Haddington; one of the most tragical of simple scenes. Ah, me! But it was all right, I believe; and in the end <hi rend="italic">such</hi> sorrows are wholesome, and make us wiser. My poor old Mother cried over your Letter; it was &#x201C;the <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae&#x2019;est</hi></foreign> thing she had ever heard.&#x201C; Why did you <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> that Letter, since you had written it, in that sad wakeful night? That you wrote to me at all was indeed what your better genius prompted; and the reading of it could have done me nothing but good. However, as I preach on all occasions that duty of &#x201C;drawing in the steam&#x201C; and condensing it into <hi rend="italic">silence</hi>, I have no reason to complain. God be with thee always, in all thy sorrows, poor little Goody mine; and teach thee to interpret them <hi rend="italic">wisely</hi>, and take the right lesson out of them: that is a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> prayer, and stands good forever. To such use all sorrows, if we will be wise, <hi rend="italic">are</hi> sent us; and thou, and I, and some others, have certainly not gone without our share. The poor old Donaldsons! There also is a tragedy: the last of the Brothers gone, and nothing left but sad remembrances to these three poor old souls.&#x2014;</p>
<p>We had a suitably stupid afternoon and ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> at David Hope&#x2019;s: an old Merchant body (&#x201C;Stewart,&#x201C; I think), a young Manchester niece, Archy Glen really the <hi rend="italic">flower</hi> of the party, for W. E.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster. &#x201C;Stewart&#x201C; and the Manchester niece are unidentified.</note> did little but sit appealing to <pb id="pg-24-186" n="24:186"/><hi rend="italic">me</hi> with his eyes. &#x201C;Did you ever?&#x201C; Andrew Chrystal came in person after dinner; very greyheaded, otherwise a wholesome enough looking man. Archy and he took me thro&#x2019; &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">Goose-dubs</hi>,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><foreign>Goosedubs</foreign> [goose ponds] Lane once ran between Stockwell St. and Bridgegate, Glasgow; described in <hi rend="italic">Noctes Ambrosianae</hi> as a series of filthy and nefarious closes (<hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> <date when="1826-10-20">20 [Oct. 1826]</date>:625&#x2013;26).</note> after ten, and into a strange nasty-looking quasi-theatre where greasy youths were smoking and drinking, a bassoon or two going, and a song seemingly expected,&#x2014;&#x201C;Blast my eye,&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Blast my eye(s)&#x201C;: repeated phrase in &#x201C;Sam Hall,&#x201C; a notorious bawdy song of the time.</note> very possibly:&#x2014;I saw nothing so disgusting these several years, and in five minutes came away. David Hope&#x2019;s big bed was of excellence supreme; but the window, which I had to open for air, looked out upon &#x201C;the noisiest street but one&#x201C; in Glasgow; so that my sleep was none of the most prosperous:&#x2014;at 11&#xBD; o&#x2019;clock however, W. E. and I, after cleaving other floods of courteous wearisomeness (a <hi rend="italic">shame</hi> to mock over, for it was beneficence in purpose), found ourselves fairly storming along, thro&#x2019; rich green country, and wholesome <hi rend="italic">clothed</hi> populations, a pleasure to behold after ragged, weedy Ireland; all in a carriage by ourselves, where even smoking <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have been practiced;&#x2014;and punctual to the minute at 3 p.m., Jack, in a new grey jacket with swift gig and pony appeared,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">invited</hi> W. E. over with him &#x201C;till the evening train&#x201C;; had to take refusal, and shake hands; and so, within another hour, I was set down here, with all my goods, and dinner (of welcome chicken-broth), prepared by the assiduous Isabella, wound up my travel&#x2019;s history, for this first stage of it. Thank Heaven, once more! I have been in many strange scenes since that Saturday morning when I parted with you at Cadogan pier;&#x2014;I return with safe bones; I suppose, intrinsically rather <hi rend="italic">better</hi> in health; and with materials to think about which ought to last me this long while. Many a thing you will have to <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> yet, when the talking fit comes on! I think I have altered no opinion I had about Ireland, hardly any at all; but many an object has from shadowy become <hi rend="italic">corporeal</hi> to me; and that is pretty much what I expected from the business. Of men the only even slightly <hi rend="italic">admirable</hi> unit I fell in with was L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> George Hill: but of friendly figures I have seen a good few; and of persons <hi rend="italic">memorable</hi> in the way of farce and tragedy, very <hi rend="italic">low</hi> farce and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> tragedy, a whole squadron remain with me. More power to their elbow,&#x2014;and to mine! In some quiet place I ought to try and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> my Book now; <hi rend="italic">now</hi> after all this weary embroilment and embargo. God help us all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have not made much of sleeping here yet;&#x2014;but tonight and henceforth I expect to succeed better, and in a day or two to throw my &#x201C;bilious headache&#x201C; (a steady comrade for some time) to the winds, and be myself <pb id="pg-24-187" n="24:187"/>again and more. My poor old Mother is quite brisk, really looks better than when I was here last,&#x2014;a &#x201C;monument of mercies,&#x201C; as she calls herself: nothing can be truer than her regard for <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> she is sure you &#x201C;cannot quite pass us by without a glance&#x201C; on this occasion;&#x2014;agrees heartily with me that there is no such hand for a Letter, &#x201C;so <hi rend="italic">jocose</hi> and clever&#x201C; everywhere:&#x2014;in short you will have to try and give them a day or two days on the passage southward. The place is all cleaner, brighter than it used to be; <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> country lasses serving you, Isabella on foot to rule them: on all hands an innocent kind of rurality <hi rend="italic">wholesome</hi> for the soul as the excellent <hi rend="italic">porridge</hi> they give you is for the body. Jack, totally idle, busied in reading, also in furnishing <hi rend="italic">eaves-spouts</hi> and other indispensable improvements,&#x2014;remains <hi rend="italic">King</hi> of the place, and I do not design to disturb his sovereignty while lodged here: in fact I have &#x201C;a place by mysel&#x2019;&#x2018;&#x201C; (this eastern room), and they leave me very much hitherto to do what I like here,&#x2014;which is nothing at all hitherto; a little silly reading, a little bad tobacco, and very much looking out upon Burnswark, and silent painting of images (not pleasant all of them, nor painful all) upon the vacant sky to northward. Jock Ritchie<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the neighboring farm; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430809-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:30</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-09">9 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> and his disorderly fields and operations remind me sufficiently of Ireland; more than any object I have yet seen here in Scotland does.</p>
<p>Certainly it was well I did not come to Auchtertoul! All yesterday, already seeing that it was so, and being in very weary and bilious mood withal,&#x2014;I could scheme out nothing but that you sh<hi rend="italic">d take a Lodging for us</hi>, somewhere on the shore thereabouts, that we might <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a little space of quiet, so often promised hitherto in vain. Today I can rejoice in the resource of hospitable Fergusdom! This day week you go there,&#x2014;well, and best. They are really excellent people, with abundant room, and habits of leaving one alone:&#x2014;I rejoice much to think of meeting you there. So tell me, Goodykin, <hi rend="italic">when</hi> I must come,&#x2014;Friday itself, or next day, or when? And tell the Ferguses with many compliments. At the day you wish, or near it, I will try to be there. I think we may manage to make out a week there,&#x2014;with a run of two day<supplied>[s]</supplied><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> to St Thomas,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Erskine at Linlathen, who had written to JWC, <date when="1849-07-23">23 July</date>, inviting them both there.</note> it will be easy,&#x2014;and after that I can see you over to Haddington if you like; or in short we can <hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> what way things should be. Let that therefore be the settlement;&#x2014;sufficient for this day, in the <hi rend="italic">calomel</hi> condition I am in!</p>
<p>If <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know Lady Ashburton&#x2019;s Address,&#x2014;for I cannot yet <hi rend="italic">read</hi> it quite certainly even in this Letter of yours,&#x2014;will you tell her that I sent a Note (from Derry, I think) addressed &#x201C;Glen <hi rend="italic">Truein</hi> House, n<hi rend="italic">r Dalwhinny</hi> N.B&#x201C; <pb id="pg-24-188" n="24:188"/>(according to the first indication);<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dalwhinnie is at the head of Glen Truim in Inverness-shire.

<p><salute>No news, Dearest, none at all:</salute> but a penny will carry a word to you, so I may send it tho empty. I made but a bad figure at sleep last night, contrary to hope; in fact I awoke at 3 o&#x2019;clock; and made nothing more of it, owing to cocks, and other blessed fellow inhabitants of this Planet,&#x2014;not all of whom are friendly to me, I perceive! In fact the Planet was not wholly made for me, but for me and <hi rend="italic">others</hi> (including cocks, unclean things many and even the Devil): that is the real secret of it! However, I am very so-so in health today still, on that account; and this night I mean to <hi rend="italic">change my bed</hi>, to shift into the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> room namely, and so bid defiance at least to cocks.&#x2014; On Monday my Mother and I are to go to Dumfries; where also is no great outlook for <hi rend="italic">sleep.</hi> Alas, a human creature with these particularities in mere sleep, not to speak of any others, is not he already a creature to be prayed for?&#x2014; Home, with <hi rend="italic">its</hi> quietude, will perhaps be all the welcomer.</p>
<p>If you have not already written to Lady A<hi rend="italic">n</hi> about that address, you see you need not now. This came by today&#x2019;s post. They appear now to have fixed on a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> Address; which must be <hi rend="italic">King</hi>gussie<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >14 mi.

<p>I have written a Letter to Marg<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Fuller; walked some miles in mud (for it has rained much today); smoked several pipes,&#x2014;and that is all! My <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi> occasionally affrights me. Such a state of things must, will and shall end. But let us say no more today.</p>
<p>Did your Uncle ever speak of a sad mishap (and worse) to Duncan Stewart in Liverpool (James&#x2019;s Brother)? Some cheating the Customhouse, rumour says; and an imprisonment in Lancaster Castle is said to have followed.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Details not traced.</note>&#x2014; Quick, write, and be a real <hi rend="italic">despatching</hi> Goody! <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> today.</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Here is a note from Plattnauer come with yours of this morning of no particular moment most likely;</salute> but I despatch it at once all the same&#x2014; There is also a note forwarded yesterday by Elizabeth, which I opened as it looked <hi rend="italic">questionable</hi> and Elizabeth said &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the Person</hi>&#x201C; had called a second time to inquire if you had got it. I supposed it a begging-letter. For the rest, I have no news. Since the day at Kircaldy we have had frequent deluges of rain making the house the safest place for one. Otherwise I should have made a run over to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> by this time to see old Betty.</p>
<p>On Tuesday I am to go with my Uncle and Walter to dine with the Minister of Beath&#x2014;five or six miles off&#x2014;whose wife&#x2019;s sister is a very nice old acquaintance of mine and at present residing there&#x2014;a Miss Macay whom you saw once at Comely Bank<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The minister of Beath, in Fife, 7 mi. W of Kirkcaldy, was (from <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>) James Fergusson (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>); m. <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>, Catherine (d. <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), da. of Charles Mackie, London goldsmith. Her sister is not otherwise identified, and the encounter is untraced.</note>&#x2014; Like everyone else she is grown extremely old; but still able to &#x2018;get up a sentiment&#x2019; for me&#x2014;I found&#x2014;&#x201C;Mercy! how like her <hi rend="italic">Mother!</hi>&#x201C; were her first words on seeing me&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have had no further communication with the Ferguses By the way, I found there that day, M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Heywood and Lady Belcher,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Mrs. Heywood, 26 Cumberland Terr., Regent&#x2019;s Pk., and Diana, b.

<p>I keep to my intention of transferring myself there on Friday&#x2014;and shall write to Miss Jessy today or tomorrow that you will come on the Saturday or as soon after as you can. Fair wind to You!</p>
<p>All that about Duncan Stewart is notoriously true&#x2014;but nobody has found in it &#x201C;any reason to alter their opinion of him&#x201C;&#x2014; Both he and his wife have, these many years been considered &#x201C;no <hi rend="italic">good</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;as Elizabeth says&#x2014;</p>
<p>It is very sad that you should have to take calomel the first thing on coming to a stillstand&#x2014;but the wonder is you have stood so much tossing about, so well as you seem to have done&#x2014; I do not think it ever answers for us nervous people to <hi rend="italic">subside</hi> all at once; we should be let down by degrees.</p>

<ps><p><title>[ENCLOSED REPORT]</title></p>
<p>This head is of a very nice type and truly effeminate A grand point this for the heads of women sometimes have a masculine type and this never works well The faulty part of this organization is in the centre of the brow and in the organs of &#x201C;Individuality&#x201C; &#x201C;Size,&#x201C; &#x201C;Weight,&#x201C; and &#x201C;Colour.&#x201C; The effect of such defects is to produce a want of observation, in relation to external objects and a tendency to reflect too much on subjects suggested by the feelings. The outer world presents to the observant person a multitude of attractive objects which draw the attention from what is called the inner world and thus tends to dissipate grief and anxiety and to prevent us from being too much taken up with ourselves.</p>
<p>But the non-observant person dwells too much within the chambers of <pb id="pg-24-191" n="24:191"/>the mind and is in comparison with the observant person, incapable of enjoying many pleasures For instance, if a person love botany and have a taste for rural scenery how greatly the mind of such a person may be relieved and exhilirated by a ramble in the country particularly if in search of botanical specimens<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Ah yes!&#x201C; penciled in margin.</note> and the same may be said in relation to Geology and other sciences as well as to the objects and employments in domestic life, which non-observant persons rarely are found to take any interest in. Moreover persons of weak observing faculties find great difficulty in acquiring expertness in any manipulatory art, such as piano playing, drawing, &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Now, here lies this lady&#x2019;s only defect. I wish I could say &#x201C;here lies <hi rend="italic">buried</hi>&#x201C; &#x26;c for she is very sensible very intelligent, thinks comprehensively, is of an enquiring mind and a love of knowledge. She writes well, is fond of reading, is a most pleasing companion, has a good memory of events and periods<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Oh!&#x201C; in margin.</note> and a taste for the study of languages.</p>
<p>As to her moral character, she is far from every positively bad quality, is affectionate, ardent, industrious, discreet, economical, an &#x201C;excellent thing in woman&#x201C;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi> 5.3.</note> and as unselfish as is compatible with prudence and safety. Though cautious and sufficiently reserved this lady does not labour under that cowardly diffidence which oppresses so many female minds She is not obtrusively confident but rather in that middle state between retireingness and self-reliance which alone is compatible with happiness and efficiency.</p>
<p>From obstinacy she is quite free &#x26; and has that spirit of obedience and resignation to the will of fate which enables one to bear patiently the slings and arrows of misfortune<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi> 3.1.</note> as well as the various inconsistencies &#x26; crosses of every day life.</p>
<p>I believe that she is ever guided by kind feelings &#x26; upright principles and that she has earned the good will and respect of all who know her</p>
<p>I have had so much to say about the intellectual region that I am obliged to be less minute in regard to the moral organisation.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,&#x2014;</salute>By all laws of human computation, I owe you a Letter, and have owed, any time these seven weeks: let me now pay a little, and explain. Your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> Barrel of Indian Corn arrived also perfectly fresh, and of admirable taste and quality; the very bag of new-ground meal was perfect; and the &#x201C;popped corn&#x201C; d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, when it came to be discovered: with the whole of which admirable materials such order was taken as promised to secure &#x201C;the greatest happiness to the greatest number&#x201C;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeremy Bentham&#x2019;s phrase.</note> and due silent thanks were rendered to the beneficence of the unwearied Sender:&#x2014;but all this, you shall observe, had to be done in the thick of a universal packing and household bustle; I just on the wing for a &#x201C;Tour in Ireland,&#x201C; my Wife too contemplating a run to Scotland shortly after, there to meet me on my return. All this was seven good weeks ago: I hope<supplied>[d]</supplied><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> somewhere in my Irish wayfarings to fling you off a Letter; but alas I reckoned there quite without my host (strict &#x201C;host,&#x201C; called <hi rend="italic">Time</hi>), finding nowhere half a minute left to me; and so now, having got home to my Mother, not to see my Wife yet for some days, it is my <hi rend="italic">earliest</hi> leisure, after all, that I employ in this purpose. I have been terribly knocked about too,&#x2014;jolted in Irish cars, bothered almost to madness with Irish balderdash, above all kept in dreadfully short allowance of sleep;&#x2014;so that now first, when fairly down to rest, all aches and bruises begin to be fairly sensible; and my clearest feeling at this present is the uncomfortable one, that &#x201C;I am not Caliban but a Cramp&#x201C;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> 5.1.</note> terribly cramped indeed, if I could tell you everything!</p>
<p>What the other results of this Irish Tour are to be for me I cannot yet in the least specify. For one thing, I seem to be farther from <hi rend="italic">speech</hi> on any subject than ever: such masses of chaotic ruin everywhere fronted me, the general fruit of long-continued universal falsity and folly; and such mountains of delusion yet possessing all hearts and tongues: I could do little that was not even <hi rend="italic">noxious</hi>, except <hi rend="italic">admire</hi> in silence the general &#x201C;Bankruptcy of Imposture&#x201C; as one there finds and sees it come to pass, and think with infinite sorrow of the tribulations, futile wrestlings, tumults and disasters which yet await that unfortunate section of Adam&#x2019;s Posterity before any real improvement can take place among them. Alas, alas! The Gospels <pb id="pg-24-193" n="24:193"/>of Political Economy, of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Laissez-faire</hi></foreign>, No-Government, Paradise to all comers, and so many fatal Gospels,&#x2014;generally, one may say, all the Gospels of this blessed &#x201C;New Era,&#x201C;&#x2014;will first have to be tried, and found wanting. With a quantity of written and uttered Nonsense, and of suffered and inflicted Misery, which one sinks fairly dumb to estimate! A kind of comfort it is, however, to see that &#x201C;Imposture&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">has</hi> fallen openly &#x201C;bankrupt,&#x201C; here as everywhere else in our old world; that no dexterity of human tinkering, with all the Parliamentary Eloquence and Election Franchises in nature, will ever set <hi rend="italic">it</hi> on its feet again, to go many yards more; but that <hi rend="italic">its</hi> goings and currencies in this Earth have as good as ceased forever and ever! God is great; all Lies do now, as from the first, travel incessantly towards Chaos, and there at length lodge! In some parts of Ireland (the Western &#x201C;insolvent unions,&#x201C; some 27 of them in all), within a trifle of <hi rend="italic">one half</hi> of the whole population are on Poor-Law rations (furnished by the British Government, &#xa3;1100 a week furnished here, &#xa3;1300 there, &#xa3;800 there); the houses stand roofless, the lands unstocked, uncultivated, the landlords hidden from bailifs, living sometimes &#x201C;on the hares of their domain&#x201C;: such a state of things was never witnessed under this sky before; and, one would humbly expect, cannot last long!&#x2014; What is to be done? asks every one; incapable of <hi rend="italic">hearing</hi> any answer, were there even one ready for imparting to him. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Blacklead</hi> those 2 million idle beggars,&#x201C; I sometimes advised, &#x201C;and sell them in Brazil as Niggers,&#x2014;perhaps Parliament, on constraint, will allow you to advance them to be Niggers!&#x201C;&#x2014; In fact, the Emancipation Societies should send over a deputation or two to look at <hi rend="italic">these</hi> immortal Irish &#x201C;Free men,&#x201C; the <foreign><hi rend="italic">ne-plus-ultr&#xE0;</hi></foreign> of their class: it would perhaps moderate the windpipe of much eloquence one hears on that subject! Is not this the most illustrious of all &#x201C;ages&#x201C;; making progress of the species at a grand rate indeed? Peace be with it.</p>
<p>Waiting for me here, there was a letter from Miss Fuller in Rome, written about a month ago; a dignified and interesting Letter; requesting help with Booksellers for some &#x201C;History of the late Italian Revolutions&#x201C; she is about writing; and elegiacally recognising the worth of Mazzini and other cognate persons and things. I instantly set about doing what little seemed in my power towards this object,&#x2014;with what result is yet hidden,&#x2014;and have written to the heroic Margaret: &#x201C;more power to her elbow!&#x201C; as the Irish say. She has a beautiful enthusiasm; and is perhaps in the right stage of insight for doing that piece of business well.&#x2014; Of other persons or interests I will say nothing till a calmer opportunity; which surely cannot be very long in coming.</p>
<p>In 4 days I am to rejoin my wife; after which some bits of visits are to be paid in this North Country; necessary most of them, nor likely to be profitable almost any. In perhaps a month I expect to be back in Chelsea; <pb id="pg-24-194" n="24:194"/>whither direct a word if you are still beneficent enough to think of such a Castaway! <closer><salute>Yours ever</salute></closer></p>

This morning, in spite of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things present or likely to come, we are decided to go; and I write you a word (with very bad apparatus) in great haste and confusion, to be ready for you at Kirkcaldy when you come tomorrow. The weather seems completely <hi rend="italic">broken</hi> here, air full of &#x201C;electricity,&#x201C; of rain and other confused tumult,&#x2014;potatoes all likely to rot, they say; travelling is not a good job at all in these circumstances.</p>
<p>I got your Letter on Tuesday before I started. Plattnauer&#x2019;s inclosure was to thank me for a <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> which had <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi>, sent by John, from London, at my request: the other letters were babble and moonshine.

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>On Monday I go to Fife, where and farther to the North I have still some visits to accomplish; so that unluckily there is no chance of my reaching Lancashire till considerably after the <date when="1849-08-28">28<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> of the month. Let the admirers of Goethe know this, with my compliments and regrets.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-08-28">28 Aug.</date> was the centenary of Goethe&#x2019;s birth.</note></p>
<p>Whether I shall come home by Manchester, or whether by land at all, is very uncertain; Manchester, with so many interesting objects in it, and so many well-affected souls, is very alluring, if I do come within wind of it. But my days and nights, this long while, have been so overwhelmed in tumult and noise, the thing I at present seek above all others is <hi rend="italic">silence;</hi> and that, I doubt, is not a product you are very famous for in Manchester! So <pb id="pg-24-197" n="24:197"/>that the likelihoods, I imagine, are, one may feel necessitated (as usual) to rush direct for Chelsea.</p>
<p><closer><salute>I send many kind remembrances to Ballantyne and Espinasse, and the others named; and with best wishes for one and all of you, remain&#x2014;hoping a better horoscope for visits by and by.&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Good evening to thee, Goody dear!</salute> There are you safe, I hope, at Kirkcaldy; and here am I since yesternight safe at Scotsbrig; and I cannot come conveniently tomorrow, but mean to appear on Monday; and in the mean time send you this to handsel a little your new quarters, for the blotch I sent yesterday from Dumfries will hardly have proved legible. Oh that I could say with <hi rend="italic">effect</hi>, Be happy! The wish that I could will be worth something to thee; and to me the writing of it is worth one penny, this evening after tea, while a little light still lingers over Burnswark.</p>
<p>My Mother and I got home, without much rain to ourselves, but amid the plentifullest combination of thunder showers I have seen for years; cloud answering cloud, in great heavy musters, all round from Hartfell to Helvellyn;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountains in Dumfriesshire and Cumberland, respectively.</note> and such a pitchy mass of rain pouring down over Criffel<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mountain 10 mi.

I am totally <hi rend="italic">idle</hi> here; and, alas, have long been everywhere: pray for me, pray for me!</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I have been here, sojourning in my native scenes, for above a week, after more than a month of confused wanderings over Ireland, whither I went to make a &#x201C;Tour,&#x201C; not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> &#x201C;for pleasure&#x201C; I may say, and which I was very glad to end by striking in hither for a little <hi rend="italic">rest.</hi> The day after tomorrow (this is Saturday) I have to set off again, and quit these old familiar haunts, which are very sad to me if very dear: but before going I will write you a hasty word, the <hi rend="italic">most</hi> deliberate at my disposal just now: I have all along counted on doing so, for I judge that a Letter with this date will be welcomer to you than one with any other whatsoever. Your Letter to me arrived safe, after not very long delays; and I believe you have since had more than one written to you, by Jack, by way of answer: but as for me, I calculated on answering you first <hi rend="italic">from Ireland;</hi> and there I was continually kept in such a flurry, there really never was half an hour at my disposal for such an object: so that, on the whole, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is actually the first fair possibility I had. Another Letter of yours, a shortish one, with news of good health, but of <hi rend="italic">financial</hi> intricacies about your new Farm, was also lying here when I came, and I believe has been answered by the Doctor. We are all a little anxious to learn what has come of those same pecuniary &#x201C;troubles,&#x201C; and hope heartily to hear by the next arrival that you have got the matter handsomely settled in some way. &#x201C;All <hi rend="italic">beginnings</hi> are difficult,&#x201C; says the Proverb.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. TC&#x2019;s trans. of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship and Travels, Works</hi> 24:227.</note> &#x201C;A <foreign>dub</foreign> [puddle] at every Town-end, and a <foreign><hi rend="italic">loch</hi></foreign> at this,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340408-TC-MCA-01"><sic>7:129</sic><corr>TC to MCA, <date when="1834-04-08">8 April 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> <pb id="pg-24-199" n="24:199"/>is another saying to the same purport. Well; a man has to struggle thro&#x2019; the &#x201C;loch&#x201C;: on the other side, if he wade well, he does find habitable ground, all the welcomer for his past trouble. Good speed to you, dear Brother! I do not well understand how the matter lies; and can do little more at present than join with all the rest, in wishing you with our whole heart &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Good speed</hi>&#x201C; till you get the difficulty subdued again.</p>
<p>Scotsbrig, except by the increased size of the <hi rend="italic">children</hi>, who grow always whether we heed them or not, is but little altered since you last saw it: Jamie is rather in weakly health, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than he has been, and above all grown more <hi rend="italic">careful</hi> in his habits of living; for the rest, he seems to be doing moderately well in all ways; has a fair or even rather superior crop on the ground, but complains of low prices (15 pence a stone for meal,&#x2014;they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> extremely low, here as with you and everywhere in these unsettled times!): he has suffered something by loss of cattle from an &#x201C;epidemic&#x201C; (disorder in the lungs) that has long been hovering about: at present he is &#x201C;making up his rent&#x201C; for &#x201C;Thursday next,&#x201C;&#x2014;a duty you happily have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to do;&#x2014;and grumbles a little about the state of things; but, on the whole, I find him doing well, and entitled to the name of <hi rend="italic">fortunate</hi> in these broken distracted times. Isabella, too, seems quite herself again; and the children seem good healthy creatures: what is there to complain of, in such a posture of affairs?&#x2014; Our dear old Mother, you will be delighted to know, is really brisk and well; quite surprisingly so at her time of life (78,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1849-09-30">30 Sept.</date></note> she counts it): I think I find her perceptibly heartier and fresher than two years ago; which adds greatly to the cheerfulness of this place for me, as is natural. Alas, such a state of things cannot continue always; but in the meanwhile surely we may be humbly glad at it, and ought to feel grateful, as for a great mercy, to the bounteous Heavenly Powers! She <hi rend="italic">reads</hi> greatly; has lately given up <hi rend="italic">smoking</hi> (chews a little liquorice-stick instead), which I imagine is a real improvement: she or her old room are but little altered since you saw her and it,&#x2014;only the <hi rend="italic">carpet</hi> is wearing out, and she is now negociating about some fresh one; the peat-house too is getting frail: to this and all such things she will say, with a pious cheerfulness all her own, &#x201C;It&#x2019;ll maybe last my time,&#x2014;but we maun ha&#x2019;t mend it too!&#x201C; Good old Mother!&#x2014; She gets her meals now mainly with Jamie&#x2019;s people, who are very kind and respectful to her, young and old: Jack&#x2019;s long visits to this place do her good too, I believe. On the whole, it is a great comfort to one to see her as she now presents herself to me. Jack came, I think, two months ago; probably enough he may still stay for a good while; the free lounging life, best possible here, being much to his mind. After enough of that, and not <pb id="pg-24-200" n="24:200"/>sooner, he may return to Chelsea, and resume his work on <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi>, of which a good stock yet remains to him.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson wrote to John Carlyle, <date when="1849-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, that he had twice tried to forward a copy of his trans. of Dante to Alexander but had not yet found an agency. He distributed the 12 copies sent to him to Thoreau, W. E. Channing, Bronson Alcott, and others (see Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 457&#x2013;58).</note></p>
<p>Of the other Annandale people I can say almost nothing. I have only passed thro&#x2019; Ecclefechan, and seen nobody but Grahame of Burnswark, and Park<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Park; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18360223-TCJWC-JAC-01"><sic>8:306</sic><corr>TCJWC to JAC, <date when="1836-02-23">23 Feb. 1836</date></corr></ref>.</note> the Baker for one instant. Park is better in health than he once was, but still looks very much broken; he has has<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> now quite given over work, I believe, and merely superintends. Grahame has got into a new Two-story House, and is otherwise doing well enough in the economic sense; but both he and his Sister<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Graham.</note> are sadly cast down by the death of their last Brother, Peter, in America, which event came upon them unexpectedly, tho&#x2019; the poor man had been long in a suffering state. Grahame snuffs immensely; and &#x201C;Oh-whows&#x201C; in a really tiresome manner, poor fellow. Calvert, Isabella&#x2019;s father, is dead, as you probably know, a good while ago.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He died in 1846; see <ref target="volume-21/lt-18461003-TC-AC-01"><sic>21:68</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1846-10-03">3 Oct. 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> Old Garthwaite the Tailor too is dead.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Tom&#x2019;s father.</note> The railway, they say, has <hi rend="italic">slightly</hi> cheapened coals, but otherwise done Ecclefechan neither good nor harm: the Station is wrong-placed, at Swaugh;<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471002-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1847-10-02">2 Oct. 1847</date></ref>.</note> and cannot be got altered, so poorly is the whole thing paying hitherto. From Dumfries to Carlisle there is also a rail in action; comes thro&#x2019; Austin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">meadow</hi>, near the Bar yonder; but that is paying still worse. They must wait, they must wait: it will be long before those new-arrangements come to their full development.&#x2014; Coming home the first day, I saw Tom Clow (your Jenny&#x2019;s brother) hoeing turnips in the field near the Potter-knowe:<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The hill behind Middlebie, a few mi. NE of Ecclefechan.</note> he is still with &#x201C;the Laird,&#x201C; who is said to be struggling on in a kind of average fashion, fast falling into a large family. James and Charles Stewart&#x2019;s Brother, one Duncan Stewart a big Liverpool Merchant, has entirely ruined himself by some <hi rend="italic">fraud</hi> about the Customhouse; was in Lancaster jail, is now only out on bail of &#xa3;20,000: a very bad job indeed, all people say. This with other things has terribly hurt James Stewart, who indeed, by a stroke of palsy, is quite broken down,&#x2014;to the regret of everybody. Mudie, late Factor at Springkell, went away to Braidalbane in the North; has lately there been detected keeping <hi rend="italic">false books</hi>, and otherwise playing the devil; and is now turned out, to <pb id="pg-24-201" n="24:201"/>disgrace and beggary, they say.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Springkell, an estate ca. 4 mi. E of Ecclefechan. Breadalbane is a wild, mountainous district in the Grampians of W Perthshire. Mudie is unidentified.</note> Ah me, what a &#x201C;<foreign>pluister</foreign> [mess]&#x201C; of a world this is! Let me close my budget of news here.&#x2014; Of Ireland and my experiences there nothing must be said just now. I went round the whole coast, south and west, from Dublin round to Derry again (and thence <hi rend="italic">home</hi> by Glasgow); I conversed with all ranks of men, from Peers to Peasants, and saw much of the country; but little that was wholesome or comfortable could I contrive to see! Such a country for beggars and beggary was never before discovered. Desolation, weak and utter dissolution of society seemed fast coming on in various quarters. Over about &#x2153; of the Island there are &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Insolvent</hi> Poor-Law Unions&#x201C; (30,000 beggars supported by Government in some): in these not far from the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> soul is a Pauper!

<ps><p>I am going to Kirkaldy (the Fergus&#x2019;s) on Monday; there to meet Jane, who has been <hi rend="italic">touring</hi> for her own behoof while I was absent, and is now about coming southward again,&#x2014;probably by Scotsbrig for a day. I shall, it may be computed, be at Chelsea again, before this Letter reach you; tho&#x2019; I have one or two visits in the North to pay first. Jack always forwards the Newspaper in the interim. Duffy of the old &#x201C;Nation&#x201C; (intrinsically a good fellow, narrowly escaped from sentence of transportation) accompanied me a good part of my way in Ireland. He loves me well; got many a severe lecture from me,&#x2014;by which may he profit!</p></ps>

<p><salute><hi rend="small-caps">Dear Sister Jenny</hi>,&#x2014;</salute>Here is a Draft for your money, which you will get by presenting that Paper at the Bank, when the Martinmas Term comes;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1849-11-11">11 Nov.</date></note> I wish you much health and good industrious days till the 22nd comes round <hi rend="italic">again;</hi> and have done nothing more gladly, I may say, in the payment line than write this little paper for you, ever since the last was written, I think. It gave me very great pleasure to see your neat little Lodging and thrifty, modest, and wise way of life, when we were in <pb id="pg-24-202" n="24:202"/>Dumfries the other day. The reports of all friends agree in testifying to the same effect. Continue so, my good little sister, and fear nothing that can befall. Our outward fortune, lucky or what is called unlucky, we cannot command; but we <hi rend="italic">can</hi> command our own behaviour under it, and we do either wisely or else not wisely; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, in real truth, makes <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the difference,&#x2014;and does in reality stamp us as either &#x201C;lucky&#x201C; or else &#x201C;unlucky.&#x201C; For there is nobody but he that acts foolishly and <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> that can, in the end, be called &#x201C;unlucky&#x201C;; he that acts wisely and <hi rend="italic">right</hi> is, before all mortals, to be accounted &#x201C;lucky&#x201C;; he and no other than he. So toil honestly along, my dear little Jenny, even as heretofore; and keep up your heart. An elder brother&#x2019;s duty to you, I trust I may promise, you shall never stand in want of while I live in this world.</p>
<p>Take the next <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> (which Jean will give you for the purpose) and address it in your own hand to me: &#x201C;Care of John Fergus, M.P. etc., Kirkcaldy,&#x201C;&#x2014;or in fact if James Aitken write that, it will be all the same,&#x2014;and I shall need no other sign that you have received this Note and Inclosure safe. You can tell James to send only one <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> that way; but to direct the other to Scotsbrig till further notice.</p>
<p>Our Mother and I got well home on Thursday; the thunder-showers hung and fell heavy on all hands of us; but we escaped with little damage from them,&#x2014;got no rain at all till we were on the top of Dodbeck (or rather Daneby) Banks; which rain was never violent upon <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, and had as good as ended altogether by the time we reached the old Gildha Road.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dodbeck is 6&#xBD; mi. E of Dumfries on the main uphill road to Annan. They climbed steadily to Dalton and the back road to Hoddam and Ecclefechan. Gilhall is a farm nr. Dalton, 4 mi. W of Ecclefechan.</note> Our Mother&#x2019;s new bonnet, or any of her clothes, suffered nothing whatever. There had <hi rend="italic">been</hi> great rains here and all the way; the fields all running brooks, and the road-conduits hardly able to contain the loads they had. It was a good deal clearer yesterday; yet, in the evening, we had again a touch of rain, which I saw was very heavy over in Cumberland. To-day is a degree brisker still, tho&#x2019; with remnants of thunder-clouds still hanging, so we fancy the &#x201C;Flood&#x201C; is about terminating, and the broken weather going to heal itself again. Jamie has some cattle rather suffering by the &#x201C;epidemic,&#x201C; which, in the last year, has destroyed several; his bog-hay, too, is of course much wetted; but he is otherwise getting briskly enough along. You are to tell James Aitken that there is &#x201C;an excellent spigot&#x201C; here already for the water-barrel, so that he need take no farther heed of that, at least, till he hear again.</p>
<p>I could not quite handily get packed (owing to Garthwaites tailoring) for this day; so I put it off till Monday; and am fixed for that morning (10 <hi rend="small-caps">a.m.</hi>) <pb id="pg-24-203" n="24:203"/>to be in Edinburgh about <hi rend="italic">one</hi> o&#x2019;clock and over in Kirkcaldy in good time, where Jane, as I conclude, is arrived since yesterday and expects me against the given time.

<dateline><place>Kirkcaldy</place>, Tuesday Forenoon [<date when="1849-08-21">21 August 1849</date>].</dateline>
<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>If I had taken the Newspaper yesterday, I could have sent it, for there was ample time allowed me in Edinburgh: and now if this Note, as I partly fear, take <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days to get to Scotsbrig, I shall be vexed to think of my good Mother&#x2019;s disappointment.</p>
<p>Our journey to Edinburgh yesterday was altogether prosperous: at Moffat, R<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Calvert and his friend appeared at our carriage-door, to hand in the Miss Calvert and little Niece who were at Scotsbrig that evening;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert and presumably Martha Calvert, Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s brother and sister.</note> the other two places an old gentleman and his daughter took; after which there was nothing to be done or attempted, except to hope there <hi rend="italic">would be</hi> fresh air, to keep one&#x2019;s own window quite open at least, and sit meditating as the green solitudes whirled past one. It seemed to be rather after time when we reached Edinburgh; I got into the due omnibus, without delay; into the due railway train (a detestable, squealing, tumultuous, ill-smelling and every way ill-ordered apparatus), which after infinite haggling and <foreign><hi rend="italic">skaiching</hi></foreign> [scrounging] brought me out&#x2014;to see the Kirkcaldy Steamer &#x201C;gone about 20 minutes&#x201C;! The next was due, they told me, at a quarter past five,&#x2014;three hours of waiting.&#x2014; I discovered afterwards (when close upon <hi rend="italic">this place</hi>) that if I had sailed to Burntisland,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Opp. Leith and SW of Kirkcaldy.</note> as most of the others in my train seemed to be doing, there was a <hi rend="italic">railway</hi> that would have taken one on at once to Kirkcaldy; into which one could have got booked in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> itself, as the &#x201C;Kirkcaldy Railway&#x201C; (with 7 good miles of sea): <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was the railway and the trains &#x26;c of which Fergus spoke; unhappily communicating to my deep ignorance no instruction at all! However, I did well enough the other way; <pb id="pg-24-204" n="24:204"/>and indeed I should much <hi rend="italic">prefer</hi> the other as a mode of conveyance, especially with <hi rend="italic">luggage</hi> to handle, if one once knew the times, and could make them suit.</p>
<p>Being left at the Chain-pier with 3 vacant hours before me, I slowly sauntered up the shore of the sea; bathed in excellent water, well known to me of old, near &#x201C;Caroline Park&#x201C; (a locality much jumbled just now, by stone-waggons and other tumult of the Granton pier);<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 mi. W of Leith. The pier had been finished, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>. Caroline Park was W of the harbor.</note> after which, as I had done before, I <hi rend="italic">smoked</hi>, lying on the green, and looking out upon the blue Ocean-stream &#x26; the history of long-passed years,&#x2014;by no means an uncomfortable or a useless afternoon;&#x2014;and so at five o&#x2019;clock I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> sitting in the right steamer; and so, without farther adventure, safe in this house about half past six, still in good time for dinner. Jane, poor little creature, ran out to meet me; Fergus had gone &#x201C;to the railway&#x201C; for me, but of course did not find me there.</p>
<p>Jane looks vastly better than when we parted at Chelsea: she is off to Dunfermline today (14 miles) driving with the women of our party,&#x2014;for there are 3 stranger women here, and one man; a <hi rend="italic">dreadfully</hi> dull set all of them, I fear! Very kind and harmless, but wearisome (I much doubt) to a degree. Besides my room is exposed to the noise of street-carts, in some measure: so that my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> sleep today was attended with difficulties.&#x2014; I have written to Erskine today to say that our stay in <hi rend="italic">these</hi> special latitudes is not likely to be above some 8 days or so; and that for any two of these, or <hi rend="italic">almost any</hi>, we are his at Linlathen. I should like to get away from these alarming &#x201C;Lady Belcher&#x201C; people,&#x2014;a kind of washed-out Roman dilettante sisterhood, of ineffable <hi rend="italic">courtesy</hi>, and of a <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi> su<supplied>[r]</supplied>passing<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Letter omitted.</note> brook-water; with whom it will not do to attempt talking much. Fergus&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">three</hi> Sisters<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jessie Fergus, Mrs. Nixon (d. <date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430907-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:120</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-09-07">7 Sept. 1843</date></corr></ref>), and presumably Jane Royd (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380906-TC-JWC-01"><sic>10:162</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1838-09-06">6 Sept. 1838</date></corr></ref>). Elizabeth Pepoli was the fourth sister.</note> (for on counting the Party, I now find we are six women and 3 men) would be very greatly better if by themselves:&#x2014;but, in fact, what business has a lodger and guest to complain, ungrateful that I am! I will have a bathe daily in the sea; and I can sit here aloft, looking out into nothing but sky and trees, whenever I like to be alone. The day is very bright; tho&#x2019; yesterday morning, it seems, had still its remnant of rain. Harvest, they say, is begun here, close by <hi rend="italic">here</hi> which is early; crops all good, potatoes beginning to look very sick. Near Milk-brig<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 2 mi. S of Lockerbie.</note> yesterday I saw people mowing a little patch of barley; but nothing farther of the kind has occurred, or even seemed (so far as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sight went) very near occurring.</p>
<p>I hope my Mother is in her usual pitch today again: to say I send her my <pb id="pg-24-205" n="24:205"/>affection, is saying very little. Oh be careful of her, the good old Mother still left us amid so many losses! I wish Isabella also to understand how sensible I am of her constant kindness; and many delicate politenesses to me. Blessings with you all.&#x2014; Jane I perceive <hi rend="italic">will</hi> in all probability come by Scotsbrig; but no time or particulars could be fixed today. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>I have come up hither riding thro&#x2019; the beautiful Autumn air, with Mr Fergus who has business here today; and as he is off among his people, and has left me here for half an hour, in an &#x201C;Office-room&#x201C; where ink and paper are (tho&#x2019; no <hi rend="italic">pens</hi> usable but this steel one), I will send you a line of news before going farther.</p>
<p>We go along well enough at Kirkcaldy; excellently well, so far as the <hi rend="italic">hospitalities</hi> of friends can go; the weather too is good, and there is sea-bathing, with other &#x201C;temporal blessings&#x201C;:&#x2014;only in the article of <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> I am still a little defective; and in the article of Dilettante <hi rend="italic">Twaddle</hi>&#x2014; But we will not speak of that!&#x2014; The truth is, I have a kind of <hi rend="italic">headache</hi> almost always, the sign, I suppose, of a very <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> condition; my room too is noisy in the mornings, dinner is at 7 and breakfast on the stroke of <hi rend="italic">nine</hi>, very bad hours for me:&#x2014;in short I do not expect to do any good in my present quarters; and therefore with the less regret will quit them <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, which at any rate I must have done. Jane seems to get on considerably better than I; but she had a very bad headache, poor thing, last night,&#x2014;had got fatigued, I think, driving to Falkland &#x26;c,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 14 mi. N of Kirkcaldy.</note> and perhaps <hi rend="italic">frightened</hi> with a horse that fell: in short, she had crept <hi rend="italic">into</hi> bed, at the dinner hour; and had a quite prostrate time of it &#x201C;till about 2 this morning&#x201C; according to her own report. Miss Fergus came in with tea to her, about 7; I left her well, 2 hours ago, but decidely resolute not to have any <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> or other tumult <hi rend="italic">today.</hi></p>
<p>The Letter you sent me forward was from Lord George Hill; of no significance otherwise.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lord George wrote, <date when="1849-08-18">18 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I had great pleasure from your visit. &#x2026; The approbation &#x26; encouragement of one who enters so fully as you do into all that is useful, however small &#x26; mean it may appear to a passer by is very cheering.&#x201C;</note> Today we had a nice little Note from Jeffrey,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeffrey wrote, <date when="1849-08-23">23 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I shall be rejoiced to see you! &#x2026; A month ago I thought I should die&#x2014;cd not live&#x2014;and thought often and tenderly of you both&#x2014;indeed I have never ceased to think of you.&#x201C;</note> <pb id="pg-24-206" n="24:206"/>yesterday a d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> from Th<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Erskine: if I had been at home you should have had a sight of them all by this Post.&#x2014; We go to Erskine&#x2019;s on Monday first,&#x2014;having put it off to that day, for the purpose of meeting a Mr Mackenzie (Man of Feeling&#x2019;s son)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mackenzie (<date when="1780-00-00">1780</date>&#x2013;<date when="1870-00-00">1870</date>), writer to the signet, 3d son of Henry Mackenzie (<date when="1745-00-00">1745</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), novelist and misc. writer, author of <hi rend="italic">The Man of Feeling</hi> (<date when="1771-00-00">1771</date>). Erskine described him, <date when="1849-08-22">22 Aug.</date>, as a &#x201C;most genial man, who you may remember desired me to call your attention to some doings of Oliver in the upper ward of Lanarkshire as recorded in one of the Ballantyne books.&#x201C;</note> whom Erskine is anxious to present: we have engaged to stay &#x201C;two days&#x201C;; shall probably get back to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> say on Thursday, and there make a flying call on Jeffrey,&#x2014;&#x201C;lunch,&#x201C; he himself talks of, or &#x201C;breakfast,&#x201C; for he professed to be very weak and old:&#x2014;after which, Jane will to Haddington, and whether I am to accompany her, or to go northward again to Perth and Glen Truine (the Ashburtons&#x2019; Place)<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lady Ashburton wrote to TC about this time from Glen Truim House, 7 mi. SW of Kingussie, inviting him to visit there.</note> without farther delay, is as yet <hi rend="italic">un</hi>certain, Jane having hitherto put off deciding it,&#x2014;indeed not having yet written to the poor Miss Donaldsons to ask them about that or any thing.</p>
<p>Dear Brother, I am terribly <hi rend="italic">weary</hi>, that is a fact: I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> freely give any joy in exchange (I often think) for a quiet place to <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> in for a while! I will end my writing, for one thing, and lie down while I may, on three of these soft chairs.

Oh the Belchers, the sketching, dilettante-ing, ever-twaddling, well-nigh insupportable Belchers! I fly the side of the house they are on.</p>
<p>My dear good Mother need be in no apprehension of my heartfelt desire to revisit Scotsbrig as I pass South again: but nothing can be <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> in the present uncertain stage of matters.

<p><salute>Accept one short word, dear Jean;</salute> it is better than no word at all; and will suffice to throw a gleam of light on our pilgrimings hereabouts.</p>
<p>I went off on Monday to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, as anticipated, and thence right across hither, where I found Jane, in good hospitable quarters, looking very much improved since we last parted. Here we have continued ever since, as quiet as the circumstances would permit,&#x2014;not near quiet <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, for indeed I have been <hi rend="italic">sleeping</hi> badly rather, and so in the midst of many enjoyable things have not been enjoying myself very much.&#x2014;Tomorrow (Monday) we set off for Mr Erskine&#x2019;s (Linlathen, Dundee) some 30 miles north, there to continue till perhaps Thursday or Friday. I meant then to have come down with Jane, and escorted her to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and Haddington; but she will not hear of that,&#x2014;insists on my going off direct northward, without loss of way, to do my visit to the Ashburtons, she meanwhile faring gradually southward at her leisure. I think she will be at Scotsbrig some day or two or even three days the week after this,&#x2014;about the <date when="1849-09-05">5<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> or <date when="1849-09-06">6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of September</date>, for instance?&#x2014;but she will write herself to Jack or Mother when she has fixed. From me too, for my own behoof, you shall hear again before long.</p>
<p>James&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> came aright; a sign that Jenny had got her Letter. Beautiful weather <hi rend="italic">now</hi> here; harvest, good but rather late, just <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> generally.

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Here is an extremely brief word for you, merely to say that we are safe at Erskine&#x2019;s according to anticipation; and that all is quite right with us, so far as it usually is;&#x2014;and, in short, that if your usual motherly anxieties, dear good Mother, are like to get into action, you are fairly entitled and enjoined to <hi rend="italic">forbid</hi> them!&#x2014; I wrote to John, the other day, from Leslie; I sent you a Newspaper, which I think would come to hand yesterday; I also wrote a word to Jean, and sent a Newspaper to Mary: nobody has sent me anything in return; but I will try to believe that all is well.</p>
<p>We got here yesterday about 2 o&#x2019;clock; a prosperous ride by rail of a couple of hours; the good Erskine, with Farie &#x26;c (ask Jack about Farie) stood waiting on this side of the Ferry for us; and all kinds of welcome awaited us here. It is, in several respects, a favourable change from Kirkcaldy: <hi rend="italic">some</hi> people of sense and seriousness are here; and, for one other great point, I have got the <hi rend="italic">quietest</hi> big bedroom any man could desire! Poor Jane, I am sorry to know, did not make much sleep out last night; and having wanted, the night before too, is not in a very first-rate condition today: however, she bears up steadily: is ready for an expedition to &#x201C;Glammis Castle,&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Glamis Castle, Angus, seat of the earl of Strathmore.</note> whither they are all bent today, a drive of 12 miles; which I hope will do her a little good, in the fine weather.</p>
<p>The carriage is <hi rend="italic">at the door:</hi> bad luck to the hurry! I must <hi rend="italic">end</hi> instantly and run, for I have still new breeches to put on!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane will probably be with you <hi rend="italic">next week</hi> I think,&#x2014;towards the end. But she will <hi rend="italic">write.</hi> <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Mother; love to every one. Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>I had your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-08-28">28 Aug.</date> from Scotsbrig saying, &#x201C;Our Mother by my recommendation has remained in bed two or three days, on account of a local ailment to which she is subject, but has been reading diligently all the while, &#x26; this morning she is up as usual.&#x201C;</note> at Linlathen; for which, I hope, Jane made acknowledgement <pb id="pg-24-209" n="24:209"/>that same day. It was very welcome to us in all respects, except that ailment of my Mother&#x2019;s, which let me try to believe subsided by this time. But write, I request you, forthwith, and tell me.</p>
<p>We were excellently well off at Linlathen; sorry only (I for my part) that there had not been provision made for a longer stay. Farie was there, as Jane would tell you; he had already come to Kirkaldy for a day: poor fellow, I left him asleep at Perth this morning; a droll but truly friendly soul! He still hopes to effect some meeting with you for Linlathen or otherwise; the good Erskine was about writing to you shortly some express invitation thither. Poor Erskine, he has some formidable ailment in his hands,&#x2014;gradual stiffening of the finger-joints and loss of power,&#x2014;concerning which you might perhaps give him some good advice; advice to run up and ask Brodie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3484"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), surgeon, 17 Savile Row; sgt.-surgeon to the queen and pres. of Royal College of Surgeons. The Carlyles apparently asked Erskine to stay with them; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490919-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1849-09-18">18</date> <date when="1849-09-19">[19] Sept.</date></ref></note> at least: for at present he seems silently desperate about the thing. In fine, an excellent set of people; loved, and considerably <hi rend="italic">enjoyed</hi> on this occasion by both Jane and me.</p>
<p>Last night poor Jane attended Farie and me to the Dundee Station; she was well in health but sad enough to part with me again. She had already decided on doing her Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> visits (to Aunts &#x26;c) without my assistance: in fact she would not have <hi rend="italic">me</hi> travel and retravel any ground for the object of escorting her,&#x2014;she, as she said, &#x201C;rather able to escort <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>&#x201C; Today before this time, she is at Kirkcaldy (I hope); will cross on Monday, to Hadd<hi rend="italic">n</hi> that night, and finally perhaps about Friday or sooner I expect to hear of her getting to Scotsbrig. Oh be kind to her there; I know you all will,&#x2014;and you, if you liked (and were a <hi rend="italic">veredical</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> <hi rend="italic">Angel</hi>, that is) might tell her <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> too as well as her nerves &#x201C;not to be troubled!&#x201C;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John 14:1, 27.</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother. I am just <hi rend="italic">arrived</hi> safe;&#x2014;and here <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the Servant declaring that the Post waits. I will write again the day after tomorrow or <hi rend="italic">so.</hi> Blessings on my dear Mother and you all!</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dearest,</salute> what can I do but write to you, even if I were not bound by the natural law of the wayfarer? It is my course whenever I am out of sorts or in low spirits among strangers; emphatically my case just now, in this closet of a House among rains and Highland moors, with a nervous system all &#x201C;dadded about&#x201C; by Coach travel, rail travel, multiplied confusion, and finally by an almost totally sleepless night! Happily this closet <hi rend="italic">is</hi> my own for the time being; here is paper, here are pens and the invaluable writing-case: I will tell my woes to poor Goody; well do I know that, in spite of prepossessions, <hi rend="italic">she</hi> will have some pity for me. I must not write a Jeremiade either; I will try to write a history, and that in my present mood seems lamentable to a sufficient extent. That you, my own dear, should be perhaps sorrowing lest I be <hi rend="italic">too</hi> happy here; and that my actual quantum of &#x201C;happiness&#x201C; should be what it veritably is, in fruition and outlook: this is of itself Jeremiade enough!&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">table</hi> too is only about 18 inches broad; so that, in spite of the writing-case, the chance of free penmanship is much abridged.</p>
<p>Farie and I, after that dolorous dumb parting, got along to Perth, with the usual steam-phenomena; sad enough in spirit, one of us; and Farie, poor fellow, mumbled something of &#x201C;tendencies to suicide&#x201C; which he seemed to have been turning over in his head. Pipes were not procurable in Perth, nor good tobacco; the George Inn moreover was found full, and we had to retire upon another (the &#x201C;Salutation,&#x201C; good luck to it!), in which beside the glare and suffocation of gas, gas in the very bedrooms, and of nasty bagmen tearing up their suppers, there seemed nothing to be had but a tumbler of brandy-punch (water <hi rend="italic">tepid</hi>, as usual), and apartments that promised little sleep. We walked long in the streets till the noises had subsided: poor Farie gave me his blessing, and took the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of the rooms; I put out my dirty gas, tumbled into bed, and being dead wearied, slept a deep stony sleep till the Boots next morning roused me with &#x201C;five o&#x2019;clock, Sir!&#x201C; I slipt the <hi rend="italic">half</hi>-paid bill with a pencil-marking under Farie&#x2019;s door, and at a quarter to six was smoking on the Coach-roof, numberless importunate porters and other incommodities all well behind me. You may fancy what the route to Dunkeld and Kinnaird was, new to me after five and twenty years! The fat old Landlord at Dunkeld grown grey &#x26; much broader, was the only known living creature. A still, Olive-coloured mist hung over all <pb id="pg-24-211" n="24:211"/>the country; Kinnaird and the <hi rend="italic">old</hi> House, which was my sleeping-place, when I used to write to you,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC stayed in the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">old</hi> mansion&#x201C; nr. the new Kinnaird House when he was the Bullers&#x2019; tutor; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230525-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:362</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-05-25">25 May 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> were grayly discernible across the River amid their trees: I thought of the <hi rend="italic">water hen</hi> you have heard me mention, of the <hi rend="italic">pony</hi> I used to ride, of the whole world that then lived,&#x2014;dead now mostly, fallen silent forevermore even as the poor Bullers are, and as we shall shortly be! Such reflexions, when they do not issue <hi rend="italic">pusill</hi>animously, are as good as the sight of Michael-Angelo&#x2019;s Last Judgement,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the Sistine Chapel, Rome.</note> and deserve their place from time to time. Killiecrankie (which is the beautifullest mountain pass I have ever <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> seen)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230416-TC-MAC-01"><sic>2:336</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1823-04-16">16 April 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> lay dim and soft in the hazy light; pleasant after breakfast; my companions were an Eskdale or Roxburghshire grazier or shepherd, who alighted at many inns for a glass of whisky; and a fat entirely ignorant Yorkshire cockney, voracious of salmon, and furnished extensively with private edibles,&#x2014;a totally ignorant man, staring wide-eyed over &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the Highlands&#x201C;: an ancient woman rode with us some miles, an Eskdale or other such grazier&#x2019;s widow (as I fancied), going some &#x201C;picturesque <hi rend="italic">tour</hi>&#x201C;: sad people all; I myself sat by the Driver, and except some service to the old woman, whose look and accent rather touched me, held my peace, looking around and within. At Blair Athol<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 18 mi. NNW of Dunkeld.</note> the old woman got down to wait for a son-in-law (as one could gather); and here my prior knowledge of the country ended, and all <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi> of ditto along with it. Wild bare moor, growing ever wilder, no mountains either to speak of, and the rocky Garry<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >After Struan, 4 mi. W of Blair Atholl, the road, running along the river Garry, ascends steeply the wild Glen Garry.</note> not better than many a Galloway burn; the scene altogether was not better than that about Crook Inn and Moffat-wards,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Moffat and the Crook Inn are on the old high road from Dumfries to Edinburgh.</note> to which it bore some resemblance in fact. Finally the top waters of Tay were reached,&#x2014;Dalna-spiedel<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dalnaspidal, &#x201C;field of the hospice,&#x201C; lies in a bleak situation at 1,422 ft.</note> where those mighty hunters at Linlathen had been;&#x2014;and the &#x201C;Truine,&#x201C; tributary of the Spey began to testify that we were now in Invernessshire. Hitherto all had gone well, or no worse than anticipation; but from this point matters began rather to decline. At the Ashburton &#x201C;Bothy,&#x201C; a bare new Farm-house (to appearance, Hunting cot, in fact) very bare, unfurnished-looking and near the road, no face shewed itself, except one within window; a coarse man&#x2019;s in the act of being <hi rend="italic">washed:</hi> the Coachman said, their carriage came almost daily down there, but today there was none;&#x2014;I had to do the other eleven miles therefore, with little prospect but that of meeting strange &#x201C;gunner-bodies,&#x201C; and diminished <pb id="pg-24-212" n="24:212"/>prospects of the one thing desirable, repose. About 2 o&#x2019;clock, they shewed me &#x201C;Glen Truine House,&#x201C; a rather foolish-looking turretted diminutive-pretentious, grey granite House, standing half a mile off, on a <hi rend="italic">shelf</hi> among the Hills to the left; a scene really not unlike the Crook; for Spey and Truine join here, and the country is rather an undulated plain, or very <hi rend="italic">broad</hi> valley, with no high Hills but one near by: a bare country, for the rest, and by no means a garden of Eden in any aspect whatever! The &#x201C;gillie that was to wait for me&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">was</hi> by no means waiting; he &#x201C;mistook the time,&#x201C; nothing but solitary bare moor was waiting: I took the next cottage, left my goods there; walked, found nobody (as usual): in brief. Oh Goody, Goody, it was 4 o&#x2019;clock before I actually found landlord, 4&#xBD; landlady (I walking all the while with no refection but <hi rend="italic">cigars</hi>); 5 before I could get hold of my luggage; and <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> (after vain attempts at sleep, amid noises as of a sacked city) before any nourishment (for which indeed I had no appetite at all) was ministered to me.

<p>I am just about turning my face homewards&#x2014; Tomorrow I go to Haddington again&#x2014;this time with my name on my luggage, and all my personalities openly worn&#x2014;I shall remain there till Thursday and should like a few lines from you before I go further&#x2014;but if you have not time to write at once, have a letter for me at Liverpool on Monday the 11th<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mon. was <date when="1849-09-10">10 Sept.</date></note>&#x2014;I shall be at</p>

<p>I am too much <hi rend="small-caps">worried</hi> just in these days for writing leisurely letters, besides having been knocked about like a human shuttlecock&#x2014;and now a&#x2014;wasp(!) has put the finishing stroke to my inefficiency by stinging my right hand in the most brutal manner!&#x2014;of course <hi rend="italic">the wasp died of it</hi> on the spot&#x2014;but, after 24 hours <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am still in pain, and my finger in a poultice.</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>The day before yesterday you got a hurried fragment of a Letter, the Post interrupting me; and now today, in a few words, I will send you the sequel.&#x2014; I got no dinner that day till <hi rend="italic">past 8;</hi> and as a consequence, had next to no sleep that night; whereby, when the light broke yesterday morning, my prospects were none of the brightest! I had in fact a very sickly, solitary and dispirited day; and wrote to Jane a very lugubrious Letter; but happily being left almost the whole day alone, I picked up some sleep in my own cell here in spite of noises; and by judicious management generally, I got a <hi rend="italic">good sleep</hi> last night; so that today, the weather also being bright and beautiful, and my company having all gone into the Hills, I feel very much recovered; and have no doubt I shall do well now. I have had a considerable solitary ride (one of the worst of <foreign><hi rend="italic">garrons</hi></foreign> [nags] in appearance, but sure-footed, willing, and steady at the jogtrot); I have had a quiet smoke in the garden since, and also again a bit of sleep; I am to have my dinner at five instead of eight: and so, in general, I hope to have a better time for the future here. But on the whole it seems to me, a <foreign><hi rend="italic">gliff</hi></foreign> [glimpse] <hi rend="italic">of the place will do;</hi> and so soon as I can fairly reckon my visit <hi rend="italic">accomplished</hi>, and take myself to the Southward again, it will be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> course for me.</p>
<p>This &#x201C;House&#x201C; is a new grey granite one, with turrets and <foreign>gimcracks</foreign>; but it is by no means useful in proportion to its promise: add to which it is <pb id="pg-24-217" n="24:217"/><hi rend="italic">crowded</hi> to the ridge-tile, nearly thrice as many people as are good for it; and the accommodation, even for favoured guests like myself, is by no means very exquisite! My little Cell, where I now am, will scarcely <hi rend="italic">hold</hi> my trunks and me; of drawers, bath &#x26;c there is no vestige; and one sometimes does not get hot water &#x201C;because there are not jugs enough, Sir!&#x201C; However, some are going tomorrow (good speed to them!); and before the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the week, only Milnes and a Nephew (of Lord A&#x2019;s)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Either Lord Bath or Humphrey Mildmay.</note> will be here: good fellows both, with whom it will be easier to live a little! My next neighbour, &#x201C;Lord Canning&#x201C; (son of Canning), even <hi rend="italic">snores</hi> a little on occasion: how his Wife stands it I cannot say; but the quality is not recommendable here. He and his are to go &#x201C;about Friday&#x201C;; another peer and peeress, a Lord Sidney, a fat dull haughty-looking, but on the whole, honest and well conditioned man, whose Wife is a Paget, pale, beautiful, and high-bred, but without great <hi rend="italic">wit</hi> of any kind:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1849-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, that he knew Lord and Lady Sydney and had &#x201C;seen Lord &#x26; Lady Canning at the Duke of Buccleuch&#x2019;s in Naples. They are all very idle people. Lady Canning seemed clever. She is some relation to Lady Clare.&#x201C;</note> they are to go in a few days more; and Milnes does not <hi rend="italic">come</hi> till Friday. The departure of the Peer of the realm makes an immensity of room: so many flunkies Lady&#x2019;s-maids &#x26;c are in his train.&#x2014; The place, for the rest, is overflowed with &#x201C;Gillies&#x201C; so-called; a raw-boned set of <foreign>hallanshakers</foreign> [ragged fellows], who assist in hunting, every one of whom leads a ragged <foreign>garron</foreign> (like the one I have just been on), a <hi rend="italic">work</hi>-horse in peat or ploughing time, but equal to carrying a Lordship on the moors when game-time arrives,&#x2014;the wages are 5/ a day for <foreign>gillie</foreign> and <foreign>garron</foreign> united. On the whole, it is a wondrous-looking life; and the thought that anybody should leave a rural palace in the South, and pay &#xa3;500 or &#xa3;1000 for two months of an adventure like this,&#x2014;might justly fill one with astonishment! But &#x201C;changes are lightsome&#x201C;; weary are the lives of rich men that require such a change.&#x2014; Our Ladies &#x201C;sketch&#x201C; sitting on blocks of granite, and looking out for &#x201C;effects&#x201C; upon the distant mountains. Today they are all off on a visit to the westward, a place called Laggan, where certain Marquises and the like are settled: nothing but Miss Emily Baring, a solitary sketcher down below, and I here on the second-floor back, are left about these premises just now. I have got Lyell&#x2019;s Book on America; and there are three or more Newspapers daily, which however seem to contain almost nothing but the &#x201C;Bermondsey Murder,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1849-08-17">17 Aug.</date> Patrick O&#x2019;Connor, a customs exciseman and a bachelor of ca. 50 years old of Mile End who engaged in moneylending, was found brutally murdered in Bermondsey, a district S of the Thames adjoining Southwark. He had been shot through the head and his legs and arms tied to his body, which was covered with lime and so discolored as to be almost unrecognizable. Maria Manning, b. Rue, known to be friendly with O&#x2019;Connor, was arrested in Edinburgh, <date when="1849-08-21">21 Aug.</date>, in possession of money and other articles of O&#x2019;Connor&#x2019;s and returned to London. Her husband, Frederick George Manning, arrested in Jersey, <date when="1849-08-28">28 Aug.</date>, confessed, blaming his wife, who refused to acknowledge her guilt. The inquest began <date when="1849-08-18">18 Aug.</date> and ended <date when="1849-08-27">27 Aug.</date>, the jury finding that the Mannings had murdered O&#x2019;Connor. After the trial, <date when="1849-10-25">25</date>&#x2013;<date when="1849-10-26">26 Oct.</date>, the Mannings were sentenced to death, the husband accepting the judgment in silence and the wife loudly protesting. Newspapers were full of the lurid details.</note>&#x2014;very poor stuff for the human mind to diet upon. This will do for a <pb id="pg-24-218" n="24:218"/>description of my posture here; you have only to fancy the country an open upland moor, of hilly surface, intersected by the Spey and Truine (a bigger <hi rend="italic">Water-of-Milk</hi> each), which join here, Spey from the West, Truin from the South&#x2014;a scene not unlike a mixture of Craigenputtoch and the Crook Inn: no great shakes of a scene!&#x2014;but with the air bright and pure; mountains, sunny or shady, from <hi rend="italic">five</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> diff<hi rend="italic">t</hi> courses or sets of them, rising in the distance, and only one high one, &#x201C;Craig Dhu,&#x201C; close at hand: add scullions, gillies (as above), French cook, flunkies, soubrettes, gun-cases and pointer-dogs: you will find it a sufficiently impressive scene of human wisdom, and conceive that a <hi rend="italic">slightish</hi> dose of it may be expected to suffice for me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane, as I compute, is at this hour in Edinburgh, and may be setting out for Haddington: I have heard nothing but expect a word the day after tomorrow. Our Letters from this quarter, get to Perth <hi rend="italic">in the morning</hi> about 6; and so are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days, I suppose, on the road to you.&#x2014; Tell me how my Mother is; and tell her I have a right good purpose to call again at Scotsbrig as I pass,&#x2014;which need surprise no one, I think! There is some kind of scheme also to take Stirling up at Keir for a day; but that is very uncertain. No harvest here yet; all in the thick of it about Perth, you may tell Jamie, and the crops looking well,&#x2014;all but the potatoes, which are everywhere partially rotted. <closer><salute>My love to every one; and so <foreign>adieu</foreign>, dear Brother.

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>I am actually up in this Highland Country; meaning to pass southward again before long,&#x2014;and within wind of Keir by one possible route, as Farie often assured me when we parted last. Of this latter fact I know almost nothing myself; still less of the other essential question, Whether you will be at Keir about the time of my transit?&#x2014;but I am willing to investigate, as you perceive, and to give myself the chance if there be a good one.</p>
<p>Pray tell me, therefore, where you are to be about the middle and latter half of this month; and also (if you know) what the <hi rend="italic">Perth</hi> and Keir time-tables say of trains by rail,&#x2014;especially whether any conceivable train, or set of arrangements, would save me the horror of sleeping at a Perth Inn; a deliverance for which, of itself, I ought to make a tolerable circuit. But I fear, Not, as to this latter point: our only available Coach out of these parts arrives in Perth rather after 8 p.m., they say; after which there is reported to be no train westward? Say a word of that too, when your hand is in. I was really sorry you could not come to Linlathen; sorry I have so often missed you, if you really want to see <hi rend="italic">me:</hi> in a peaceable environment at Keir, there are plenty of things I could like to say to you and hear from you.</p>
<p>This is not much of a country, except for grouse and other vermin, this Highland scene of English hospitality and sportsmanship! Thank God that you are no killer of grouse, for one thing. The only legitimate &#x201C;hunter&#x201C; that I now know of is, to me evidently, the <hi rend="italic">ratcatcher:</hi> all others, in these countries and epochs, are spurious in very fact, and <hi rend="italic">sports</hi>men, not craftsmen as every man is bound to be!</p>
<p>The Address is as above, &#x201C;Glen Truim&#x201C; &#x26;c with the addition, not quite indispensable perhaps, of &#x201C;The Lord Ashburton&#x2019;s&#x201C; name; a good man (in spite of his grouse) with whom I hope to make you acquainted some day.</p>

<p><salute>It looks a month since we parted at Dundee!</salute> I have had so much of both <hi rend="italic">motional</hi> and &#x201C;emotional culture&#x201C; since that Friday evening! <hi rend="italic">Gootlook</hi> did not <hi rend="italic">follow me into the Orient</hi> by any means<supplied>[,]</supplied> a Headach followed me, and stuck by me till the monday that I left Kirkaldy:&#x2014;of <hi rend="italic">heartach</hi> I will not speak;&#x2014;but there is no reason why I should be silent on the <hi rend="italic">misfortune</hi> I <hi rend="italic">happened</hi> an hour after my return to Fergusdom; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> might have happened to anyone however little of an Egoist&#x2014; I had lain down on the black coffin-like sofa in my bedroom to try what rest, such as could be had under the circumstances, would do for my head; when I felt something like a bluebottle creep inside my hand, shook it off, and oh my!&#x2014;the next instant I was on foot like &#x201C;a mad&#x201C;&#x2014;stung by a wasp!&#x2014; Miss Jessie got the sting out, and admired it thro&#x2019; her glass, and applied, on my own advice, laudnum and honey, but the pain went up to my shoulder and even down my side, and the swelling and inflamation spread so fast all up my arm that Miss Jessie could hardly be hindered from running herself for both a Doctor and a&#x2014;silversmith! the last to <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> a ring that could not be got off&#x2014;but it was my Mothers little pebble ring and I would not suffer it to be cut and neither would I be at the cost of a D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> just yet&#x2014;all that evevening I suffered horribly, in Silence, and all night &#x201C;the trophies of <hi rend="italic">The Wasp</hi> would not let me sleep&#x201C;&#x2014;not one wink&#x2014;however I went next day to Auchtertoul with my hand in a poultice, being still determined to &#x201C;come out of that&#x201C; on Monday and unwilling to go without saying farewell to my poor Uncle, whom it is likely enough I shall never see again&#x2014;on Sunday night the pain was sufficiently abated to let me sleep&#x2014; So I was up to leaving according to programme by the quarter after eight train&#x2014; John and Jessie were up to give me breakfast and see me off&#x2014;and M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Nixon gave me a nice little trunk to <hi rend="italic">facilitate</hi> my packing. They were really very kind the poor Ferguses but somehow or other they are radically uncomfortable people for <hi rend="italic">us</hi> <pb id="pg-24-221" n="24:221"/>to be mixed up with&#x2014;there is something <hi rend="italic">sordid</hi> about them inspite of their &#x201C;good intentions&#x201C;&#x2014;John I take to be at heart downright niggardly!</p>
<p>I got to the Princes Street Station a little before ten&#x2014;and found on enquiry that I could have my luggage taken care of for me on paying the sum of sixpence for booking&#x2014;so I left there everything but my writing case, in which were my jewels and your manuscript&#x2014;and with that I got into a cab having bargained with the cabman for two shillings an hour (I tell you these details for your own guidance in case of your returning by Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>) and drove to Adam Street to Betty<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The old Haddington servant&#x2014;almost from my Jeannie&#x2019;s birth&#x2014;is still living (<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>), one of the venerablest and most faithful of women.

She was on her knees blackleading her grate all in confusion poor soul&#x2014;her little carpet <hi rend="italic">up</hi>, everything topsy turvy&#x2014;a domestic earthquake having been commenced that very morning <hi rend="italic">in preparation for my coming</hi>&#x2014; Miss Anne<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, her aunt.</note> having kindly warned her that she might be &#x201C;all ready&#x201C;&#x2014;but I was too early and so found her all unready&#x2014;only her heart as right as could be&#x2014; Oh dear me how she does love me that woman! and how good and pious hearted she is&#x2014;while I sat on her knee with my arms about her neck and she called me her &#x2018;dear <foreign>bairn</foreign>&#x2019; and looked at me as if she would have made me welcome to her &#x2018;skin&#x2019; I felt as nearly as possible <hi rend="italic">perfectly happy</hi>&#x2014;just fancy that! But I must not get into the details of my visit to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> just now my few days here are so filled up&#x2014;I have not yet seen half the people I wish to see.</p>
<p>She gave me <hi rend="italic">four biscuits</hi> wrapt in her best pockethandkerchief and promised to see me at my Aunts before I left in the evening&#x2014;and then I jumped into my cab again proceded to Clarence Street&#x2014;a kind note received at Kirkaldy from Elizabeth had prepared me for a rather warmer welcome than I had anticipated&#x2014;but not for so warm a one as I got&#x2014;it was a great comfort to me to be so received by my Fathers Sisters however unlike him&#x2014;my heart was opened by their kindness to tell them that it was nothing but apprehension of their bothering me about my soul which had estranged me from them so entirely&#x2014; Anne&#x2019;s reply given with an arch look and tone was very nice&#x2014;&#x201C;indeed Jeanie you need not have been afraid of our setting ourselves to reform <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;it is plain enough that nothing short of God&#x2019;s own grace can do <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;but I wont despair that a time may come tho I am not such a fool as to think that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can hasten it.&#x201C; Anne went out with me and we called for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> George<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Margaret Welsh.</note>&#x2014;not at home&#x2014;at the Stoddarts&#x2014;the Lady in <pb id="pg-24-222" n="24:222"/>the country&#x2014;John petrified looking&#x2014;either hardened into stone or quite stunned at seeing me&#x2014;I could not tell which<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Riddle Stodart (d. <date when="1871-00-00">1871</date>), writer to the signet and notary public, 2 Drummond Pl.; JWC&#x2019;s old suitor; m. <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, Jemima Henrietta Brown (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>); see E.

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Thanks for your little Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-09-03">3 Sept.</date> forwarding letters for TC at Scotsbrig and saying that &#x201C;of course we will all be kind as possible to Jane when she comes.&#x201C;</note> which arrived this morning at breakfast; the first communication I have yet had here. I am truly glad to hear of my Mother&#x2019;s being in her usual way again; and to catch a glimpse of Scotsbrig in general, from over the Hills and far away. Luck be with you all till I come back again!</p>
<p>The black Note, as you perceive, is a melancholy announcement, that of <pb id="pg-24-223" n="24:223"/>poor Mrs Dixon&#x2019;s departure from this world.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Janet Dickson (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>; see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240625-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:94</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1824-06-25">25 June 1824</date></corr></ref>), Edward Irving&#x2019;s sister, d. in Glasgow, <date when="1849-08-29">29 Aug.</date> TC last noted seeing her in London, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>; see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460721-TC-JWC-01"><sic>20:253</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1846-07-21">21 July 1846</date></corr></ref>.</note> I remember her a brilliant bonny lass, from almost my earliest years in Annan; she has had many ups and downs since that, and has now ended it all. Peace, we may believe, is <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, if not to be found on the side of the dim river where we yet linger.</p>
<p>I am left quite alone today, and have the drawing room, and indeed the house, altogether to myself for some hours;&#x2014;plenty of space too for writing, were it not that noises come rather rife from the flunkey region, and still worse that I am but in bad case myself for any epistolary or other exertion. A general party &#x201C;to picnic with the Abercorn people&#x201C; (a proud dull Marquis of the <hi rend="italic">Shuttlerow</hi> kindred)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> &#x201C;on loch Eroch&#x201C;:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Loch Ericht, 15 mi. long.</note> that was the general order of the day; but one Lord, at breakfast time, broke off, preferring &#x201C;to shoot&#x201C;; and I, before breakfast time, had already broken off, being in no case for picnics; having, in fact, got a very nasty <hi rend="italic">lumbago</hi> these two days past, which was made considerably worse yesterday by a sorry wearisome expedition to the same region (8 or 9 miles off), which I hoped might have cleared it away. My sleep, in short, has been carried on &#x201C;under difficulties,&#x201C;&#x2014;the worst <hi rend="italic">room</hi> I have permanently had these twenty years; and the change to a better did not take place &#x201C;yesterday&#x201C; as predicted; but is only taking place today on my renewed demand. The weather, however, is superb and certainly, among the hay and heather, left all to myself, I expect to gain great improvement today, and to be quite set up again tomorrow More than once, in the <foreign><hi rend="italic">wakerife</hi></foreign> [sleepless] hours of night, it has been in my head to take Coach, and come south at once; but when I think of the &#x201C;good intentions&#x201C; of everybody to me, I find that I must <hi rend="italic">finish</hi> my visit, and give it a less unhandsome close than that would be! The more I see of it, the more distracted does this Highland <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gilha&#x2019;ing</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Living in a primitive house in a solitary place; cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340612-TC-MAC-01"><sic>7:207</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1834-06-12">12 June 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> for English people of rank appear to me. The present adventure, Lord Ashburton told me yesterday, costs him about &#xa3;1200; and he admitted, as we drove along together that it was a very stupid business,&#x2014;&#x201C;except in respect of health.&#x201C; I suggested that men really desirous of &#x201C;hunting&#x201C; ought to go to Africa with its lions, to America with its bears and boas, to some place where wild animals really are and stand in need of hunting; whereas here, except it be the catching of rats, there is really no legitimate field for the &#x201C;hunter,&#x201C; and his era is quite done! All this was mildly taken; indeed we had a great deal of serious talk, he and I, as he drove me to and from the scene of adventure (a &#x201C;fishing&#x201C; in Loch Eroch yesterday, futile highly, in which I took no share at all, but lay among the heather in solitude for 3 hours rather); and his L<hi rend="italic">p</hi> <pb id="pg-24-224" n="24:224"/>seems to be full of &#x201C;good resolutions,&#x201C; with which, alas we know what <hi rend="italic">place</hi> is paved! He has awakened a good deal, however, since I came, and a strong word of sense now and then got to hearing again: the other two Lords are radically dull fellows, inclined to eating rather than to thinking; and, what is bad too, are evidently rather afraid of me, and look to their arms when I am in presence. Their Ladies, are unexceptionable, and do better with me,&#x2014;especially the Paget one, a really clever-looking woman, had she been trained to anything! Alas, alas, it is not a joyful view one gets of human things thro&#x2019; this aperture; not joyful,&#x2014;neither will it last long.</p>
<p>The Germans you perceive have been holding a <foreign><hi rend="italic">Festmahl</hi></foreign> [banquet] over Goethe&#x2019;s Centenniversary; but it seems to have succeeded well nowhere; not even Humboldt&#x2019;s heavy eloquence could carry it thro&#x2019; at Berlin;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A correspondent to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1849-09-03">3 Sept.</date>, reported from Berlin, <date when="1849-08-29">29 Aug.</date>, the celebration of the centennial of Goethe&#x2019;s birth, <date when="1849-08-28">28 Aug.</date> In the afternoon there were songs, readings from Goethe&#x2019;s poems, and a lecture on Weimar during Goethe&#x2019;s early days there, at which the lecturer had to sit down because of the noise. In the evening F. H. Alexander von Humboldt read his intro. to a forthcoming <hi rend="italic">Goethe Album</hi> initiated by the Princess of Prussia. There followed two more lectures, the circulation of poems written for the occasion, and much drinking and singing. &#x201C;On the whole the celebration &#x2026; was a failure; it wanted life and enthusiasm, &#x2026; order and preparation.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;and on the whole, to Goethe one may say as to others, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">It</hi> can do thi&#x2019; naither ill na guid!&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Dear Brother, I know not why I should scribble all this stuff about what hardly interests me, and can hardly interest anybody. It were much better that I went about my business; stript inner flannels, and set off on a two-hours walk, as my intention is. I have still a Note to write; apprising Stirling of my willingness to try for a meeting with him at Keir if the times will answer. The shifting of my things to a new room deprives me of my own proper pen, and this was the best I could find or manufacture here. Enough of it, enough! I expect to hear from Jane tomorrow if all have gone well with her; I have written twice. <closer><salute>Take care of my Mother, and give my love to all. Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>Many thanks, my Dearest;</salute> your Letter delivered me from many anxieties this morning. By one of the innumerable irregularities of this establishment there seemed to be at Post-time (9&#xBD; a.m.) no Letter at all for me today; and I was sitting at my <hi rend="italic">lukewarm</hi> breakfast thinking in silence what could be the meaning of it, when the careless (or more properly the care<hi rend="italic">worn</hi> and almost heartbroken) Flunkey of the morning brought it in for me! That is not yet an hour ago: and now we are all agog again for some expedition to &#x201C;Craig Dhu&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Craigdhuloch, high cliffs overlooking Loch Dhuloch.</note> or I know not what,&#x2014;chaotic miserably uncomfortable cold and hungry expeditions they all are;&#x2014;and at any moment, if they do not kindly happen to forget me, I am liable to be <hi rend="italic">called:</hi> let me therefore haste, and speed you off a word while time is! For nobody can say either <hi rend="italic">when</hi> we shall go, or in what manner, or whether we shall be home in time for the Post or not. Circumstances little pleasing, any of them, to the rational mind! If I do not write <hi rend="italic">this</hi> instant, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> being already lost, you will not even on Sunday hear from me at Scotsbrig.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s last Letter, I mean the one <hi rend="italic">to</hi> him, represented me in a state of <hi rend="italic">lumbago:</hi> that is not yet entirely gone; but it has been in a bearable state ever since that day; I have got a big waste room too, and in spite of noises and turmoils contrive to get nightly in instalments some six hours or so of sleep. But on the whole my visit prospers as <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> as could be wished.

<salute>Dear Stirling,</salute>
<p>I am sorrier than perhaps you will believe at this refusal of the obstinate times and distances to meet. I leave this place tomorrow; and as there is now no object in loitering, I make direct to Edinburgh, whence after a day with an old noteworthy Friend, Lord Jeffrey, I go by the Caledonian Line to my Mother&#x2019;s in Annandale, for a week; after which, by the same swift conveyance, I have to project myself at once to Chelsea, and there endeavour to <hi rend="italic">ruminate</hi> all this rough food my eyes have eaten these three months past! I am really quite sated of seeing,&#x2014;or, as we Scotch call it, <hi rend="italic">stalled</hi> or &#x201C;sta&#x2019;ed.&#x201C; Enough, enough.</p>
<p>At Cawder, with pipes, and a licence of speech or silence, I could have done excellently well beside you, with the other two or without them. Lord Napier I have never seen; but, for the sake of his name, if there were nothing else, should at any time be very glad to see him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Francis Napier (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1898-00-00">98</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19752"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), 9th Baron Napier, later 1st Baron Ettrick of Ettrick, diplomat. The Napiers were a famous military and naval family.</note> More acquaintance with yourself also is a thing that I actually desire, singular as it may seem! In fact I am very much disappointed at this failure;&#x2014;and to make some amends, must promise myself a success in some similar enterprise before much time go by. If the Powers be propitious,&#x2014;alas, if I had but got my next Book written, and could conscientiously plead need of rest, I would so gladly go with you, it seems to me, to ride sure-footed ponies, eat innocent mutton, smoke tobacco, and talk honestly what came uppermost, for a couple of weeks in poor old Scotland once again! We shall see, we shall see.</p>
<p>In the mean time, come to me at Chelsea whenever you are in London, <pb id="pg-24-228" n="24:228"/>and disposed to do a kindness to your fellow creature; such, I think, will really be the effect produced there.</p>
<p>Mrs C. is in Annandale at this moment; or perhaps crossing the Border, towards Liverpool and home. Indeed if you stay till the 27<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, you may possibly enough find us both in Chelsea if you call. For the present, <foreign>Adieu</foreign>. The day is of the wettest; damp wind moaning thro&#x2019; bad carpentry; Strathspey undergoing vapour-bath, and Corryarrick blotted out from the list of mountains.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Strath Spey, a valley in NE Scotland.

I mean in Jesus Christ&#x2019;s&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;Oh Ay,&#x201C; said dear Betty&#x2014;&#x201C;Christ has care of my <foreign>Bairn</foreign> <hi rend="italic">a</hi>wheres [everywhere]&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">even on the railway!</hi> and a great comfort that is for me to think, now that she <foreign>gangs sae muckle be</foreign> [so much by] them&#x201C;! But of all that some quiet evening at Chelsea&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have to tell you now that a note from Elizabeth lying for me here stated <pb id="pg-24-229" n="24:229"/>that she continued better, but not strong yet&#x2014;and that her Sister was still with her and would stay till I came&#x2014;a great luck that this Sister happened to be out of place just now&#x2014; I fancy the poor girl had been in a very dangerous way before we heard of her illness&#x2014;now that I know of this sister being with her, I feel in less breathless haste to fly to her rescue&#x2014;can yield to Jeanies wish, which is indeed an obligation of <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> on me, with a good grace, that I would stay here over Sunday to give her my advice about Helen&#x2014;she (Jeanie) being to arrive from Auchtertoul tomorrow night, to look after poor Helen, who has been very ill indeed, and I am afraid has a disease on her that may end fatally sooner than any of them are aware&#x2014;</p>
<p>I was dreadfully shocked with her <hi rend="italic">shape</hi> and emaciated look&#x2014;still she can go out for exercise and protests that she is getting better&#x2014;but there is death in her face&#x2014; We wish John to examine into her case&#x2014;but she is extremely nervous about him&#x2014;and it must be gone about <hi rend="italic">delicately</hi>&#x2014;when Jeanie comes&#x2014; I am glad dear John came with me&#x2014; When I have talked with Jeanie I can be of no farther use here&#x2014;only a trouble in fact&#x2014; So on Monday I mean to go to Manchester to make amends to Geraldine for the vexation about me caused her by that foolish Harriet Martineau<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Gossip of some kind&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>); see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491110-JWC-JAC-01">JWC to JAC, [<date when="1849-11-10">10 Nov.</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;and to London <hi rend="italic">straight</hi> next day that is my present programme,&#x2014;if it receive any modification I will write again to Scotsbrig where I hope this will find you safe and <hi rend="italic">slept</hi>&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> get as nice porrige and nice coffee and nice everything, with such a seasoning of human kindness as I got there; you will need no more pity.</p>
<p>John went out with <hi rend="italic">Betsy</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Elizabeth Paulet, home to Seaforth.</note> last night, there being no bed for him here unless he had chosen to sleep in a little one in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> room which I told him he was welcome to do if he liked!! but he declined&#x2014;he promised to come today about one and stay till night&#x2014;and tomorrow Betsy is to bring the carriage and take me to Seaforth for a few hours just to satisfy her that I have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> &#x201C;registered a vow in Heaven&#x201C; never to set my foot in her house again&#x2014; But a few hours will be enough of <hi rend="italic">that</hi>&#x2014;she looks to be more than ever in a state of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mild delirium</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now I must end and go to Helen&#x2014;</p>
<p>Kindest love to your Mother and all of them and tell Isabella I forgot the woodruff&#x2014;and she must stuff some into your carpet bag<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The herb would &#x201C;sweeten&#x201C; the bag.</note>&#x2014;</p>

Milnes &#x26; Lord A. had returned late the evening before, from a visit to Inverness, to Peel and other notabilities; Mildmay as well as I, tho&#x2019; by a route of his own, went away that Thursday morning; the fluctuating Party at Glen Truim was reduced to Milnes &#x26; Lady Grey (a wearisome official Lady); but was to be reinforced by Charteris, by Rutherford,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Rutherfurd (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">1854</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24368"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), lord advocate for Scotland, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1851-00-00">51</date>; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310822-TC-JWC-01"><sic>5:355</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-22">22 Aug. 1831</date></corr></ref>.</note> and others, whom it was interesting <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to meet. A weary, mad world this, and no mistake!</p>
<p>The Inverness Coach had been once overset (with many broken bones), and once nearly drowned, in an overflooded Brook, with all skins wetted, in the early part of this week; so when I waited for it, about midday, by the shelter of a small scraggy wood, at the land end, it came up with diminished capabilities (a <hi rend="italic">smaller</hi> borrowed Coach, in fact), and no seat for me but the end of a plank, sticking from below the Guard, and depending on his weight for not canting one into the road, a very precarious-looking seat in the wild gusty day among the moors! However, I got up without scruple; effected some improvements by means of a couple of big nails at Dalwhinny;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At the head of Glen Truim.</note> <pb id="pg-24-232" n="24:232"/>and so, in result came along with tolerable success thro&#x2019; the wild heather solitudes, with their dashing streams and loud blustery winds, and got to Perth and an abominable gas-lighted Bagman Inn about nine of the clock, unscathed, and ready enough for tea, having dined on sandwiches and whisky only, with Killiecrankie for dumb waiter as I came along. Oh the disgusts of gas and bagmanhood! I took to the streets and smoked in solitude. My bed too was French; and hardly had I flung myself in right weariness and sleepiness upon it, when, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Brm, Glrr</hi>&#x2014;r!&#x201C; the steady hum of a neighbour snoring, below, above or I could not tell where, saluted me; and the hope of sleep fled far! Sorrow on all unhandsome noses;&#x2014;in fact I had little sleep; and Boots too roused me, by mistake, at 5 instead of a &#xBC; to 6.&#x2014; The morning, however, was beautiful; the country, with its yellow corn and shady woods, and diligent innocent Scotch creatures (I left <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> too, no comrade in my carriage) was quite an idyl to look upon. I drove past Fergusdom, close, but &#x201C;too early&#x201C; for breakfast; disembarked in Princes Street, and drove, self and luggage, direct for Craigcrook. Alas, poor Jeffreydom was all in distress; most of them sickly before, and just yesterday poor little Jeffrey and Mrs had <hi rend="italic">both</hi> tripped themselves over a rope, while walking about Newhaven; which made a bad job of it indeed! However, Mrs Empson,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charlotte (b. <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), the Jeffreys&#x2019; da., m. to William Empson (<date when="1791-00-00">1791</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8800"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18380718-TC-JAC-01"><sic>10:127</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1838-07-18">18 July 1838</date></corr></ref>).</note> just at breakfast, gave me some tea; and the others sent pressing messages that I was to stay and talk with them: of attempting to lodge there in these circumstances there was clearly no possibility. The poor little Duke<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duke of Craigcrook, the Carlyles&#x2019; nickname for Francis Jeffrey.</note> looked very feeble; his talk was of friendly sound, but feeble likewise, and hardly to be kept from falling into the old strain of &#x201C;content<hi rend="italic">t</hi> with common things&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c, <foreign>ach Gott!</foreign> Mrs E. almost shocked me, so ghastly strange and old had she grown; and the children seemed other tha<supplied>[n]</supplied> lovely, very strange Empsonisms, upon my honour! About 2 o&#x2019;clock, no porter being readily procurable Jeffrey himself undertook to drive both luggage and me to the Caledonian Railway, where, after really friendly farewell from Mrs Jeffrey, he did finally set me down and leave me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It was their last meeting, described in TC&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 338&#x2013;39 with much the same comments on Charlotte Empson (&#x201C;abstruse, timid, enthusiastic,&#x201C; &#x201C;perhaps jealous,&#x201C; and &#x201C;a morbidly shy kind of creature&#x201C; with the &#x201C;air of a spoiled child&#x201C;) and duly pbd. in Froude&#x2019;s edn. because, as he told her, he thought she was dead.

No Mackenzie<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Mackenzie, 9 Doune Terr.</note> was at home, no John Hunter, no nobody;&#x2014;I rushed <pb id="pg-24-233" n="24:233"/>therefore into a Tavern of &#x201C;hot joints&#x201C;; devoured some morsel of food; and set myself into the Carlisle Train, which without other than insignificant adventures conducted me safe hither, to a bowl of porridge and good sleep last night about 9&#xBD; or 10; and so my travels&#x2019; history<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> 1.3.</note> can end for the present. Your missing Letter will perhaps come tomorrow; from me thro&#x2019; John (by this same post) you will perhaps hear tomorrow. Long I do not design to stay here; and my course now, unless I can conveniently deflect for one night to Neuberg&#x2019;s, is straight. They are all pretty well here; and retain a lively sense of poor Goody&#x2019;s presence among them.</p>
<p>What you say of poor Cousin Helen is abundantly afflicting! By all means wait till you exhaust what of help lies in you in such a case. If John can do any medical service, certainly he will be willing: certainly too, by one means or other, a clear understanding of the case, medically speaking, ought to be arrived at, without delay. Poor Helen, poor little soul!</p>
<p>You do only well to keep <hi rend="italic">away</hi>, quite clear away from Pauletdom, so long as it is engaged in its present course of &#x201C;bursting blood-vessels,&#x201C; and the like: away from it you, away!</p>
<p>I will write to Manchester, if I have the smallest news to give, even sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> time be scarcer than it is like to be. <closer><salute>For the present, <foreign>adieu</foreign> Dear Goody,&#x2014;and Gootluck go with thee.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Isabella, by way of exonerating herself from a promise of her own, begs me to write a Letter to you in her stead: a useful counter-change of activities, which I am bound to indulge her in; she herself having already been very busy in various exertions for my behoof again since I arrived here.&#x2014; By this same post I write also to Jane, whose <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Letter I have just got; but to her the Liverpool Post-Office will yield nothing tomorrow, I think, tho&#x2019; to you at Seaforth it will: which is another argument, if other were wanted, for writing to you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-234" n="24:234"/>I came to Scotsbrig last night (Friday) about half past 9 p.m. or later; not anticipated, but cordially welcomed; no conveyance but one&#x2019;s feet,&#x2014; Minto, however, took charge of the Luggage, and at 10 this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi> it was all here. A light shone from our Mother&#x2019;s window, as I approached last night,&#x2014;stalking thro&#x2019; the country like a ghost;&#x2014;all the world was not yet in bed; Isabella made me a jolly <hi rend="italic">bowl of porridge</hi>, upon the strength of which I slept soundly, and so today am very quiet and well; right glad that I am got so far towards home again. At Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> I found nobody whatever but the Jeffries, and them in a very feeble way, clearly <hi rend="italic">not</hi> in need of strangers quartered on them; so, as Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> otherwise seemed empty, I said good-night to it, and bowled myself away.</p>
<p>Everything seems pretty right here; our good Mother looks quite in her usual average of health; Jamie too makes no special complaint even when questioned, but professes still to be <hi rend="italic">a little</hi> thought weaker than when this ill turn overtook him: he is decidedly of mind that his ailment will never mend of itself; and seems to agree with me that you should go with him to Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> directly after the harvest is done, and have the proper operation performed. It will give me great satisfaction indeed to hear that it is done; and really it strikes me in my ignorance that delays, continuing the irritation &#x26;c, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> prove detrimental one knows to what degree, but cannot in any degree prove beneficial. Pray think of this.</p>
<p>The &#x201C;dying Cow,&#x201C; I am to inform you, has by some oblique path &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">warstled</hi></foreign> [staggered] down to the bottom of the Linn,&#x201C; and is there standing among bushes waiting its end,&#x2014;poor dumb-creature, nobler of mind than many a speaking one, I think! For the rest, the Harvest-weather is mainly good; crops fast getting housed about Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and in the Perthshire region; and Jamie&#x2019;s three Mowers here are all busy in their calling; everything around them nearly ripe.&#x2014; I think of getting home <hi rend="italic">soon;</hi> straight road,&#x2014;or if I knew a good course to Nottingham, perhaps with a bend in by that for one night. Jane will probably only precede me by a few days. A Letter from you here is very welcome as you know. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>These long wanderings of mine having at length brought me thus far on my way homeward, and being now about to terminate in a swift course <pb id="pg-24-235" n="24:235"/>from this to Chelsea, I naturally remind myself of Nottingham, and wish to know, before starting, what possibilities there are for me in that quarter. Mrs C. is to reach home tomorrow, from Manchester; my precise day of departure is not yet fixed; but it must very certainly be soon; and unless, I turn aside for a day and night to take a sight of you home with me, the journey, once entered upon, will be accomplished at one stretch,&#x2014;in some 12 or 11 hours, if I mistake not.</p>
<p>Pray tell me, therefore, first whether you are at home; secondly, if you can, what possibility of route there is; especially <hi rend="italic">how</hi> a steam traveller can reach Nottingham from this place in one day,&#x2014;if he can at all. If he cannot, I will rather put off my visit till after getting home; but I suppose he can, and that you without much difficulty can discover and indicate the method. I have no <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi>, but you doubtless have one; far worse, I cannot endure the study and deciphering of <hi rend="italic">Bradshaw</hi>, and therefore do in all such cases apply rather to charitable friends. My locality here is adjacent to the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Line</hi>, station &#x201C;Ecclefechan,&#x201C; or still better &#x201C;Kirtle Bridge&#x201C;; I dislike rising very early, and cannot sleep at all (especially of late) in Inns: these are the terms of the problem; on which please say a word to enlighten me, while the decision yet hangs, and a very inviting possibility has not yet become impossible. My Brother is now in Liverpool, went so far in escort of my Wife a few days ago; I myself have been in the Highlands &#x26;c since Ireland; and feel now thoroughly <hi rend="italic">sated</hi> with travelling.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With many kind regards, and the hope of soon hearing, or perhaps even seeing,&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>
<p><closer><salute>Yours always truly /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name></p>

<p><salute>Welcome to your own home again, my Dear!</salute> I judge, after best calculation, it will be surer to aim thither than towards Manchester today:&#x2014;and yet I do not know; perhaps you <hi rend="italic">might</hi> get this before setting out from Green Heys, and it would be a kind of comfort during the long drive? One would like to do <hi rend="italic">both</hi> ways! Before the end of the sheet, I must decide upon one of them; a truly important decision indeed.</p>
<p>Your Letter from Glen Truim, forwarded I judge on Friday last and readdressed <pb id="pg-24-236" n="24:236"/>in Lady A&#x2019;s hand, arrived yesterday; this with a <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The weekly periodical sent to TC by Frederick Lucas; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420801-TC-ECH-01"><sic>15:3</sic><corr>TC to ECH, <date when="1842-08-01">1 Aug. 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note> was my sum of correspondence since I arrived here, at my still port of refuge, where it is a blessing to have none but indispensable correspondence. I am indeed lazy beyond measure; I sleep and smoke, and would fain do nothing else at all. If they would but let me sit alone in this room, I think I should be tempted to stay long in it; &#x201C;forgetting and forgotten&#x201C;; so inexpressibly wearied is my poor body and poor soul. Ah me, people ought not to be angry at me, people ought to let me alone,&#x2014;perhaps they would, if they rightly understood what I was doing and suffering in this Life-pilgrimage at times; but they cannot, the good friendly souls,&#x2014;ah me! Or rather, Courage! Courage! The rough billows and cross winds shall not best us yet; not at this late stage of the voyage, and harbour almost within sight!&#x2014; The fact is, my poor Goody, thou seest I am very weary; and the more <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> I get, I seem to grow the wearier.</p>
<p>Yesterday I took a ride on Jamie&#x2019;s shelty, by Waterbeck and the Kirtlebridge region: the lanes all silent, fields full of stooks, and Burnswark and the everlasting Hills all looking quite clear upon me. Jog-jog, so went the little lazy shelty at its own slow will; and Death seemed to me almost all one with Life, and Eternity much the same as Time.&#x2014; Jamie attended me on a second constitutional excursion, he riding I walking, at a later and quite dark hour. Poor Jamie is himself very far from well just now; and he has hard losses within the last year. Other work, except eating my victuals, I did not do yesterday at all.</p>
<p>Today I have written to ask Neuberg what is the route by Nottingham: a rest somewhere between this and London would not be unwelcome to me; but I do not much think Nottingham will prove much nearer me than London itself. We shall see. On the whole, as the old song says, &#x201C;I wish I were at home again, at home again!&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> Sleeping in my brown bed again;&#x2014;above all things, if that were possible, at some kind of profitable work again. Oh help me, do not hinder me!&#x2014;</p>
<p>You shall have money directly; in fact may have it any day by writing: but if you do not ask for it, I will bring the Letter in my own pocket, as much the same result, with less trouble to you.&#x2014; I know not if I ought to go to Dumfries one other time, and settle various little things; but unless I grow <hi rend="italic">livelier</hi>, the temptation to sit here doing nothing all my time, will be irresistable. Oh Goody, Goody, how lazy I am! God send thee well home, my dear little woman,&#x2014;a good little woman too, and the best of women in several very essential respects! My Mother is here, sitting by me in a kind <pb id="pg-24-237" n="24:237"/>of silent impatience to get me out into the bright still air, &#x201C;to <hi rend="italic">ask</hi> for Letters as well as leave them&#x201C;;&#x2014;air I do believe is the best element just now. <closer><salute>Oh write; a word instantly when you arrive at Chelsea. And take care of yourself; and be good, and all shall be well! Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>
<ps><p>I decide to try Manchester with this, after all. Kind regards to Geraldine therefore, and <foreign><hi rend="italic">bon voyage</hi></foreign> to you, and speedy meeting to us both!</p></ps>

<p><salute>Dear Jenny,&#x2014;</salute>My Mother wishes me to a<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> write a word to you, to say how glad we all were to get your Note on Sunday with the assurance that you were got well again, the former news having somewhat alarmed our good Mother on that subject. All is well here, or in its usual state of health, my Mother especially brisk; harvest is going on rapidly in the bright weather,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">five</hi> scythes going today, and hopes that the whole affair of cutting will be over about the end of the week. Some <hi rend="italic">cows</hi> unfortunately are ill of the epidemic; and the potatoe-rot here is making rapid progress <hi rend="italic">below</hi> ground as well as above. I am unable to tell you how the new dress fits, for indeed it has never yet been tried on; I can only say it looks well, and no doubt is entertained about its suiting.</p>
<p>I arrived here on Friday night about 10 o&#x2019;clock having come with little delay at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, direct from my Highland quarters; I am glad enough to be at complete rest here ever since. Jane, along with John, as you know, had gone the day before to Liverpool, whence we have repeatedly heard from them, all well: Jane is to be at home, if her purpose hold, this very evening about 11 o&#x2019;clock; John reports himself as likely to return to Scotsbrig about</p>
<p>the end of this week, or beginning of next.&#x2014; My own day of departure is not fixed yet; but it is to <hi rend="italic">be soon:</hi> you shall hear farther when or before it takes place. My Mother has been speculating about another drive to Dumfries first: but I shudder at all &#x201C;drives&#x201C; or locomotions, or exertions of any kind; the Pony too is said to be rather in tired case;&#x2014;I cannot promise to come, but should like if I could. Tell Jean I found her two excellent Kilmarnocks<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wool nightcaps.</note> here; and accepted them with gratitude.&#x2014; The Ecclefechan sheevers (or &#x201C;lifters&#x201C;),<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harvesters who follow the scythers and make the sheaves.</note> with whom this goes, are come in for supper, so I <pb id="pg-24-238" n="24:238"/>must end. <closer><salute>With my regards to Assembly street, and my love to you all, Your affectionate Brother</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter came duly; thanks for it. I have today got a Note from Jane at Manchester, indicating that you had kindly gone with her so far yesterday, and were off again in the evening while she wrote,&#x2014;or was all this &#x201C;Monday&#x201C; on your part! At any rate Jane does not go homeward till today; and tonight, we do at last hope, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> half of these extensive locomotions will come to a pause. Jane is very grateful for your kindness to her; which she does not specify the details of, but pronounces to have been exemplary.</p>
<p>I have a Note from Neuberg today; offering to &#x201C;meet me at Derby,&#x201C; but seeming to expect that I shall refuse; which, beyond dispute, especially after what I now know from you and Jane, I will do, and so give up Nottingham at once and wholly. Thank Mrs Paulet for her hospitable offer: but say that neither must Liverpool now tempt me; my one advisable course is clearly some train of the Caledonian which will carry me at once to Chelsea. I have not yet studied the Railway Bill, much less appointed my day; but such is clearly the method, and about the time you talk of for returning hither,&#x2014;end of this week or beginning of the next,&#x2014;I think of getting it executed. I have had <hi rend="italic">three</hi> nights of excellent sleep here; more sleep than I have had in me at once for 3 months back. I have the idlest stillest days, quite a treasure to my lazy mind: alas, such a life cannot last long but it is a thing to be thankful for while it does continue.</p>
<p>Jamie&#x2019;s harvest progresses rapidly; he has now <hi rend="italic">five</hi> scythes at work; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> is ripe: he hopes to terminate at about Saturday night, if the weather hold. The inclosed Note, which I see is from Erskine, seems to have arrived <hi rend="italic">before</hi> I came hither, but by some unaccountable mistake, for which Isabella is truly sorry, she had stowed it aside as a Note received <hi rend="italic">from</hi> you, and only yesternight late produced it as what it was! Doubtless an invitation from Erskine: it seems to me you should try to combine that journey with Jamie&#x2019;s business, which perhaps you will find when you come back <pb id="pg-24-239" n="24:239"/>ought not to be delayed longer than is inevitable now.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle reported, <date when="1849-09-07">7 Sept.</date>, that James Carlyle was threatened with another fistula and kept to the house; by <date when="1849-10-01">1 Oct.</date>, that he hoped to take James to Edinburgh for an operation but the harvest prevented this; and, <date when="1849-10-03">3 Oct.</date>, that he refused Erskine&#x2019;s invitation to Linlathen but hoped to see him in Edinburgh in <date when="1849-10-00">mid-Oct</date>.</note>&#x2014; Today farther, a big long Letter, seemingly a Pamphlet from somebody, but folded as a Letter with three blue stamps, has come to your address; but in these circumstances we leave it waiting here. I meant however to send you &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>&#x201C; No. 3, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is better than N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1 (N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2. did not come to me at all): but probably you have little time to read it where you now are.</p>
<p>Mother is very well,&#x2014;and well affected towards you always. The water-barrel, which yields me daily an ample tub for bathing, has tinctured its water with a perceptible flavour of <hi rend="italic">palled wine</hi>, not pleasant to the nostril while using it! The poor old Cow is still alive, down in a bottom near that stone chasm where I have sometimes bathed; nobody will kill her for my urging, &#x201C;they have no gun&#x201C; they say.</p>
<p>I hope you will be here before I go, or that we shall meet somewhere or other on the route. Enough for this day. I am reading the little <hi rend="italic">Voyage d&#x2019;Espagne.</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Antoine de Brunel, <hi rend="italic">Voyage de&#x2019;Espagne, curieux, historique et politique, fait en l&#x2019;ann&#xE9;e <date when="1655-00-00">1655</date></hi> (Paris, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>), as shown by TC&#x2019;s ref. to its being &#x201C;of Louis XIV&#x2019;s time&#x201C; (<date when="1643-00-00">1643</date>&#x2013;<date when="1715-00-00">1715</date>), in <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490921-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1849-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note> I have read the Yankee Thoreau&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">galimathias</hi></foreign><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Galimatias&#x201C;: nonsense; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490813-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1849-08-13">13 Aug.</date></ref></note> yesterday. <closer><salute>Yours ever /</salute></closer> <name>T.

<p><salute>Here has your Letter come, O punctual Goody;</salute> and now, at 3 o&#x2019;clock, we may suppose you in the throes of getting under way; a pain I truly sympathise with, but one which has to be undergone! We spent last night here in occasionally scheming out your adventures, arrival in Euston Square, arrival at <hi rend="italic">home;</hi> and then I went to bed: but it appears tonight is the true time to set about that operation;&#x2014;in fine, I shall not be at rest till I hear that you have fairly arrived, and some account of what you found on getting to harbour. A little slice of Schwabedom,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of the Salis Schwabes in Manchester.</note> among the other fruits of your <pb id="pg-24-240" n="24:240"/>travel laid up for me, will not be unwelcome at all. Along with yours came this Letter from Neuberg; of course I give up altogether that speculation, and shall make for Chelsea instead of &#x201C;Derby.&#x201C; I decide likewise to omit Liverpool: Pauletdom, knowing what I do from you about it, is by no means a scene I would go wilfully to take share in! I judge it not, perhaps I pity it enough; but to condemn it withal appears the inevitable result if I did judge it: a clearer course is to do what Nature emphatically prompts, &#x201C;Keep away from it; pass it swiftly in silence,&#x2014;holding thy nostrils if needful!&#x201C;&#x2014; I have written to John, conveying a Note to him which I suppose is an invitation from T. Erskine;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490919-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1849-09-18">18</date> <date when="1849-09-19">[19] Sept.</date></ref> Thomas Erskine also wrote to JWC, <date when="1849-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, from Linlathen: &#x201C;I said to you that I knew that I might safely go to your house,&#x2014;relying on your kindness&#x2014; &#x2026; but I am now satisfied that I could get no more of consulting all the surgeons in London, than I know already&#x2014;so that that reason for going there no longer exists.&#x2014; I believe that no human skill can <supplied>[save?]</supplied> my hands&#x2014;and I believe also that I shall one day be thankful for all the annoyance of it. / Dear friend&#x2014; I cannot easily express to you how much I feel for you. If we had been alone, I should have proposed you to have staid a few days with us, in the hope of comforting you a little &#x26; perhaps of suggesting something helpful to you. You need&#x2014;more than almost any one that I know&#x2014;a father&#x2019;s love or a mother&#x2019;s love&#x2014;a heart, which you may hide yourself in, &#x26; make your home of&#x2014;a heart that might care for your least feeling&#x2014;&#x26; might desire &#x26; endeavour that all your feelings might be healthy &#x26; happy &#x26; holy&#x2014; My dear child&#x2014;you must go to God, you would find such a heart&#x2014;you are not in the way of finding it in this world. &#x2026; Try to pray. Read the 15th chapter of S<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Luke&#x2014;&#x26; try to return to your Father &#x26; to your Father&#x2019;s house&#x2014;where there is bread enough &#x26; to spare.&#x201C;</note> urging him too that he ought to look after Jamie&#x2019;s medical affair, which I consider ought not to be neglected longer. Probably he may manage the visit and it both at once.</p>
<p>All hands are busy at harvest here; everything ripe, and five scythes at work; the <foreign>finis</foreign> looked for on Saturday afternoon. I never saw more beautiful still weather; sunsets, when I go stalking up Middlebie Rig towards Burnswark side, are beautiful as <hi rend="italic">Claudes</hi>, and happily I am bothered with no talk about them. I live as the idlest of all men. I have slept three nights, two in succession, <hi rend="italic">well.</hi> My heart lies waste and sad enough; but it is quiet, left quiet,&#x2014;and lays schemes for amendment and renewed activity, if the gods will. I am grown very <hi rend="italic">impious</hi>, however; a dull weight as of stone mountains seems to crush down everything in me, good as well as evil. By and by we hope to see Richard become himself<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Richard III</hi>, altered Colley Cibber, 5.3.</note> again in spite of everything! At any rate, a few days of absolute silence, absolute inaction in thought, word and deed among these old native moors is by no means to be despised.&#x2014; I have not yet set any day for departing; but must of course set about it soon: I mean to try for Chelsea all at one run; so soon as I hear news from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> there will be little excuse for my loitering longer.</p>
<p>Alas, alas, I seem yet far from articulate <hi rend="italic">work;</hi> nevertheless one must <pb id="pg-24-241" n="24:241"/>begin to advance thitherward:&#x2014;I wish you had got thro&#x2019; that mass of burbled Papers, for one thing. But indeed I hardly think you ever will; and probably it is my own concern, tho&#x2019; your judgement might have availed me too in the washing of such a mass of &#x201C;diggings,&#x201C;&#x2014;diggings <hi rend="italic">without</hi> gold, with at best only bran and huge tons of mud, ah me!&#x2014; I have now Thoreau&#x2019;s Book, which went with me in vain all over Ireland; a very fantastic yet not quite worthless Book. I have others of the same still here; the <foreign>pabulum</foreign> of my at present &#x201C;irregular life!&#x2014; Get into the cab then, my poor Goody, for it is now towards 4 o&#x2019;clock (my dinner-hour here); and Gootluck go with thee to the Orient and everywhither! <closer><salute>Hoping for news swiftly&#x2014; Ever yours</salute></closer> <name>T.

<salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Along with your Letter of today, for which take many thanks, there came this, which as it is postable I enclose. It strikes me as probably from the same source as the <hi rend="italic">pamphlet</hi> Letter mentioned in mine of yesterday: &#x201C;Pimlico&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Part of Westminster, ca. 2&#xBD; mi. WSW of St. Paul&#x2019;s.</note> is stamped on both, and the hands have a resemblance.</p>
<p>Jane had written to me on Tuesday; we trust to hear tomorrow that she arrived duly. What day I go is yet unfixed; but the train, I imagine, ought to be the Express one: 12.42 from Lockerby, into London at 11.&#x2014; Jamie is gone to Annan, in hopes I believe of catching up some debts due. Weather still good; <foreign><hi rend="italic">finis</hi></foreign> of cutting here is fixed for <hi rend="italic">tomorrow.</hi> Potatoes all rotting here and hereabouts, branch and root. No other news,&#x2014;no news at all, that is!</p>
<p>W. Grahame arrived here two hours ago, woe betide bad luck! I have <hi rend="italic">missed</hi> my dinner for him, given him <hi rend="italic">tea</hi>, and now he is only waiting for this to go his way towards Ecclefechan. My Mother is talking with him in the other room till I end. <hi rend="italic">Let</hi> me end. Write soon,&#x2014;what day you are coming, so soon as that fixes itself with you.</p>

<p>We were all much disappointed today when, going to the Postman&#x2019;s place of deposit, the answer was, He had not called at all! No remedy for it. On coming home, however, a Note of Geraldine&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490921-JWC-TC-01"><sic>JWC-TC</sic><corr>JWC to TC</corr>, [<date when="1849-09-21">21 Sept.</date>].</ref> According to Jewsbury, TC replied with &#x201C;a very kind note&#x201C; (Ireland 301).</note> with a Dumfries Newspaper <hi rend="italic">lay here:</hi> The Postman had given them to one of Jamie&#x2019;s harvest-people by the wayside; and so, tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> by an abbreviated route, they had arrived.</p>
<p>Poor creature, you have had a &#x201C;bad headache&#x201C; again; a most sad preparation for a long journey! Could not travel on Wednesday, but had to lie in sick misery instead. I rather dreaded such a thing, as the residue of past ailments. However I do now infer from Geraldine&#x2019;s Note, which seems to bear tho&#x2019; indistinctly the London Postmark according to its intention, that you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> at least in your own home at Chelsea; which is one point gained, and a great one.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote JWC, [<date when="1849-09-20">20 Sept.</date>], to thank her for an envelope in her own writing, showing that she had safely reached home the day before. She also mentioned that after meeting Froude for the first time, <date when="1849-08-20">20 Aug.</date>, she had written on his <hi rend="italic">Nemesis of Faith</hi> and F. W. Newman&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Soul, Her Sorrows and Her Aspirations</hi> (<date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>) for G. H. Lewes as ed. of the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>, who refused it because &#x201C;it would scandalise every review&#x201C; (Ireland 296). It was eventually pbd. in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> 52 (<date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>):379&#x2013;407.</note> Tomorrow surely will bring me a Note from your own hand: may it report all well, especially your poor little self well. A good sleep in your own old bed would cover a multitude of cracks. We shall lie in wait for the Postman tomorrow, and catch his Letter at first hand!&#x2014; I must have written you today at any rate, independent of Geraldine&#x2019;s Letter, for tomorrow there will be no post to London.</p>
<p>Repose here, excellent sleep nightly, and a day of the most perfect <hi rend="italic">vacancy</hi> from effort or disturbance of any kind, are duly vouchsafed me: no other news have I, or can I have. About 8 o&#x2019;clock usually I awaken; find a <hi rend="italic">Tub</hi> of excellent rain-water with two big sponges waiting me from the previous night; get into these, and splash (a blessing denied me, all the time, at Glen Truim); splashing is hardly done when in my Mother&#x2019;s room a neat hot breakfast, of coffee, toast, and an excellent egg, waits me: after which a day of &#x201C;sauntering about the doon,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> reading some foolish, empty but not entirely insane Book (<hi rend="italic">Voyage en Espagne</hi>, an old image of Spanish grandeur, folly and wickedness of Louis XIV&#x2019;s time, has served me these last 3 days); dinner of chicken-broth with a slice of excellent ham, is &#x201C;on the <pb id="pg-24-243" n="24:243"/>table at 4&#x201C; (an hour or more too early,&#x2014;except when, as yesterday, I omit it altogether); tea at 5, all ready for tea by that time: after which I sally forth with a stick in my hand, and take a long stretch of walking. One night round by Castlebank, Grahamhall (if you knew all these localities, on the Pennersaughs side) and Ecclefechan: last night, by Cushat Hill, and damp shady woods, which brought me home by Waterbeck;&#x2014;a strange impressive kind of course for me, with the autumn wind soughing over the back wildernesses, and &#x201C;ghosts&#x201C; sitting on the tail of every cloud for me! After porridge, I have a little more reading sometimes, at all events an ultimate smoke is due; and then I tumble into bed. Such a life as I say to myself, cannot last forever! Yesterday Grahame came, poor old fellow; I had to <hi rend="italic">omit</hi> dinner, get him some tea <foreign><hi rend="italic">quam primum</hi></foreign> [as soon as possible], and set him on his way again. Wearisome extremely was the good man&#x2019;s talk to me, is indeed almost all talk.&#x2014; I wait your report on Chelsea, and shall then try to fix my day.</p>
<p>Jamie is ending his cutting operation today; busy too in &#x201C;carrying,&#x201C; has already two ricks in: a loud grey northwind blowing everywhere. Irish beggars abound; hardly any other new phenomenon at all. A poor vagrant Irishman coming from Langholm<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ca. 11 mi. ENE of Scotsbrig.</note> was taken with <hi rend="italic">cholera</hi> on the edge of this Parish; nobody w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> take him in; he was carted to Waterbeck; still nobody had pity enough to overcome his cowardice and horrow;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> the poor man was again carted to and fro for hours; finally was carted back to Langholm, with difficulty <hi rend="italic">there</hi> was got into a house, and in a short space after died: no more shocking history have I heard this long while.&#x2014; The express train (from Lockerby a little before 1 p.m.), which reaches Eust<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Sq<hi rend="italic">re</hi> at 11, that seems the Train for me. <closer><salute>God bless thee, dear little Goody! Write, write.</salute></closer></p>

<p>It was a wild looking speculation getting up yesterday morning at Geraldine&#x2019;s to start by the early train&#x2014;but tho&#x2019; Geraldine was as kind and clever a sicknurse as ever came near me; I felt the most desperate need of getting <hi rend="italic">home</hi> at any risk&#x2014;and this time fortune favoured the desperate, for I have been made no worse by the journey&#x2014; I put three letters which she made up for me to you, John, and <hi rend="italic">herself</hi> into the post office in Piccaddilly in passing, to show I was arrived&#x2014;it would have been too late to write from Cheyne Row&#x2014;I told her late on Wednesday to write, that I had had a headach all day and would not then rise to write myself and foresaw there would be no time in the morning as I had still my loose things to pack.

<p><salute>Alas, my poor little Goody,</salute> these are not good times at all! We have been terribly ill off for Letters here, and now that the Letters have come they are none of the best. Friday no Letters here, Saturday ditto; Sunday, to our great surprise,&#x2014;ditto, on calling at the Post station: however it turned out, the foolish Post had met the foolish Boys going to Sermon, and given them the Letters; so that, after a melancholy walk in the &#x201C;Langtether Moss&#x201C; and other windy high-lying localities, I was met by my poor Mother jubilantly shewing two letters, one from you, one from John. Yours, it clearly appeared, had <supplied>[been]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> written timefully on Friday, and was due the day before. Some root of blunders lodges somewhere on the line hither: for example farther, the <hi rend="italic">Tablet</hi>, which of course had been despatched on <pb id="pg-24-246" n="24:246"/>Saturday, came today, when no London letter or Mail-produce of any kind could be due. Today too we had your <hi rend="italic">second</hi> friday letter; namely the one you wrote to John,&#x2014;if possible a still more melancholy one: and indeed now John himself is come; and I sit down to send you advice of all these misarrangements; and also of the only sure remedy for them, which surely is now near, my home-coming, and the cessation of so much correspondence by letter. Jack came at half past 3, Jamie and I waiting for him; I walked home instead of riding; awaited dinner, have now had tea, and will send an express to Ecclefechan with this,</p>
<p>Your poor head (and heart too, as is too clear) were in sad case on Friday; which, I flatter myself, proceeded in good part from the total want of sleep after so much fatigue: let me hope you have well slept since that, given up &#x201C;thinking of the old un,&#x201C; and much modified the Gummidge view of affairs. Sickness, and distraction of nerves, is a good excuse for almost any degree of despondency: but others we can by no means permit ourselves a philosophy <foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Gummidge,&#x2014;not at all, poor lone lorn critters tho&#x2019; we be! In fact, there remains at all times, and in all conceivable situations short of Tophet<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440514-JWC-JW-01"><sic>18:46</sic><corr>JWC to JW, <date when="1844-05-14">14 May 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> itself, a set of quite infinite prizes for us to strive after, namely of duties to do; and not till after these are done, can we talk of retiring to &#x201C;the House.&#x201C; Oh no, my Dear, give up that, I entreat you; for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> mere want of sleep, and other unreality, I tell you! There has nothing changed in the Heavens nor in the Earth since the times were much more tolerable than that.&#x2014; Poor thing, you are utterly worn out; and I hope a little, tho&#x2019; I have no right properly, to get a letterkin tomorrow with a cheerier report of matters. Furthermore I am coming home myself in some two days; and I reasonably calculate, not <hi rend="italic">un</hi>reasonably according to all the light I have, that our Life may be <hi rend="italic">much</hi> more comfortable together than it has been for some years past. In me, if I can help it, there shall not be anything wanting for an issue so desirable,&#x2014;so indispensable, in fact. If you will open your own <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi>, and shut your evil demon&#x2019;s imaginings and dreamings, I firmly believe all will soon be well! God grant it. Amen, amen.</p>
<p>My day of coming <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be Wednesday, but I rather think Thursday is fully likelier; you shall hear again what the likelihoods are tomorrow.

<p>I lay in wait for the Postman at Noon; but found &#x201C;no effects,&#x201C; not even Duffy&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, which by mere course of time was due. No Letter from poor Jeannie, not a word to any of us, tho&#x2019; any news, especially of improvement from the last low pitch of sleeplessness and dispiritment, would have been so welcome. After all, by the mere law of reply and answer, no word from you was due to me; so I must be content, as well as I may. We will <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> things are not so bad; hope remains unto all!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Ever since I have sat here privately, in the eastern bedroom, reading deliberately in one of the wateriest, weariest and worst of Books, Moore&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">History of Ireland;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Moore, <hi rend="italic">The History of Ireland</hi>, 4 vols. (<date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>&#x2013;<date when="1846-00-00">46</date>).</note> a Book I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to read, tho&#x2019; without profit: and now between 3 and 4, I must write you a word before going out for a little air. My Mother, poor soul, has been lying ill in bed all day, Jack sitting as guardian in the room that leads to her, with monition that &#x201C;perhaps she is asleep.&#x201C; Her face-cold of yesterday is not removed, does not seem much enhanced either; but, as Jamie says, &#x201C;a wee thing <foreign>dings</foreign> [casts] her down now.&#x201C; She is very miserable when in health worse than usual.&#x2014; For the rest, the day, like all these days, is bright and dry; leading home of corn goes briskly on, and all other industry is at the lowest ebb conceivable. I <hi rend="italic">walked</hi>, last night, to Ecclefechan, under the cloudy moon, escorted by Jack, to put your Letter into the Post-Office; by rule you should have it this evening (if it were worth anything): that is the last act of industry I have done. No pitch of <hi rend="italic">laziness</hi> can well be deeper than mine in all outward respects now is. I have slept as much in these ten days as in any other twenty since leaving home. Unluckily for two nights past I have got into the bad habit of dividing my sleep in two, waking a couple of hours by way of interlude, and then sleeping till 10 o&#x2019;clock; which quite oversets the day&#x2019;s arrangements as to meals, and indeed induces me to omit dinner altogether! A bad habit altogether, if I could mend it: but who can? My two hours of waking pass in wondrous resuscitations and reviews of all manner of dead events; not quite unprofitably perhaps, and tho&#x2019; sadly not unpleasantly. Sad as death; but also quiet as death, and with a kind of faint reflex of sacred joy (if I could be worthy of it) like the light which is &#x201C;beyond death.&#x201C; No earthly fortune is very formidable to me, nor very desirable; a soul of <pb id="pg-24-248" n="24:248"/>something heavenly I do seem to see in every human Life, and in my own too, and that is truly and forever of importance to me.</p>
<p>Jamie goes to the Dumfries Roodfair tomorrow; and that, of itself, as he &#x201C;takes the gig,&#x201C; would prevent my setting out: but I do privately design <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi> first, the day after tomorrow; and on that evening, if you hear nothing farther, you may begin to expect me towards midnight. I am to go by the train you went by, from the station where you started; then wait an hour and half at Carlisle and take the Express Train, which reaches Euston Square at 11 p.m. The waiting at Carlisle is by no means indifferent to me; but it is easier to do than so much gigging, to Lockerby, when all horses are so busy; so I accede to that suggestion from the Engineer of Trailtrow, who on this occasion seems to counsel well. His report of Lancashire matters is favourable. In Pauletdom <hi rend="italic">he</hi> seems to have noticed or surmised nothing wrong:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury&#x2019;s letters at this time have critical references to &#x201C;Pauletdom&#x201C; e.g., in late <date when="1849-09-00">Sept.</date> she corrects a description of a young woman, who &#x201C;has been looked at through a Seaforth mist, which is refracting, as you know.&#x201C; Later, [<date when="1849-11-06">6 Nov.</date>], after mentioning JWC&#x2019;s relations with Harriet Martineau, she apparently refers to Elizabeth Paulet: &#x201C;As to &#x2014;, we had better make no theories about her, except that she is like someone&#x2019;s lawyer, who &#x2018;hatched great hens out of little eggs.&#x2019; &#x2026; I have known her longer than you have, and have suffered more by her; but, in the face of all the shame and suffering that lie before her, I cannot feel resentment for what is a touch of insanity, unstrengthened and unpurified by any sort of education. &#x2026; Her intimacy with her brother during the first part of her married life was disastrous; but she has fire in her, and the fire she has to pass through must and will purify her, burn up the dross, and leave her less of &#x2018;alloy&#x2019;&#x201C; (Ireland 299, 310&#x2013;11). Her brother Robert Nodes Newton (see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450805-JWC-TC-01"><sic>19:132</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1845-08-05">5 Aug. 1845</date></corr></ref>) left school at fifteen and became a clerk in a Liverpool merchant&#x2019;s office at the time of Elizabeth Paulet&#x2019;s marriage.</note> Helen Welsh&#x2019;s case I find he regards with some considerable fixity of hope,&#x2014;one of the wisest &#x201C;alterations of regimen&#x201C; I clearly think would be, to advise your Uncle into a larger and airier house&#x2014;perhaps a feasible attempt with this motive to urge?

<p>I am so glad to hear such good accounts of you from John Carlyle&#x2014; When you get to Auchtertool where you will have fewer outward distractions (provided the Liddles<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Liverpool friends of the Welshes; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440707-JWC-TC-01"><sic>18:112</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1844-07-07">7 July 1844</date></corr></ref>.</note> can be kept <hi rend="italic">within bounds</hi>) you must write to me yourself very often&#x2014;a few lines at a time&#x2014;not to tire yourself&#x2014;but <hi rend="italic">often</hi>&#x2014;for I do assure you, Dear, nobody away from you can be more anxious about you than I am&#x2014;ill health of one&#x2019;s own makes people either singularly callous towards other peoples illness or singularly sympathetic, I have observed; and it is so far lucky for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that I have chosen the better part&#x2014;especially when I see a person much <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> than myself suffering&#x2014;and a person dear to me&#x2014;it makes me very sorrowful. One of Johns notions of &#x2018;proper regimen&#x2019; for you is that my Uncle should &#x201C;remove into a larger better aired house&#x201C; a notion in which I cordially agree&#x2014;and I fancy at the risk of a good <hi rend="italic">damning</hi> I must one of these days assail my Uncle himself on this subject&#x2014; I have been in a badish way since I returned&#x2014;two nights absolutely without sleep on the back of a fatiguing journey and twelve hours of retching and agony in my head at Manchester pretty well dished me&#x2014; And then just think! what a moment for making the disgusting discovery that there were <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> introduced into my bed&#x2014;my great voluminous red bed! where hunting them out was impossible!&#x2014; The only thing to be done a complete pulling in pieces of the whole concern&#x2014;and sending the curtains to the dier!&#x2014; It is the only spirited thing I have done for months back the instantaneous attack I have made on this nuisance &#x201C;regardless of expence&#x201C;&#x2014;with my nerves so little up to the earthquaking and bug-killing!&#x2014; The day before yesterday the curtains were all taken away and the bedstead pulled in pieces <hi rend="italic">two</hi> bugs were found alive, and there were two <hi rend="italic">skins</hi> of dead ones&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">voila tout</hi></foreign> [that&#x2019;s all]!&#x2014;but two were enough to <hi rend="italic">bite me all over</hi>&#x2014;and they would soon have been &#x201C;a great nation&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390505-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>11:95</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1839-05-05">5 May 1839</date></corr></ref>.</note> if left <pb id="pg-24-250" n="24:250"/>to increase and multiply&#x2014;so I do not grudge the three pounds I am to pay for the cleaning&#x2014;nor the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> I have myself laid out on it&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is not come yet&#x2014;writes that he will be here today&#x2014; my maid seems much better since my return&#x2014;but I am afraid she will never be <hi rend="italic">hearty</hi> as a single servant&#x2014;she gets so <hi rend="italic">low</hi> without excitement&#x2014;it is a pity! for except this inequality of temper she has not a fault&#x2014;her sister is still here&#x2014; Charles Buller&#x2019;s old servant who was eight years with him, and counted &#x201C;a treasure&#x201C;&#x2014;but married like a fool came to me two days ago, a frightful example of the ravages of matrimony, to say her husband &#x201C;had no respect for her more than if he never had seen her&#x201C; (perhaps <hi rend="italic">less</hi>) and so she had &#x201C;left him for ever and wished to go to service again&#x201C;&#x2014; I believe if I could bring myself to put away Elizabeth and take this <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> woman who wants nothing any more but a quiet life it would be best in the long run&#x2014;but I am very bad at putting away <hi rend="italic">anyone</hi> that cleaves to me</p>

<salute>My dear Brother</salute>
<p>Here I am safe; that is nearly all the news I can tell you, so busy am I, such a bustle of unexpected people and things, as well as of expected, has there been about me all day.&#x2014; Would that I knew of my poor dear Mother&#x2019;s being well again and safe: I should be right glad to take a Letter with no other &#x201C;news&#x201C;! But that we cannot expect just yet.</p>
<p>My ride to Carlisle, all in a carriage by myself, was prosperous: there, however, my special prosperity may be said to have ended. The waiting,&#x2014;considerably beyond <hi rend="italic">two</hi> hours as it proved, for we did not actually <hi rend="italic">start</hi> till 5 min. to 2,&#x2014;was extremely wearisome; then the carriages were crammed, so that I had to struggle for air to live upon; and as to &#x201C;living&#x201C; of other kinds, my lot was little better, having subsisted mainly on two sea-biscuits and my Mother&#x2019;s raisins, the &#x201C;soup&#x201C; at Preston being hardly eatable (owing to <hi rend="italic">age</hi> of mutton since killing!)&#x2014;and the &#x201C;time&#x201C; to eat it in being some 3 minutes agitated by terror; while at other stations one draught of water was all that with difficulty I could realise for myself! In short it was as abominable a jumble as even I had anticipated; and the one good feature of the business was that I did get safe out of it, tho&#x2019; with a sorely aching head, and was set down at my own door a little before <pb id="pg-24-251" n="24:251"/>midnight, where honest tea, a right smoke, silence and composure soon set me on a clear course again. On the whole I do not advise any one to the &#x201C;Express Train.&#x201C; It costs &#xa3;3.10 from Carlisle; it seems to be immensely popular, and therefore <hi rend="italic">crowded</hi>, just now; and as to arrangements for the wholesome or comfortable subsistence of human beings on the course, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> these are sacrificed to <hi rend="italic">velocity</hi>, and that of course is the one thing attained;&#x2014;at <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much cost, I do opine! At Crewe Station I did not forget you; yet I fear you have little benefit of that today. <hi rend="italic">Our</hi> stopping-place proved to be &#x201C;about half a mile&#x201C; from the Post-Office: one of the Porters goodnaturedly <hi rend="italic">took</hi> my Newspaper, but I did not in the least see that he would put it into the place in time,&#x2014;the contrary rather. Thank Heaven, I am out of all that for a while to come!</p>
<p>Jane had everything in applepie order for me; but she herself looks very thin, poor soul, and is evidently suffering a good deal. She does sleep, however, at last; tho as yet but ineffectually, insufficiently, and indeed mainly by the aid of morphine hitherto. Now that all is come to anchor again, I hope we shall do better. The maid Elizabeth seems perfectly gate-going [able to get about] again; a little Sister of hers still here I have not yet seen.&#x2014; My own sleep, after tea and so much jumbling, was none of the best; but I compute that it will improve, and indeed that I shall be better for all this locomotion, when I gradually get the results summed up.</p>
<p>There have been various persons here today, there was a stack of absurd Letters, not <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Catalogues or such like, which needed to be sorted; and I have not yet got my clothes unpacked,&#x2014;my portmanteaus, I mean. Among my Letters is one from Duffy, one from A<hi rend="italic">y</hi> de Vere<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1849-09-18">18</date> and <date when="1849-09-23">23 Sept.</date>, respectively.</note> &#x26;c; the whole of which must lie over for one day. The Nation N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2 is <hi rend="italic">here;</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It quoted TC among other sages, <date when="1849-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Cast forth thy Act, thy Word, into the ever-living, ever-working Universe: it is a seed-grain that cannot die&#x201C; (Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 40). Duffy had restarted the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>, <date when="1849-09-01">1 Sept.</date></note> it had been at Haddington; I send you N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4,&#x2014;John&#x2019;s address<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1849-10-03">3 Oct.</date>, that the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> that arrived &#x201C;today is better than the last.

If the salvation of Ireland depends upon such scattered, wordy, feeble preaching as that, it will fare ill with Ireland.

<p>But what is becoming of my poor old Mother! I cannot get her sad state out of my mind for a minute, all this while. Do, I beg of you all, and of you most as nearest to her, endeavour,&#x2014;but indeed I know you will whatever is <pb id="pg-24-252" n="24:252"/>in you,&#x2014;to help her out of that afflicting business! She will be quieter now that I am gone. Let me hope to hear soon that all is tolerably well with her again. And to the good Isabella, and to Jamie, and all the other kind souls, my thanks heartfelt. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> dear Brother.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>Dear A. de Vere,</salute>
<p>Your Note,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-09-23">23 Sept.</date>, from Currah Chase, Adare.</note> by some mistake of the people here, did not come to hand till last night, when I returned finally home from these wanderings of mine,&#x2014;properly the night <hi rend="italic">before</hi> last;&#x2014;and a welcome enough sight it was, at this end of 300 and odd miles of Express Train, and the multiplex confusions of that day, and of many past days and weeks. I had heard of you in Edinburgh about a week before from Empson; but knew not whitherward to aim a Letter at you, having seen your Address extinguish itself at Cork (if I remember), and continue dark henceforth.</p>
<p>It was a great disappointment to me that I neither heard of you at Limerick, nor could see any De Vere there; your Brother the Soldier Engineer was unluckily out from his desk, when I called,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Vere wrote: &#x201C;I joined my people at Kilkee &#x26; passed nearly a month by the sea-side. How glad we should have been had you turned up among us.&#x201C; The brother was Capt. Francis Horatio De Vere (<date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">65</date>), R. E., of whom TC wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Irish Journey</hi>, <date when="1849-07-24">24 July</date>: &#x201C;Engineer de Vere not in his office when I called in the morning; does not get return call. &#x2026; At four, &#x2026; I decided to leave De Veredom then, to itself&#x201C; (169).</note> nor did the counter call take effect till half an hour too late: as for the Baronet,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Vere Edmond De Vere (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1888-00-00">88</date>), 3d bart., of Currah, co. Limerick.</note> whom I well remember, not without remorse for the Anti-Irish vexation I once gave him, it remained uncertain to me whether he was at Curragh or Kilkenny or where; in these circumstances there could nothing be attempted in that direction. Meditations among the turf-boats; talk with articulate-speaking natives, such as the City of the violated Treaty<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Treaty of Limerick, <date when="1691-10-03">3 Oct. 1691</date>, on the town&#x2019;s surrender to the English and Dutch, supposedly guaranteed freedom of trade and property rights to Roman Catholics in Ireland, but it was followed by Protestant confiscation of Catholic lands.</note> turned up for me,&#x2014;judicious Quakers, noisy Priests, sleek Poor-Law Officials, and insignificant miscellaneous: this occupied my little time in Limerick, till <pb id="pg-24-253" n="24:253"/>Bourke took me off with him in the Galway direction. A real grief and disappointment; one of the many such I had to pay in Ireland for the kindness of old and new friends. You must tell Lord Monteagle I had a passing interview with Lord Carew at Waterford, full of politeness on his part; Lord Stuart de Decies was eminently kind to me, and has left Dromana as a right pleasant place, a [word illegible] (English) islet in the waste chaos, in my memory; and Ballygiblin with Sir W<hi rend="italic">m</hi> and Lady Beecher was in every respect a ditto ditto to me. Thank his Lordship for those kind favours; let him know that they were successful, which is perhaps the best kind of thanks. I must likewise trust you to make my regretful acknowledgements to Mr Cooper of Markree; pray do not forget: I staid only two nights at Sligo, and was under special charge, of a very friendly kind, all the time;&#x2014;not to say dead wearied, and with a whole bundle of undelivered Letters still in my repositories.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Joshua Cooper (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>) of Makree Castle, Sligo; M.P. for co. Sligo, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">41</date>, <date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>. De Vere enclosed a letter from him, &#x201C;one of those &#x2018;six Irish good landlords, if there be so many&#x2019; to whom I gave you letters. &#x2026; much vexed at having missed you.&#x201C;</note> The beautifullest soul in all Ireland, so far as my experience went, I am to say farther for behoof of your Cousin Spring Rice,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One of the five sons of De Vere&#x2019;s paternal uncle, Lord Monteagle.</note> was Lord George Hill, at Ballyare and Gweedore; a man to remember all one&#x2019;s life; almost a poetic or tragic man. Out of the black bogs, and blacker savage populations of Gweedore, that noble, elegant, <hi rend="italic">truly</hi> aristocratic mind will never, I suppose, make much conquest of money,&#x2014;at least, any Hudson or Rothschild<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Hudson or a member of the wealthy Rothschild family.</note> will entirely extinguish him in that kind of conquest,&#x2014;but there is another kind of conquest which he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> daily making, in which no Hudson has part or lot, and which all the ingots of Threadneedle Street,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Site of the Bank of England.</note> and all the acres in Ireland, are very poor in comparison to, if a man has really <hi rend="italic">got</hi> a soul and not a mere stomach instead! To have seen such a man, in these beggarly times, to have frankly communed with him, and to remember him always thenceforth, is a real possession to me.</p>
<p>For the rest, I do not on the whole think my ideas about Ireland underwent any essential change whatever; but to have the empty Theorem clothed with a flesh-and-blood Body,<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Vere wrote: &#x201C;What sort of bundle of opinions did you make up in our Ireland of the Condemned. I fear that Duffy &#x2026; must have kept you somewhat within one range of influences. In Ireland the various classes are so antagonistic &#x26; one-sided &#x2026; that one may move long in a single place of society without seeing much of what belongs to another. Before you started your &#x2018;leading Idea&#x2019; I remember was that of industrial armies &#x2026; &#x26; a conquest of our waste lands. Have you taken in any new lights &#x2026; ?&#x201C;</note>&#x2014;this was and still continues abundantly impressive to me; I may say, painfully impressive and oppressive to <pb id="pg-24-254" n="24:254"/>me. Under the sky at present I think there is no such detestable and profoundly damnable spectacle as that which, in its finished state, the West of Ireland offers to one who can look on it with eyes. The late but inevitable downbreak, and scandalous bankruptcy of a Rotten System of Things; the long-suffering of the gods worn out; and Nature, stern as Rhadamanthus, as green and soft as she looks, saying audibly and visibly, &#x201C;Ye distracted Liars, it shall endure no longer! Grow wiser, truer; or die, all of you,&#x2014;and be damned!&#x201C; That really is her message, translated into unofficial language; and it was my main consolation, a very grim one, sad as death yet with a kind of joy as of immortality in it, as I wandered thro&#x2019; those abominable scenes of Westport and other &#x201C;Workhouses&#x201C;; huge <hi rend="italic">Swineries</hi>, as I called them, <hi rend="italic">human</hi> swine (O Heaven!) fed on compulsion, and no bacon to be expected! the <hi rend="italic">drippings</hi> of all our Cants, Cowardices, God-forgettings and Devil-worshippings; those in that Sea of Purulence,&#x2014;equal to the Best of Loki<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >God of strife and spirit of evil in Scandinavian mythology.</note> in Scandinavia, they may be seen <hi rend="italic">there!</hi>&#x2014; <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign> for this time.

<salute>Dear Duffy,</salute>
<p>I got your <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1 far up in the Highlands of Scotland; the other N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> (except the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, which now lies <hi rend="italic">here</hi> again) at successive more southerly points; and finally, the night before last, on my return home from these long roamings, I found your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-09-18">18 Sept.</date></note> left by mistake of somebody here instead of being forwarded, and safe, tho&#x2019; among a heap of rubbish. This is what news I have had of you since the day you rolled away from me on the street of Stranorlar; news enough if one will consider it well, and spread it out to all its expansion.</p>
<p>I like the new <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> very well, especially N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3 of it, which was the second that reached me. I seem to see there a beam of real star-fire and manful insight and endeavour, shooting forth from amid the old too-smoky and fuliginous elements; and destined yet, by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, to subdue them all to itself, and beam clearer and clearer by whatever real substance was in them. I wish much,&#x2014;perhaps you do not know, or decipher from my vehement and impatient speech, how much I wish,&#x2014; <pb id="pg-24-255" n="24:255"/>that it may be so. Better or worse, yours is the only voice I hear in Ireland entitled to any considerable regard from me. The one human voice there, amid the infinite barking and howling which is all we have heard this long while! May you truly <hi rend="italic">love</hi> wisdom; and regard all other things, popularities, nationalities &#x26;c &#x26;c as mere noise and nonsense in comparison: him that is loyal to wisdom wisdom <hi rend="italic">will</hi> reward, and him only; he shall &#x201C;acquire strength by going,&#x201C; for all the Universe is on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> side, and his light, in the darkest of nights, even in Ireland&#x2019;s night of <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>, &#x201C;shall shine more and more unto the perfect day.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 4:18.</note> Your temptations, and open and disguised impediments, I discern too well, will be many; but the task is great, and if you front them well, the prize too is great. Courage, patience, the eye to see, and the heart to endure and do: may these be yours, and all that follows from them!</p>
<p>Today I have already written two Letters all on Ireland, and must not go deep into the subject again just now. Your account of the Potato failure is much stronger than I have yet gathered elsewhere;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Duffy wrote: &#x201C;Your wish is gratified&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">potato is gone</hi>&#x2014; I have seen a great part of Dublin and Wicklow within the last three days and I did not meet <hi rend="italic">one field</hi> that was not blighted &#x2026; to the wholesale destruction of the crops. From distant counties I have heard similar reports&#x2014;and I have good reason to believe the blight is general.&#x201C;</note> tho&#x2019; it corresponds in tendency with what I saw in Scotland, where the miserable roots were daily getting spotted more and more, yet it was without that murrain rapidity of &#x2019;46; and one&#x2019;s conclusion there was, that nobody could yet say or guess to what extent it might go. Anyway there cannot now be any &#x201C;famine&#x201C; as in &#x2019;46; poor rates being everywhere established, and the potatoes, rotted or not, being now altogether the property of the Farmer, properly of the Landlord, to be struggled for between <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, the poor Cottier having now no share in that game at all. May they rot, I say always; may the past existence of Ireland remain <hi rend="italic">past</hi>, unrestorable by human cowardice or cunning any more in this world! Alas! even rotted they will do much mischief still; they will for years to come make of agriculture a kind of gambling, or at least keep alive an element of that kind in it, pernicious in all pursuits of men. A farmer in the Perth region, I was told repeatedly had gained &#xa3;2,000 by his potatoes alone last year; the prices in London were some sixfold, and the Perth man&#x2019;s potatoes <hi rend="italic">had</hi> lived: this year, it is likely enough, they may have died, and his loss&#x2014;Nay, who can estimate his loss (if there really be a soul in him) whether they have died or lived?&#x2014;</p>
<p>You are surely right in what you argue about the state of the land,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Now that the crisis has come I trust you will insist upon such a permanent settlement of the land questions as will save us from eternal new famines. You have got more blight&#x2014;use it I entreat you. If you throw your weight upon the scale justice will be done the unfortunate people whom we saw deformed into beasts in the South and West.&#x201C;</note> that it <pb id="pg-24-256" n="24:256"/>is a covenant of iniquity, clean contrary to God Almighty&#x2019;s law, and conformable only to my Lord Chancellor&#x2019;s Law, that now gives a ploughing man access to Irish soil (and you may add Scottish and English and European if you like); a terrible solecism,&#x2014;alas, alas, the <hi rend="italic">outcome</hi> of a million other silent and spoken solecisms; of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> our solecisms,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >MS ends here; rest of letter from Duffy.</note> cants, cowardices, and contraventions of the everlasting Acts of Heaven&#x2019;s Parliament! The sight of it, fallen upon us in its naked horror, and the thought, how far beyond the most distant mountains the sources of it lie, and the remedies of it lie, may well make a man sad.</p>
<p>You are sure of my poor sympathy, and of all good men&#x2019;s on this side of the water or on that, in any feasible attempt to improve even a little that misery of miseries. In &#x201C;land tenure&#x201C; itself, or the direct question of tenant and landlord, it is possible some considerable improvement might by express law be brought about; but I confess the figure of an &#x201C;Act of Parliament&#x201C; that could rectify all that is inconceivable; and even of one that could tend at all decidedly to rectify it, I have no clear notion hitherto. If you have, by all means explain it publicly, but not till you have studied it well, and talked with lawyers, political economists, and all such classes upon it. What they have to say, were it even all false, has to be taken along with one, and known both to be, and to be a falsity. The &#x201C;land tenure&#x201C; in England, you perhaps are not aware, is precisely what your Irish one is, in that most essential respect that the tenant has no lease. Generally throughout this South of England leases are not known, or only beginning to be known; yet nowhere in the Queen&#x2019;s dominions does the farmer, with all his workers, sit so easy. From the practice of England you will get no help; I think the Scotch law, if it were investigated with that view, would be found to yield you something. Did you ever speak with Hancock on the subject?<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably William Neilson Hancock, barrister and prof. of political economy, Trinity College, Dublin.</note> He is full of zealous notions on that or kindred matters, and speaks from under a wig withal. On the whole be practical, be <hi rend="italic">feasible</hi>, that is the one condition; support in abundance awaits you here if that be complied with.</p>
<p>Also do not much mind Linton,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William James Linton (<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>&#x2013;<sic><date when="1898-00-00">98</date></sic><corr><date when="1797-00-00">97</date></corr>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16745"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), engraver, poet, journalist, and political reformer; estab., <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>, <hi rend="italic">The National</hi> to reprint publications inaccessible to workingmen; ed. of <hi rend="italic">The Illuminated Magazine</hi>, <date when="1845-00-00">1845</date>; became friendly with Mazzini, who encouraged him to found and be sec. of the International League, <date when="1847-00-00">1847</date>, and supported the Friends of Italy; founded and conducted <hi rend="italic">The English Republic</hi>, <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>.

He and TC had met, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>, when Linton protested the death sentence of John Frost (see <ref target="volume-12/lt-18400109-TC-TAR-01"><sic>12:11</sic><corr>TC to TAR, <date when="1840-01-09">9 Jan. 1840</date></corr></ref>), canvassing TC and others for support.

<ps><p>One Espinasse, a young Edinburgh man, now and for some years past in Manchester, I accidentally learn, has written to you, offering services, which have been declined. Very well, upon that be there no return. But, somehow, I feel that you do not probably understand this poor young man, and that I ought to say a word in explanation of him. Poor fellow! he is a kind of hero this little Espinasse, and is now threatened with changing into a kind of Scotch <hi rend="italic">Rousseau</hi>, so unpropitious are the elements to him. An excellent scholar, especially in German, &#x26;c., full of exact information on all manner of subjects, discernment sharp as a hawk&#x2019;s (especially on the satirical side); in all ways an honourable, proudly veracious, anti-humbug little fellow (strange as you may think it), and very much to be relied on for doing whatsoever he undertakes to do. Of a contemptuous, proud temper, as I say, though honest to the bone; that is really the man&#x2019;s character if you can believe me, who have known him for several years. Of late I find he has once or twice taken to the most flagrant imitation of me, which looks absurd and almost mad, quite unfit for any journal, but I assure you he can write in quite other styles than that, and used to do literary, &#x26;c., articles for the Manchester <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> very well indeed, till he took some huff at them. In the interest of suffering humanity, and for the sake of a young man of real superiority, I testify these things.

<p><salute>Well to be sure&#x2014;After all!&#x2014;</salute> But I have not been so much surprised by that <pb id="pg-24-258" n="24:258"/>letter as you would naturally suppose&#x2014;your frigid reception the other day<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490905-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1849-09-05">5 Sept.</date>]</ref>.</note> did not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> take in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>: it only satisfied my Aunt Anne that I &#x201C;had wasted a good half hour of my <hi rend="italic">one</hi> day on a person who to all appearance did not care three straws for me&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">had no more feeling than a stone</hi>&#x201C;! &#x201C;Yes,&#x201C; I told her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">to all appearance</hi> it was even so: but I had a mild trust that appearances might be, in this instance as in so many others&#x2014;deceitful.&#x201C; For old affection spoke up for you in my heart, that <hi rend="italic">a quarter of a century</hi> even, however it might &#x201C;make a great odds&#x201C; on a man as well as &#x201C;on a girl,&#x201C;&#x2014;could not have <hi rend="italic">changed his nature</hi>&#x2014;nothing but death is <hi rend="italic">up to</hi> doing that&#x2014;the &#x201C;dear John&#x201C; of <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date> was <hi rend="italic">loyal, constant, deeply affectionate,</hi> that was <hi rend="italic">his nature</hi> and <hi rend="italic">all that</hi> he must be still, must be always <hi rend="italic">at heart;</hi> however years and sorrows, of which doubtless he had had his share as well as I, as well as all who live long, might have frozen and deadened him outwardly. And how reconcile <hi rend="italic">such</hi> abstract notions about you with my Aunt&#x2019;s notion of your &#x201C;not caring three straws&#x201C; for myself? Indeed I did not so much <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to reconcile them, it would amaze you to know how surely I relied on your affection for me; how surely I have relied on it thro&#x2019; all these years: tho&#x2019; no sign of it was discoverable thro&#x2019; the minutest microscope! never a visit, nor a message, nor anything to show you recollected my existence! and when at last you were <hi rend="italic">obliged</hi> to see me &#x201C;quite promiscuously,&#x201C; looking at me as if I had been my own cousin twenty times removed. But in all that I saw <hi rend="italic">only</hi> &#x201C;force of circumstances.&#x201C; Not that I have a vanity equal to anything&#x2014;equal to fancying myself so very loveable, that wherever I have &#x201C;been <hi rend="italic">known and appreciated</hi>&#x201C; (as your cousin Mrs. Aitken is always saying of &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">David</hi>&#x201C;) my image must have been, henceforth and for ever preserved in lavender!&#x2014; Oh dear no! Whatever I may have been as a girl, as a woman I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> not vain the least in the world! I should like to see <hi rend="italic">the individual vanity</hi> that could hold its own in the position of worser half to a &#x201C;celebrated author&#x201C;! Decidedly it has been no egregious sense of my own loveableness, past or present, that I have believed myself always dear to you, but simply from my immense faith, taken up long ago, in your affectionate and constant nature.</p>
<p>So you see how it is that your letter did not at all astonish me.</p>
<p>You tell me you have lost your fortune, and are obliged to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> for your bread. Well! to speak truly, I feel no sorrow over this. If your heart <hi rend="italic">ache</hi>; <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, above all, obligatory work is the only remedy worth trying. Oh don&#x2019;t I know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> a privilege is that of sitting, with folded hands, thinking over a past that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> past, because in the present and future all is too dark&#x2014;ailment and sorrow overclouding the present and the future without hope or object! Oh depend on it, dear John, the loss of fortune or whatever it be <pb id="pg-24-259" n="24:259"/>that curtails one of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> privilege is a thing to thank God for, is perhaps the one interposition that has saved one out of madness!&#x2014; But your health, the loss of that is indeed a thing to grieve over, ill health is the misery of all miseries, complicates life for one to a degree that none can understand who have not tried it. It seems to me always that if one was quite well it would be so easy to be <hi rend="italic">good!</hi>&#x2014;that every sort of amiable quality would bloom up in one like the bean tree in the fairy tale so soon as that physical pressure was lifted off! and one must go on, good God! getting always more hardened, more difficulter to live and more difficult to live with! Is it not very sad?&#x2014;but is not life <hi rend="italic">all</hi> very sad? I have found it so. A person who tells me he is &#x201C;happy&#x201C; looks to me either the greatest of Imposters or the greatest of miracles!&#x2014; So changed I am since the days when we danced quadrilles and divined nothing of all that!</p>
<p>I do not know whether you meant me to answer your letter, but I have followed the monition of <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> in the matter&#x2014;and I have written with my accustomed indiscretion I suppose.&#x2014; But you will burn this, and it will be all the same as if I had written to the dictation of Mrs Ellis&#x2019; <hi rend="italic"><foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Women of England.</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Ellis, b.

<p><salute>Thanks, dear Brother, for your little Note,</salute><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-09-30">30 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Our mother continues better, but the swelling &#x26; pain are not yet quite gone.

Jane got the former too.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1849-09-27">27 Sept.</date>, saying that their mother &#x201C;remained out of bed the greater part of the day. &#x2026; The soreness &#x26; swelling of the face are greatly less, &#x26; there is good cause to hope that another full nights sleep will set all to rights again.&#x201C;</note> Alas, my poor Mother is not well yet, seems to be <pb id="pg-24-260" n="24:260"/>getting very slowly well! But I must be patient. Send me a little Bulletin, pray, every day while this last. Tomorrow Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> I shall expect; this time we received the despatch in the morning.&#x2014; I have got the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> too; worth reading, seemingly: I will send it tomorrow when read.</p>
<p>My own sleep has never yet come back; but will now, I suppose, for I am deep in <hi rend="italic">castor</hi> &#x26;c today. For the rest, sorting aside great quantities of rubbish; getting the decks cleared&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">action</hi> of some kind, I do hope! Poor Jane meanwhile is but in a distressing way still; cannot sleep, is dispirited &#x26;c. Last night she had taken a <hi rend="italic">double</hi> dose of morphine (&#x201C;Murphy,&#x201C; as the maid calls it), and I, seeking for my pipe, was unlucky enough to awake her, poor thing, at the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> moment,&#x2014;which has of course done much ill. However, she is up and sewing; hopes to do better tonight. A. Sterling, gloomy as night, just &#x201C;from Brighton,&#x201C; is now down stairs,&#x2014;poor fellow, after all. Craik I saw yesterday; he expects his Irish Chief here tomorrow, all the <hi rend="italic">six</hi> Chiefs, and a grand consultation: he will then know what, when and how, a little better.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6586"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), whom the Carlyles had known since <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> (see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350920-JWC-SS-01"><sic>8:207</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1835-09-20">20 Sept. 1835</date></corr></ref>), had been apptd. prof. of English lit. and history at Queen&#x2019;s College, Belfast.</note> Chorley was here on Saturday; shrill as ever, Mother recovered but weak still.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J.

<salute>Dear Forster,</salute>
<p>Thank, and salutation. Here, sure enough, we are, both Wife and I; but in a most shattered condition; quite done up with Express Trains and other unutterable tumults, sleep obstinate <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to come back (especially to the weaker of the two);&#x2014;in short, there can no dining be so much as fancied in the liveliest imagination; and we must wait for Saturday, if you cannot come to us sooner. By all means come; we are greatly in want of news on all subjects personal and national, particular and universal; in want, still more, of the sight of friendly faces, with or without news.</p>
<p>Ask me little of Ireland; the passage thro&#x2019; it and out of it is like a bit of the Flight of Satan thro&#x2019; Chaos, when the Heavens had been closed on him, and the Earth was yet hardly made!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> 2:1010ff.</note> No country such as that ever lay beneath the Sun before. The <hi rend="italic">Universal</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">imposture</hi> (its own, and ours, and all the world&#x2019;s), quietly continued for two abominable Centuries or more, is fallen there into palpable downbreak, into flat bankruptcy (<hi rend="italic">without</hi> certificate); and lies now the most detestably sordid mass of fetid ruin eyes ever saw, or thoughts ever dreamed of! <foreign><hi rend="italic">In</hi>fandum, regina!</foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Unspeakable, O Queen&#x201C;: <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 2:3.</note> Alas, how to <pb id="pg-24-262" n="24:262"/>&#x201C;speak&#x201C; of such a thing, is yet far from me. Human speech is very unfit for it just now!&#x2014;</p>
<p>But have you read Duffy&#x2019;s Article in the last <hi rend="italic">Nation?</hi> If not, by all means read it; nay you ought to notice it in next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> or whenever you have opportunity: it is the wisest word ever yet uttered upon Ireland by any Irishman within my hearing;&#x2014;and &#x201C;eloquent&#x201C; too, with far other than rhetorical melody, with the tone of earnest sorrow and conviction. &#x201C;A few workmen wanted&#x201C;: that is the title; read it, reflect on it.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Forster was not so pleased with the article as TC and wrote in &#x201C;Work for Ireland,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1849-10-06">6 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;We really should have thought one might as well advertise for coals to Newcastle. It is not work that has been wanted, but the right and prudent direction of it. &#x2026; It is not &#x2026; of clever volunteers to write in the columns of the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi> that Ireland has need. Even though they should forswear all talking and all Irish oratory, and though they should take to reproducing Adam Smith and Ricardo, we doubt if any more advantage is like to be derived from their solemn studies than from their idle spouting. &#x2026; Political science must spring from life, from character, from industry, and from the whole march of society. The journalist or student may hold up here and there a solitary lamp, a very useful and a very brilliant one perhaps, as in Mr Duffy&#x2019;s own case. But from none of these lights are we to hope to regenerate or to build up a nation.&#x201C;</note></p>

<p>I have been writing all day, day very wet too and dismal-looking; but before going out in my waterproof, I will still write you a small word.

Oh take care, and be <hi rend="italic">obedient</hi> to his doctoring; for you have no strength to throw away, dear Mother; and get well again, and let us hear that all is as it used to be. At this Autumn season you have cause to be doubly careful, especially with such wild weather as accompanies it just now. I will hope for good news, next time Jack writes too,&#x2014;and tell him to write <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>, whatever the news be.</p>
<p>I am getting pretty well round again, myself; and hope to accomplish <pb id="pg-24-263" n="24:263"/>some more result with what health I may have than lately. A good deal of rubbish, outward and inward, will require to be cleared away first! I have got the pen in my hand, however; and will try harder than usual not altogether to quit it till I do get down to the right vein.&#x2014; Jane is better than when I wrote last, has got some tolerable sleep twice; but is still as weak as water, poor thing; and very irritable and sad; and needs all the good treatment I can manage, in my own poor state, to give her. She goes out almost daily,&#x2014;not today in such blustery wet weather,&#x2014;to Charing Cross and back again in an omnibus; that is pretty nearly all the exercise she gives herself, not being able for almost any walking. She sews, reads &#x26;c; and is clearly growing stronger. We are very quiet at this season; left mostly to ourselves hitherto; which is far the wholesomest condition. I hope to send you better news, as well as to get better news, before much time go by.</p>
<p>I was yesterday in the City, getting money: I saw nobody yesterday: on other days I have met acquaintances up and down; all people are coming back to London during this month; Forster (Jack knows him) had some &#x201C;Hungarian Patriot&#x201C; to give a dinner to;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hungarian revolt against Austria; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490801-JWC-MML-01">JWC to <sic>MMD</sic><corr>MML</corr>, <date when="1849-08-01">1 Aug.</date></ref> The patriot is unidentified, but the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1849-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, has &#x201C;The Constitutional System of Hungary&#x201C; by &#x201C;a Cambridge Man.&#x201C;</note> sent over his Boy yesterday,&#x2014;but it was no work for me just now! At the Library, the day before, I found a Magazine Parcel left: in it an &#x201C;Article,&#x201C; which I have clipt out for you (nobody else will or need look at it),&#x2014;the writer describes himself as a son of one David Hannay,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hannay (<date when="1794-00-00">1794</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), Dumfries businessman; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310327-TC-JAC-01"><sic>5:256</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1831-03-27">27 March 1831</date></corr></ref>.

<name>My dear Brother,</name>
<p>I need not say how your news of last night distressed me; alas, I perceive <pb id="pg-24-265" n="24:265"/>my poor Mother is still very unwell.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1849-10-03">3 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Our mother still continues better, but is very weak. All her teeth are loose &#x26; a good part of the inside of her mouth is skinless, so that she is not able to eat much food. We have got some ale for her, which she takes sometimes during the day but mainly at night with her porridge.&#x201C;</note> You do right to let me know the accurate <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> of it: I beg you very specially to continue with all faithfulness to do that at any rate; the truth whatever it may be is not likely to exceed the product of my own haggard imaginations in such a case. Pray write me, were it but one line, every day; merely to report how things are. These loose teeth, that skinless palate &#x26;c must be abundantly distressing; and, alas, there is so little strength to work upon,&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> has been already so &#x201C;worked upon&#x201C; by the tear and wear of so many toilsome and anxious years in our dear old Patient&#x2019;s case!</p>
<p>Your trial of ale speaks promisingly to me; she was always fond of ale to porridge, and seemed to get good of it. Would not a couple of glasses daily of Port wine be worth trying? You can get Port or other wine tolerably good from Postie, I believe; at one Walker&#x2019;s in Dumfries all kinds of wine used to be noted for good: half-a-dozen of Port, if you think it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> do no harm, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at once come to you if you gave me signal,&#x2014;it would be a real solacement to me (which you <hi rend="italic">owe</hi> me in my absence) to contribute any help at all in this case. And Oh be careful, be gentle and attentive, dear Brother; and do your best now if ever! One of the most comforting circumstances of the matter is that you are now there in person.&#x2014; Perhaps I exaggerate, and have aggravated in my imagination as I lay awake last night a good while, the gravity of this affair. Write to me, at any rate, one word daily, that I may see how matters go on.</p>
<p>Jane is very considerably better; is just gone out (3 p.m.) with Miss Farrar<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mary Louisa Farrer.</note> &#x26;c who have called. She will gather strength daily I now calculate. I myself am busy,&#x2014;&#x201C;annihilating rubbish,&#x201C; in preparation for something better.&#x2014; Fuz called, Strachey the Youngest being already here, the ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> before last.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Fuz, nickname for John Forster. George Strachey.</note> Talk, talk, but little to the purpose. Thackeray has been dangerously ill, still lies close in bed: &#x201C;slow inflammation,&#x201C; tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to be produced by too diligent a course of dinners,&#x2014;poor Thackeray!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Who had had his ankle give way under him at a dinner party, <date when="1849-09-17">17 Sept.</date>, was put to bed and had his illness diagnosed as cholera. He seems to have got considerably better by <date when="1849-09-24">24 Sept.</date> but relapsed in early <date when="1849-10-00">Oct.</date>, when he was apparently in danger. By <date when="1849-10-15">15 Oct.</date> he was recovering. See Ray 2:595. His illness caused a gap in the publication of his serial <hi rend="italic">Pendennis.</hi></note> He has had formally to suspend his <hi rend="italic">Pendennis</hi> nonsense; and everybody says he had better give it up, the total, and even, tiresome inanity of it being palpable to all creatures. Dickens again is said to be flourishing beyond <pb id="pg-24-266" n="24:266"/>example with his present series of funambulisms:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">David Copperfield.</hi></note>&#x2014;I read one other N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of it (I am quite fallen behind) last night; innocent wateriest of twaddle with a <hi rend="italic">suspicion</hi> of geniality,&#x2014;very fit for the purpose in view, which Th&#x2019;s is not. Fuz likewise had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> Manning, happy Fuz; talked long and not instructively of that and such topics, then went his way rather late. John Chorley I saw last night for a while; smoked a cigar, set him on ordering &#x201C;two gallons of brandy&#x201C; for me. He has a dreadful apart<hi rend="italic">t</hi> in respect of atmosphere sure-ly!</p>
<p>Jamie&#x2019;s harvest, I hope is getting on; I hope all things, many things, will be better than my fancy of them at present is! <closer><salute>God bless you all.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Last night was a night of good news: Jenny reports really well of you, and our hope (if you take <hi rend="italic">good care</hi> of yourself) is rationally that her nursing will soon set you up again. The Dr also sent a Note; and Jamie appears to be doing every way well, and has the prospect of soon getting handsomely home again. Surely, surely, we should all be thankful!</p>
<p>But take care of yourself, and be very cautious, dear Mother. The weather here is fiercely cold; grim strong northwind blowing on us: and from Scotland we hear, what was to be expected, that you have hard winter days too. Today there is some rain; and doubtless the weather will moderate itself before real winter come: but in the meanwhile it is evidently most unwholesome weather for all weak creatures; and for your particular complaint, more directly than for any. Lie still in bed; keep reading: and see that the room is well warmed and well shut in before you venture to put on your clothes! We owe many thanks to Jenny; tell her so; and that she must not fail to write again or two,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> whether there is anything special to be said or not. If any &#x201C;special&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">were</hi> to be said, we should expect a line from her <hi rend="italic">instantly.</hi> Let her remember this.</p>
<p>We here are well, and busy, and have no news at all. Jane seems quite got round into her old way again; reading, sewing, writing (copying some <pb id="pg-24-269" n="24:269"/>of my rough papers); and few of our friends being yet come to Town, tho&#x2019; some of them are, we have more composure, and the day more to ourselves, than at other seasons. I too am scribbling away,&#x2014;my fingers are quite <hi rend="italic">sore</hi> today with what I have scribbled;&#x2014;which, alas, will turn to little account: yet it needs to be done, and is perhaps <hi rend="italic">on the road</hi> to what will turn to account. The Bookseller is getting <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edition nearly ready; will send it out, I suppose, about the end of this month: but I have not seen him, or made any inquiry of my own about his procedure.</p>
<p>Last night, by a kind of accident, we had Mr Spedding with us,&#x2014;him that lives over in Cumberland, you recollect,&#x2014;a pleasant worthy man; and one or two other people came accidentally in, so that it was rather a stirring night till they went away. I had my usual sufficient <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> along the pavements afterwards; and have taken little or no harm by the little bit of stir we had. A curious German called the other day too; an old acquaintance, as it turned out, of John&#x2019;s at Rome.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> And this morning there has been an afflicted rather wearisome young Brother from Brighton: terribly ill off about his &#x201C;spiritual state,&#x201C; his doubts, trials, &#x26;c &#x26;c: I counselled him earnestly to stick <hi rend="italic">to his tools</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">work</hi> diligently, leaving all that of &#x201C;trials,&#x201C; &#x201C;spiritual state&#x201C; &#x26;c to shift very much for itself!&#x2014;&#x2014; &#x2014;&#x2014; Isabella will get her two Jamies back again soon: our affectionate regards to her, poor Isabella. Now you are to take right good care of yourself, you dear Mother, and be well again soon. And Jenny will not fail to write.&#x2014; <closer><salute>My blessings with you all, evermore</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle</salute>
<p>If John be not there to talk to you now you will be needing more than ever to be written to&#x2014; And I should be very ungrateful for all your affection and kindness, if I did not contribute my mite, especially as you are the only person that ever compliment me on my <hi rend="italic">handwriting!</hi></p>
<p>The settling down at home after all those wanderings has been a serious piece of work for both M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and myself&#x2014;for me; I have only managed it by a large consumption of morphia&#x2014;at last however I begin to sleep&#x2014;if not <pb id="pg-24-270" n="24:270"/>like a Christian yet, at least less like a Heathen! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is at his work again, and my maid is at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> work again and the supernumerary Sister is gone away; and now that the house should go on in its old routine there is only needed a <hi rend="italic">cat</hi> (the last was drowned for unexampled dishonesty during my absence) to eat the regiments of mice who have effected a settlement in every part of the house, the parlour not excepted, and who threaten to run up one&#x2019;s very petticoats while one is reading ones book!&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C in the midst of talking to me the other evening suddenly stamped his foot on the hearth-rug and called out furiously &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">get along</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">Sir</hi>!&#x201C; and he had not gone mad&#x2014;had merely perceived a mouse at his feet! I am also terribly ill off<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> for curtains&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> having invaded the premises as well as mice, and all my curtains having been franticly torn down and sent to the Dyer&#x2014;not so much to have the colour renewed as to have the bugs boiled to death&#x2014; The middle of next week it is promised I shall have my bed <hi rend="italic">set up</hi> again; but in the meanwhile I feel like a poor wretch in an hosptal or a beggar&#x2019;s lodging house lying without a rag about me to hide my &#x2018;sleeping&#x2019;&#x2014;or oftenest sleepless &#x2018;beauties&#x2019; from the Universe! What troubles people have in this world in merely protecting themselves from the inferior animals!</p>
<p>For the rest, London is quite enough for the most retired taste at present&#x2014;and I like it best <hi rend="italic">so</hi>&#x2014; There are always <hi rend="italic">some</hi> &#x201C;<foreign>daundering</foreign> [idly strolling] individuals&#x201C; dropping in, to prevent one from growing quite savage, and, of <hi rend="italic">excitement</hi> I had enough in Scotland to serve me for many months to come&#x2014; I am very glad I have been in Scotland once more, and seen all those places and people&#x2014;tho it <hi rend="italic">was smashing</hi> work at the time! I have brought away many recollections that will be a pleasure for me all my life&#x2014;and my visit to Scotsbrig was the one in which I had most <hi rend="italic">unmixed</hi> satisfaction&#x2014; For along with my pleasure at Haddington and Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> there was almost more pain than I could bear&#x2014; But <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were all so kind to me, and then you were little <hi rend="italic">changed</hi>&#x2014; I had seen you all so much more recently&#x2014;and in short in finding so much to please me at Scotsbrig I <hi rend="italic">missed</hi> nothing I had ever possessed there&#x2014; In the other places it was far otherwise.</p>
<p>I hope you have the same mild weather that has been here the last few days; that your poor face may be quite mended&#x2014; We shall be very anxious till we hear that you are in <hi rend="italic">your usual</hi> again, and that Jamie is come home well&#x2014; I am very sorry about Jamies ill health, he seems to deserve more than any of us to be strong, leading the natural, hard working life that he leads, and manifesting at all times such a manly patient steadfast mind.</p>
<p>My love to Isabella who I hope is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> gone with him; for she is not strong enough for encountering agitations of that sort&#x2014;</p>

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>Your letter was one of the letters that one feels a desire to answer the instant one is done reading it&#x2014;an out-of-the-heart letter that one&#x2019;s own heart (if one happen to have one) jumps to meet. But writing with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C. waiting for his <hi rend="italic">tea</hi>, was, as you will easily admit a moral impossibility&#x2014;and after tea there were certain accursed flannel shirts (Oh the alterations that have been made on them) to &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">piece</hi>&#x2019;&#x2014;and yesterday when I made sure of writing you a long letter, I had a headach and durst not either write or read for fear of having to go to bed with it&#x2014; Today I write&#x2014;but with no leisure, tho I have no &#x201C;small <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi>&#x201C; to make, nor any disturbance in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> line (better for me if I had!) still I get into as great <hi rend="italic">bustles</hi> occasionally as if I were the mother of a fine boisterous family.</p>
<p>Did you hear that I found <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> in my red bed on my return? <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, who go mad where a <hi rend="small-caps">bug is</hi>!&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> bed &#x201C;such a harbour for them&#x201C; as the Upholster said&#x2014; Of course I had it pulled in pieces at once, and the curtains sent to the dying&#x2014;at immense expence&#x2014;and ever since, I have been lying in the cold nights between four tall bare posts&#x2014;feeling like a patient in a London Hospital&#x2014;</p>
<p>&#x2014;Today at last two men are here putting up my curtains&#x2014;and making <hi rend="italic">mistakes</hi> whenever I stay many minutes away from them&#x2014; And so soon as their backs are turned I have to go off several miles in an Omnibus to see Thackeray who has been all but dead and is still confined to his room and who has written a line to ask me to come and see him<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thackeray wrote, [ca. <date when="1849-10-16">16 Oct.</date>]: &#x201C;I am getting better &#x26; am susceptible of seeing ladies, but I cant write as yet.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; And I have great sympathy always with and show all the kindness in my power <hi rend="italic">to sick</hi> people&#x2014;having so much sickness myself and knowing how much kindness <hi rend="italic">then</hi> is gratifying to me&#x2014; So you see dear it is not the right moment for writing you the letter that is <hi rend="italic">lying in my heart</hi> for you&#x2014;but I could not under any circumstances, refrain longer from telling you that your letter was very <hi rend="italic">very</hi> welcome, that the tears ran down my face over it&#x2014;tho&#x2019; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C <pb id="pg-24-272" n="24:272"/>was sitting opposite, and would have scolded me for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sentimentality</hi>&#x201C; if he had seen my crying over kind words merely&#x2014;and that I have read it three times, and carried it in my pocket ever since I got it&#x2014;tho my <hi rend="italic">rule</hi> is to burn all letters.</p>
<p>Oh yes there is no change in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, so far as affection goes&#x2014;depend upon that!&#x2014;but there are other changes, which give me the look of a very cold and hard woman generally&#x2014; I durst not let myself <hi rend="italic">talk</hi> to you at Scotsbrig&#x2014;and now that the opportunity is passed I almost wish I had&#x2014; But I think it not likely, if I live, that I will be long of returning to Scotland&#x2014; All that true simple pious kindness that I found stored up for me there ought to be turned to more account in my Life&#x2014;what have I more precious?</p>
<p>Please burn this letter&#x2014;I mean dont hand it to the rest&#x2014;there is a circulation of letters in families that frightens me from writing often&#x2014;it is so difficult to write a circular to <hi rend="italic">one.</hi></p>
<p>How glad we are to hear such good news of Jamie<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Brother Jamie. Been at Edinburgh for a surgical operation with John&#x201C; (TC&#x2019;s note in <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>).</note>&#x2014; I hope tonights post will tell us he is safe home&#x2014; John I fancy from Jeanie&#x2019;s last letter does not go back with him&#x2014;but to Auchtertool for a little longer</p>
<p>Your poor Mother and her face!&#x2014;what a bout she must have had&#x2014;</p>
<p>For me; I am <hi rend="italic">really</hi> better tho I may say in passing that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2019;s &#x201C;decidedly stronger&#x201C; is never to be depended on or any account <hi rend="italic">he</hi> gives of me&#x2014;as so long as I can stand on my legs he never <hi rend="italic">notices</hi> that anything ails me, and I make a point of never <hi rend="italic">complaining</hi> to him unless in case of absolute extremity&#x2014;but I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> for the last week been sleeping pretty well, and able to <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> again, which I had not been up <hi rend="italic">to</hi> since my return&#x2014;</p>
<p>About the bonnet&#x2014;send it by any opportunity you find&#x2014;just as it is&#x2014;I can <hi rend="italic">trim</hi> very nicely myself and perhaps might not like Miss Montgomery&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly related to Mrs. Montgomery of <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320522-TCJWC-JC-01"><sic>6:164</sic><corr>TCJWC to JC, <date when="1832-05-22">22 May 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note> <hi rend="italic">colour</hi></p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>I did design to write to you at greater length today: but, <pb id="pg-24-273" n="24:273"/>alas, I was <hi rend="italic">finishing off</hi> some kind of things, more time went than I had expected,&#x2014;and now here at last has an Irish acquaintance (one Hutton,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Dix Hutton; see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490708-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1849-07-08">8 July</date></ref>.</note> whose Father was good to me) come in, and my means of writing are literally <hi rend="italic">null!</hi></p>
<p>You need not be told how glad we were of your good news about my Mother and Jamie. My good old Mother, it is a sad new sorrow to think of her as ailing; she seldom goes out of my head, when I fancy her in that condition&#x2014; Now however it appears the disorder is really retreating, almost as good as gone, according to your account,&#x2014;which we earnestly hope to get <hi rend="italic">repeated</hi>, and confirmed, one of these days. Jamie too, what a comfort to think that he has got that ugly business so well over! You will need to use all your medical authority to impose on him now the importance of taking care; if he be cautious and strict with himself, this business may be a great relief to him indeed, and in several respects, a great <hi rend="italic">improvement</hi> beyond the former state of matters before this began.&#x2014; Write to us again, swiftly, about my Mother: this, and to assure you that we ourselves are <hi rend="italic">well</hi> and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> news, was nearly all I meant by writing now with my Irishman waiting on me.</p>
<p>A French Newspaper, sent by I know not whom, announces to us that &#x201C;Chopin&#x201C; (the Piano-forte man, Miss Stirling&#x2019;s)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Stirling. Chopin died, <date when="1849-10-17">17 Oct.</date></note> is dead, &#x201C;the 17<hi rend="italic">th</hi> last&#x201C;: poor Chopin, an innocent, pale, melodious tremulous creature! Farey was here one day; settled in Town now; his Brother off to Madeira by Steamer. This Letter of Bunsen&#x2019;s was brought me the other day by the appointed &#x201C;Amp&#xE8;re,&#x201C;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Jean-Jacques Antoine Amp&#xE8;re (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), French essayist and literary historian.</note>&#x2014;a broad-built earnest-looking man of my own age or more, with big mournful eyes, and quantities of grizzled hair;&#x2014;a rational, intelligent, and very pleasant man; who unhappy was just about leaving England, and could come to me no second time.</p>
<p><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Brother, I must not spend another minute. Jane is out walking; pretty well she, very <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> in her regimen, bed-time &#x26;c,&#x2014;busy beyond measure just now with some <hi rend="italic">sewing</hi>, which frets her (puzzles her) she says.&#x2014; Yesterday I bought that Newspaper for her: today as I heard the Hawkers proclaim, the Mannings are &#x201C;condemned.&#x201C;</p>

<salute>Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter gave great satisfaction here, and even excited &#x201C;emotion&#x201C;; and, I found the other day, an answer was sent off to it by the party chiefly interested. I myself about the same time had a purpose to write; but that put me off.&#x2014; I am very busy since my return, and make hitherto the most unsatisfactory progress; which puts me generally quite out of condition for writing letters at all (my poor <hi rend="italic">liver</hi> too assisting towards such a result): and so, in fact, I write to almost nobody whatever, except it be in some case of strict <hi rend="italic">compulsion</hi> (dirty little cases of that kind continually occur here, <pb id="pg-24-275" n="24:275"/>&#x201C;invitations,&#x201C; solicitations, authors&#x2019; manuscripts &#x26;c); and by far the <hi rend="italic">largest</hi> share of all the Letters I do write goes <hi rend="italic">to Dumfriesshire</hi>, I think, in these late times. &#x201C;You must just excuse us, the day, Sir,&#x201C; as the old Coach Guard once said to me; &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the weather&#x2019;s</hi> no what we could wish!&#x201C;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note>&#x2014; Alas, alas, in bitter earnest, I am growing an old man, and have still an immensity of things which I have never got said in my vocation, and which are very importunate upon me to get said;&#x2014;the &#x201C;saying&#x201C; of which is a terribly difficult job indeed; and sinks me into dark regions of confusion, and even of weak misery and dispiritment of which the &#x201C;outer public&#x201C; has little notion! However, I trust always in your affection, dear Sister, in your tolerance of my short comings,&#x2014;in your &#x201C;just <hi rend="italic">excusing</hi> us the day,&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.</note> however bad the &#x201C;weather&#x201C; be.&#x2014;</p>
<p>I cannot say that I have yet made any progress at all in the road towards a new definite edifice of a <hi rend="italic">Book;</hi> but every rude balk or boulder one tumbles aside, every barrowful of broken crockery one wheels away, every stroke of <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> effort one makes, is something towards such a result; and therefore I must even persevere, persevere,&#x2014;and, for one thing, chiefly keep my mouth shut: that I have found to be generally a really furthersome proceeding of its kind!</p>
<p>Our weather is delightful, a beautiful &#x201C;St Martin&#x2019;s Summer,&#x201C; these two weeks past, after a tract of vehement windy cold. Jane has gone out; I too have just to go.&#x2014; Jack&#x2019;s account of our Mother, four days ago, continues favourable; &#x201C;up thro&#x2019; the day,&#x201C; &#x26;c; but she is not yet recovered to her old health, I fear, by any means. Jenny is come back to you again, I suppose.</p>
<p>And now for a <hi rend="italic">request</hi>, Can you get me 2 (say 3, and not <hi rend="italic">more</hi>) bits of Shoemakers&#x2019; waxed-thread, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Rositty-ends</hi>&#x201C; (need not be quite &#x201C;ends&#x201C;), of rather <hi rend="italic">small</hi> grist (my awl being small): I need them in cobbling with <hi rend="italic">gutta-percha</hi> here.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Aitken replied, <date when="1849-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, to say TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;little commission&#x201C; had been carried out.</note> <closer><salute>Alas, my paper is done! God bless you, dear Sister.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>1000 thanks (as Lady Ashburton writes it) this book is even prettier than the one you gave me formerly and I am quite natural enough still, in spite <pb id="pg-24-276" n="24:276"/>of the Diogenes<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >(ca. <date>412<!-- <sCap>b.c.</sCap> --></date>&#x2013;<date>323 <hi rend="small-caps">b.c.</hi></date>), Greek Cynic philosopher.</note> school I &#x201C;sit under,&#x201C; to admire pretty things and like to have them.</p>
<p>But what that boy meant by going about the other book on his own basis I cannot imagine or rather I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> imagine too well for his credit.&#x2014; When he was going with the bird the first day, he sent the maid to ask if he should wait for an answer and I first said no&#x2014;then called after her that he might bring the novel if it was come home&#x2014;you had promised me the <hi rend="italic">Caxtons</hi> you remember.</p>
<p>Next day being in the City he went <hi rend="italic">on his own inspiration</hi> entirely, to ask for &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">the book</hi>&#x201C;&#x2014;and a pretty scold I gave him for his officiousness&#x2014;as the boy being an impudent greedy boy, whom I only employ <foreign><hi rend="italic">faute de mieuex</hi></foreign>, I have no doubt he went back to see whether he could not grab a shilling from you, being quite sufficiently paid already.</p>
<p>If ever I have a <hi rend="italic">clean</hi> little house in the country&#x2014;out of this cursed smoke I mean to take out all these fruits and flowers and put them in little gilt frames and adorne the walls of a boudoir with them&#x2014;a <hi rend="italic">sweet</hi> idea. hoping to see you on Thursday</p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There is nothing to be called new here; but I must write you a line to give thanks for your kind intelligence about my Mother, and to ask you for another little packet of tidings. We have had a touch of east-wind with frost, since you wrote; I know not how that may have suited our good Patient&#x2019;s ailment; but at any rate the wind is round again, and we have a kind of damp still atmosphere today, with heat enough for the season of the year. You do not say anything about <hi rend="italic">the teeth;</hi> I want to know how our poor Mother gets on in that respect. If she were well again otherwise, there are such helps as artificial teeth to be had.&#x2014; So long as she is able to stir about, and read, we will wait more patiently for the complete disappearance of that bad business.</p>
<p>Inclosed here is a <hi rend="italic">measuring tape;</hi> a useful implement in itself, and one for which I have a special end in view at present. It was as if <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> before my coming off from Scotsbrig that I was to get my Mother a new Carpet, a thing she has been speaking of for some time. The Kitchen Carpet, <pb id="pg-24-277" n="24:277"/>namely, was to be thrown overboard; the present room-carpet was to go to the Kitchen; and a new Carpet was to be ordered by me for the room. The pattern of Grahame&#x2019;s Carpet at Burnswark, which he got lately at Glasgow (and can still, I suppose, get the like of there) was the kind approved of: only one thing was wanting while I remained, there was no correct <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> to be had about Scotsbrig; I was obliged to <hi rend="italic">guess</hi> the room by my <hi rend="italic">steps.</hi> Here now is a &#x201C;standard measure,&#x201C; however, sufficiently exact; and I want you to take the dimensions, and to bid Grahame write for the thing <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> (if Grahame&#x2019;s is the pattern still preferred), and let the account be sent direct to me here, where it will be easy to pay it to the Glasgow bodies. Or if you do not like to speak to Grahame on the subject, I can write to him myself.&#x2014; Pray attend to this, for my sake; I have had it in my eye all this while, but thought it would only be a bother while my Mother was so ill. There must evidently be a new Carpet got; and the sooner the better.</p>
<p>I am haggling along here, in the midst of some old papers, endeavouring to try if I cannot do a small somewhat; but hitherto my progress is none of the best. &#x201C;Dreadfully stiff to ye raise, man!&#x201C; Clearly there is nothing for it but to haggle away. &#x201C;To sit down by the side of sad thoughts,&#x201C; as Oliver says,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> is no thrifty employment for any of us.&#x2014; Here is a <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> despatched along with this; it contains among other thin ware an impudent but goodhumoured Caricature of me, in an Article (&#x201C;Bubble Girl&#x201C;) which you will see;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Bubble-Girl: A Historiette,&#x201C; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> 40 (<date when="1849-11-00">Nov. 1849</date>):513&#x2013;22, an anon. satire on TC&#x2019;s style.

My Mother will perhaps be amused with it and Jamie too.</p>
<p>Plattnauer, much to our amazement, came tumbling in the other night; had <hi rend="italic">quitted</hi> Lord George (with tempests of &#x201C;tears&#x201C; on both sides), had important mysterious &#x201C;business&#x201C; &#x26;c &#x26;c,&#x2014;in a word we greatly feared his old enemy<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Insanity.</note> had got up on the poor soul again: however, as a new tutor was not easy to get here, it is now settled that Pl<hi rend="italic">r</hi> shall <hi rend="italic">return</hi>, and settle to his old work at Ballyare; that the &#x201C;business&#x201C; here shall consider itself as <hi rend="italic">done.</hi> He had dinner with us yesterday;&#x2014;and, I grieve to say, did my <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> no good by the operation. Tell Jamie to <hi rend="italic">take care</hi> of himself. Jane is out walking. <closer><salute>My love to my dear Mother, and to all the rest.&#x2014; Ever yours</salute></closer></p>

Whence I inferred that the poor old foolish rich Actor must have passed away&#x2014;and the poor <hi rend="italic">companion</hi> was left on his own sad basis&#x2014; But the strangest thing of all&#x2014;a rap came to the door one evening a week ago which I did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> know&#x2014;&#x201C;that&#x201C; I said to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C &#x201C;is nobody that comes here at present but it <hi rend="italic">has been</hi> here often&#x201C;&#x2014; &#x201C;What an odd faculty that is of remembering peoples raps&#x201C; said M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C&#x2014;and the door opening there walked in&#x2014;Pattnauer!&#x2014; Mazzini would have surprised me much less.

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>I have been most foolishly putting off writing from day to day till I could tell you that the parcel was sent to the Paper People&#x2014;and in that small enterprise I have been hindered by the unpunctuality of my dressmaker who has kept <hi rend="italic">me</hi> from day to day waiting for my new stuff-gown&#x2014;without which I could not abdicate the other&#x2014;the said stuff gown has finally been sent home and is just&#x2014;sent back again for certain alterations&#x2014;so you see!&#x2014; In a day or two the affair will get itself wound up and meanwhile I have at last the sense to write about those stockings&#x2014; I can&#x2019;t think what Isabella was dreaming of when she said I expressed any designs upon <hi rend="italic">stockings this</hi> year. I dont want stockings knit for me the least in the world! Last year when your Mother was ill and reading more than was thought good for her I wrote a request to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to <hi rend="italic">spin</hi> me some Stockings&#x2014;purely for the sake of turning her &#x201C;superfluous activity&#x201C; into a more harmless direction&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">she could not</hi> spin, it turned out, and so I thought no more of course about the <pb id="pg-24-281" n="24:281"/>matter&#x2014; But a thousand thanks to you Dear all the same for your obliging offer&#x2014; For the present however I shall not avail myself of it</p>
<p>I have a good many pairs of satisfactory stockings on hand&#x2014;or rather on <hi rend="italic">leg</hi>&#x2014;at present, and when I need more I know where I can get Shetland knit stockings, by paying the price, which is worth while, they are so soft and fit so well and last so long&#x2014;as to the bonnet I should not be wearing it at this season, so it may wait for John&#x2019;s or somebody&#x2019;s coming&#x2014;&#x201C;half a crown&#x201C; or <hi rend="italic">three and sixpence</hi> which would be the cost <hi rend="italic">here</hi> is not much to pay&#x2014;but if the bonnet be no more it would be what M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C would call a <hi rend="italic">practical solecism</hi> to pay as much as it costs for the carriage of it&#x2014;</p>
<p>For the rest I have no news to tell you except that I have got a new cat&#x2014;who gives <supplied>[sat]</supplied>isfaction hitherto&#x2014;but they all do that in the beginning, and end in having to get themselves drowned out of the world&#x2014; I have been very busy lately at all sorts of trades&#x2014;chiefly carpentering&#x2014;and in your own line&#x2014;painting and varnishing&#x2014;so the last two days I have been giving myself a <hi rend="italic">lark</hi>&#x2014;actually have &#x201C;with <hi rend="italic">my</hi> cough and at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> time of life&#x201C; sat two <hi rend="italic">days</hi> of my mortal existence over a three volume novel!&#x2014;but it was the last new one of an authoress who sometimes goes by <hi rend="italic">my</hi> name so I wanted to see whether the present work came up to <hi rend="italic">my reputation!</hi>&#x2014; it is quite curious how this woman says things that I have said exactly in my own words&#x2014;which are often absurd and wild enough&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dear Mr. Grahame,</salute>
<p>Will you have the goodness to call at Scotsbrig, some day soon, and take charge of a small matter which I have for you there.</p>
<p>My Mother&#x2019;s room wants a carpet; you at Burnswark, I ascertained, have lately got from Glasgow a carpet, the Pattern and Price of which are quite <pb id="pg-24-282" n="24:282"/>suitable: the thing I want, therefore is, that you would ascertain, by inquiry at Scotsbrig, how many yards of the stuff are requisite there; and next, that you would straightway write to your Glasgow man to send the due quantity directly to my Mother, and send his Bill to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> here, which without farther trouble to him shall be settled by return of post. <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the weighty matter you are charged with, this and nothing more: pray do it for me as soon as your convenience will allow. My Mother or the Doctor can inform you of the right quantity, which I cannot quite exactly do; and all the rest, I hope you will find to be plain sailing and no mistake.</p>
<p>We are very quiet here, tho&#x2019; London is gradually getting very populous again. Absurd &#x201C;Peace Meetings,&#x201C; with quantities of empty balderdash talked in Exeter Hall;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At a meeting of the Peace Society, <date when="1849-10-30">30 Oct.</date>, at Exeter Hall, representatives of various nations called on all countries to limit armaments and cut expenditure on their armies and navies.</note> the &#x201C;Trial of the Mannings,&#x201C; and now in some ten days, the Hanging of the Mannings: these and other equally sublime affairs are mainly what one hears talked of at present,&#x2014;to which I have no answer whatever to give; naturally nothing whatever, except &#x201C;expressive silence.&#x201C;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomson, &#x201C;A Hymn on the Seasons&#x201C; 118.</note> There are extensive buildings going on in this neighbourhood, as in all London neighbourhoods, &#x201C;owing to railways,&#x201C; they say: sinister memories of Irish famine again, owing to potato-rot; Louis Napoleon venturing towards Emperorship, in rather perilous circumstances; a poor old Pope discovering, but unwilling to believe, that he has got into the wrong time-latitude now, that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> trade is almost as good as <hi rend="italic">up</hi> in these late times;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >French troops had restored Pius IX to Rome, but Louis Napoleon did not allow reintroduction of an absolutist regime.</note> a thoroughly <hi rend="italic">anarchic</hi> Europe, after vain attempts at &#x201C;reformation&#x201C; by parliamentary eloquence and street-barricades settling lazily into the old malodorous slough-of-despond<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress</hi> pt. 1.</note> again, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to lie long there:&#x2014;in all these external phenomena too there is little to call forth one&#x2019;s enthusiasm; one sits rather looking silent at all that; one can think over it, &#x201C;think and smoke tobacco,&#x201C; as the better plan!&#x2014; I am struggling very hard now and then to get some kind of <hi rend="italic">work</hi> out of myself again, if possible; but that will be a long story first, I am apprehensive,&#x2014;terrible quantities of <hi rend="italic">mud</hi> to cast away before the first <hi rend="italic">stone</hi> can be laid, I fear! Let us ply the carting then; ply the shovel and mud-barrow; the rubbish won&#x2019;t go away <hi rend="italic">of its own accord</hi>, no, every shovelful of it will have to be <hi rend="italic">flung</hi> out!&#x2014; For the rest, we are both of us in tolerable health for the like of us; which is a favourable preliminary: in fact there are many things favourable, and as my good old Mother always says, &#x201C;more than <hi rend="italic">we deserve.</hi>&#x201C;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-283" n="24:283"/>Send me a word, how you are and how Miss Grahame is;&#x2014;and believe me always,</p>
<p><closer><salute>Your old friend, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name></p>
<ps><p>Best regards to Mrs. Johnston of Grange when you go up that way. Among persons beautifully memorable to me she remains always, and will remain.</p></ps>

Martineau, who had been staying with Charles Knight and his family in London and St. Leonard&#x2019;s (Martineau, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> [3d edn., <date when="1877-00-00">1877</date>] 2:320), wrote to Frances Wedgwood, Sat., [end of <date when="1849-10-00">Oct.</date> or early <date when="1849-10-00">Nov.</date>]: &#x201C;It will rejoice you to hear that we may sweep all the pernicious nonsense out of our heads. Here is a capital, sensible note from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> C. to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Knight, expressing entire relief, and a desire to drop the &#x2018;accursed&#x2019; subject. She says it is enough for her that I deny having warned Miss Jewsbury against her; for she has never had reason to doubt my truth. And she has no particular desire to go over any criticism on herself that I may have uttered fairly in conversation 3 years ago. &#x2026; My host and hostess are going into the country till Monday morning: so we ask them both,&#x2014;(and her, if her husband can&#x2019;t come) to dine at 5. on Monday. / I have told her that I think her wise about not going back into &#x2018;accursed&#x2019; things: but that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am ready, if she ever asks it;&#x2014;as well as I can remember, after a lapse of 3 years. I could tell her and Miss J, face to face, what I said,&#x2014;supposing her in the magnanimous mood suited to the occasion. But of course, I shall be glad to be excused.&#x2014;It seems to us that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> P[aulet]. is pretty much thrown overboard. &#x2026; What I most dreaded was that opposition of statement from her about a conversation to which there were no witnesses&#x201C; (<hi rend="italic">Harriet Martineau&#x2019;s Letters to Fanny Wedgwood</hi>, ed. E. S. Arbuckle [Stanford, Calif., <date when="1983-00-00">1983</date>] 105). Jewsbury wrote JWC, Tues. [<date when="1849-11-06">6 Nov.</date>]: &#x201C;I am very glad that you have got [Martineau] back out of the region of lies; but your letter has made me very sad. How is one to do in this world when things are told one, sworn to one&#x2014;and one is tied hand and foot to secrecy and honour? I thought I was condemned &#x2026; by hard labour and silence, to get over that tragedy; and when I had, and when all the pain and suffering had done their work, now to find that it was all lying, is dreadful! What a waste of our life! For [Martineau] did tell the truth as regards all I suffered; and, anyway, she has put us right together&#x201C; (Ireland 309). Jewsbury wrote again, [<date when="1849-11-12">12 Nov.</date>]<sic>.</sic><corr>,</corr> in answer to two of JWC&#x2019;s letters: &#x201C;No amount of explanation would ever make her [Elizabeth Paulet] confess herself in the wrong, or would ever make her see the question as a whole: she would go distractedly into details, and I thought with a shudder of all the isolated facts she would dig up. &#x2026; You and she can never be friends again<sic>, [12 Nov.], in answer to two of JWC&#x2019;s letters: &#x201C;No amount of explanation would</sic><corr>. &#x2026; As to me, I know her, and she would only say things that would make me like</corr> her less than ever. &#x2026; She has set me right with you, and in your esteem, for I must have seemed untrustworthy. That is all I care for.&#x201C; Paulet, she said, &#x201C;is not a subject for ordinary treatment; it would be like treating savages to a legal constitution&#x201C; (Ireland 312, 313). Jewsbury admitted being wrong to have believed her but felt herself &#x201C;punished enough by all these years&#x2019; estrangement&#x201C; from JWC, adding that &#x201C;you may be sure I love you more now that I know I did you such injustice&#x201C; (Ireland 318, 319).</note>&#x2014;and not much more amusing than darning stockings&#x2014;</p>

<name>Dear Sir,</name>
<p>Jane tells me you at one time thought of offering yourself to me as &#x2018;Volunteer Secretary,&#x2019; by way of having a generous employment in this world!&#x2014; How that may have been I know not; but if you really have leisure and heart for a little of that kind of work, then sure enough I at present stand much in need of such a service as that were on your part. A mass of embroiled papers written last year, and tied up in batches, which have been repeatedly on the edge of the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, which I think <hi rend="italic">is</hi> their ultimate just destination; but to which I grudge to commit them indiscriminately just yet, till a better search have been made whether there be not some fractions of <hi rend="italic">in</hi>combustible perhaps in the melancholy imbroglio. The help <pb id="pg-24-287" n="24:287"/>of one like you might really be valuable in this small case. For there needs not only a Copyist, able and willing to decipher my blottings, and reduce them to clear legibility; but there needs also a man of decisive judgement and insight, who could completely appreciate what he read, know in some measure what might be worth something and what was clearly worth nothing, reduce the confused matter to heads, and thus help essentially to disentangle the living part of these Papers from the dead. Copyists I have had of the required kind, and could perhaps again get (tho&#x2019; not without some trouble), but a Copying <hi rend="italic">Editor</hi>, of that sort, I should in vain apply for by aid of money and the labour-market. In the meanwhile, to do the service myself, I find on repeated attempts, is difficult on many accounts;&#x2014;and I suppose, will prove impossible, with the <hi rend="italic">fire</hi> so near at hand. That is the real state of the matter; to which, if what my Wife reports was serious and not (as is more likely) jest, and if you have done with your Nottingham affairs, and are really <hi rend="italic">free</hi> to volunteer for what you like, I thought I might as well call your attention in passing.</p>
<p>After all, I fear it is but one other cowardly instinctive-artifice on my part to <hi rend="italic">shirk</hi> the real difficulty: for the truth is, I have got something to write again, in these times, an <hi rend="italic">un</hi>written insupportable something, towards which these Papers were an attempt evidently futile as such;&#x2014;and I suppose there will <supplied>[be]</supplied><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Word omitted.</note> no way of determining what to write and what to keep silent, or how at all to proceed in the matter, except&#x2014;except, alas, getting into that dreadful paroxysm of clairvoyance which is usual to me in writing Books, but which I shudder to contemplate as inevitable again!</p>
<p>So that, on the whole, it is perhaps really no vital matter whether you say No to all this, or even say nothing, but let it all evaporate, as a cloud, into the vague blue, and matters take their course as if it had not been. You will forgive me, at any rate; and consider that this, at least this, is a thing strictly <foreign><hi rend="italic">e secretis</hi></foreign> [private], not to be spoken of except to myself;&#x2014;and, in fine, you will come and see us some evening so soon as convenience serves. <closer><salute>Believe me always</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Here goes again a little Note for you before the Week quite end;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC is writing on Sat.</note> in the confident hope of getting another Bulletin from you shortly in return. Our Mother seems really much better; and we feel as if with you beside her she were safe: but a small definite assurance to that effect is still much desired.&#x2014; Your last Letter was of unusual extent too, and unusual liveliness of interest; <hi rend="italic">not</hi> written &#x201C;with the Messenger just waiting.&#x201C; Jane was greatly contented with her share of the Packet, tho&#x2019; I suppose she has not said anything yet, being by no means in good case for writing just now.</p>
<p>In fact our one point of important news is, that she has got a cold again, poor thing, and is prisoner in the house since about Tuesday: the weather, which was dim-grey and damp, got a tinge of <hi rend="italic">frost</hi> introduced into its fog about that time; and poor Jane took the earliest opportunity (she knows not <hi rend="italic">how</hi>) of &#x201C;supplying herself with a winter cold,&#x201C; as she phrases it. She is not very ill at all yet; merely &#x201C;sniftering,&#x201C; and head-aching &#x26;c: so that I hope it will not prove a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">winter</hi> cold&#x201C; by any means, but pass off again by aid of better weather,&#x2014;as indeed it is perceptibly better yesterday and again today. That, I say, is nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> our stock of news.</p>
<p>The Copies of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> came, I think on Wednesday: I sent one off <hi rend="italic">to our Mother;</hi> it is directed to go by Carlisle; and I suppose will reach you <pb id="pg-24-292" n="24:292"/>before many days: a Copy for yourself, if you care to have one, is ready here at any time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >TC wrote in his Journal, <date when="1849-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> just out; copies only came to me the other day. Such a battling and fidgeting, continued almost thro&#x2019; a year, I feel as if I could almost wish there might never be another edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of this Book in my time;&#x2014;but that, sure enough, is a <hi rend="italic">pettish</hi> insincere feeling. Ten or a dozen copies: sent one to L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> George Hill. Book tolerably printed.&#x2014; Enough of <hi rend="italic">it!</hi> I got a wooden Box with lock on it for the Cromwell rubbish that was filling all my drawers; into that I now hastily pack whatever new Cromwell matter reaches me; and then shove it aside; determined to have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with that one job at last. My wooden trunk is already half-full, nearly so.&#x201C;</note> The Book makes four very handsome volumes; and is <hi rend="italic">correct</hi> wherever I have glanced over it: what kind of &#x201C;demand&#x201C; was for it, I do not the least know, nor, to say truth, <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> in any degree care. It is an endless haggling and botheration, getting out any edition of that particular Book; and if another be <hi rend="italic">never</hi> called for, I think it may almost &#x201C;answer probably just as well.&#x201C;&#x2014; The thing is coming out in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, tho&#x2019; Parker would rather have &#x201C;delayed it till New-year.&#x201C; My other writing makes no perceptible progress, or next to none, in spite of some efforts.&#x2014; We hope you prosper with <hi rend="italic">Purgatory</hi> in your newly equipt room,&#x2014;&#x201C;more power to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> elbow!&#x201C;&#x2014; You have a good quiet workshop compared with many a one, and a task which is at once clear and worthy. <foreign><hi rend="italic">I fausto pede.</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Horace, &#x201C;<foreign>I bone &#x2026; i pede fausto</foreign> [Go, my brave fellow, &#x2026; with prosperous step].&#x201C;</note></p>
<p>I am very glad to hear of the Boys<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James and Thomas (b. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>), James and Isabella Carlyle&#x2019;s sons. The young James wrote his aunt Janet Hanning, <date when="1849-12-06">6 Dec.</date>, from Annan: &#x201C;We came here three weeks last Monday and we like the School very well. We are learning Geography and Grammar but the Geography is a bigger one than the one that we learned at Hoddam, and we like the woman we stay with very well. &#x2026; I saw my Father to-day and they were all well at home. There is another lad lodging in the house with us&#x201C; (MS: Univ. of Toronto Lib.).</note> going to Annan: it may do them lasting good in their life. If they are likely to get <hi rend="italic">above</hi> a couple of years there (which would be very desirable), I should considerably incline to try Jamie with Latin, as the readiest means of learning <hi rend="italic">English</hi> and grammar: but <hi rend="italic">under</hi> two years, I should fear he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> never get thro&#x2019; the skin of it, and so the labour be lost. Consult well of it; and do not let the poor boy miss any chance of improvement to his mind and to his wordly opportunities, that <hi rend="italic">is</hi> really open to him. On no account let him get into any of the &#x201C;learned professions,&#x201C; I should be inclined to vote! But to write well and freely, to cipher well, to understand a little geometry, geography &#x26;c, and have the resources of <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> opened to him: this is an excellent help, whatever way he turn afterwards in practical life.</p>

<p>Dont I wish I might do it? But alas!&#x2014;your note finds me in bed; where I have been spending most of my time for the last five days.

<salute>Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>Here is a Letter which Jack sent me, last night, from Alick; which, as I gather, you have not seen at Dumfries. Jack does not expressly bid me forward it to you; but of course that is the proper course, and I send you the Packet without delay. If I could write you something worth while from myself along with it, that too would be very proper: but, alas, there are neither time nor means for that just now; so you must take a flying word, as better than none at all, and put up with that till times mend.&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">This</hi> morning I got the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier;</hi> but it was sealed with a large splash of wax, carrying &#x201C;Annan, Commercial Bank&#x201C; upon it: that could not surely be from James or thro&#x2019; him, tho&#x2019; a part of the Address is very like his writing? There is a <hi rend="italic">cross</hi> in the inside, marking some Paragraph about Wull Carruther&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Carruthers of Breckonhill, lawyer in Annan (see <ref target="volume-13/lt-18410620-TC-AC-01"><sic>13:153</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1841-06-20">20 June 1841</date></corr></ref>), gave a lecture, &#x201C;John Knox,&#x201C; at the Annan Mechanics&#x2019; Inst. &#x201C;to an overflowing audience.&#x201C; He defended Knox&#x2019;s character from &#x201C;the attacks&#x201C; of David Hume (<date when="1711-00-00">1711</date>&#x2013;<date when="1776-00-00">76</date>) and others and was enthusiastically received (<hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1849-11-20">20 Nov.</date>).</note> Lecturing on <hi rend="italic">Knox:</hi> that, I suppose, will be the origin on this <hi rend="italic">Courier?</hi> James will probably send his own, by natural course of time, tomorrow; and so resolve that question.</p>
<p>Jack&#x2019;s report of our Mother is tolerably good still; but she seems to be in an infirm kind of way yet, and will require to take good care during the Winter weather. The Doctor&#x2019;s being <hi rend="italic">there</hi> is certainly a great resource, as matters stand: his stay there, even if it turned to no account otherwise, must be accounted a real benefit on that ground. But he seems getting on with his work too; and indeed he has as fair a chance there, for that kind of work, as he could anywhere have. &#x201C;More power to his elbow!&#x201C; poor fellow, is what we will all wish him.&#x2014; And &#x201C;more power to <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>,&#x201C; if that could at all avail, as a prayer!&#x2014;</p>
<p>Jane took cold about a week ago, and has had some weakly days of it; never yet quite able to go out,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the disorder has now abated considerably; and we hope will go altogether before long.&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> third edition got out the other day, after weary delays: I sent my Mother a Copy, which you will see next time you go into those parts: there are various little fiddling improvements &#x26;c; but nothing authorizing me to bid any of you concern yourself with it farther: indeed, such is the <hi rend="italic">bother</hi> attending this business, I almost wish (in my impatience) there were no new editions more in my time, that so my poor hands might be rid of it for one thing! But in return it does bring money, more or less; and, I suppose too, it may be <pb id="pg-24-296" n="24:296"/>doing some good more or less: wherefore we will let it go its <foreign>gates</foreign> [ways], and not snarl at the <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> it gives us. In Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine for next month, there is furthermore a miserable <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> of a little Paper by me: this too you shall by and by see: I struggle daily to get into some black mass of a &#x201C;Book,&#x201C; or very big story I have to tell: but it will not do yet, alas, no, not at all.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his Journal TC wrote, <date when="1849-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x201C;Writing here, in a languid aimless painful manner, obstinately continues. It is like the staggering and wriggling hither and thither of one <hi rend="italic">giddy</hi>, not travelling on any line, but distractedly stumbling about in irregular circles&#x2014;nowhither!

<p>Sun shining at Hampstead <hi rend="italic">yesterday!</hi> God bless me!&#x2014; Are you <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> it was the <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg? We here never saw daylight even&#x2014;were sewing by candle-light at noon!</p>
<p>You <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> my cold is better, I am much obliged to you; but if, instead of sitting there peaceably <hi rend="italic">hoping</hi>, you had bestirred yourself to come and <hi rend="italic">see</hi> how I was, you would have found me closely confined to the house, and <pb id="pg-24-297" n="24:297"/>very much in need of being talked to or played chess with&#x2014;which ever you liked&#x2014;</p>
<p>As to the M.S<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Scudder says (ix) that the MS was from Geraldine Jewsbury, but it is more likely that JWC was helping Neuberg&#x2019;s work on TC&#x2019;s rough drafts. By <date when="1849-12-04">4 Dec.</date>, Neuberg wrote to his sister that he had put them in order, finding on nearly every page TC&#x2019;s &#x201C;marginal notes which have nothing to do with the text, and in which he seems to be talking to himself by the way&#x201C; (Sadler 282). Jewsbury wrote to Neuberg, <date when="1849-10-24">24 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;Thanks for yr note. I am very glad to have such a good account of Chelsea. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle&#x2019;s late letters have been much more satisfactory &#x26; have made me more easy on her account&#x2014;but I wish you were living nearer to her than Hampstead&#x201C; (MS: NLS 551.10).</note> we had best take it in the fore noon; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C is not, in the course of nature, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">up stairs till tea time</hi>&#x2014;that state of matters is quite exceptional: besides <hi rend="italic">I</hi> get very <hi rend="italic">low</hi> in the fore noons, when my solitude is complicated by a cold in my head&#x2014; If you will come on Tuesday fore noon, and bring that Hampstead Sun with you, perhaps I might get courage enough to walk out with you for half an hour&#x2014; Your note did not come last night till after post hours <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Chelsea&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have begun this on the wrong side of the paper which must surely portend something!&#x2014; Perhaps that my mental constitution is breaking up&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>John&#x2019;s letters give us evidently the favourablest account of you they can; and we have great reason to be thankful it is so good: but we are still very anxious to have farther tidings; and it is with the view of inducing him to write again that I today, tho&#x2019; I have no news worth reporting, again take up the pen.&#x2014; We are tolerably well ourselves; Jane has even ventured out for some kind of walk today, the Sun, tho&#x2019; in a bleared manner, having shewn himself, and the set of the wind being from the west. Our frost, which was grim enough tho&#x2019; calm for three or four days, has gone about its business now; we had soft rain yesterday, and today I suppose there is a preparation for frost again. All this is hard upon poor weak creatures: how do you stand it, dear good Mother? I hope you keep within doors, and wrap yourself well: the fire is the best ally in such a season. We seem here, by starting our frost so <hi rend="italic">early</hi>, as if there was to be rather a hard winter.</p>
<p>I am scribbling daily; but there comes little or nothing yet upon the paper that will answer; in the sorrow of my heart I must just scribble away till we do get nearer the mark. Many obstructions, very heavy some of them, lie round me and in me: obstructions that depend on &#x201C;the world,&#x201C; or on &#x201C;other people&#x201C; generally, are not to be much mended by efforts or impatience of ours; but obstructions that depend on ourselves,&#x2014;those, some of those, one might mend; to these one&#x2019;s whole impatience and endeavour should be divested!&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">dud</hi> of a thing is come out in <hi rend="italic">Fraser;</hi> absolutely worth nothing at all: you shall get it in 3 or 4 days. I am having <pb id="pg-24-300" n="24:300"/>some of my ragged scrawls of Papers <hi rend="italic">copied;</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >By Neuberg, some of which were used for <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets.</hi></note> but I hardly think there will almost any benefit come out of them, however clearly they be written.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of speculation about my going down to Manchester, and making a <hi rend="italic">Speech</hi>,&#x2014;Speech in the &#x201C;School Association&#x201C; they have there;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1849-12-15">15 Dec.</date>, reprinted the report of &#x201C;a great educational meeting in Manchester,&#x201C; of more than 5,000 people, on <date when="1849-12-12">12 Dec.</date>, in the Free Trade Hall, with speeches by the chairman, Alexander Henry (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">1862</date>), M.P. for S Lancs, Thomas Milner Gibson (<date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10637"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), and William Johnson Fox (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/10047"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), as well as &#x201C;an excellent letter from Mr. Carlyle, counselling perseverance.&#x201C; Espinasse, who was sec., says that TC wrote to him, &#x201C;evidently not disinclined to come,&#x201C; but &#x201C;probably, from over-fastidiousness on his account, &#x2026; I left his letter unanswered.&#x201C; TC then declined to attend because of &#x201C;a cold&#x201C; (Espinasse 201&#x2013;2).</note> which I really have some notion of, for it might do good, and would be to myself a real relief: nevertheless I shudder so at the long ride by rail, at the <hi rend="italic"><foreign>dadding of myself abreed</foreign></hi> in that way, and at the other conditions of the business, I hardly think there will come a real result out of the speculation. If there do, it is to be on Wednesday week, the <date when="1849-12-12">12<hi rend="italic">th</hi> Dec<hi rend="italic">r:</hi></date> but you shall hear of me again before that.</p>
<p>I sent you a <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> yesterday, and a bundle of <hi rend="italic">clippings</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> to the Doctor a few days before: there is coming out in that Paper a series of Letters about the Poor and Labouring Classes,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491126-TC-CGD-01"><sic>TC-CGD</sic><corr>TC to GCD</corr>, <date when="1849-11-26">26 Nov.</date></ref></note> and much noise and talk are excited thereby. I got some of them, accordingly, from Miss Wynne, whom John knows; and after reading them, pushed them on to you,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; I did not find they had done much for me after all. I will send another or two, if there seem anything likely to entertain you for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Jamie is much better, they say; indeed quite set on his feet again, if he will now take care. Surely he will do that; and need no teaching, after the lesson he got! We greatly rejoice to think of poor Jamie&#x2019;s being well again. Tell John to give us some account of Isabella too, whom he spoke of lately as rather in a feebler way.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle noted on MS: &#x201C;better now.&#x201C;</note>&#x2014; Dear Mother, I have got your <hi rend="italic">Dressing gown</hi> on; and a capital one it is, and many a time it reminds me of your motherly heart and unwearied goodness to me,&#x2014;my dear old Mother! I also wear your stockings daily, often the <hi rend="italic">new</hi> ones of this year.

<salute>Dear Geraldine,</salute>
<p>Will you make my compliments to your Brother Frank; and say, with my hearty acknowledgements to him and yourself, that if I come to the grand meeting, I will either sleep in some H&#xF4;tel (<hi rend="italic">not</hi> the Palatine) or else in your House,&#x2014;the latter much the likelier branch of the alternative. Excellent tobacco, perfect quiet, and cordial human welcome: what House is there, however high, that can give me more, or in the same completeness so much? This point, therefore, may be considered <hi rend="italic">settled.</hi></p>
<p>But, alas, it is very dubious whether I can have the courage to come at all. Impulse is not wanting; for I am really in a kind of fixed rage at all these brutal nonsenses in which this poor world lies steeped at present, simmering and fermenting towards issues that are fearful to contemplate; a good mass of which nonsenses arrange themselves as obstacles to what is clearly first and all-important, an &#x201C;Education of the People&#x201C;;&#x2014;and certainly it would afford me some relief if I could tell the poor people a bit of my mind on that matter, for one! But on the other hand&#x2014; Alas, there are hundreds of considerations that rise formidable and questionable on &#x201C;the other hand&#x201C;: and just now, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi></foreign> [power of inertia], and natural human laziness, warmly seconding all these, the balance seems to bend pretty decisively on that cowardly side again!&#x2014; In two days or three I must decide; and you will hear from Espinasse, if not otherwise at first hand from Jane.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jewsbury wrote Neuberg, <date when="1849-12-22">22 Dec.</date>, about his own and TC&#x2019;s failure to attend the meeting for &#x201C;a good cause [where] several thousand persons were present&#x201C;: &#x201C;Carlyle behaved very&#x2014;shabily I was going to say but I suppose it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be treason&#x2014;but I cannot understand how a man fully convinced (as he professes to be) of the importance of an object allowing a natural disinclination to trouble to stand in the way of his exciting himself in the least&#x2014; there never was an occasion on w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he might have done so much good with so little trouble&#x201C; (MS: NLS 551.26). She wrote to JWC, <date when="1849-12-28">28 Dec.</date>, for &#x201C;a signature of Harriet Martineau and a specimen of Carlyle&#x2019;s caligraphy,&#x201C; also for &#x201C;a good large piece of Carlyle&#x201C; for &#x201C;a very nice little damsel, who just worships the sound of his name&#x201C; (Ireland 328).</note></p>

<salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster</salute>
<p>I hope in God the newspaper arrived safe!&#x2014; Henry looked so excited when he heard it was consigned to the post office, and exclaimed so wildly &#x201C;I would not for five pounds that it were lost! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Forster would be in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a way,&#x201C; that I quite trembled with apprehensions about it all the evening! M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C put it in with his own hand, and out of his own head&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am still confined to the house, in a very shabby condition indeed&#x2014;and need cheering spectacles (don&#x2019;t I wish I may get &#x2019;em?) a sight of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for example!</p>
<p>Meanwhile thanks for Moloch&#x2019;s book&#x2014;which I read with immense interest&#x2014;it is long since I fell in with a novel of this sort all about Love and nothing else whatever&#x2014;it quite reminds one of one&#x2019;s own <hi rend="italic">Love&#x2019;s young dream</hi>&#x2014; I like it&#x2014;and like the poor girl who can still believe or even &#x201C;believe that she believes&#x201C; all that! God help her&#x2014;she will sing to another tune if she go on living and writing for twenty years!</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Mr John Davis, Mr Robson&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reader</hi>, was of essential service, and did a good deal of work which could not in any sense be called typographical, in regard to those &#x201C;Lists&#x201C; adjoined to the Second Volume of the new <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi> The &#x201C;Committee Lists&#x201C; he as good as did from the foundation (my own man having quite failed there); in the &#x201C;Long-Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> List&#x201C; too he was very useful by his patient and exact revisal of the <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> in face of the Original Document it had been formed from.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An alphabetical list of M.P.s and their constituencies and &#x201C;Lists of the Eastern Assoc. Committees&#x201C; see <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 8:315&#x2013;51.</note></p>
<p>Both these Pieces I consider to be of real worth, and to enhance sensibly the value of the Book both intrinsically and as an article of sale. Neither of them, as you are aware, nor the &#x201C;Squire Papers&#x201C; which precedes them, was any part of my Bargain with you; the whole of these &#x201C;Adjuncts&#x201C; are quite a <hi rend="italic">volunteer</hi> addition:&#x2014;so that I am not quite clear who it will be in your opinion, or even in the nature of things, that ought to pay Mr Davis for this trouble of his. Paid, however, he very indisputably must be: and if you say it is I that should pay, why then it shall be I.</p>
<p>The matter being referred to my own valuation by Mr Davis, I will therefore request you to pay him <hi rend="italic">Five Pounds</hi> for those extra services; and to charge, if you find it proper, the whole or any part of that sum to my account when we come to settle.</p>
<p>I am bound farther to testify that Mr Davis went into the very bottom of the inquiry (in regard to those &#x201C;Committee Lists&#x201C;), and did his work like a man of real accuracy and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile tho&#x2019; I cannot sit still and resign myself to be ailing and useless neither can I work at anything for ten minutes together without being ready to sink&#x2014; I do a little at my great screen&#x2014;then read a little&#x2014;in three minutes fall to sewing&#x2014;sew on one button perhaps and then walk to and fro in the room then stretch myself on the sofa&#x2014;then recollect something forgotten and start up&#x2014;and so on like a tormented spirit&#x2014; Few people come to talk to me&#x2014; Bolte is not come back from Germany<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She was there from late summer to late <date when="1849-12-00">Dec.</date>; see <hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;ltes Briefe</hi> 72&#x2013;73.</note>&#x2014;Madam Pepoli has taken to <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> the poor people and seems to dislike me now&#x2014;has been here only twice since my return&#x2014; Plattnauer is gone back to Lord George&#x2014;mercifully&#x2014; John Carlyle still in Annandale&#x2014; Anthony Sterling who <hi rend="italic">is</hi> on the spot and has nothing to do more important in his own eyes than amusing me&#x2014;if it were possible&#x2014;is obliged to come rarely for peaces sake.

<p>There is a considerable mass of dislocated papers, definable as &#x2018;written rubbish&#x2019; for most part, now lying here, which must gradually get itself arranged into some form or other, by printing or else by burning: but I find nothing that could handily be got ready for your next number; nor indeed do I think the matter would in general be very suitable for that vehicle.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I wish to Heaven you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> deliver me of these Paper Bundles, now hung round my neck, and like to strangle the life out of me! But no, I fear you cannot yet;&#x2014;however, a word from you might help to throw light on the affair. Something must be decided <hi rend="italic">soon.</hi> I used to think, having plenty to say was a grand thing; but I find it now rather worse than having <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, for that would at lease<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> leave one a quiet life. Heigho! There is a mass of mud and street-sweepings (bigger than all Chadwick&#x2019;s), and at what corner to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> is and has long been a desperate mystery! For most part, I stand leaning on my shovel; looking at it with mere helpless dismay, <pb id="pg-24-307" n="24:307"/>unable to strike in anywhere with decision or fixed purpose. Probably I shall run away from it altogether, and seek shelter in the wildernesses?&#x2014;</p>
<p>I have a Banker,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Adamson.</note> inconveniently situated <hi rend="italic">in Dumfries;</hi> he can do second Draughts, easily by the aid of Penny Stamps. About a Hundred Pounds will be needed here; the rest may go to him: so please make it up in that way, when you come to see me, some morning soon.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1849-12-13">13 Dec.</date> TC signed a receipt stating: &#x201C;Received of Messrs Chapman &#x26; Hall, Four Hundred Pounds&#x2014;being the consideration for an edition of 1250 Copies of &#x2018;Letters &#x26; Speeches of Oliver Cromwell,&#x2019; printed by them / Thomas Carlyle / &#xa3;400&#x201C; (MS: Pierpont Morgan Lib.). Only the signature is in TC&#x2019;s hand.</note> First, however, look into a certain &#xa3;5 payable to one of Robson&#x2019;s men for extra services (<hi rend="italic">extra</hi> in two senses), and make a decision about that,&#x2014;which decision I will stand to.</p>
<p>The Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Books appear to have arrived safe at their destinations; at least one of them clearly has, and the other we can infer in the meanwhile.&#x2014; Of the two fractional Cromwells<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly the supplementary <hi rend="italic">The Squire Papers;</hi> see <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491223-TC-CR-01">TC to CR, <date when="1849-12-23">23 Dec.</date></ref></note> one is intended for Ireland; the other may come hither by any opportunity, by which too I could send back the First Vol. of the Irish one. Do you communicate with Waterford at all? Dublin, at any rate, will do.</p>
<p>Miss Brightwell&#x2019;s Etchings ought to have the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> put upon them:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18490424-TC-CLB-01">TC to CLB, <date when="1849-04-24">24 April</date></ref>.</note> if the Plates are in your hand, pray do not neglect that.</p>

<salute>My dear John</salute>
<p>I ought to tell you that I am <hi rend="italic">about</hi> again&#x2014;that is to say when it does not rain&#x2014;and that again is to say at rare intervals&#x2014; The weather is in fact detestable&#x2014;but it will mend in time&#x2014;which cant be said of all the detestable things one knows.&#x2014; The chief news to tell you is that I have got a dog!&#x2014;and can hardly believe my senses!&#x2014; I should never have mustered courage to risk such a great step, had not Dilberoglue the Greek I know in Manchester, having heard me talking about my wish for a dog which was merely a &#x201C;dont you wish you may get it&#x201C;? actually, on his return to Manchester, set about seeking one and fired it off at me by railway&#x2014;and so well has he sought and found, that here is a little dog perfectly beautiful and <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>looking, which does not <hi rend="italic">bark</hi> at all! nor whine, more than if it were deaf and dumb!! it sleeps at the foot of my bed without ever stirring or audibly breathing all night long and never dreams of getting up till I get up myself&#x2014;it follows me like my shadow and lies in my lap&#x2014;and at meals when animals are apt to be so troublesome it makes no sort of demonstration beyond standing on its hind legs! Not only has M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C no temptation to &#x201C;kick his foot thro it&#x201C; but seems getting quite fond of it and looks flattered <pb id="pg-24-309" n="24:309"/>when it musters the hardihood to leap on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> knee So <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is one small comfort achieved for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> really a comfort to have something alive and cheery and fond of me always there&#x2014; &#x2014; My fear now is not that M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C will put it away but that I shall become the envy of surrounding dog-stealers! Anthony Sterling says &#x201C;it is much too valuable a dog not to get itself stolen fast enough&#x201C;&#x2014; Well! I can but get a chain to fasten it to my arm and keep a sharp look out&#x2014;</p>
<p>My cold is away again&#x2014;but oh dear! &#x201C;my interior&#x201C; is always very miserable&#x2014;and nothing that I do or forbear seems to make the least difference&#x2014; The worst is the dreadful pressure on my faculties&#x2014;there <hi rend="italic">are</hi> kinds of illness that one can <hi rend="italic">work</hi> under&#x2014;but this sort of thing that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> go on with makes every thing next to <hi rend="italic">impossible</hi> for me&#x2014;</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Neuberg is always lamenting your absence&#x2014;he comes occasionally and plays chess with me, and I generally beat him&#x2014; What is it that makes that man so heavy?&#x2014;he is clever and well informed and wellbred and kind and has even some humour and yet&#x2014;when he goes away every time I yawn and yawn and feel so dished!</p>
<p>No thoughts of coming back yet? I miss you very bad</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C bids me tell you to cut out his &#x201C;trees of Liberty&#x201C; from the Nation and send it back&#x2014;</p>

Railway Guard (from Dilberoglue, Manchester) brought him in one evening late. A little Cuban (Maltese? and otherwise mongrel) shock, mostly white&#x2014;a most affectionate, lively little dog, otherwise of small merit, and little or no training. Much innocent sport there rose out of him; much quizzical ingenuous preparation of me for admitting of him: &#x2018;My dear, it&#x2019;s borne in upon my mind that I&#x2019;m to have a dog!&#x2019; &#x26;c. &#x26;c., and with such a look and style! We had many walks together, he and I, for the next ten years; a great deal of small traffic, poor little animal, so loyal, so loving, so <hi rend="italic">na&#x000ef;ve</hi> and true with what of dim intellect he had! Once, perhaps in his third year here, he came pattering upstairs to my garret; scratched duly, was let in, and brought me (literally) the <hi rend="italic">Gift of a</hi> HORSE (which I had talked of needing)! Brought me, to wit, a letter hung to his neck, inclosing on a saddler&#x2019;s card the picture of a horse, and adjoined to it her cheque for 50<hi rend="italic">l.</hi>&#x2014;full half of some poor legacy which had fallen to her! Can I ever forget such a thing? I was not slave enough to take the money; and got a horse next year, on the common terms&#x2014;but all Potosi [see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341028-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:326</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-10-28">28 Oct. 1834</date></corr></ref>], and the diggings new and old, had not in them, as I now feel, so rich a gift! Poor Nero&#x2019;s last good days were with us at Aberdour in <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>. Twice or thrice I flung him into the sea there, which he didn&#x2019;t at all like; and in consequence of which he even ceased to follow me at bathing time, the very strongest measure he could take&#x2014;or <hi rend="italic">pretend</hi> to take. For two or three mornings accordingly I had seen nothing of Nero; but the third or fourth morning, on striking out to swim a few yards, I heard gradually a kind of swashing behind me; looking back, it was Nero out on voluntary humble partnership&#x2014;ready to swim with me to Edinburgh or to the world&#x2019;s end if I liked! Fife had done his mistress, and still more him, a great deal of good. But, alas! in Cook&#x2019;s grounds here, within a month or two a butcher&#x2019;s cart (in <hi rend="italic">her</hi> very sight) ran over him neck and lungs; all winter he wheezed and suffered; &#x2018;<date when="1860-02-01">Feb. 1st, 1860</date>,&#x2019; he died (prussic acid, and the doctor obliged at last!)&#x2014;I could not have believed my grief then and since would have been the twentieth part of what it was&#x2014;nay, that the want of him would have been to me other than riddance. Our last midnight-walk together (for he insisted on trying to come), <date when="1860-01-31">Jan. 31</date>, is still painful to my thought. &#x2018;Little dim-white speck, of Life, of Love, Fidelity and Feeling, girdled by the Darkness as of Night Eternal!&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> tears were passionate and bitter; but repressed themselves as was fit, I think the first day. Top of the garden, by her direction, Nero was put under ground; a small stone tablet with date she also got&#x2014;which, broken by careless servants, is still there (a little protected now).&#x201C;</sourceNote><head>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,&#x2014;</salute>Many thanks for your two Letters; for all your punctuality. The last of your Letters came the day before yesterday, and here today about noon is the Barrel itself! I have opened it, before going out: all is tight and right,&#x2014;every thing looks good and excellent: nothing has been <hi rend="italic">tried</hi> fairly except Garthwaite&#x2019;s waistcoat; but if all the rest suit as well as that, we call ourselves well used in the matter! Jane will write, herself, I <pb id="pg-24-311" n="24:311"/>believe, about all that; nay she was talking a Letter to you this very day, but people I hear have come in upon her operations down below:&#x2014;this Note of mine is to concern <hi rend="italic">our Mother&#x2019;s Shoes</hi> and little else, for there is need of despatch in regard to that.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to the Shoemaker (one Grundy, in St Martin&#x2019;s Lane):<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Grundy, boot manufacturer, 44 St. Martin&#x2019;s Lane.</note> he tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> make a pair of shoes to fit from an old shoe; but petitioned hard to be favoured with some <hi rend="italic">measurements</hi> as well; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have no doubt <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can do, if you take a folded spill of clean paper and try, as you have seen the Shoemakers do here. There are 3 grand measurements besides the length of the foot: put your folded spill accurately round, and make a small tear or nick with your nail, at each of these 3 places: 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, over the toes (at the spread of the foot where it is broadest); 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, perpendicular over the instep where it is highest; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, from heel to front where it is lowest (the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of distance that way): these are the three grand dimensions, to be done by <hi rend="italic">nicks</hi> as I describe, which the Artist here <hi rend="italic">understand</hi> even in a <hi rend="italic">mute</hi> condition. Lastly, however, he wished a trace of the sole (as you have seen Salter&#x2019;s people<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably a Dumfriesshire shoemaker.</note> do it): with these, aided by an old shoe, he certainly ought to consider himself equipt!&#x2014; Today the old shoe itself having come to view, I am constrained to say that it offers but a faint resemblance to the foot; and the new demand for measures seems to me an indispensable one. Up, therefore! Please let me have them with all despatch: I will send up the shoe but strictly charge the man not to stir till your new helps arrive. Also say whether my Mother would not like the shoe to come much better over the instep than this? In fact whether there is any objection, except ease of getting off and on, to its coming up as far as my own do, or as the man (with his india-rubber apparatus) wishes?&#x2014; Perhaps it makes no difference to him, but perhaps also it does: mention it therefore. And now enough, dear Brother.</p>
<p>Your <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> shall be sought out,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-24/lt-18491223-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1849-12-23">23 Dec.</date></ref></note> and all shall be ready to go (if we can manage it) so soon as the shoes are ready.

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept my thanks for your very kind and valuable Gift: I have duly received your First volume of that important Biography,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hanna, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Thomas Chalmers, D.D., L.L.D.</hi>, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date>).</note> and have gone over it with much pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The spirit is excellent: pious, gentle and discreet, yet frank, cheerful and genial. Your plan too is beyond question the best,&#x2014;that of making Chalmers himself, for most part, tell his own story. His utterances have in them a <hi rend="italic">veracity</hi> which is the highest merit of speech, and which is very rare indeed in these poor times,&#x2014;or rather, we may say, is unexampled in them elsewhere. Such utterances, in whatever dialect of speech or of ideas they may come, bring <hi rend="italic">their</hi> human credentials with them, and cannot be refused admittance with brotherly welcome, to the hearts of all men. From this First volume, with its multifarious details, I gather a fine, fresh, <hi rend="italic">breezy</hi> view of poor old Scotland and poor old Fife again; and look into the soul of a most brave, robust, true-hearted, healthy man, such as it is a pleasure to look upon in whatever <hi rend="italic">coat</hi> or vesture he appear;&#x2014;and truly, in a Churchman&#x2019;s coat, I know not when there has appeared the like of him, or the second to him, in Scotland or out of it, for a great while back indeed! Be the memory of such preserved and promulgated to all lengths and breadths!&#x2014;</p>
<p><closer><salute>I heartily wish you good speed in your pious task; and with many thanks on my own behalf and on the world&#x2019;s,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Remain always very sincerely yours</salute></closer>

<salute>Dear Redwood,</salute>
<p>Many thanks to you once more. Your never-failing memorial of this season reached us yesterday, in perfect safety: a welcome testimony of a true man&#x2019;s silent loyalty and love, which, testified or not, well deserves to be precious to me in this bad world. There is something almost affecting in those silent messages; their modest silence more impressive than any eloquence or profession! The <hi rend="italic">words</hi> of this poor generation being mostly lies, men that have a meaning in them are reduced to express it, for most part, by <hi rend="italic">silence.</hi> Again many thanks; and long may you live to be friendly to us in your still hermitage, and useful to yourself and to your fellow mortals in this world!</p>
<p>Often enough have you been present to my thoughts since you last specially heard of me. For I am overloaded with confusions, outward and inward; and I do believe, a man as solitary as you yourself are,&#x2014;perhaps even more. In my bewilderments, I have often thought of flying to your Cottage for refuge from the intolerable tumult, when it threatens to get too bad upon me; I feel as if there lay in the world no safer retreat for me than there,&#x2014;by the shore of the many-sounding Sea, far away from all <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi> babblement, for a season! And really it is possible I may run over to you suddenly, and that before long. Once or twice I have been not far from that adventure; and other similar occasions lie before me not very distant. Do not take the trouble of writing to ask me: I know I am always welcome to you, which assurance is a true possession to me; and if the measure seem feasible at any time, I will come without asking, merely announcing myself and arriving.&#x2014; When I went to Ireland last autumn, it was almost a toss-up whether it should not be to you. Ireland did not yield &#x201C;pleasure&#x201C;; it yielded pain, disgust and occasionally almost despair: but it was instructive, or might have been, and perhaps something will grow out of the visit for me yet.</p>
<p>A great question is now, in deep silence, agitating me, as to certain masses of Paper-rubbish accumulated here: Whether the fire shall have them, or the printer? And if the latter shall, whether it ought to be as a Book or as a Series of Pamphlets? Say nothing about it: a month hence, it will be decided, and you shall <hi rend="italic">see</hi></p>
<p>By post, along with this, comes a small thin <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> to Cromwell 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> <pb id="pg-24-314" n="24:314"/>edit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x2014;which, if you have not before seen the <hi rend="italic">Squire Letters</hi>, may amuse you for a moment.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Squire Papers: List of the Long Parliament; and Lists of the Eastern-Association Committees</hi>, supplementary to <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>, Chapman &#x26; Hall, price 3s., rptd. from <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s</hi> (<date when="1847-12-00">Dec. 1847</date>), advertised as pbd. early <date when="1849-11-00">Nov.</date>; see Tarr 126. On <date when="1849-12-20">20 Dec.</date> the Rev. Dr. Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward (<date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>; <ref target="volume-24/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29942"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), librarian and antiquarian who had grown up in Norwich, a friend of John Childs, called on TC. He brought firsthand information about William Squire, who claimed that he lent two Cromwell letters to Woodward&#x2019;s late father, a Norwich antiquary, and asked for their return. Woodward replied that no such letters were among his father&#x2019;s papers, and Squire sent a vituperative letter, which Woodward left with TC (MS: Bancroft Lib., Univ. of Calif., Berkeley). In a note appended to the letter and dated <date when="1849-12-21">21 Dec.</date>, TC commented that Woodward&#x2019;s reply seemed to have &#x201C;roused the anger of W. Squire in some rather unaccountable way.&#x201C; Above the line here TC wrote, at a later date: &#x201C;(read <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and you may account for it.&#x2014;some day).&#x201C; This comment, like that in the unsent letter to Henry I. Carr, suggests that TC was unwilling to face his serious doubts about Squire&#x2019;s veracity. TC&#x2019;s note was also about Woodward&#x2019;s account of Squire&#x2019;s eccentric family and about Squire himself having inscribed &#x201C;O.C. <date when="1640-00-00">1640</date>&#x201C; on a window of Norwich Castle, as an idle act or to trick Woodward (MS: Bancroft Lib.; pbd: Wright, <hi rend="italic">SP</hi> 343&#x2013;45).</note>&#x2014; We have frost now, after much mud. In health we are as well as usual; which is not at all a high figure of wellness. I think of a horse again, if I go on with these &#x201C;Pamphlets.&#x201C; <closer><salute>God bless you always.</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have the Box, the Shoes, and the essential of the Books quite ready; and my notion was to-day to pack and send them off by Pickford at once: but on second tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> I find it will be safer to put a word of inquiry to you first, and ascertain that we are not <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> somewhere. Jane has brought down a <hi rend="italic">Dante</hi> done by &#x201C;Carolus Witte&#x201C; (Leipzic <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date>) into <hi rend="italic">Latin Hexameters</hi> by the &#x201C;Abbate dalla Piazza&#x201C;; a thinnish octavo volume, which you have covered in grey paper&#x2014;is that accurately it? She asserts so: but your Letter has fallen aside somewhere; and I conclude, tho&#x2019; reluctantly, to ask again and see. Then as to the other Book or Books for your &#x201C;evening reading&#x201C;: we have the <hi rend="italic">Shakspeare</hi> quite ready, but doubt it might get <hi rend="italic">spoiled</hi> (your own nicely bound one,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; there is a one-volume copy, free of this objection), also that you might find it rather languid reading, &#x26;c &#x26;c. I have just ended an English <hi rend="italic">Lucian</hi>, two quarto voll. &#x201C;from the German of Wieland,&#x201C; a London Library Book; really lively reading, and was minded to send you that <foreign><hi rend="italic">meo periculo</hi></foreign> [at my risk];&#x2014;then farther there is <hi rend="italic">Preuss</hi>, two Books of his about King Fritz; instructive, interesting too, tho&#x2019; toughish <pb id="pg-24-315" n="24:315"/>reading:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably <hi rend="italic">Lucian, from the Greek, with the Comments and Illustrations of Wieland and others</hi>, trans. W. Tooke, 2 vols. (<date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>). Johann David Erdman Preuss (<date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>; see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450407-TC-KAVE-01"><sic>19:51</sic><corr>TC to KAVE, <date when="1845-04-07">7 April 1845</date></corr></ref>) wrote several books on Frederick the Great, the fullest being <hi rend="italic">Friedrich der Grosse. Eine Lebensgeschichte</hi>, 4 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>). TC probably means his <hi rend="italic">Die Lebensgeschichte des grossen k&#xF6;nigs Friedrich von Preussen</hi>, 2 pts. (Berlin, <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>); see <ref target="volume-19/lt-18450917-TC-JWC-01"><sic>19:199</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1845-09-17">17 Sept. 1845</date></corr></ref>. John Carlyle wrote, <date when="1849-12-25">25 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The Dante you describe is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the one I want: that is in folio, &#x26; old parchment binding. Mind it no more. &#x2026; Jamie has a Shakspeare in one volume, w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may do in the meanwhile for me. &#x2026; The Lucian &#x26; Preuss I have already seen. In brief, let the Chalmers&#x2019; Life &#x26; the shoes be dispatched alone.&#x201C;</note> not to mention other possibilities, here or in Cochrane&#x2019;s Establish<hi rend="italic">t.</hi> On the whole, say definitely, and we will do, so far as feasible. The Box is a trim nice light little thing, some 2 f 4 by 1 f 4 and 8 inches deep (perhaps); and will hold a great many Books: indeed, if there be not more Books than you once spoke of, I think a Paper Parcel will do the job.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with regard to Newspapers. I made the man send you two &#x201C;Illustrated&#x201C; ones last week, the only two there were,&#x2014;6<hi rend="italic">d</hi> apiece;&#x2014;select either, if you like either for my Mother and you; tell me what to do about the old one, and I will pay it off at the same time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carlyle responded, <date when="1849-12-25">25 Dec.</date>: &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">two</hi> illustrated newspapers arrrived safely. Our mother &#x26; I both thought the <hi rend="italic">text</hi> of them rather empty, &#x26; she prefers continuing the old one. The Newsman who sends it is Mr. Welbeck &#x26; he lives in the northwest corner of Sloan Square. &#x2026; His account will be some ten or twelve shillings, &#x26; <hi rend="italic">I will tell him to send it to you</hi>, &#x26; to continue the paper he now forwards to us.&#x201C;</note> Miss Wynne writes to me the new <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> with &#x201C;Labour and the Poor&#x201C; will need to be <hi rend="italic">returned</hi> to Grafton Street, if I accept them: I think I must <hi rend="italic">decline</hi> that offer; in fact, I have been thinking to take out a secondhand <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>, as I had the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> once: what say you to that?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;I think you would find the Chronicle, coming daily, rather tiresome. Our Mother has given over reading the articles on the Poor, &#x26; they are not worth sending for me in my present turmoils&#x201C; (<date when="1849-12-25">25 Dec.</date>).</note> Do you care anything about it for Scotsbrig? No other N<hi rend="italic">os</hi> will come from me (in fact I shall get no more) till I hear.&#x2014; Chorley paid me his 8/6 for the meal,&#x2014;excellent meal, as I can testify; the butter also unsurpassable.&#x2014; I think the <hi rend="italic">shoes</hi> will really answer. They came last night, rather before expectation, and seem carefully made, according to all the measures and model and directions.&#x2014; A word tomorrow before this go. <hi rend="italic">No more today</hi>, dear Brother.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Monday afternoon.</hi> No time dear Brother; I have been very busy all forenoon, and have still much to do out of doors and in.

<salute>My dearest Betty</salute>
<p>This newyear&#x2019;s day letter, I hope, will not seem to you to come from such a far country as the others you have had from me these good many years back.&#x2014;not that I am any <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> you; counting by mile stones; but having seen and kissed me so lately, you must feel me less a stranger to you than I was getting to be.&#x2014; You know you found me &#x201C;just the same <hi rend="italic">Miss Welsh</hi> as ever&#x201C;&#x2014;and so I am so far kind love towards you and towards my old home is concerned, and so I would always be if I lived to a hundred&#x2014;but for the rest; the Miss Welsh you first knew was a considerably <hi rend="italic">blither</hi> character than I am now a-days&#x2014;especially in winter weather!&#x2014;I am not however confined altogether to the house <hi rend="italic">this</hi> winter, I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> confined with a cold for three weeks, but it is gone now, and I go out for a little walk every tolerable day. I am <hi rend="italic">never</hi> quite well&#x2014;hardly ever any thing like <hi rend="italic">so</hi> well as you saw me in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was not much to brag of&#x2014;but I say nothing about it, and put as good a face on myself as I can, so long as I am only able to keep on foot and mind my affairs, such as they are. If I had <hi rend="italic">you</hi> here to pet me and take care of both myself and my house, I dare say I should indulge in a good deal more lamentation.</p>
<p>Elizabeth goes on very well however. so long as I am able to look after her, and cheer her up, her spirits being too low for so young a creature or at least extremely unequal&#x2014;but I shall never dare to leave her alone in the house again after her illness last time, which I am quite sure was caused entirely by her feeling quite miserable alone&#x2014;and I cannot remain <hi rend="italic">always</hi> here watching <hi rend="italic">her.</hi> So I often wish I could fall in with some elderly servant suitable to me&#x2014;one who had seen enough of life to know that the world was not made exactly for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> convenience, and that &#x201C;what can&#x2019;t be cured must be endured&#x201C;&#x2014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have got a little dog, that is almost as engaging as <hi rend="italic">Shandy</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s dog; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261001-JBW-MW-01"><sic>4:140</sic><corr>JBW to MW, <date when="1826-10-01">1 Oct. 1826</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-14/lt-18420326-TC-JGL-01"><sic>14:96</sic><corr>TC to JGL, <date when="1842-03-26">26 March 1842</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;tho&#x2019; no <hi rend="italic">new</hi> dog can ever <hi rend="italic">replace</hi> dear little Shandy in my affections&#x2014; This one was sent me from Manchester under charge of the Guard of the Railway&#x2014;he is about the size of Shandy but has long white silky hair hanging all about him&#x2014;and over his eyes which are very large and black&#x2014;I was afraid M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle would have found him a plague and ordered him about his business&#x2014;and so he would if the dog had been noisy&#x2014;but he is as good as dumb&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">never</hi> barks unless I make him do it in play&#x2014;and then when <pb id="pg-24-317" n="24:317"/>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C comes in bad humour the little beast never troubles its head but dances round him on its hind legs, till he <hi rend="italic">comes to</hi> and feels quite grateful for its confidence in his good-will&#x2014; So he gives it <hi rend="italic">rasens</hi>, of which it is very fond, one by one, and blows tobacco smoke in its face which it does not like so well&#x2014;and calls it &#x201C;you little villain&#x201C; in a tone of great kindness.</p>
<p>I am sending you for new year&#x2019;s gift something that I think you will like very much to have&#x2014;a vol. of <hi rend="italic">Logan&#x2019;s Sermons</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Logan (<date when="1748-00-00">1748</date>&#x2013;<date when="1788-00-00">88</date>), preacher and poet who came from nr. Haddington; perhaps a 1-vol. rpt. of his <hi rend="italic">Sermons</hi>, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, <date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>).</note>&#x2014; In reading them you will seem to hear my Mother&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have done before now&#x2014; Perhaps the book may not be delivered along with this letter altho sent off by the same post&#x2014;as there is sometimes a delay about parcels&#x2014;but if it do not come within a day or so after you must write and tell me. I have not heard very lately from my Aunts&#x2014;indeed I have not written to them for some weeks, having had a deal of bothering work to do of one sort and another</p>
<p>God bless you dear Betty&#x2014; Remember me kindly to your Husband<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander Braid.</note> and son&#x2014; How does the <hi rend="italic">egg-trade</hi> go on?&#x2014; Many thanks for your offer of meal&#x2014;but we get a barrel of oatmeal each year from Scotsbrig where they have it <hi rend="italic">remarkably</hi> good, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> generally take porride for supper&#x2014;</p>

<salute>Dearest M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell</salute>
<p>To think that I should never have written you one line since the distracted little note I sent you from Nottingham in <date when="1849-07-00">July</date> last! and so often as I have thought of it too! Nay, I actually began a letter one day of <date when="1849-10-00">October</date>&#x2014;I had just been writing <hi rend="italic">Drumlanrig Castle Thornhill</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Seat of the duke of Buccleuch.</note> on the back of a letter to Lady Ashburton who was on a visit there, and had written me out the address as particularly as if I had never heard of Drumlanrig in my life!&#x2014;and it struck me as something quite <hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi> that I should be writing <hi rend="italic">Thornhill</hi> after any other name than yours, just as when I first wrote to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I found it so very strange and sad to be writing that place after any ones name but my mothers&#x2014; And so by way of making amends to <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi>, I began a second letter, one to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&#x2014;to go by the same post&#x2014;but some visitor <pb id="pg-24-318" n="24:318"/>came in, and what does not get done by me at <hi rend="italic">the right moment</hi> is apt to miss getting done altogether&#x2014;</p>
<p>When I wrote from Nottingham I remember I durst not trust myself to tell you any thing about me even if there had been <hi rend="italic">leisure</hi> for it&#x2014; I was in such a nervous state&#x2014;promised to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> C and to my own mind to go to Scotland, but afraid to make my purpose known, lest after all I should <hi rend="italic">shirk</hi> it at the last moment, as I had done before&#x2014; And even if I got into Scotland, I could not have told you, for my life, what I was going to do there&#x2014;where I should go or not go&#x2014;sometimes in <hi rend="italic">brave</hi> moments I thought of visiting Thornhill as well as Haddington and then it seemed all but impossible for me ever to set foot in either place and if I did I was not sure that I would show myself to any living person of my friends in either the one place or the other&#x2014; So I thought it best to say nothing to you of my intentions till I ascertained by <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> what part of them I could carry out&#x2014; It was not till I was in the Railway for Haddington that I was <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> I was really going there&#x2014; And I did spend a night there, in the principal Inn the windows of which looked out on our old house, without any one suspecting who I was&#x2014;I arrived at six in the evening and left at eleven next day after having walked over the whole place and seen every thing that I wished to see&#x2014;except the people!&#x2014; I could not have stood <hi rend="italic">their</hi> embraces and tears and &#x201C;all that sort of thing&#x201C; without breaking down entirely&#x2014;so I left that part of the business till the agitation caused by the sight of the old <hi rend="italic">place</hi> should have subsided and I could return with my nerves in good order&#x2014;which I did for three days after having been six weeks in Fife and other places with which I had no associations either sad or gay.&#x2014; It was the same when I went to Annandale&#x2014;till the last moment I was not sure I could go&#x2014;and would not have gone but for the pain I was going to give my Husbands family by passing them by&#x2014; Actually when I left Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> for Ecclefechan I did not know whether the Railway went thro&#x2019; Thornhill!&#x2014;had not dared to satisfy myself!&#x2014;and at all the stations after I got into Dumfriesshire I <hi rend="italic">kept my eyes shut</hi>&#x2014; This will sound to you like sheer madness&#x2014;but it was no worse than extreme <hi rend="italic">nervousness</hi>&#x2014;which I <hi rend="italic">could not</hi> controul, and so must be excused for&#x2014; I stayed only two days at Scotsbrig and then hurried on to Manchester where I was retained by severe illness&#x2014; Another time it will not be so bad I hope and I shall behave more like a rational woman&#x2014; You may believe I got little good of <hi rend="italic">the country</hi> under such circumstances I returned to London so ill and continued ill so long a time that I got into the way of doing nothing I could possibly help&#x2014;and so it happened that having lightened my conscience of the half sovereign which a Miss Skinner<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> undertook to convey to you I postponed writing till&#x2014;now!&#x2014;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-24-319" n="24:319"/>If anniversaries be in many respects painful things there<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thus in MS.</note> useful at least in putting <hi rend="italic">orderly</hi> people like me on settling up their duties as well as their accounts&#x2014;and so I am busier this week than for months back bringing up my correspondence &#x26;c &#x26;c&#x2014; Fortunately I am on foot, and even able to go out a little in the forenoon&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the frost is hard enough&#x2014; I seem to have got off this winter with only three weeks confinement&#x2014;for the rest the pleasantest fact in my life for a good while is that I have got a beautiful little dog&#x2014;that I hope I will not make such a fool of myself with as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Mundel<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Widow of Robert Mundell of Closeburn; see <ref target="volume-17/lt-18430812-TC-JWC-01"><sic>17:39</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1843-08-12">12 Aug. 1843</date></corr></ref>.</note> used to make of herself with&#x2014;what was the objects name?&#x2014; He is not of course either so pretty or so clever as <hi rend="italic">Shandy</hi>&#x2014;and if he were <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should not think so&#x2014;but he is &#x201C;better than I deserve,&#x201C; as Coleridge said of his <hi rend="italic">cold</hi> tea.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340627-TC-AC-01"><sic>7:223</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1834-06-27">27 June 1834</date></corr></ref> and <hi rend="italic">The Life of John Sterling, Works</hi> 11:58.</note> and I like him better than I choose to <hi rend="italic">show&#x2014;publicly</hi>&#x2014; The sad part of the business is that I dare not take him out with me without a chain, for fear of <hi rend="italic">the dog stealers</hi> who are a numerous and active body&#x2014;</p>
<p>I am sending you for good luck a book which I hope you will get some amusement out of&#x2014;perhaps the best newyears gift one can make&#x2014;a little amusement I mean&#x2014; The two bits of things for Margaret and Mary<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hiddlestone and Mills.</note> you will give them with my kind remembrance&#x2014;and the post office order I need not point out the use of&#x2014; <closer><salute>God bless you dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell&#x2014;with Love to your Husband and Father I am ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>
