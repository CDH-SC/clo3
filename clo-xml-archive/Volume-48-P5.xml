<div1 type="section" id="ed-48-introduction">
<head><title><pb id="pg-48-xi" n="48:xi"/>Introduction</title></head>
<p>The letters in this volume cover the two-year span from <date when="1871-10">October 1871</date> to <date when="1873-09">September 1873</date>. During this period, TC lamented his lack of purpose even as he persistently sought ways to extend his influence upon his times. These efforts were colored by mercurial swings in his mood, ranging from mordant humor at the prospect of his demise, to nostalgia for his earlier days as a struggling writer. Inevitably, his sentimental forays into the past were undercut by his realization of the myriad sacrifices that JWC had made to secure his success, and by his unwitting neglect of her. TC was also haunted by the need to clarify his legacy, particularly in circumstances where he was surrounded by followers such as William Allingham, Moncure Daniel Conway, Charles Gavan Duffy, John Forster, James Anthony Froude, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, David Masson, Charles Eliot Norton, James Fitzjames Stephen, John Ruskin, and John Tyndall, all of whom were eager to interpret his wisdom for posterity. Referring to Conway&#x02019;s assiduous attempts to befriend him, TC quipped to Emerson that &#x0201C;I will not employ <supplied>[him]</supplied>, should I need a Boswell (which I never shall)&#x0201D; (TC to RWE, <date when="1872-04-02">2 April 1872</date>). Yet TC&#x02019;s anxieties about the ephemerality of his fame and authority were sharpened by the loss of relatives and friends.</p>
<p>The sudden accidental death of TC&#x02019;s nephew James Aitken on <date when="1871-09-25">25 September 1871</date> reinforced his proclivities towards silence. To his sister, Jean C. Aitken, he wrote: &#x0201C;&#x02018;It is Gods holy will&#x02019; is all that any of us can say or think upon it;&#x02014;and to think it so with our whole heart is far better than any speaking of it; and the sole assuagement that exists for any of us&#x0201D; (TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date>). On <date when="1871-10-09">9 October</date>, he received a request from Thomas Erskine&#x02019;s nephew James to write a brief tribute to his father for a &#x0201C;pleasant &#x00026; useful memorial.&#x0201D; TC commented to his sister Jean that &#x0201C;I cannot for my life think what to say about Erskine that could be suitable for the public it is meant for; but yet I suppose there will be no avoiding of an attempt to say something! I much dislike this kind of demand upon me (which comes far oftener than I could expect); but on reflecting, too, I should perhaps admit that in a case like Erskine&#x02019;s especially, it has its value to me and its uses&#x0201D; (TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date>). But TC could not bring himself to comment on &#x0201C;Saint Thomas&#x0201D; (Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 6:207), whose &#x0201C;rose-pink&#x0201D; Christian piety was antithetical to his more &#x0201C;Rhadamanthine&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 12:429) perspective. He sent James Erskine &#x0201C;about 20 &#x02026; Letters&#x0201D; retrieved by his niece and assistant, Mary Aitken, but refused to contribute to the proposed volume (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct.</date></ref>).</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-xii" n="48:xii"/>With less reserve, TC thanked John Forster profusely for sending him the first volume of <hi rend="italic">The Life of Dickens</hi> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>): &#x0201C;I am already deep in it, sat reading there, in fact, till 2 this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>. I need not tell you, what you already guess privately and all the world will confirm, that it is of the liveliest interest, and dextrously and exactly done: easy to prophesy that it will go round the globe, and be eagerly read by thousands on thousands of men&#x0201D; (TC to JF, <date when="1871-11-29">29 Nov. 1871</date>). Yet Carlyle was &#x0201C;privately&#x0201D; also startled by the book&#x02019;s reception. He informed his brother John that &#x0201C;there are already subscribed for about four thousand copies&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1871-12-07">7 Dec. 1871</date>). In a letter to Gavan Duffy, he described the &#x0201C;perfect rage or public famine (Copies not to be supplied fast enough)&#x0201D; (TC to CGD, <date when="1871-12-12">12 Dec. 1871</date>). Perhaps recalling earlier invitations issued to him by Emerson to visit the U.S., which he had considered but never acted upon, TC took particular interest in Forster&#x02019;s account of Dickens&#x02019;s tumultuous first North American tour in <date when="1842">1842</date>. The novelist&#x02019;s frank criticism of the American &#x0201C;bores&#x0201D;&#x02014;a judgment that TC echoed in <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets</hi> (<date when="1850">1850</date>)&#x02014;and their crude manners and morals, as well as his attacks against their piratical copyright laws, had generated widespread controversy. TC confided to Duffy: &#x0201C;Me nothing in [the volume] so surprises as these &#x02026; American explosions round poor Dickens, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> Yankee-doodle-dodom blazing up like one universal Soda-water Bottle round so very measurable a Phenomenon, this and the way the Phenomenon takes it was curiously and even genially interesting to me&#x0201D; (TC to CGD, <date when="1871-12-12">12 Dec. 1871</date>).</p>
<p>But TC, to whom Forster had been sending advance drafts of the book, already knew that the &#x0201C;comical&#x0201D; conclusion to the first volume contrasted sharply with the &#x0201C;dark&#x0201D; finish to the second, where Forster described the novelist&#x02019;s grief at the loss of his infant daughter Dora. Dickens&#x02019;s reaction to her death, quoted by Forster, resonated deeply with TC: &#x0201C;<supplied>[H]</supplied>ow often it is with all of us, that in our several spheres we have to do violence to our feelings, and to hide our hearts in carrying on in this fight of life, if we would bravely discharge in it our duties and responsibilities&#x0201D; (Forster, <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> 2:460). These &#x0201C;very tragic and very mournful&#x0201D; (TC to CGD, <date when="1871-12-12">12 Dec. 1871</date>) words seemed to summarize TC&#x02019;s own predicament as he turned seventy-six. Lionized by the public and besieged by admirers, he disliked having to keep up a posture of gratitude and seized any chance he could to escape from the commotion. With his niece, he began translating the Faereyinga Saga from a German translation and writing a brief history of the early Norse kings. It offered a respite from the tiresome &#x0201C;celebrity hunters&#x0201D; who tormented him with mundane requests. To his brother he complained, &#x0201C;A full week ago you were promised to have that poor &#x02018;Preface&#x02019; to the Saga &#x02026; alas, it is not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> finished, nor dare I promise it in another week. Nothing can excel or equal the interruptions &#x00026; paltry obstacles that have continually come in the way of ending it: but end it I will, if spared alive;&#x02014;nay, in the meanwhile, it is better <pb id="pg-48-xiii" n="48:xiii"/>to me, with all its chaotic adjuncts, than if I had in my mind nothing at all to regard as &#x02018;Work&#x02019;&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1872-01-20">20 Jan. 1872</date>).</p>
 <p>Yet &#x0201C;work&#x0201D; could not prevent TC from periodically being overwhelmed by memories of JWC and their remote Scottish past. A letter from Colonel David Davidson, childhood friend of JWC, received by TC, <date when="1872-02-12">12 February 1872</date>, &#x0201C;with much emot<hi rend="italic">n</hi>,&#x0201D; jolted him into a renewed bout of introspection. Davidson had recently visited JWC&#x02019;s nurse and companion Betty Braid at her home in Greenend, South Edinburgh. During their conversation, she recalled JWC&#x02019;s father, Dr. John Welsh, and &#x0201C;the circumstances of his illness &#x00026; death&#x0201D; (Davidson, <hi rend="italic">Memories</hi> 325; see <ref target="volume-48/ed-48-appendix"><sic>Appendix</sic><corr>Betty Braid&#x02019;s Narrative</corr></ref>). In her laconic manner, which for TC evoked &#x0201C;fine old Scotch practicality, and simple wisdom&#x0201D; (TC to DD, <date when="1872-02-22">22 Feb. 1872</date>), Braid conveyed JWC&#x02019;s agonized response to her father&#x02019;s demise: &#x0201C;She was sitting on the chair, when she got up wi&#x02019; a scream, an&#x02019; cried, &#x02018;I maun see my father!&#x02019; an&#x02019; rushed to the locked door o&#x02019; his room; but, before she could open it, Dr. Howden gat her in his airms, an&#x02019; she fainted clean awa&#x02019;. He carried her through the drawing-room, ye ken, to the little bedroom aff it, an&#x02019; laid her on the bed beside her puir mother that was lying there in deid swoon; an&#x02019; there they were, like twa deid corpses!&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-48/ed-48-appendix"><sic>Appendix</sic><corr>Betty Braid&#x02019;s Narrative</corr></ref>). For TC, who had struggled awkwardly but persistently to live up to the heroic ideals that Dr. Welsh had embodied for JWC, this narrative recaptured a bitter-sweet phase of his existence. Betty Braid herself constituted &#x0201C;the last living link of scenes and places now all departed, but dear and sacred to me as no others are&#x0201D; (TC to DD, <date when="1872-02-22">22 Feb. 1872</date>). Across the front of the envelope containing Davidson&#x02019;s letter, TC wrote, &#x0201C;what a unique of Histories it has been to me! To be reposited in my <hi rend="italic">safest</hi> place&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">Here</hi>.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>The death of Giuseppe Mazzini on <date when="1872-03-30">30 March</date> elicited more ambivalent feelings. TC commended the Italian patriot&#x02019;s steadfast devotion to the nationalist cause, which he grudgingly conceded to Conway had been successful: &#x0201C;He died receiving the homage of the people, and seeing Italy united, with Rome for its capital. &#x02026; We wait to see whether Italy will make anything great out of what she has got&#x0201D; (Moncure D. Conway, <hi rend="italic">Autobiography, Memories and Experiences, 2 vols</hi>. [Boston and New York, <date when="1904">1904</date>] 2:67). Uneasy about Mazzini&#x02019;s close friendship with JWC, particularly in the darkest stages of their marriage in the <date when="1850">1850</date>s, TC preferred to distance himself from the Italian on political rather than personal grounds. But the line separating the two spheres was never clear, as TC acknowledged. On <date when="1872-02-01">1 February</date>, he exclaimed to William Allingham: &#x0201C;Poor Mazzini! lying dead there&#x02014;all done, all over. What a bright young man when he came in here in <date when="1836">1836</date> and sat on that sofa! He got into &#x02018;solidarity&#x02019; and all manner of absurdities. He used to trouble himself about every wretched Italian who was in any way political. There was one Italian who fell in love with a <hi rend="italic">danseuse</hi> and stabbed himself; Mazzini took care of him, recovered him, and persuaded the girl to marry him&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Allingham Diary</hi> 208; <pb id="pg-48-xiv" n="48:xiv"/>see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720330-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-03-30">30 March 1872</date></ref>). TC was ignorant of the extent to which he himself had benefitted from such selfless and &#x0201C;absurd&#x0201D; behavior. It had been Mazzini who had striven to console JWC in her misery, and to counsel her to remain faithful to her husband, despite her loneliness and wretchedness (see <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460706-JWC-TC-01"><sic>20:222</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1846-07-06">6 July 1846</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-20/lt-18460707-TC-JWC-01"><sic>23</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1846-07-07">7 July 1846</date></corr></ref>).</p>
<p>As an antidote to these often painful reminders of the receding past, TC tried to keep focused on the evolving &#x0201C;Condition of England,&#x0201D; which he described in a phrase borrowed from T. H. Huxley as &#x0201C;administrative nihilism.&#x0201D; His summary of democratic culture suggested that he had lost none of his corrosive powers of analysis: &#x0201C;<supplied>[A]</supplied> Government carried on by Parliamentary palaver and Universal Suffrage, with penny newspapers presiding, must necessarily be a Do-nothingism, and neglect <supplied>[not]</supplied> only its Colonies, but every other interest, temporal and eternal, except that of getting majorities itself by hook or by crook&#x0201D; (TC to CGD, <date when="1871-12-12">12 Dec. 1871</date>). At some point in spring or early summer <date when="1872">1872</date>, TC began composing a pamphlet, later published by William Paterson in <date when="1882">1882</date> as <hi rend="italic">Last Words of Thomas Carlyle On Trades-Unions Promoterism and The Signs of the Times</hi>. TC gave the piece, dated <date when="1872-07-12">12 July 1872</date>, to his nephew John Aitken, who was helping him with business matters. In the preface to the published version, Aitken referred to it as a &#x0201C;Latter-Day Pamphlet,&#x0201D; serving as an &#x0201C;outline or index to [Carlyle&#x02019;s] Literary Will and Testimony&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720713-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-07-13">13 July 1872</date></ref>). TC covered familiar topics with biting acumen and originality: the corruption of Trades Unions (whose aims he broadly supported) from the older Guild ideal of the nobility of labor to the more recent &#x0201C;Mammonite&#x0201D; conception of an organization &#x0201C;avowedly for increase of wages alone&#x0201D; (8&#x02013;9); the shoddiness and mediocrity of manufactured goods; and the continued ascendance of &#x0201C;Feudalism and Preservation of the Game&#x0201D; over &#x0201C;Industrialism and Government by the Wisest&#x0201D; (15). But in a fresh excursion, he highlighted the rise of &#x0201C;Promoters,&#x0201D; a &#x0201C;new-sprung Sect of people &#x02026; well known in the City region just now, and spreading there like a Tropical Hemlock-Forest&#x0201D; (16&#x02013;17) whose &#x0201C;trade is to devise seductive projects of companies for industrial Enterprise &#x02026; of every conceivable sort, in any quarter of the terraqueous globe&#x0201D; (17&#x02013;18). For TC, this latest scourge, sanctioned by Government deregulation of banks and financial markets, was the &#x0201C;Avatar or fated coming-in upon us of General Commercial Gambling.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Promoterism,&#x0201D; he predicted, would transform the &#x0201C;sober arithmetical Counting-house of Trade&#x0201D; into &#x0201C;a <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> Table, presided over, not by Merchant Princes but by Hungry Scoundrels&#x0201D; (32). Ironically, his Miltonic vision of a world in thrall to &#x0201C;Beelzebub &#x00026; Co.&#x0201D; would soon be rendered in fictional form by TC&#x02019;s nemesis Anthony Trollope, who began writing his very Carlylean attack against &#x0201C;Promoterism,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">The Way We Live Now</hi> (<date when="1875">1875</date>), in <date when="1873-05">May 1873</date>.</p>
<p>TC occasionally attended public functions, though never without a faint sense of the ludicrousness of his renown as &#x0201C;the Chelsea Sage.&#x0201D; On <date when="1872-05-10">10 May 1872</date>, he agreed to attend a reception hosted by Count Albrecht von Bernstorff, <pb id="pg-48-xv" n="48:xv"/>the German imperial ambassador in London, in order to meet with Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, empress of Germany, and wife of Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig, emperor of Germany from <date when="1871">1871</date>. The Princess had wanted to convey her appreciation to the author of <hi rend="italic">Frederick the Great</hi> for his deep understanding of Prussian history and culture, but as TC recounted to Mary, &#x0201C;Her English was not fluent, though correct enough &#x02026; she did not seem to wish me to speak at all&#x02014;and indeed, I now guess, must have had her speech probably all by heart (but don&#x02019;t whisper <hi rend="italic">this</hi> to any soul!),&#x02014;which gives a slightly ridiculous character to the whole affair,&#x02014;and entirely secures one&#x02019;s head against being <hi rend="italic">turned</hi> with it!&#x0201D; (TC to MA, <date when="1872-05-11">11 May 1872</date>).</p>
<p>TC&#x02019;s facetious tone here&#x02014;reminiscent of JWC&#x02019;s humor&#x02014;indicated his trust and confidence in Mary, both as a companion and intellectual stimulus to him. Yet he was also faintly aware that she harbored ambitions that went beyond serving as his personal secretary, which may have been inspired by JWC&#x02019;s own example. During the time in which she had helped TC to organize and edit JWC&#x02019;s letters, Mary was exposed to the prodigious wit and sarcasm of a woman who had scorned the role of being a subordinate &#x0201C;wife of genius.&#x0201D; Mary was proud of her free-thinking aunt and closer to her in spirit than TC possibly cared to contemplate. Like JWC, Mary came to resent the ubiquitous barriers in Victorian society that prevented women from fulfilling their personal and professional aspirations. In a statement she added to a letter she had copied for TC to the poet and teacher Meta Wellmer, Mary held out the expectation that &#x0201C;the next generation of women will have a much better position than those of this one have, when trades &#x00026; professions are thrown open to them. A boy has every thing open to him at present whereas a girl or young woman who does not marry has to fight a &#x02026; battle for a livelihood&#x0201D; (TC to MW, <date when="1872-05-29">29 May 1872</date>). Her own eclectic interests&#x02014;women&#x02019;s rights, Scottish ballads and folklore, and housing and education for the poor&#x02014;reflected her independent instincts. Though fiercely loyal to her uncle, she was resolved to pursue an autonomous course. In <date when="1872-03">March 1872</date>, Mary failed in her attempt to obtain a position as adjunct to the housing reformer and activist Octavia Hill, who had been renovating properties (purchased by Ruskin) for the poor. TC encouraged her to continue searching for &#x0201C;an Honest livelihood and occupat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1872-03-30">30 March 1872</date>), but others in his circle were less tolerant of these endeavors. John A. Carlyle wrote to TC on <date when="1872-03-31">31 March</date>, &#x0201C;I was extremely shocked to find that the dear little Mary had left you, &#x00026; gone to face the difficulties of London life, leaving you in solitude. You &#x00026; I have both of us money enough&#x02014;more than we know how to make a right use of&#x02014;&#x00026; I cannot see why she should go out to find a Livelihood&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720330-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-03-30">30 March 1872</date></ref>). Long accustomed to his brother&#x02019;s curmudgeonliness, TC quietly ignored his comments.</p>
<p>But in <date when="1872-09">September</date>, Mary&#x02019;s outspokenness produced a conflict that her uncle <pb id="pg-48-xvi" n="48:xvi"/>could not overlook. Though the precise nature of their quarrel is unknown, Mary had apparently offended Lady Louisa Ashburton by voicing suspicions to Carlyle family members that she had schemed to marry TC. Involved since the spring of <date when="1868">1868</date> in a serious (and secret) lesbian relationship with the American sculptress Harriet Hosmer (see Kate Culkin, <hi rend="italic">Harriet Hosmer: A Cultural Biography</hi>, [<date when="2010">2010</date>] 117&#x02013;18), Lady Ashburton responded angrily. She wrote to Mary&#x02019;s mother, Jean C. Aitken, and asked TC to forward &#x0201C;the letter to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, if you will to Mrs Aitken much better&#x02014;as it is quite clear the poisoned tongue of calumny, added to the natural inclination to believe her own child, has made your sister take a jaundiced view of the matter&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-09-13">13 Sept. 1872</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720912-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-12">12 Sept. 1872</date></ref>). In the same letter Lady Ashburton may also have implied that Mary was being disloyal to her uncle by giving priority to her own career. Desperate to mend fences, TC tried to appease Lady Ashburton while encouraging Mary to accept a position offered to her by the feminist activist Clementia Taylor and her husband, the Liberal politician and radical Peter Taylor. TC took no chances with his prickly brother, exhorting him not to &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">say a word ag</hi>t <hi rend="italic">the Peter Taylor&#x02019;s</hi>; they are really very good honest-hearted people, and their &#x02018;Philanthropy[&#x02019;] &#x00026;c &#x00026;c won&#x02019;t infect <hi rend="italic">her</hi> clear little head or heart. Encourage in everything; and say, wh<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I really <hi rend="italic">believe</hi>, that all this sorrow be for her <hi rend="italic">good</hi>, and will lead to <hi rend="italic">far</hi> better employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi> for her here than she ever c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have from poor old dreary Me and the fag-end of my days&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1872-09-05">5 Sept. 1872</date>). On <date when="1872-09-25">25 September</date>, Mary wrote to her Uncle, announcing to him that &#x0201C;all my arrangements with Mrs Taylor <hi rend="italic">are</hi> made&#x02014;only the day of my going not fixed.&#x0201D; Assured that relative harmony had been restored, TC invited her to stay with him at Cheyne Row, until she was ready to assume her new position. Mary herself was evidently relieved to be returning: &#x0201C;I need not say, dear Uncle, that I look forward with <hi rend="italic">much</hi> pleasure to seeing you again&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-09-25">25 Sept.</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720928-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-28">28 Sept. 1872</date></ref>). She arrived back on <date when="1872-10-02">2 October</date>, and immediately resumed her former position as TC&#x02019;s assistant.</p>
<p>Over the next six weeks they began revising the <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, which was being prepared for &#x0201C;The People&#x02019;s Edition&#x0201D; of TC&#x02019;s collected works. Edward Twisleton had given TC a copy of Ernst Julius Saupe&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Schiller und sein v&#x000E4;terliches Haus</hi> [Schiller and His Father&#x02019;s Household] (<date when="1851">1851</date>), which, together with excerpts from three other German books, TC intended to make into a supplement to the biography. On <date when="1872-10-26">26 October 1872</date>, he mentioned to John A. Carlyle that &#x0201C;Mary and I are faithfully standing to our poor bit of work; the translation [of Saupe] fairly ended &#x00026; mostly recopied &#x00026; put right. &#x02026; On the whole it keeps my hands and my head pretty full through the few working hours of the day;&#x02014;and in that respect may be counted a kind of blessing to me; Saupe&#x02019;s botchings and my own bother with them being better than the poor gloomy meditations which I should otherwise awake to every morning&#x0201D; <pb id="pg-48-xvii" n="48:xvii"/>(TC to JAC, <date when="1872-10-26">26 Oct. 1872</date>) Yet even in these modest &#x0201C;Dryasdust&#x0201D; labors, TC experienced moments of high emotion. On <date when="1872-11-02">2 November 1872</date>, he told John, &#x0201C;Poor Schiller, the account of his death, which I read yesternight the last thing (vividly described by one Voss, who sat up with him 12 nights, and saw him the day before he died, look at his last little Baby with inexpressible love and <hi rend="italic">Wehmuth</hi> [sadness], and then bury his head among the pillows in a flood of tears) brought me also to the edge of weeping, or even over the edge&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-02">2 Nov. 1872</date>).</p>
<p>On <date when="1872-11-07">7 November 1872</date> TC received a visit from Emerson, who was touring Europe and Egypt with his daughter Ellen Tucker Emerson. The American was touched by TC&#x02019;s warm greeting: &#x0201C;He opened his arms &#x00026; embraced me,&#x0201D; he told his wife, &#x0201C;and we sat down &#x00026; had a steady outpouring for two hours &#x00026; more on persons, events, &#x00026; opinions&#x0201D; (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-13">13 Nov. 1872</date></ref>). Two days later Emerson regaled William Allingham with instances of TC&#x02019;s exuberance: &#x0201C;His humour runs into everything, hearty laugh, excellent company&#x02014;has always something memorable to say in choice language&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Allingham Diary</hi> 216). But TC was more restrained writing to John: &#x0201C;Emerson was here yesterday and we had a long talk, and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> muddy walk: very gentle; clear and pure on his part; but less of real heart interest coming out of it than one expected&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-13">13 Nov. 1872</date>). He may have been aware that the press referred to Emerson as &#x0201C;the American Carlyle&#x0201D; (see, for example, <hi rend="italic">Shetland Times</hi>, <date when="1873-05-05">5 May 1873</date>), and made determined efforts in his letters and conversation to repudiate the comparison.</p>
<p>Since the Rectorial address of <date when="1866">1866</date>, and JWC&#x02019;s subsequent death, TC had consciously projected a public image that contradicted the popular notion of him as a mellowed prophet. Though his respect and affection for Emerson were undiminished, he felt compelled to emphasize the temperamental and philosophical chasm dividing them. He explained in <date when="1873-04">April 1873</date> to his new American acquaintance, the Harvard professor Charles Eliot Norton: &#x0201C;There&#x02019;s a great contrast between Emerson and myself. He seems verra content with life, and takes much satisfaction in the world, especially in your country. &#x02026; But the warld is verra black to me; and I see nothin&#x02019; to be content with in this brand new, patent society of ours&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton Letters</hi> 1:484&#x02013;85). TC sought to distinguish himself from Emerson at the same time that he wanted to stress his intellectual compatibility with his two most prominent British prot&#x000E9;g&#x000E9;s, Ruskin and Froude.</p>
<p>In his letter to Emerson of <date when="1872-04-02">2 April 1872</date>, TC trumpeted their merits as committed lieutenants, though he realized that neither man was temperamentally suited to the proselytizing role that he demanded from them. In &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Munera Pulveris</hi>, Oxford-<hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> on Art, and whatever else he is now writing,&#x0201D; TC declared, &#x0201C;Ruskin is copiously and desperately, pouring [fierce lightening-bolts] into the black world of Anarchy all round him. No other man in England that <pb id="pg-48-xviii" n="48:xviii"/>I meet has in him the divine rage against iniquity, falsity, and baseness &#x02026; that every man ought to have.&#x0201D; But TC, who knew about his disciple&#x02019;s fragile mental state and his tormented relationship with Rose LaTouche, the 24&#x02013;year old daughter of a wealthy Irish banker, could not conceal from Emerson that Ruskin was &#x0201C;not a strong man; one might say a weak man rather; and has not the least prudence of management; though, if he can hold out for another 15 years or so, he may produce, even in this way, a great effect&#x0201D; (TC to RWE, <date when="1872-04-02">2 April 1872</date>). Froude, who planned to conduct a lecture tour on Irish history and the Anglo-Irish relationship of the U. S., <date when="1872-10">October 1872</date>, was a &#x0201C;most clear, friendly ingenious solid and excellent man,&#x0201D; and TC was delighted to hear that Emerson would be one of his hosts in the &#x0201C;New Country.&#x0201D; Froude was &#x0201C;the valuablest Friend I now have in England, nearly tho&#x02019; not quite altogether the one man in talking with whom I can get any real profit or comfort&#x0201D; (TC to RWE, <date when="1872-04-02">2 April 1872</date>).</p>
<p>Throughout November and December, Froude&#x02019;s American visit dominated TC&#x02019;s correspondence. Given the antagonistic role that he had played in Anglo-Irish relations in the <date when="1840">1840</date>s and <date when="1850">1850</date>s, TC found it difficult to disengage himself from the controversy that Froude was stirring in the U.S. He savored the outrage that Froude met with from Irish nationalists and supporters of Home Rule, and fondly recalled the role that he had adopted as a <hi rend="italic">provocateur</hi>, taunting his opponents with satire and invective. At the core of TC&#x02019;s Swiftian vision of Ireland were two contradictory assumptions, which revealed a peculiar combination of radical and reactionary impulses. On the one hand, he believed that Britain was guilty of a world-historical injustice. He asserted to Forster, <date when="1872-11-22">22 November 1872</date>: &#x0201C;In no province of human affairs at any time or in any place did I find so despicable and even ignominious and hideous an attempt at governing by any Nation. Lord help the People&#x02019;s William [Gladstone] and us all!&#x0201D; (TC to JF, <date when="1872-11-22">22 Nov. 1872</date>). On the other, he was convinced that the Irish &#x0201C;canaille&#x0201D; (TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-12-14">14 Dec. 1872</date>) deserved their fate, and he shared Froude&#x02019;s opinion that this feckless population was incapable of governing itself.</p>
<p>It was a position that TC had always held in the manner of the author of <hi rend="italic">Gulliver&#x02019;s Travels</hi>, employing satire and paradox to bewilder, aggravate, and disarm his opponents. Somewhat na&#x000EF;vely, the earnest and painstaking Froude had underestimated the impact that his hostile Carlylean rhetoric would have on Irish-American opinion. He lacked his mentor&#x02019;s raucous sense of the absurd, and in the U.S. he found himself frequently outflanked by nationalists and priests who understandably endorsed his condemnation of British cruelty and hypocrisy at the same time as they excoriated him for his anti-Catholic prejudice. As he had done earlier with the beleaguered Ruskin in the Governor Eyre episode, TC dismissed Froude&#x02019;s misgivings and exhorted him to persevere. In a letter to Henrietta Froude, <date when="1872-12-05">5 December 1872</date>, TC lauded <pb id="pg-48-xix" n="48:xix"/>her husband&#x02019;s mission and instructed him to take no more regard of his critics than &#x0201C;the barking of dogs or the braying of asses. He may depend on it, what he is saying about Ireland is the genuine truth, or the nearest to it that has ever been said by any person whatever.&#x0201D; Betraying his own longing to re-enter the arena of political combat, TC hypothesized: &#x0201C;were I in his place, I would make next to no apologies or explanations, but quietly and firmly read my lectures in the pre-appointed places; and that done walk silently about my own business,&#x02014;especially not to be too long in walking home again to my own hearth and known friends&#x0201D; (TC to HF, <date when="1872-12-05">5 Dec. 1872</date>). Though pleased that Froude had produced such a disturbance, TC missed his company and looked forward to his return. As he admitted to John Forster on <date when="1872-12-20">20 December</date>, &#x0201C;I wish we saw him back again safe and sound after this tremendous raid across the Border!&#x0201D; (TC to JF, <date when="1872-12-20">20 Dec. 1872</date>). To TC&#x02019;s relief and surprise, Froude returned sooner than expected. Unnerved and exhausted by the hostility that his lectures had generated, he cut short his visit and sailed from New York, <date when="1872-12-18">18 December 1872</date>, arriving back in England a month later.</p>
<p>TC found considerable compensation for Froude&#x02019;s absence in the company of Charles Eliot Norton, who had been living in London since the autumn of <date when="1872">1872</date>. Recovering from the death of his wife, Susan Ridley Norton, <date when="1872-02">February 1872</date>, Norton immediately warmed to TC. He informed a friend, <date when="1872-12-27">27 December 1872</date>: &#x0201C;I think the chief pleasure of my stay in London this year has been the frequent walks and talks I have had with Carlyle. I see him often enough to have grown familiar in some sort with him, and sincerely attached to him. &#x02026; He is the most striking figure in London,&#x02014;and when he dies there will be a bigger gap than the death of any other man could make&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton Letters</hi> 1:420). TC was equally impressed by Norton. He commended him to his brother John as a &#x0201C;fine, gentle, intelligent &#x00026; affectionate creature, with whom I have always a pleasant, soothing &#x00026; interesting dialogue when we meet&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1873-03-22">22 March 1873</date>). Yet tensions were already building between Froude and Norton that would have profound implications for TC&#x02019;s future literary reputation. In an entry to his diary, <date when="1873-01-25">25 January 1873</date>, Norton confessed: &#x0201C;I have never taken to Froude, and his late performance in America is not calculated to raise one&#x02019;s opinion of him. His face exhibits the cynical insincerity of his disposition. Carlyle is fond of him, and assures me I should like him better, if I knew him better. But he is an out and out disciple of Carlyle, in thought and in literary form, &#x02026; and Carlyle is not insensible to the flattery of being accepted as master by a man of Froude&#x02019;s capacity&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton Letters</hi> 1:461&#x02013;62). TC tried to assure Norton of Froude&#x02019;s integrity, and at least temporarily, an uneasy accord was established.</p>
<p>In the new year, TC arranged to revise his will, the most recent version of which he had written on <date when="1871-04-06">6 April 1871</date>. He asked Forster to undertake the task of drafting it, despite the latter&#x02019;s poor health. He reported to his brother John: <pb id="pg-48-xx" n="48:xx"/>&#x0201C;Poor F[orster is] still in great distress; not dangerously ill &#x02026; but really in a bad fit, he admits,&#x02014;incessantly coughing &#x00026; with very little sleep. &#x02026; During the whole of this misery Forster has been strenuously busy for me, upon a matter which <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will much approve when I tell you of it on our first meeting again&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1873-02-05">5 Feb. 1873</date>). TC was moved by Forster&#x02019;s generosity, toiling amidst considerable pain to compose his will. On <date when="1873-01-30">30 January 1873</date>, TC sent him a letter of thanks: &#x0201C;God bless you, dear Forster;&#x02014;I can never forget what you are now doing for me &#x00026; have before this done&#x0201D; (TC to JF, <date when="1873-01-30">30 Jan. 1873</date>).</p>
<p>In spring <date when="1873">1873</date>, TC was forced, by the death of John Stuart Mill, to remember an earlier acolyte who had served him with similar fidelity. He wrote, <date when="1873-05-10">10 May</date>, &#x0201C;Yesterday I got a great shock when Norton told <supplied>[me]</supplied> when we were stepping out into the street that John Mill was dead! I had heard no whisper of such a thing before; &#x00026; a great black sheet of mournful more or less tragic memories, not about Mill alone, rushed down upon me: Poor Mill, he too has worked out his Life Drama in sight of me; &#x00026; that scene too has closed before my old eyes, though he was so much my junior!&#x0201D; (TC to JAC, <date when="1873-05-10">10 May 1873</date>). Carlyle&#x02019;s anguish was aggravated by a letter he received a week later from Harriet Isabella Mill, Mill&#x02019;s sister, who was upset by an article published in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> that repeated the story of the burnt manuscript of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>. In a tender reply, TC gently advised her to forget the &#x0201C;babbling newspapers,&#x0201D; and to &#x0201C;dismiss [the incident] wholly from your thoughts as a thing, which to me is now grown a No-thing,&#x02014;nay has even risen (by the sacred memories connected with it) to be a real possession, which it is blessed for me, &#x00026; as it were sacred, to look back upon! This is truly the character of it to all that are concerned&#x02014;both to me, who still linger on this Earth, &#x00026; to your dear Brother whose memory alone now remains to us&#x0201D; (TC to HM, <date when="1873-05-17">17 May 1873</date>). In forcing himself to relive the episode once more, TC exhibited the same nobility of character in the present that he had long ago demonstrated in the past. Notwithstanding the profound political and philosophical differences between them, TC could recognize the &#x0201C;sacred&#x0201D; ties that bound him in solidarity with John Stuart Mill, a fellow toiler in the Babylon of literary pursuits.</p>

He thanks J. H. Balfour-Browne for his dedication of a new book (<date when="1871-12-20">20</date>) and James Marshall for finding a cast of Goethe&#x02019;s hand for Lady Ashburton (<date when="1871-12-23">23</date>).</p>

TC bemoans &#x0201C;that monster of a Norse preface, or sketch of the Early Kings of Norway,&#x0201D; a &#x0201C;totally worthless thing&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-02-24">24</date>).

<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1872-04">April</date></hi>. TC writes warmly to Ralph Waldo Emerson apologizing for his long silence.

He signals the intended arrival in the U.S. of Froude, &#x0201C;a most clear, friendly ingenious solid and excellent man&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-04-02">2</date>). He describes his short holiday at Belton to John A. Carlyle who is also suffering from dyspepsia (<date when="1872-04-13">13</date>). Forster takes TC for a country drive (<date when="1872-04-14">14</date>) since TC refuses dinner invitations. TC declines becoming involved with a political meeting (<date when="1872-04-18">18</date>) and the presidency of a new Temperance organization (<date when="1872-04-22">22</date>), having been invited by John Pearce. TC tells his brother John, who is expected <date when="1872-05-02">2 May</date>, to bring &#x0201C;a bottle or two of genuine whisky&#x0201D; since all he can find in London is &#x0201C;dirty Irish&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-04-27">27</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1872-05">May</date></hi>. TC sends someone an autograph, while grumbling about it (<date when="1872-05-05">5</date>).

Carlyle has gone to Vichy; TC reports to him an &#x0201C;<supplied>[a]</supplied>bundance and super-d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> of intrusive Callers&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-05-29">29</date>).</p>

TC gives permission to Edward Walford to translate some of his work into Latin or Greek (<date when="1872-06-14">14</date>), and he congratulates Edward FitzGerald on progress in providing a monument at Naseby (<date when="1872-06-15">15</date>). He thanks Mary Aitken for her dealings with Elliott &#x00026; Fry over their use of family photographs; she is busy and learning German (<date when="1872-06-18">18</date>). TC asks Jean to send a straw hat (<date when="1872-06-20">20</date>). He writes her again with money for various gifts; her son John visited TC on <date when="1872-06-21">21 June</date> and wrote at dictation a long letter to John A. Carlyle (<date when="1872-06-22">22</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1872-07">July</date></hi>. TC stays at Melchet for a few days, swiftly returning to London when he cannot sleep. He thanks Lady Ashburton for a hamper of produce from Addiscombe, and encourages her to take a &#x0201C;Cottage at Strathpeffer&#x0201D; rather than go to Marienbad (<date when="1872-07-04">4</date>).

He tells John he is happy to invest in railway stock if the price is good, and <pb id="pg-48-xxxvii" n="48:xxxvii"/>would like to help his sister Mary Austin in renewing the lease of The Gill if he can (<date when="1873-03-12">12</date>). With Maggie&#x02019;s help, TC is clearing &#x0201C;a great heap of rubbish&#x0201D;; Mary Aitken is doing well at the Taylors&#x02019; (<date when="1873-03-20">20</date>).

He writes a very friendly introduction to Edward FitzGerald on behalf of Charles Eliot Norton (<date when="1873-04-14">14</date>), and sends FitzGerald&#x02019;s reply to Norton, calling him a &#x0201C;peaceable, affectionate, &#x00026; ultra modest man&#x0201D; (<date when="1873-04-18">18</date>).

He parts from Norton (<date when="1873-05-09">9</date>), who is returning to the U.S. (<date when="1873-05-16">16</date>). He learns from Norton of the death of John Stuart Mill (<date when="1873-05-07">7</date>), which affects him strongly. He dismisses Browning&#x02019;s new poem as &#x0201C;the despicablest, most conceited &#x00026; utterly worthless performance I ever met with from the hand of a man of talent!&#x0201D; (<date when="1873-05-10">10</date>). Mary visits regularly and seems to flourish in her new life (<date when="1873-05-10">10</date>).

He tells Forster of his pleasure in the summer warmth, and the prospect of a sea-bathing holiday with Mary Aitken and her mother, Jean (<date when="1873-06-24">24</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1873-07">July</date></hi>. He writes to Lady Ashburton in Marienbad with his concerns about her daughter Mary&#x02019;s health and wishes she were back in England with its summer sunshine; he has been in touch with Thomas Woolner about a sculpture commissioned by Lady Ashburton, &#x0201C;really a meritorious bit of sculpture&#x0201D; but requiring some kind of explanation to the viewer (<date when="1873-07-06">6</date>). Maggie Welsh has left for Liverpool, and TC is considering a month&#x02019;s sea-bathing with Mary and her mother in the Isle of Bute. TC sends Betty Braid a gift in memory of <pb id="pg-48-xxxviii" n="48:xxxviii"/>JWC&#x02019;s birthday (<date when="1873-07-12">12</date>), along with news of the death of James Baillie at the <date when="1873-03-31">end of March</date>. He thanks Froude for an invitation, but tends to prefer a week in Blickling with Lady Lothian and Lady Gertrude Chetwynd-Talbot before heading for Scotland (<date when="1873-07-30">30</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1873-08">August</date></hi>. Instead of Isle of Bute, TC and Mary leave for Blickling, Norfolk (<date when="1873-08-02">2</date>), from where TC writes to Forster about the beauty of the place and his enjoyment of it (<date when="1873-08-08">8</date>). They leave Blickling for Yarmouth, to Newcastle (by sea) then to Dumfries (by rail) (<date when="1873-08-12">12</date>).</p>
<p><hi rend="italic"><date when="1873-09">September</date></hi>. TC stays at Auchtertool, Fife (<date when="1873-09-01">1</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873-09-05">5</date>), then goes to Haddington to visit JWC&#x02019;s grave with Mary Aitken and Maggie Welsh, staying overnight in Edinburgh (<date when="1873-09-05">5</date>); TC and Mary return to Dumfries. TC writes FitzGerald from Dumfries about their Naseby monument plan, which has failed (<date when="1873-09-13">13</date>). He tells brother John that he &#x0201C;has suffered a great deal of misery in this confused &#x02026; seven weeks&#x0201D;; he and Mary return to Chelsea (<date when="1873-09-15">15</date>). London seems empty and TC rather enjoys the experience. He denounces autograph hunters (<date when="1873-09-20">20</date>). He complains to John that his digestion is seriously upset, his &#x0201C;wretched stomach dragging me down all day.&#x0201D; Forster&#x02019;s health seems improved. TC urges John to go back to translating: &#x0201C;nothing c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be more medicinal to the weary wandering mind&#x0201D; (<date when="1873-09-27">27</date>).</p>

<p>As volume 48 enters the final stages of editing, we received the news of the death of one of its senior editors, Aileen Christianson, who has been with the edition since <date when="1967">1967</date>, a backbone of its regular and scrupulously edited appearance. While she devoted years of her life to this, Aileen was also a charismatic tutor and lecturer, in both Scottish literature and women&#x02019;s studies. Forthright, confident, and cheerful, Aileen was a conspicuous member of Edinburgh University, of the Carlyle Society, and of the world of Carlyle studies. She has left a legacy of published work on Jane Welsh Carlyle, on Scottish women writers, and on the onward march of the Duke&#x02013;Edinburgh edition of the Letters. She will be much missed.</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, my Uncle, desires me to say that, after many delays, he has received and read the Novel<note n="1" noteref="2">Marshall Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">For Very Life</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1871">1871</date>), apparently his first novel.</note>
 and Letter you have been so kind as send him. In the Novel, of which you ask his opinion, he says he finds considerable talent&#x02014; But his idea is that in a novel one expects <hi rend="italic">Action</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">reflections</hi>; in which latter my Uncle thinks yours abounds almost too exclusively. The plot also he considers extravagant and wild. In short he thinks the talent and ingenuity you are evidently possessed of might be more suitably expended in some <hi rend="italic">real</hi> work, of history or other, than in Novel writing; and he would bid you not stop, but proceed in your Literary labours, though in a different direction.<note n="2" noteref="3">Balfour-Browne later wrote: &#x0201C;In <date when="1870">1870</date> I published a book&#x02014;a novel. It was accepted by Messrs Chapman and Hall &#x02026; on the &#x02018;half-profit principle.&#x02019; &#x02026; I sent a copy of the book to Carlyle, and he wrote me by the hand of his niece Mary Carlyle Aitken a very nice letter, and told me that he had found a good deal of talent in the book and would willingly accept the dedication of my next novel, but he advised me to devote myself to real work. Well, I have, although reluctantly, taken his advice&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Forty Years at the Bar</hi> 137).

<p><salute>My dear Sister,</salute></p>
<p>I intended writing to you yesterday, but was invincibly prevented; indeed I have various days intended, but always some pitiful invincible trifle has prevented me. One poor word, however, you shall have today; tho&#x02019;, alas, what good can it do! All words are in effect idle; the stroke has fallen, our loss is irrevocable and unalterable. &#x0201C;It is Gods holy will&#x0201D; is all that any of us can say or think upon it;&#x02014;and to think it so with our whole heart is far better than any speaking of it; and the sole assuagement that exists for any of us. I am much <pb id="pg-48-02" n="48:02"/>struck by the universal sympathy poor Jim&#x02019;s death awakens and the great love of all his friends for him.&#x02014; A faithful useful clear and loving hearted man; and felt to be such, apparently without exception by all who knew him. There is a mournful but deep and true comfort in knowing that this was verily the fact; a human being at any stage of his existence cannot end on better terms. You cannot but weep for him, dear Sister; but surely this is not the worst kind of sorrow; by degrees I trust you will find it has been blessed to you.</p>
<p>Mary is very diligent and active doing all she can to unravel the unpleasant mystery about His worldly effects; which we hope will one day come to clearness;<note n="1" noteref="5">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1871-10-06">6 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Jean &#x02026; feels rather anxious to know the state in which poor Jim&#x02019;s affairs were left.

<p>My own affairs here are still in a so-so way; but I reckon myself gradually coming round.

Lady Ashburton came suddenly up on Tuesday last &#x0201C;for one week&#x0201D;; had ridden all the way from Dingwall (600 miles) at a stretch; to stay one week at Melchet upon manifold business mostly of a provoking nature (about her grand new house which lets in the water and refuses to be heated as it ought),<note n="6" noteref="10">TC meant Melchet Court, built <date when="1862">1862</date>&#x02013;<date when="1868">68</date>.</note>

John continued: &#x0201C;I could send Mr S&#x02019;s letter &#x00026; two of the pamphlets of w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I have duplicates. &#x02026; The pamphlets are old, but all the rules of the one about Cottages on the Hope Johnstone Estate [presumably of John James Hope Johnstone (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), of Raehills, Lockerbie, and Hook House, Dumfriesshire; see <ref target="volume-36/lt-18600815-TC-JAC-01"><sic>36:181</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1860-08-15">15 Aug. 1860</date></corr></ref>] are still in force &#x00026; working well.&#x0201D;</note>
 never arrived till last night about nine, though the Letter had arrived 48 hours before. I read the Pamphlet and adjuncts before going to bed, with considerable approval of both; and will write about them before long. The Linlathen message also came; and Mary on search, has found about 20 Erskine Letters;&#x02014;I cannot for my life think what to say about Erksine that could be suitable for the public it is meant for;<note n="9" noteref="13">James Erskine (previously Paterson) wrote, <date when="1871-10-09">9 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;I hesitate in asking you to do anything you might find a burden. &#x02026; But knowing the kindly remembrance you have of my Uncle &#x00026; the pleasure you had in each others society&#x02014;I hope you w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> find it agreable to write whatever comes into your mind about him, &#x00026; allow it to take its place with similar contributions from 3 or 4 friends&#x02014;in a little volume&#x02014;which along with the few letters we can now obtain w<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, I think, make a pleasant &#x00026; useful memorial.&#x0201D; He also asked if TC would allow him to publish any of Erskine&#x02019;s letters that he had. John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1871-10-22">22 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;In regard to that request of Erskine&#x02019;s (young Paterson&#x02019;s) you surely might refuse to undertake any writing.&#x0201D; TC apparently wrote telling him that he had decided against it, as John replied, <date when="1871-10-26">26 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;We are all glad to hear that you have dismissed the question about Erskine by sending the Letters only to his nephew.&#x0201D; Erskine wrote, <date when="1871-10-27">27 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;My wife &#x00026; I have read all the letters you kindly sent&#x02014;with great interest &#x00026; pleasure. &#x02026; I still hope that a time may come&#x02014;when you will find it good &#x00026; pleasant medecine to write a few words of your Friend. It w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a further tie between you, &#x00026; w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a very valuable stone in this small memorial to him.&#x0201D;</note>
 but yet I suppose there will be no avoiding of an attempt to say something! I much dislike this kind of demand upon me (which comes far oftener than I could expect); but on reflecting, too, I should perhaps <pb id="pg-48-05" n="48:05"/>admit that in a case like Erskine&#x02019;s especially, it has its value to me and its uses.<note n="10" noteref="14">TC did not write anything.</note>
</p>
<p>This is all, dear Sister, or almost more than all, the greater part of it worth almost nothing to you. I add only my poor heart&#x02019;s blessing upon you and all you have still left to you. God be with you all.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute>&#x02014;I cannot explain to myself the strange, and indeed lamentable fact that I have not seen you, or heard a distinct word from you for, I think, seven or eight months.<note n="1" noteref="17">For TC&#x02019;s last recorded contact with John Ruskin, <date when="1871-04">April 1871</date>, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710430-TC-JRU-01"><sic>47:199&#x02013;200</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1871-04-30">30 April 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note> It is a fact that has become not only surprising to me, but distressing, and the source latterly of continual anxieties both about myself and you. For three months I had no Amanuensis (I in the Highlands, Mary in Dumfriesshire far away), and without a hand could not write to you myself: about the middle of that period, too, there came the most alarming rumours of your illness at Matlock;<note n="2" noteref="18">Ruskin caught a chill in <date when="1871-07">July</date> while staying at the New Bath Hotel in Matlock, Derbyshire; this led to an attack of internal inflammation. He recovered gradually under the care of his friend Henry Wentworth Acland (<date when="1815">1815</date>&#x02013;<date when="1900">1900</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/62"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), physician.</note>
 and both Lady Ashburton<note n="3" noteref="19">TC inserted &#x0201C;Ashburton&#x0201D; where Mary wrote &#x0201C;A.&#x0201D;</note>
 and myself (especially the latter party for whom I can answer best) were in a state really deserving pity on your account, till the very Newspapers took compassion on us, and announced the immediate danger to be past. All this is wrong; and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> as it should be. I beg earnestly that, wherever this may find you, you would at once<note n="4" noteref="20">TC inserted &#x0201C;at once.&#x0201D;</note>
 devote one serious half-hour to me; and write a few words of authentic news concerning yourself, and especially a word of <hi rend="italic">prediction</hi> as to when I may expect to see you again, if ever.<note n="5" noteref="21">Ruskin replied, <date when="1871-10-23">23 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;Your loving letter greets me returning today from Oxford. My illness indeed very nearly ended me; and left me heavy in limb and otherwise helpless for some weeks&#x02014; Gradually &#x02026; my strength came back&#x02014;but I cannot yet run or climb as I could before. &#x02026; I &#x02026; send this miserably written letter to you with my love, and will come, if I may to see you, at &#x000BD; past 8, tomorrow evening.&#x0201D;</note>
 The <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> sufficiently assures <pb id="pg-48-06" n="48:06"/>me, from time to time, that it is not want of the old goodwill towards me which keeps you silent;<note n="6" noteref="22">Ruskin&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> appeared monthly; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710430-TC-JRU-01"><sic>47:199&#x02013;200</sic><corr>TC to JRU, <date when="1871-04-30">30 April 1871</date></corr></ref>.

 but the <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> itself (which very few can get hold of, though many are seeking it) awakens anxieties in me instead of satisfying them all. In short a deliberate bit of letter is indispensable to me for all manner of reasons.</p>
<p>It is four weeks today since I returned hither; said by sanguine friends to be visibly &#x0201C;improved in health,&#x0201D; felt by myself to be only invisibly so, if at all: now as formerly I have my daily (especially my <hi rend="italic">nightly</hi>) battle to fight with the innumerable Beasts at Ephesus,<note n="7" noteref="23">Cf. 1 Cor. 15:32.</note>
 human diabolical and also of the inanimate sort, which never quit a poor fellow till they have brought him to the ground altogether, against which I faintly but really sometimes with an earnest wish, endeavour to make fight, though of course with weaker and weaker effect. Froude has returned, and is often asking about you; as indeed are many others, to whom the radiant qualities which the gods have given you, and set you to work with in such an <hi rend="italic">element</hi>, are not unknown. Write me a word at once, dear Ruskin. Mary sends her love to you. The most mournful tragedy has happened in her and my circle,&#x02014;the death of her eldest Brother by the accident of leaping down from a coach here, probably with too much trust in his nimbleness of limb;&#x02014;an excellent completely faithful and valiant young man whose loss has thrown a gloom over us all.&#x02014; No more today. <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> swiftly what have begged of you: I remain ever and always</p>

<p>I enclose you today the small settlement of Mary&#x02019;s dressing-gown and my own warm shoes.<note n="1" noteref="27">Mary Aitken recorded in TC&#x02019;s checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1871-10-31">31 October 1871</date> / M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Aitken (for Dressing Gown Cloth Shoes &#x00026;c / &#x000A3;2 .. 1 .. 2&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>
 Mary will mark on the margin what the particulars are; which she says are all right.

<p>This little tatter of a thing is therefore off my hands. About it indeed there need have been no hurry; but I suppose I wished to tempt you to another Letter; for I am truly anxious to hear definitely from you; and am often enough thinking about you in the sad time that now is. I am myself so so, not entitled to complain much but still less to brag. My sleep is almost uniformly broken and indifferently bad; but I never except once since you last heard of me have lost a whole night Patience, patience; we must endeavour to be patient and to do daily the poor duties of the day,&#x02014;certain one thing that the end (under God&#x02019;s good pleasure and in God&#x02019;s hand) is not far.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I intend to send you <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> where possibly you <pb id="pg-48-08" n="48:08"/>may find something to read. Tell me how you get on with Ziethen.<note n="3" noteref="29">Hans Joachim von Zieten (<date when="1699">1699</date>&#x02013;<date when="1786">1786</date>), Prussian general; possibly Luise Johanne von Blumenthal, <hi rend="italic">The Life of Gen. de Zieten</hi>, trans. from German by B.

 I enclose a bit of Paris talk about the state of Trade &#x00026;c, which wears an authentic look,&#x02014;if you have not seen it already, it came from Lady Ashburton this morning, who is at length in the Highlands again; but I suppose not for long.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sister,</salute></p>
<p>Forster has been here taking leave of us before going to the sea side, where it is uncertain how long he may continue. He is still very far from well; cannot sleep for coughing &#x00026;c &#x00026;c and does not know but he may be driven home again in a few days.<note n="1" noteref="31">Forster wrote from the Bath Hotel, Bournemouth, <date when="1871-11-19">19 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;The Small One [Eliza Forster] is, I hope, getting a little stronger; and, though I have not had good nights, my cough has spared me very much. &#x02026; <supplied>[T]</supplied>he place decidedly is a success thus far, and I am extremely glad that we have come to it.&#x0201D;</note>
 His errand here seemed to be all on <hi rend="italic">our</hi> behalf; on my Chapman affairs, on John&#x02019;s ditto and prospects towards Harding &#x00026;c &#x00026;c:<note n="2" noteref="32">John Aitken was currently employed by Chapman &#x00026; Hall (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711118-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-11-18">18 Nov.</date></ref>), but was perhaps still hoping to get employment with Robert Palmer Harding, head of a prominent London accounting firm, Harding, Pullein, Whinney, &#x00026; Gibbons; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710529-TC-JAC-01"><sic>47:208</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1871-05-29">29 May 1871</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710926-TC-JAF-01"><sic>225</sic><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1871-09-26">26 Sep. 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 in short nothing could exceed the kindness of Forster as usual. Among other things he produced the enclosed cheque to be sent to you for behoof of Miss Cunningham;<note n="3" noteref="33">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct.</date></ref></note>
 I said it was not due or suitable till Xmas; he approved much of your delay and silence till then; but insisted on my sending it you at once &#x00026; having done with it. Keep it therefore on those terms, dear Sister or have it changed when you like into ten Notes for behoof of Miss C. when the time comes. A single word of receipt either to Forster or to us will finish the matter.</p>
<p>I received the Dr&#x02019;<hi rend="italic">s</hi> big Packet on Monday; and am glad to see the worthy old Gentleman of Hillside<note n="4" noteref="34">In connection with John A.

 was evidently a little gratified by what had taken <pb id="pg-48-09" n="48:09"/>place. We dispatched, Mary and I, to Leighton his <hi rend="italic">oblique</hi> Message<note n="5" noteref="35">TC apparently sent John some information about Sir Baldwyn Leighton, living at Loton Park, Shrewsbury, as John wrote, <date when="1871-10-22">22 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;I have another copy of Stewarts pamphlet on Cottages, &#x00026; could send it at once to Sir B. Leighton or yourself.&#x0201D; TC then apparently sent John a newspaper containing an article by Leighton, as John wrote, <date when="1871-10-26">26 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;The newspaper I will send on to Mr Stewart with a few words of explanation.&#x0201D; He then wrote, <date when="1871-11-05">5 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;Two days after forwarding the Shrewsbury newspaper to Mr Stewart, I wrote a few words telling how Sir Baldwin Leighton &#x00026; his father [Sir Baldwin Leighton (<date when="1805">1805</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871">71</date>), 7th bart.] before him had attended to the Cottages on their estate with success &#x00026; how their plan seemed much the same as his own on the Annandale estates. And he seems to have been stirred up very pleasantly, &#x00026; sends the two enclosed letters, &#x00026; the package of pamphlets. &#x02026; The letters will not be altogether uninteresting to you, I think, from so old a man; &#x00026; you can shew them both, or the last of them alone, to Sir B. &#x00026; give it to him along with the pamphlets &#x02026; if you think it desirable. It is a pity that more landlords don&#x02019;t attend to such important matters.&#x0201D; Charles Stewart wrote to John, <date when="1871-11-01">1 Nov.</date>, thanking him for sending &#x0201C;Sir Baldwin Leighton&#x02019;s excellent Lecture&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1770.88). This was probably the second of two papers delivered by Leighton at the Social Science Congress in Leeds, <date when="1871-10">Oct. 1871</date>, &#x0201C;Poor Law Out-Relief&#x0201D; and &#x0201C;Landlords and Labourers&#x0201D;; they were pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Pauperization: Cause and Cure</hi> (Shrewsbury, <date when="1871">1871</date>).</note>
 or what we judged to be such;&#x02014; and expect with confidence enough that it will have the due reception. I deeply feel that I am in John&#x02019;s debt and mean to pay him very soon.</p>
<p>My blessings on you all.<note n="6" noteref="36">John wrote, <date when="1871-11-05">5 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;Jean bears her great sorrow calmly &#x00026; bravely, &#x00026; there is this addition to it that no search or enquiry enables her to find out what Jem had done with the two or three hundred pounds he had saved &#x00026; spoke of both to herself &#x00026; John. She has given up seeking to ascertain, &#x00026; made up her mind to seek no farther.&#x0201D;</note>

<p>Forgive me that I have not sooner answered your friendly, cheery, and altogether pleasant little note.<note n="2" noteref="40">Hughes had apparently written to TC to ask him to contribute a copy of his works to a new library for Chicago.

 by the methods he proposed (for the gifts of all the books of living authors will go for very little in such an enterprise) and, third and worst, that it wore on the face of it a visible pick-thank kind of character&#x02014;a thing greatly to be avoided, both in Chicago and here!</p>
<p>These objections do not vanish on reflection, but on the contrary gather weight. Nevertheless, if you and the literary world feel nothing of the like and the project does take fire and go on,<note n="5" noteref="43">The appeal for contributions was led by Hughes and headed by Queen Victoria; it included many prominent authors, politicians, and cultural institutions; more than 8,000 books were eventually sent.</note>
 it continues certain that my poor contribution of a copy of my books shall not by any means be wanting.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Sister,</salute></p>
<p>Though there is very little time left, I must write you one word before the week end. The shirts came on Tuesday; excellent warm, roomy shirts, and very warm here in the frost<note n="1" noteref="45">The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported, <date when="1871-11-16">16 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;In centigrade degrees, the mean temperature of the air last week at Greenwich was 4.0 deg., or 3.2 below the mean temperature of the corresponding week in 50 years.&#x0201D;</note>
 that there was;&#x02014;the <hi rend="italic">buttonless</hi> sleeves I knew beforehand would be intolerable; and had wrist bands put on in the course of the day. All is right under that head ever since; and I am very much obliged for this new bit of service done me. You ask if there is anything farther you can do in the way of warm clothing; to which my answer is, Almost nothing, except perhaps it were possible for you at Dumfries to find me a proper pair of winter gloves. A thick effectual pair of woolen gloves well lined with flannel not too big and that will fairly fit the human hand. Mary searched all London for me; and could find no such things, &#x0201C;Knitted lined gloves not made now, Miss&#x0201D;; at the long last she did find in some big Shop one pair left as relic not the right kind either (for they seemed to be woven not knit and otherwise of unpleasant colour); but they seem to be very &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">feel</hi>&#x0201D; lined with <hi rend="italic">plush</hi> and I thought they would do. Yesterday, however, on putting them on, I found <pb id="pg-48-11" n="48:11"/>they were decidedly too big and that the lining was too small for the outside of them; so that I would gladly have a better pair if they are to be had. But I much doubt there is no such thing attainable. What a singular feature it often seems to me that all mortals in this country seem to aim, not at making things better and better, but at making them, every new season, different: singular though extremely explicable; and undoubtedly the work of the Evil Genius, if that were any comfort. Dont, you, much bother about this of the gloves. I really can manage quite supportably as I am.</p>
<p>My sleep continues obstinately bad and broken; I can hardly remember three nights of sleep anything like regular since I returned hither. There is often a feeling in me, too, as if, at bottom, in spite of all this, I had a kind of clearness and interior health superior to that of last year (which Heaven knows is not saying much for it, though a little is always something!).&#x02014; Meanwhile I am often rather sick of the thing; but of course can do no good by that. And in fact had better be silent about it till we see if it mend at all.</p>

Mary however is due outside to walk with John<note n="3" noteref="47">Mary Aitken&#x02019;s brother John was now living in London. Mary wrote to Ann Welsh, <date when="1871-12-05">5 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;My brother lives about 20 minutes walk from us; and often comes down to us in the evenings. He and I go for very long walks together on Saturdays&#x02014;when he has a half holiday; and he comes here to dinner every Sunday. He seems to like London and his work very well; but he had a bad start poor fellow; he was only here about a fortnight till that dreadful accident happened. He is now our only Brother that is left to us&#x0201D; (MS: EUL). John Aitken was now working for Chapman &#x00026; Hall; Forster had written, <date when="1871-08-21">21 Aug.</date>, that Frederic Chapman was about to go away on holiday, but would write to John Aitken to discuss whether John would start work immediately, or would wait for Chapman&#x02019;s return from holiday.</note>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,</salute></p>
<p>Thanks for all the pains you take with me. The bright new Volume came punctually (by Nephew John)<note n="1" noteref="53">Forster wrote from Bournemouth, <date when="1871-11-27">27 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;Day by day I have been expecting the promised book. &#x02026; I have written by this post &#x02026; to cause the volume to be sent to you tomorrow without fail. It is to be published early next week. &#x02026; <supplied>[Y]</supplied>ou will kindly <hi rend="italic">let no one see it</hi> (except Mary) until after next Monday [<date when="1871-12-04">4 Dec.</date>].&#x0201D; John Aitken delivered the first vol. of Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">The Life of Charles Dickens</hi> (<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>) from Chapman &#x00026; Hall.</note>
 yesternight ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 9;&#x02014;and in spite of an unwelcome interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I am already deep in it,&#x02014;sat reading there, in fact, till 2 this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>. I need not tell you, what you already guess privately and all the world will confirm, that it is of the liveliest interest, and dextrously and exactly done: easy to prophecy that it will go round the globe,<note n="2" noteref="54">Up to here the letter is in TC&#x02019;s hand; the rest is in Mary Aitken&#x02019;s hand.</note>
 and be eagerly read by thousands on thousands of men. <hi rend="italic">Euge</hi>, <hi rend="italic">euge</hi> [Well done, well done]!&#x02014;</p>
<p>We want a new Note about health matters; the first was a great favour and solace to one&#x02019;s mind; the account given fairly beyond what one had reckoned on. This time you say nothing on the subject; but from various signs I flatter myself things are not worse than they were but probably better.<note n="3" noteref="55">Forster wrote: &#x0201C;<supplied>[T]</supplied>he Small One <supplied>[Eliza]</supplied> is lying on the sofa, quite tired out with her walk. We indeed do almost nothing, she and I here, except in the health-hunting way, which is really <hi rend="italic">very hard work</hi> after all.&#x0201D;</note>
 Confirm these fine surmises to us; at all events let us know how the truth stands. No time was better spent than your rustication now in gathering a little strength to front the storms that are coming in the next two months.<note n="4" noteref="56">TC probably referred to the fact that four months (not two) away (<date when="1872-04-02">2 April 1872</date>), Forster would be 60 and could then retire from work; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711212-TC-CDG-01">TC to CDG, <date when="1871-12-12">12 Dec.</date></ref></note>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,</salute></p>
<p>My poor Birthday yesterday brought an unexpected crowd of letters and congratulations from far and near; a thing wonderful to me and I may say sad <pb id="pg-48-15" n="48:15"/>rather than joyful. At least sixty of the seventy-six times that poor anniversary has now come round have been unmarked by any notice of it at all,&#x02014;except indeed by One<note n="1" noteref="65">JWC.</note>
 who can now notice it no more:&#x02014;and here, when we have got to the 77<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,<note n="2" noteref="66">TC meant his 77th year, not his 77th birthday. He wrote in his journal, <date when="1871-12-08">8 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Monday last [<date when="1871-12-04">4 Dec.</date>], my 76th Birthday, then came a quite unexpected, <hi rend="italic">unexampled heap</hi> of recognit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> surprised me, if they did not interest. Once there was only <hi rend="italic">One</hi> that remembered my Birthday; mournful and <hi rend="italic">nichtig</hi> <supplied>[trivial]</supplied> was the whole world&#x02019;s remembrance, now that Hers is wanting: ah me!&#x02014; I said to myself, however, &#x02018;Does this strange influx of Anniversary Benevolence mean that I am what the Scotch call <hi rend="italic">fey</hi>; that this is perhaps to be my <hi rend="italic">last</hi> Birthday?&#x02019; Small matter, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> think; unless I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> learn to work ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> a little! But this, and all things, shall be as it pleases God. <hi rend="italic">Five days</hi> of my 77<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year are already fled&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>
 and are looking forward over the grand Brink, not back upon the sordid scramble we are just about to leave, comes such a jingle of bob-majors<note n="3" noteref="67">A term used in bell ringing.</note>
 from so many bells! I almost asked myself, Does this signify (<hi rend="italic">Scottice</hi>) <supplied>[th]</supplied>at I am <hi rend="italic">fey</hi>, that this is the last of the times? Small matter if it be; very small, had we any right to choose in the matter.</p>
<p>But certainly of all the Gifts and Good Wishes that came, none was practically half so good as your silently symbolical one which arrived soon after mid-day in the shape of three substantial cases of white Spanish &#x0201C;Gondomar,&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="68">Gondomar wine, from the Duero / Douro Valley that runs through Spain and Portugal.</note>
&#x02014;the wine I like best of all other; and of which, for sometime past, seen myself reduced almost to zero. Thanks, Thanks, dear practical Forster; here is now as much of the fine medicinal article as I shall probably ever drink; the difficulties, at which I weakly shuddered, of tracking out its obscure City locality, and all bother about it, is permanently overcome, and I have nothing to do henceforth but drink and be grateful! This latter double duty you may depend upon it I shall certainly do, and find no <hi rend="italic">difficulty</hi> in the same!&#x02014; Well, well; I will say no more about it. I find my words very ill expressive of the thing I mean by them, which, therefore, we will mainly leave to silence.</p>
<p>I finished off the <hi rend="italic">Dickens</hi> the second night after I wrote; it was a reading with what I used to call voracity such as is now rare to me in Books. The interest goes on increasing; that universal blazing up of Yankee-doodle-doodom around poor Dickens, as if it had been one huge bottle of Soda-water, is presented in the liveliest manner by help of Dickens&#x02019;s own Letters; and was wonderful, and in a sense tragic to me. It fitly closes Vol I;<note n="5" noteref="69">The last six chapters of vol. 1 of Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> covered Charles Dickens&#x02019;s visit to North America, <date when="1842-01-22">22 Jan.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-06-07">7 June 1842</date>; much of the narrative was from the letters he sent home. It is not clear to what TC referred; Dickens was wildly feted in America, and wrote of the exhausting life he was leading; he raised the question of copyright which enraged many of the people and made two speeches on it, one at Boston (1:291) and one at Hartford (1:299&#x02013;301); TC was one of the authors who wrote to him at the time supporting his position (1:304&#x02013;5), and Forster printed this letter, and also remarked on TC&#x02019;s and Dickens&#x02019;s friendship (1:313&#x02013;15; also <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> 14:92&#x02013;94).</note>
 and, alas, there will be, <pb id="pg-48-16" n="48:16"/>as brother to it, at the end of Vol II, another still higher evervescence<note n="6" noteref="70">Thus in MS, for effervescence.</note>
 there, which to my own poor thought, is still more tragical!<note n="7" noteref="71">TC refers to the deaths at the end of vol. 2 of Dickens&#x02019;s father (<date when="1785">1785</date>&#x02013;<date when="1751">51</date>), and then two weeks later his infant da., Dora (<date when="1850">1850</date>&#x02013;<date when="1851">51</date>).</note>
 The Book I have no doubt, nor can anybody have, will circulate far and wide among the kindreds of mankind to which we belong. The wonder to me is, <hi rend="italic">how</hi>, in those miserable circumstances of health, you have got it written, with such an air of calmness, perfect clearness, as if you had nothing else to care about or do. Pause wisely awhile before beginning Vol II;<note n="8" noteref="72">The <hi rend="italic">Athen&#x000E6;um</hi> advertised, <date when="1872-10-05">5 Oct. 1872</date>, that vol. 2 of Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> (<date when="1873">1873</date>), covering <date when="1842">1842</date>&#x02013;<date when="1852">52</date>, would be come out <date when="1872-11-01">early Nov. 1872</date>, and that vol. 3(<date when="1874">1874</date>) would complete the work.</note>
 and let us hope to see that come out in as perfect a form.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon I walked through the Park; and, shortly after sun-set, got into Clifford St, Bond Street, and there, after some searching found, in a Family Hotel (meaning a place altogether solitary except for one Valet),<note n="9" noteref="73">Almond&#x02019;s Hotel, 6 Clifford St., London.</note>
 the renowned Lord Houghton, ci-devant Richard Milnes,<note n="10" noteref="74">Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton.</note>
 down very deep in gout and other ailments, whom, though I hurt his hand in shaking it, my visit seemed to please a little. He did not seem in bad heart, though he has been hunted by continual illnesses since Autumn last; again and again reported to be quite recovered, and then straightway falling ill again:&#x02014;I was really touched to see poor Milnes, how he too has to pay his Tax to Time, like all of us in this world that is made of Time. My private dread was that his health might be in a worse way than I understood, and that this &#x0201C;recovery&#x0201D; too might prove of short duration.<note n="11" noteref="75">Lord Houghton survived TC, living until <date when="1885">1885</date>.</note>

 as he terms it:&#x02014;he loudly, and with much jolly emphasis, enquired after Forster, and threatened him with a call.</p>
<p>I will be ready for Xmas with you unless Fate forbid. Send us a few words <pb id="pg-48-17" n="48:17"/>as to your continued rustication (gathering of health as to both of you, I hope it still proves). Blessings be with you both.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Ruskin,</salute></p>
<p>My heart is sore for you in these dreary moments. A great change has befallen; irrevocable, inexorable,&#x02014;the lot of all the world since it was first made, and yet so strangely original, as it were miraculous, to each of us, when it comes home to himself. The Wearied One has gone to her welcome Rest;<note n="1" noteref="79">Ruskin&#x02019;s mother, Margaret, died at Denmark Hill, <date when="1871-12-05">5 Dec.</date>; TC noted in his journal, <date when="1871-12-08">8 Dec.</date>; &#x0201C;Ruskin&#x02019;s aged Mother (90 or so) died last Tuesday (just <hi rend="italic">while</hi> I last wrote here); a small-Note from him that night, every <hi rend="italic">word</hi> of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was like a tear&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).

The gold is very pure, and if you will be at the pretty pains of washing it, will I hope gleam out with Venetian light&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 555.58).</note>
 and to you there is a strange, regretful, mournful desolation, in looking before and back;&#x02014;to all of us the loss of our Mother is a new epoch in our Life-pilgrimage, now fallen lon<supplied>[e]</supplied>lier and sterner than it ever seemed before.&#x02014; &#x02014; I cannot come to you; nor would it be proper or permissible, for reasons evident. But I beg you very much to come to me at any hour, and let me see you for a little, after those sad and solemn duties now fallen to you are performed. Believe always that my hearts sympathies are with you, and that I love you well.</p>

 but in that there is gradual remedy, and a solacement from the very first. Lay this to heart and practically consider it I beg of you. I know not whether you could again think of undertaking tuition, even of a gifted young soul and in the favourablest circumstances; but that if you did like it, is still clearly within your scope. In literature too you may believe me when I speak it, there are useful things, far beyond what reviewers call useful that are still possible to you. Not everybody, you may depend on it has as clear a recognition, and as genial and piously wise a judgement of the many things she has <pb id="pg-48-19" n="48:19"/>experienced and looked at it<note n="7" noteref="87">Thus in MS.</note>

&#x02014;in fact a little Picture of yourself and what you have seen and lived through in this world, would not even that be a thing to prize?

<p>I had but little more to say, if anything; and the paper is done. Mary herself is writing to you; and I doubt not will furnish abundant details.<note n="11" noteref="91">Mary wrote to Wellmer, <date when="1871-12-06">6 Dec.</date>, telling her about the death of her brother James Aitken; she sent Wellmer a photograph of herself, although she did not like it, as TC insisted; she concluded: &#x0201C;My Uncle writes to you today; so this will go with his letter&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9207).</note>

<p><salute>Dear Duffy,</salute></p>
<p>A good many weeks ago, I had your friendly and cheerful little Note, which was very welcome to me after the long silence. It has lain on my table ever since; daily soliciting some answer, and strange to say daily in vain. Truth is, my own right hand having grown entirely useless to me for writing, the business is altogether disagreeable and even, in the old sense, impossible (for &#x0201C;dictation,&#x0201D; do what I will, never rightly prospers); and the indolence and torpor, now grown habitual, especially in these heavy, dark November and December days, with their fogs and fitful frosts, deter me altogether from answering any letter, except under actual compulsion of the hour. <hi rend="italic">Tant&#x000F9;m mutatus ab illo</hi> [how changed from what he once was]!<note n="1" noteref="101">Cf. Virgil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> 2.274.</note>
&#x02014; I also had safely delivered by <pb id="pg-48-21" n="48:21"/>the Postman your copy of <hi rend="italic">Homes in the Land of Plenty</hi>; recognisable as yours by the handwriting outside, which also was kindly welcome to me: I already had a copy from the Author;<note n="2" noteref="102">Rev. James Ballantyne, <hi rend="italic">Homes and Homesteads in the Land of Plenty: A Handbook of Victoria as a Field for Emigration</hi> (Melbourne, <date when="1871">1871</date>). Rev. James Ballantyne (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1896">96</date>), b. Galashiels, educ. Glasgow and Edinburgh Univs., ordained United Presbyterian minister, <date when="1848">1848</date>; minister at Earlston, <date when="1848">1848</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">50</date>, Arthur Street Church, Edinburgh, <date when="1850">1850</date>&#x02013;<date when="1854">54</date>; he was involved in the temperance society and the anti-slavery society; he emigrated to Australia and became a minister in Melbourne, <date when="1855">1855</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">76</date>. No other contact with TC has been traced.</note>
 and had read most part of it; but this I sent to the Chelsea Library for behoof of my Fellow-Citizens, and have put yours, as naturally worthier, in its stead. Another paper, excellently written and conceived, concerning the Association of all your Australian Colonies into one,<note n="3" noteref="103">Duffy was prominent in promoting the federation of the Australian states from <date when="1857">1857</date>; he chaired a Royal Commission on the subject that pbd. the report, <date when="1870-10-03">3 Oct. 1870</date>, &#x0201C;Federal Union: First Report of the Royal Commission&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Papers</hi> <date when="1870">1870</date> II: 2nd Session, No. 10), in which Duffy emphasized the advantage of federation as a means of common defense against foreign aggression, and demanded the right to remain neutral if Britain was at war. An intercolonial conference was held in Melbourne, <date when="1871-09">Sept. 1871</date>; Duffy&#x02019;s plan was rejected.</note>
 I also received and read with approval and good wishes at the time you intended;&#x02014;for all these things accept my hearty thanks in the lump; and pardon me for loitering so long with that poor return.</p>
<p>It gives me real pleasure to find you again in Office;<note n="4" noteref="104">Duffy was appointed premier and chief secretary of Victoria, <date when="1871-06">June 1871</date>. He wrote to TC, <date when="1871-09-06">6 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;For the last few months I have been employed in steering the ship of the state, and find it a toilsome and exhausting task. But labour never proved so pleasant as carrying long cherished projects into effect, it is the flesh therefore that wearies, not the spirit&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1770.75).</note>
 and ruling, so far as any rule is possible, what geographically we may call one of the <hi rend="italic">largest</hi> Empires (for your Colony is clearly the presiding one) that is to be found on the face of the earth! I rejoice also to hear that your Ministry succeeds, or was succeeding when we last heard: the ideas you had upon it, so far as I could gather, were sound and good, and deserved success. One thing I always earnestly wish, in reference to Australia and its progress, That you and Mother-Country could contrive some way to have ten times as much emigration. For fifty years the possibility of this, and the immensely beneficial effects of it (especially for <hi rend="italic">us</hi>) have hung before my mind as certainties, even as axioms, evident like those of Euclid; the total neglect of which, in the face of such circumstances as ours are now plainly becoming, has often filled me, and yet fills, whenever I think of it (which is now seldomer), with astonishment, impatience and even indignation. &#x0201C;Administrative Nihilism,&#x0201D; as Huxley calls it,<note n="5" noteref="105">&#x0201C;Administrative Nihilism,&#x0201D; Thomas Henry Huxley&#x02019;s address to the members of the Midland Institute, <date when="1871-10-09">9 Oct. 1871</date>; pbd. <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi>, <date when="1871-11">Nov. 1871</date>.</note>
 that is the explanation; and, alas, what Huxley does not say or quite see, <pb id="pg-48-22" n="48:22"/>Nihilism of that kind is precisely the apple that grows and must grow upon every Parliamentary tree in our day. This I at last perceive; and it quiets me on many a grievance a Government carried on by Parliamentary palaver and Universal Suffrage, with penny newspapers presiding, must necessarily be a Do-nothingism, and neglect [not]<note n="6" noteref="106">Word omitted in MS.</note>
 only its Colonies, but every other interest, temporal and eternal, except that of getting majorities for itself by hook or by crook. If on these terms we can consider it the best of all kinds of Government, we are free to do so; but the consequences are, have been, and will ever be Nihilism, as above said by Huxley,&#x02014;nay <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">minus</hi>ism</hi> (as I could say) to an ever more frightful, ruinious, detestable and even damnable extent; the ultimatum of which is Petrolium and what we have seen in Paris not so long ago!&#x02014; &#x02014; In spite of all this, I still privately hope there is patriot honesty and probity enough on both sides of the Ocean Not to let this immense and noble interest sink to the seabottom, but to save it as probably the very greatest that ever was entrusted to the guidance of a nation. Enough, Oh far too much of this; what have I to do with it more?</p>
<p>Your friend Forster has been here since I began this letter. He is still busy and unwearied; though laden with a great burden of almost perpetual ill-health, especially in Wintertime. He has just been some weeks on the Southern Coast taking his holiday there; he looks really a little stronger, and will front under better omens the three months&#x02019; service that still remain to him. Were April the 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi> once here, F. can claim his pension;<note n="7" noteref="107">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711129-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1871-11-29">29 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 and will without a day&#x02019;s delay give the matter up. I do hope, and indeed expect, he will be able to achieve this without farther permanent damage; and then there is plain sailing, so far as one can see, and nothing worse.&#x02014; The whole world is, in these very days and weeks, full of F. and his <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi>, for which there is a perfect rage or public famine (Copies not to be supplied fast enough):<note n="8" noteref="108">Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> sold out before publication; the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> recorded its progress: &#x0201C;The whole of the first edition of the first volume of Mr. Forster&#x02019;s &#x02018;Life of Charles Dickens&#x02019; has been subscribed for by the trade, and the second edition is at press&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1871-12-02">2 Dec.</date>); &#x0201C;Third edition is nearly ready&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1871-12-09">9 Dec.</date>); &#x0201C;A <hi rend="small-caps">fifth</hi> edition of Mr. Forster&#x02019;s &#x02018;Life of Dickens&#x02019; will appear shortly. Over 2,000 copies have been subscribed for by the trade&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1871-12-16">16 Dec.</date>); &#x0201C;The sixth edition is now ready&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1871-12-23">23 Dec.</date>); &#x0201C;The ninth edition now ready&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> <date when="1871-12-30">30 Dec.</date>).</note>
&#x02014;I should [think]<note n="9" noteref="109">Word omitted in MS.</note>
 it likely there is a Copy on the Sea for you too; and that you will read it with interest and satisfaction two or three months hence, in some holiday you may have. It it<note n="10" noteref="110">Thus in MS.</note>
 curious, and in part surprising; yields a true view of Dickens (great part of it being even of his own writing); only one Vol. of it, <pb id="pg-48-23" n="48:23"/>the Second not to be begun till after the above-mentioned April 5. Me nothing in it so surprises as these two American explosions round poor Dickens,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> Yankee-doodle-dodom blazing up like one universal Soda-water Bottle round so very measurable a Phenomenon, this and the way the Phenomenon takes it was curiously and even genially interesting to me, and significant of Yankee-doodle-doodom. Vol. First ends with a Soda-Water explosion which we may reckon genially <hi rend="italic">comic</hi>; Vol. Second will end with a ditto which has a dark Death&#x02019;s head in it; and has always seemed to me very tragic and very mournful.<note n="11" noteref="111">The six last chapters of vol. 1 covered Dickens&#x02019;s visit to North America; it is not clear exactly to which incidents TC referred; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711205-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1871-12-05">5 Dec.</date></ref></note>
</p>
<p>With regard to myself, there is almost nothing to be said that you do not already know. A week ago yesterday I entered on my 77<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year; I am not worse in health than that means, nor can I brag of being much better; I do retain nearly complete <hi rend="italic">soundness</hi> of organs, but the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> of everything is inevitably lessening every day; the Son of Adam has to do,<note n="12" noteref="112">Thus in MS, for &#x0201C;die.&#x0201D;</note>
 and, if like a tree, it is to be by aid of time alone, one knows not whether that is not perhaps, within certain limits, the less desirable way. But we have no choice left in the matter, and are surely bound to be thankful to be left on any tolerable terms in the Land of the Living and the Place of <hi rend="italic">Hope</hi>.<note n="13" noteref="113">See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note>
 You ask what I am doing, dear Duffy, I am verily <hi rend="italic">doing</hi> nothing,<note n="14" noteref="114">Duffy wrote: &#x0201C;I cannot believe it possible that you are idle and I am watching for the fruit of your labour. You have no choice any more than the river has a choice to flow on till it reaches the sea or the swamp; I do not ask therefore whether you are working, but on what are you working?&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1770.75).</note>
 knotting up some thrums of my life&#x02019;s Web; gazing, with more and more earnestness and generally with love and tenderness rather than any worse feeling into the Eternity which can now only be a few steps ahead: I avoid all company except that of one or two close friends. Last winter I read most of my <hi rend="italic">Goethe</hi> over again; reading a good Book is in fact my most favourite employment; even an <hi rend="italic">intelligent</hi> book, by an honest-hearted man is tolerable to me, and my best way of spending the evening&#x02014;Adieu, dear Friend; you see there is not a speck more of room.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>The night before last your welcome Letter came to hand; I am very glad to hear of you again, with nothing but good news, after so long a silence. Neither of us can now write much; to myself the inability to write with my own poor right hand is, on all sides, a severe affliction, and announcement that my <hi rend="italic">work</hi> is properly speaking done: but not the less, nay all the more, perhaps, one&#x02019;s thoughts go free; and I doubt not there is fully as much communication between Canada and me in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> way as there ever was by any other. Many thanks for the trouble you have taken to give me some shadow of your doings and various fortunes there.</p>
<p>One bit of news gratified me specially: that of poor old Sandbed John<note n="1" noteref="129">Their half-brother, John, was known as Sandbed John because he was raised by his grandfather John Carlyle (ca. <date when="1742">1742</date>&#x02013;<date when="1835">1835</date>; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350430-TC-JAC-01"><sic>8:102</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1835-04-30">30 April 1835</date></corr></ref>), farmer at Sandbed, Middlebie parish.</note>
 getting out of his lonesome Shanty into a better circle of surroundings;&#x02014;I do hope and trust his Daughter<note n="2" noteref="130">John Carlyle&#x02019;s surviving da. was Janet Ellis, b. Carlyle.</note>
 will be daughter-like, and faithfully good to him; she must be much unlike what I can suppose her if this be not an altogether favourable change for the poor old man. That of the <hi rend="italic">Kist-lid</hi> bed and heap of <hi rend="italic">duds</hi>, where you had last seen him, was a most grim and rugged picture; totally unsuitable to the most stoical old man within a step or two of his 80<hi rend="italic">th</hi> year!&#x02014; Directly on reading your Letter, the wish rose in me to send the <pb id="pg-48-26" n="48:26"/>good old man a little Gift and Memorial of kinship and days that are gone; I wrote, accordingly, at once to John at Dumfries, and he at once returns me the enclosed Bank Document,<note n="3" noteref="131">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711214-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-12-14">14 Dec.</date></ref></note>
 which you are to get translated into a Draft of Canada Dollars for him and to present inclosed in the letter, bearing his address, which goes along with this. I know well you will not grudge the trouble, and will do the thing with punctuality and convenient speed. The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> from Dumfries suggests that New-Year&#x02019;s Day would be a fit time for your making your appearance with the little message: &#x0201C;at <hi rend="italic">Old</hi> New-Year&#x02019;s Day,&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="132">&#x0201C;Old New-Year&#x02019;s Day&#x0201D; under the Julian Calendar was <date when="--01-12">12 Jan.</date> and was still traditionally celebrated as New Year in parts of Scotland.</note>
 if not at <hi rend="italic">New</hi>, there will be time enough to have the thing ready,&#x02014;we here for our part waste no time, but write by the very first post. I also enclose the D<hi rend="italic">r&#x02019;s</hi> Letter of this morning, which contains the freshest news from our kindred in Scotland,&#x02014;and at least tells you the state of the weather!</p>
<p>Our poor Sister at Dumfries bears up valiantly under what is doubtless the heaviest stroke that ever befel her:<note n="5" noteref="133">The death of Jean&#x02019;s son James Aitken Jr.; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct.</date></ref></note>
 I was at Dumfries sitting at breakfast with her when the Telegram came, summoning Mary and her to London; I have seldom seen a more pathetic scene than that of her rising instantly from the half done meal and starting on the tragic journey, and with a world of wild sorrow carefully repressed, or struggling nobly to repress itself, getting down to the railway in little less than half an hour. The whole occurrence was of cruelly tragic nature; and has deeply grieved us all. There is only one Son now left to poor Jean; John, the youngest of the three; whom I think you never saw; he is now in London, getting settled as a Clerk favourably beside us here;&#x02014;it was on rapid visit to him that poor James found his death in that tragic manner. This John also is an honest, ingenious and kindly creature, of whom we all hope good, now that he has got delivered out of his long dormantcy (as Clerk at Dumfries in some Branch Bank, under one they called <hi rend="italic">Leein&#x02019; Jamie</hi>)<note n="6" noteref="134">James Gordon (<date when="1809">1809</date>&#x02013;<date when="1884">84</date>); John Aitken was previously employed as a bank clerk at the Commercial Bank, Dumfries; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701017-TC-WM-01"><sic>47:82</sic><corr>TC to WM, <date when="1870-10-17">17 Oct. 1870</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 into a wider and freer field.</p>
<p>Your own two Boys made a memorable day for me last Autumn;<note n="7" noteref="135">Alick and James Carlyle, who visited Britain in the summer; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710809-TC-SWA-01"><sic>47:222</sic><corr>TC to SWA, <date when="1871-08-09">9 Aug. 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 and I may tell you, their Father, that I really liked them both well, as indeed we all did in the Old Country; I have seldom seen a pair of young men, whose modest rational and affectionate ways were more agreeable to me. You may tell Alick in particular&#x02014;or even <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tell him, if you so think fitter&#x02014;that I expect considerable things from him, in the Scholarly or otherwise intellectual way, though I by no means urge <hi rend="italic">that</hi> on him, No, No. let him try to be a faithful <pb id="pg-48-27" n="48:27"/>man in whatever station he alights; that is all I require of him. To your good Jimmie also, whose sensible discreet and kindly way, and even whose Yankee accent (or even imagined resemblance of such) was singular and agreeable to me, I send my affectionate regards and best wishes,&#x02014;do not forget this. Goodluck be with them all, poor Fellows. There is something mournfully beautiful to see the hearty Young Ones starting on the race, when one is quitting it oneself. Right good speed to them, and honest speed above all!</p>
<p>Our Brother Jamie of Scotsbrig we hear is at Birmingham, with his Daughter and Son in law,<note n="8" noteref="136">Jenny and William Scott.</note>
 whither he often goes of late years in the Winter season; I suppose he feels better there; his Daughter is naturally very good to him. I believe her Husband too is a worthy and friendly sort of man, and that they are well enough off in their financial affairs. Poor Jamie has generally a good deal to do with ill-health, want of sleep &#x00026;c, want of power to <hi rend="italic">eat</hi>, poor Fellow;&#x02014;and I can well believe that a skilful Nurse and <hi rend="italic">Cook</hi> who takes pains with him must be of great benefit and comfort in his case. At home he usually alternates between Scotsbrig and Craigenputtock; liking the latter rather more (they can observe) the Housewife<note n="9" noteref="137">Catherine, wife of James Carlyle Jr., at Craigenputtoch.</note>
 there being rather the skilfuller. John&#x02019;s Wife<note n="10" noteref="138">Margaret, wife of John Carlyle, at Scotsbrig.</note>
 at Scotsbrig is a very amiable honest creature, whom I have seen just twice, for a little while each time, but I can believe the general opinion entertained, that in housewifery she is below the level rather than above. Jamie is prosperous otherwise, and I believe has plenty to live upon, and latterly finds all his enterprises prosper reasonably well.</p>
<p>Be so good as send me one word, dear Brother, when you have received this enclosure, and undertaken this message: one word to this effect (or even a Newspaper addressed to me with <hi rend="italic">three strokes</hi>) will suffice so far: so soon as you have <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> the thing, please report in another word;&#x02014;but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> you can make Tom<note n="11" noteref="139">Alexander&#x02019;s eldest son, Thomas.</note>
 do. That will be the method: <hi rend="italic">Newspaper</hi> first, then Letter by Tom or <hi rend="italic">Jimmie</hi>.</p>
<p>God bless you all, young and old, dear dear Brother. I ever am,</p>

<p><salute>Dear Marshall,</salute></p>
<p>You were very good very diligent and successful in that matter of Goethe&#x02019;s Hand;<note n="1" noteref="145">Mary Aitken had written to Marshall earlier in the year at TC&#x02019;s request (letter untraced), asking if he knew if there were a cast of Goethe&#x02019;s hands. Marshall replied, <date when="1871-06-20">20 June</date>, that as he was not in Weimar at the time, he had asked his son to enquire and had since heard that there was such a cast, currently untraced; he, Marshall, would be returning to Weimar very soon, and would continue the search. He had apparently been successful.</note>
 and gave the &#x0201C;great lady&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="146">Lady Ashburton; Mary Aitken wrote to her, <date when="1871-06-23">23 June</date>: &#x0201C;I have here copied the part of a Letter wh. came to my Uncle this morning (in answer to one I wrote to M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Marshall at Weimar) which refers to the possibilities of getting a Cast of Goethe&#x02019;s Hands. We hope he will be able to find them&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>
 much satisfaction in regard to it. I have not <pb id="pg-48-29" n="48:29"/>myself seen the plaster Cast; but it is safe at Melchet within a hundred miles of me; and I hope to admire it attentively with much interest one day. Though it seemed a singular fact that Madame von Goethe<note n="3" noteref="147">Ottilie von Goethe (<date when="1796">1796</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">1872</date>), Goethe&#x02019;s da.-in-law; she had cared for Goethe until his death in <date when="1832">1832</date>.</note>
 could not recognize it either to be or else not to be the great Man&#x02019;s hand, I thought and think there could be no reasonable doubt but that it was veritably his; at all event there was evidently no clearer evidence anywhere to be obtained on the subject.</p>
<p>I owe you many thanks for your prompt kind, and indeed troublesome endeavours in this matter; and in short for the expeditious felicity with which you accomplished and finished it. The Lady herself I believe wrote you a word of receipt and acknowledgment; I had myself undertaken to pay you the small money-expense (which indeed, so far as I could guess your German Coins into English, was singularly small, not a half or a third of what it might have been): but now, in this long delay, I have both lost the papers and quite forgotten the sum;&#x02014;so that unless my good Marshall will again have the kindness to tell me what it was, and how to send it from England to Weimar, I absolutely cannot pay him! From this small downbreak into Bankruptcy let <hi rend="italic">him</hi> again relieve me, if his goodness will again go so far!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I have, what has for some months been my intention, had a copy of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell</hi> (&#x0201C;people&#x02019;s edition&#x0201D;),<note n="4" noteref="148"><hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell&#x02019;s Letters and Speeches</hi>, vols. 15&#x02013;19 of the people&#x02019;s edn. (<date when="1871">1871</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">72</date>). Marshall replied, <date when="1872-02-01">1 Feb. 1872</date>, apologizing for the delay, explaining that it was caused by the death of his oldest son, <date when="1872-01-06">6 Jan.</date> He continued: &#x0201C;Your Cromwell has proved a real god-send to me in these dreary days&#x02014;so much so indeed, that I cannot help thinking that it was a higher power than mere chance, which prompted you to send it me at the time you did. The high, unworldly tone of thinking which pervades both the text and the commentary has been a support and comfort to me during many a long sleepless night.&#x0201D; Marshall had four sons, another of whom had d. <date when="1854">1854</date> (see <ref target="volume-29/lt-18550225-TC-JMA-01"><sic>29:268</sic><corr>TC to JMA, <date when="1855-02-25">25 Feb. 1855</date></corr></ref>), and one da.</note>
 the latest of the things they have been printing for me here, packed up for you, to be dispatched for Weimar day after tomorrow, by such conveyance as there is; and I hope it may arrive sometime about New-Year&#x02019;s Day; and be a kind of friendly salutation to you though otherwise of little or no use. If it say symbolically that I look back with pleasure and affection on all the passages that have been between us, and wish you cordially, you and yours, all manner of good in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> world or <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>, it will certainly tell you no lie nor shadow of a lie! and so give it welcome, dear Marshall.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-30" n="48:30"/>I have grown very old, and am naturally growing weaker year by year and day by day: but except <hi rend="italic">weakness</hi>, I have no special complaint, no bodily organ zone diseased at all; &#x00026; am faring along slowly steadily the &#x0201C;way of all the Earth,&#x0201D; under the fairest kind of circumstances granted to those that are doomed to live so long. Mournfully tender, very solemn, very <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> it often seems to me; but I try to &#x0201C;live in <hi rend="italic">Islam</hi>,&#x0201D; as Goethe tells us we should all do;<note n="5" noteref="149">Goethe, &#x0201C;Book of Maxims&#x0201D; verse 39, <hi rend="italic">West-&#x000F6;stlicher Divan</hi> (<date when="1819">1819</date>): &#x0201C;If Islam means submission to God, we all live and die in Islam&#x02019;s dominion.&#x0201D; See also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 5:56.</note>
 and indeed know no other precept or recipe that will fit all worlds. Very hateful to me are the Anarchies, the platitudes and basenesses of these poor times that are come. Detestable, contemptible, altogether damnable seem to me the Darwinisms, and other Philosophic Balderdashes (<hi rend="italic">Poltertaschen</hi>) that have risen; but I hold my peace upon them, know they can be temporary only; and peaceably hold on my way. Why quarrel now with any ugliest jackass one may find upon the road, which is so near done?</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Here is another day of miscellaneous wet puddle that, out of its interruptions and confusion, will yield nothing for me but a <hi rend="italic">glaury</hi> walk in Mackintosh to Hyde Park and back;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">preceeded</hi> by this little word to you in such circumstances as there are.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-31" n="48:31"/>I duly received your two letters about the beginning of the week; and was much obliged for the trouble you had taken. Thornhill, especially Holm Hill and its memories remain with me always, upon what basis you well know; I am very glad to hear that poor M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell is rather in an improving state at least not worse, or visibly growing so; and the honest old D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and she are not to have their household gods, and innocent life-partnership swallowed in dark clouds, as all earthly households have to be, till a yet unknown time. Give my best regards to both of them by your next opportunity.<note n="1" noteref="153">Dr. James and Mary Russell of Holmhill; John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1872-01-11">11 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;Yesterday I went to see D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x00026; Mrs Russell. &#x02026; I found Mrs Russell looking better than when I saw her in <date when="1871-10">October</date>. She has had less of headaches, generally sleeps tolerably well, &#x00026; looks cheerful &#x00026; resigned.

His recent works included <hi rend="italic">The Luck of Roaring Camp: And Other Sketches</hi> (Boston, <date when="1870">1870</date>), <hi rend="italic">That Heathen Chinee and Other Poems Mostly Humorous</hi> (<date when="1871">1871</date>), and <hi rend="italic">Lothaw or the Adventures of a Young Gentleman in Search of a Religion</hi> (<date when="1871">1871</date>).</note>
 a recent American Celebrity, may perhaps suit them for reading, or perhaps even you or Jean at Dumfries in the first place. It belongs intrinsically to Mary to whom I made gift of it some time ago, but she is willing to surrender it awhile on this errand, having herself read it before. Brett Harte himself is a notable kind of object, a man altogether modelled upon Dickens, like Dickens, seeking his Heroes in the region of b<supplied>[l]</supplied>ackguardism and the gutters, where heroic magnanimities and benevolences, I believe, were never found; and delineating them like him by ell-deep mimicry instead of penetration to the real root of them and their affairs,&#x02014;which indeed lies much farther down! Like Dickens, however he does the feat generally rather well; and I suppose will continue at the same mode of workmanship, though a man of more weight of metal than Dickens was. I heard first that he was still young, which made me think he might mend; but by the last accounts he is towards 40; and I consider shaped for life. Read him, if you can at Dumfries, then at Holmhill;<note n="3" noteref="155">John replied, <date when="1872-01-22">22 Jan.</date>, thanking TC for his letter and the books: &#x0201C;Jean has already read most of the American, &#x00026; she thinks it will be interesting to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> &#x00026; Mrs Russell.&#x0201D; John wrote, <date when="1872-01-28">28 Jan.</date> &#x0201C;I did read Harte&#x02019;s Californian stories one evening &#x00026; found them amusing, &#x00026; here &#x00026; there very clever, but one could not stand much continuance of such reading.&#x0201D;</note>
 and let him fight his own battle. Last night there came some messages newspapers &#x00026;c from Canada: one Letter, insignificant enough, I think from near Niagara,<note n="4" noteref="156">Unidentified further.</note>
 which I enclose today; and another vastly superior Note from Emerson;<note n="5" noteref="157">Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, <date when="1872-01-05">5 Jan.</date>, that &#x0201C;the last rich instalment of your Library Edition&#x0201D; had arrived: &#x0201C;&#x00026; now my stately collection is perfect. &#x02026; Happy man you should be, to whom the Heaven has allowed such masterly completion.&#x0201D;</note>
 which I keep here for a day or two, not having yet got it properly read, <pb id="pg-48-32" n="48:32"/>but will send to you in a day or two. My other Canada communication was a Newspaper from Alick Junior at Bield; Newspaper with nothing in it, but with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> strokes on the cover of it, which perhaps was meant as an indication that the Money order for poor old John<note n="6" noteref="158">John Carlyle, their half-brother; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711214-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1871-12-14">14 Dec. 1871</date></ref>.</note>

For there came from Alick Jun<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, withal, a Letter for Mary,<note n="7" noteref="159">Mary Aitken and Alick Carlyle met the previous summer; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710809-TC-SWA-01"><sic>47:222</sic><corr>TC to SWA, <date when="1871-08-09">9 Aug. 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 which, it seems, said nothing of it. One word on the subject I shall hope to get by and by; but <hi rend="italic">may do without it tow</hi>, like the gomeril at Scotsbrig in reference to the moon.<note n="8" noteref="160">Unidentified.</note>
</p>
<p>A full week ago you were promised to have that poor &#x0201C;Preface&#x0201D; to the Saga, touching upon the Norse Kings it is concerned with; alas, it is not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> finished,<note n="9" noteref="161">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date></ref>. TC and Mary completed their translation of the <hi rend="italic">F&#x000E6;reyinga Saga</hi> <date when="1871-12-15">mid-Dec. 1871</date>, but TC had not yet finished the preface that was to form the basis of &#x0201C;Early Kings of Norway&#x0201D; (<date when="1875">1875</date>). William Allingham recorded in his diary, <date when="1872-01-24">24 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;C. dictating to his niece introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Saga</hi>&#x02014;Heimskringla, Norse Chiefs&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Allingham Diary</hi> 208).</note>
 nor dare I yet promise it in another week. Nothing can excel or equal the interruptions &#x00026; paltry obstacles that have continually come in the way of ending it: but end it I will, if spared alive;&#x02014;nay, in the meanwhile, it is better to me, with all its chaotic adjuncts, than if I had in my mind nothing at all to regard as &#x0201C;Work.&#x0201D; As I grope about, read <hi rend="italic">Snorro</hi><note n="10" noteref="162">Snorro Sturleson; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date></ref>.</note>
 again &#x00026;c &#x00026;c, I find a great many meanings attach themselves to those old Tryggvesons, Hakons, Olafs,<note n="11" noteref="163">Olaf Tryggavson (ca. 960&#x02013;1000), king of Norway 995&#x02013;1000, Haakon Haraldsson, or Haakon the Good (ca. 920&#x02013;61), king of Norway 934&#x02013;61, Olaf the Thick-set, and Olaf II, or Olaf the Saint (995&#x02013;1030), king of Norway 1015&#x02013;28; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:201&#x02013;310.</note>
 and their work in this world; and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> I knew Icelandic, like you,<note n="12" noteref="164">John A. Carlyle had used his knowledge of Icelandic to criticize TC&#x02019;s trans.; he wrote, <date when="1871-12-25">25 Dec. 1871</date>: &#x0201C;It is on the whole very readable, though incorrect in several places so far as I can see. I have gone through it all. It is from the German of Mohnike [see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date></ref>], which I have not here &#x00026; therefore cannot judge how far he has deviated from the original.&#x0201D; He then listed some specific corrections: &#x0201C;I have marked errors in pencil as I went thro&#x02019; the Saga; but if there is to be any detailed correction, I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> require to have the vol. you translate from beside me. The Saga is not without merits, though one of the poorest I have read.&#x0201D; He continued with further corrections of Icelandic word meanings.</note>
 (and, alas, if I had my own right hand but not otherwise), I feel as if I could still write a rather bright and useful little Book about them! which reminds me of the old rough proverb in Annandale dialect&#x02014; If Ifs and ands were pots &#x00026; pans!<note n="13" noteref="165">Proverbial.</note>
 In brief you shall have that Preface, if I be spared a little while.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Brother, for this day; it is full time I were addressing myself to my muddy walk, since that is to be the sole achievement, as appears. This tepid, dark and <hi rend="italic">glaury</hi> weather I think with you, is unfavourable to health; <pb id="pg-48-33" n="48:33"/>as, certainly, it is depressing and distressing. Nevertheless, except continual trouble with the grinder teeth, or the gums there about, I dont feel worse than usual, rather the reverse; and have reason to be thankful. Give my love to Jean and everybody; my Blessings on you all.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,&#x02014;</salute>Many thanks for your Letter; it is longer more deliberate than usual &#x00026; contains various details &#x00026; observations that were interesting to <pb id="pg-48-35" n="48:35"/>read.<note n="1" noteref="178">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1872-01-28">28 Jan.</date>, commenting on letters TC had enclosed in TC to JAC, <date when="1872-01-25">25 Jan.</date>, including one of Emerson&#x02019;s. He wrote about J. G. Lockhart being partly blamed for the duel between Jonathan Henry Christie (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1876">1876</date>), lawyer, and Dr. John Scott (<date when="1783">1783</date>&#x02013;<date when="1821">1821</date>), resulting in Scott&#x02019;s death; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210109-TC-JAC-01"><sic>1:302</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1821-01-09">9 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>, and Leonidas M. Jones, &#x0201C;The Scott-Christie Duel,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Texas Studies in Literature and Language</hi>, vol. 12 no. 4 (Winter <date when="1971">1971</date>) 605&#x02013;29. John then commented on the working life of Lockhart: &#x0201C;One can hardly imagine a more unwholesome occupation than he had in working for the early numbers of Blackwoods Magazine in such a place as Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> then was. &#x02026; He had much more talent than he gets credit for, had a real feeling for all that is highest &#x00026; noblest in literature, &#x00026; supreme hatred &#x00026; disdain for every kind of meanness &#x00026; imposture.&#x0201D;</note>
 I intended you a long letter today; but am driven by stress of time &#x00026;c to put you off with a mere word, to the effect that all is in the usual way here.&#x02014; You may tell Jean also that her beautiful collars<note n="2" noteref="179">Jean C. Aitken wrote, <date when="1872-01-30">30 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;I last night sent off &#x02026; a dozen of shirt collars for you&#x02014;having noticed that the old ones were a little frayed when you were here. &#x02026; Will you kindly accept them as the smallest of gifts.&#x0201D; She ended her letter: &#x0201C;I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be <hi rend="italic">so</hi> glad if you could send me a single line sometimes. But do not if it bothers you as I much fear it does.&#x0201D;</note>
 have arrived within the last &#x000BD; hour all safe, 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi> to pay (Mary says they w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have come by post altogether for 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>! consider another time). Thank Jean very much; say I find her very mindful &#x00026; the collars seem first rate.</p>
<p>You will get y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> on Tuesday morning. I might almost have sent it today but do not quite. There are several articles worth looking into, especially one by Owen upon&#x02014;&#x0201C;Longevity&#x0201D; (of the old Hebrew Patriarchs particularly!),<note n="3" noteref="180">Richard Owen&#x02019;s &#x0201C;On Longevity,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> (<date when="1872-02">Feb. 1872</date>): 218&#x02013;233, refuted the assumption that &#x0201C;the longevity specified in Genesis v. might be possible in the sense of compatibility with the physiologically ascertained laws of human life&#x0201D; (219).</note>
 that contains curious observations &#x00026; physiognomic Owenisms also, not a few. Of course you can have our following <hi rend="italic">Frasers</hi> forwarded, without ill done to me or to poor Walter at Auchtertool<note n="4" noteref="181">Rev. Walter Welsh, minister, Auchtertool, Fife.</note>
 in any means or degree upon the terms offered by you. All right that.</p>
<p>Today there has come an interesting letter from Marshall<note n="5" noteref="182">James Marshall; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711223-TC-JM-01">TC to JM, <date when="1871-12-23">23 Dec. 1871</date></ref>.</note>
 of Weimar, with a thrice interesting enclosure (wh. might really be a kind of indiscretion on Marshalls part, did not one take heed!).&#x02014; I send the whole to you read it to Jean only, pray, after you have made it out yrself &#x00026; send it back at y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> convenience.<note n="6" noteref="183">Marshall wrote, <date when="1872-02-01">1 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I did <supplied>[give]</supplied> your messages to the Grand-Duchess&#x02014;or, rather &#x02026; I sent her your letter to read. &#x02026; She returned me the letter accompanied with a brief note, which so exactly expresses my own appreciation of it, that, at the risk of committing a <hi rend="italic">very great</hi> indiscretion, I venture to enclose it along with this.&#x0201D; John sent it back quickly as TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1872-02-15">15 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;Pretty little Note ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me from the Grand-Duchess of Weimar;&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I will stick on here, unless it be <hi rend="italic">already</hi> lost &#x02026; &#x02018;Grand-Duchess of Weimar, to her Sec<hi rend="italic">y</hi> Marshall (<date when="1872-01">jan<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 1872</date>)&#x02019;&#x0201D;; the letter (in French) was about Marshall&#x02019;s letter from TC. TC wrote on the reverse: &#x0201C;inclosed in Letter from Marshall,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">now</hi> lying somewhere among my <hi rend="italic">Brother&#x02019;s</hi> big packages here&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).

 I will not add another word, Mary withal being very eager to get out <pb id="pg-48-36" n="48:36"/>to keep her appointment with John.<note n="7" noteref="184">John and Mary Aitken went for walks together on Saturdays; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711118-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-11-18">18 Nov. 1871</date></ref>.</note>

<p><salute>Dear young Lady</salute></p>
<p>Your Verses<note n="1" noteref="187">Unidentified; probably unpbd.</note>
 which I return by this post are very amiable and pretty; I trace in them clear evidence of natural ingenuity, sensibility and a gracious enthusiastic and most willing mind. But, in very love to you, I am bound to add, that, in my opinion, you do not yet seem fit to be a &#x0201C;Worker&#x0201D; in this vocal way; and that a long course of good reading (wise books, I mean, and avoiding of the foolish kind like poison!) of good reading, earnest study, observation, self-examination and reflection will be the indispensable preliminary to any really useful, wise or important <hi rend="italic">Working</hi> in that department. This is not said to discourage you; but only to admonish and exhort.</p>
<p>Another, probably still more severe-looking, thing I must say or hint. That, when you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> amassed any stock of thoughts that seem to you new, and justly imperative for utterance, you should rather try to utter them by the direct and clearest method,&#x02014;namely, in well written prose; verse, or &#x0201C;poetry&#x0201D; as it is called, except when you absolutely cannot express your thought by speaking, but are <hi rend="italic">compelled</hi> to singing of it, I have for many years regarded as a melancholy waste of human faculty in those times. This is all I had to say; and you are to accept it as a friend&#x02019;s word, not an enemy&#x02019;s,&#x02014;for that would be a great mistake indeed.</p>
<p>Believe me to be with many thanks for your true, tho&#x02019; <hi rend="italic">wildly</hi> exaggerated kindness towards me, and with many wishes for your true success and happiness in this world,</p>

<closer><salute>Yours sincerely,</salute><br/><signed><name>T. Carlyle</name></signed>.</closer>

<postscript>
<p>P.S. Of course, there will be no needless communication of this scrap of writing, least of all any <hi rend="italic">printing</hi> of it in the Newspapers;&#x02014;far be that from us both, especially from you!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,</salute></p>
<p>I have had two bad nights, not sleepless altogether, but my worst for several months; and am very low today;&#x02014;not safe for me to undertake any party or excitation in the evening; the penalties being such, and close ahead!

<p>D<hi rend="small-caps">ear</hi> S<hi rend="small-caps">ir</hi>,&#x02014;I am very much obliged indeed by the letter I received from you yesterday morning, right thankful that you were prompted to make that visit, and to write to me such an account of it.<note n="1" noteref="194">Davidson wrote, <date when="1872-02-19">19 Feb.</date>, describing his visit, <date when="1872-02-17">17 Feb.</date>, to Betty Braid. He found she had moved two doors further down the street in Greenend, Liberton: &#x0201C;Her new abode is small but neat &#x00026; comfortable, &#x00026; in the nice carpeted room we went into I found her husband <supplied>[Alexander]</supplied> sitting by the fire.&#x0201D;</note>
 Not for many a long day have I read any letter so interesting and affecting to me;&#x02014;a letter which I shall carefully keep among my valuable records! Good old Betty is at this time the most venerable woman that I know in the world. So much of loyalty, of piety, of patient endeavor&#x02014;in a word, of noble human worth, and fine old Scotch practicality, and simple wisdom to be found there. She belongs to me also, as the last living link of scenes and places now all departed, but dear and sacred to me as no others are. She once told me something, volunteered to tell me, of that sad tragedy which happened in your eighth year;<note n="2" noteref="195">Davidson continued: &#x0201C;On the wall were photographs of her two kind friends, a coloured print of the old Church at Haddington &#x00026; a photograph of the tomb. The latter led to our speaking of the death of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Welsh in <date when="1819">1819</date>, when I was a boy of 8. Vivid were my own recollections of that solemn Sabbath morning when it was whispered that he was dead. &#x02026; Betty told me most feelingly and with no common graphic power, the circumstances of his illness &#x00026; death.&#x0201D; Davidson later recorded: &#x0201C;When I got home from this striking interview, I wrote down the substance as nearly as possible in the foregoing words, and sent it off to Mr. Carlyle&#x0201D; (Davidson, <hi rend="italic">Memories</hi> 325); for his narrative, see <ref target="volume-48/ed-48-appendix">Appendix</ref>.</note>
 a strange and solemn <pb id="pg-48-39" n="48:39"/>narrative on her part, and on mine, to which I listened speechlessly attentive: but it was nothing like so minute as yours. Thank you, thank you for this true favour done me! I hope you will again, as you propose, go out and visit poor Betty; and keep me acquainted with anything that befalls her,<note n="3" noteref="196">Davidson wrote: &#x0201C;When I told her I was going to write you she bid me say she was wonderfully well but frail her legs bowing just as they liked, like two willow wands. &#x02026; Greenside <supplied>[Greenend]</supplied> is not so near as I could wish or I should see Betty oftener. But her minister M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Guthrie, has promised to keep me acquainted with her state of health that I may be ready to see her if unwell.&#x0201D; Betty&#x02019;s minister was the Rev. David Guthrie, Free Church minister, Liberton; he was one of the sons of Dr. Thomas Guthrie (<date when="1803">1803</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873">73</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/11790"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-31/ed-31-biographical-notes"><sic>31:253</sic><corr>31:biographical notes</corr></ref>), preacher and philanthropist; JWC attended one of his sermons, <date when="1856">1856</date>; see <ref target="volume-31/lt-18560829-JWC-TC-01"><sic>31:200</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1856-08-29">[29 Aug. 1856]</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 so long as she and I are spared alive.

<p><salute>Dear Tyndall,</salute></p>
<p>My brother answers punctually by return of post; and here is a copy of the <pb id="pg-48-40" n="48:40"/>poem itself, as well as perfect indication of its place in Goethe&#x02019;s Werke.<note n="1" noteref="201">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1872-02-22">22 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I have received your note this morning, &#x00026; at once send you the poem of Goethe which you want. Your edition of his works is the same as mine, &#x00026; you will find it vol. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> p. 69.&#x0201D; Goethe&#x02019;s poem &#x0201C;Symbolum&#x0201D; (&#x0201C;Des Maurers Wandeln&#x0201D; or &#x0201C;The Mason&#x02019;s Ways&#x0201D;), <hi rend="italic">Werke I: Gedichte und Epen</hi> (Munich, <date when="1996">1996</date>): 340&#x02013;41. The edn. John refers to is Goethe&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Werke</hi>, 54 vols. (Stuttgart, <date when="1828">1828</date>&#x02013;<date when="1833">33</date>). TC quoted the poem at the conclusion of his inaugural address as rector of Edinburgh University; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660413-TC-JN-01"><sic>43:185</sic></ref>. See also <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720224-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 It appears we had it in our hands that night; but in our hurry did not know.<note n="2" noteref="202">Tyndall later recalled: &#x0201C;<supplied>[Carlyle]</supplied> was intimately acquainted with every nook and corner of Goethe&#x02019;s work&#x02014;sometimes more intimately than the poet&#x02019;s own countrymen. I once had occasion to quote the poem &#x02018;Mason Lodge,&#x02019; translated and published in <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> [Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:237&#x02013;38]. The article in which it was quoted was afterwards translated into German; the original poem, therefore, required hunting up. None of my friends in Berlin knew anything about it. On learning this I went down to Chelsea, where, in answer to my inquiry, Carlyle promptly crossed his sitting-room and took from a shelf the required volume&#x0201D; (Tyndall, &#x0201C;Personal Recollections&#x0201D; 11).</note>

 and so had completely washed my hands of my engagement. A neat little job altogether: thank you much for enabling me to do it so compendiously. Nay I think it was you who first led me to this beautiful little Goethe Poem, and that without you I should probably never have discovered it, certainly not so soon, if ever! which is another perhaps still more considerable favour.</p>
<p>We are working dreadfully, poor Mary &#x00026; I, at that monster of a Norse preface, or sketch of the Early Kings of Norway; seldom did I undertake a more totally worthless thing, never anything at all which so bothered me in getting executed, or cause so near the impossible in this my fatal want of a right hand. Alas, alas, who could have thought that a shaking right hand would prove such a calamity, and as good as condemn me to silence for the rest of my earthly existence! I persist in this beggarly Norse monster; and will finish it, purely on <pb id="pg-48-41" n="48:41"/>one ground, Not to be beaten with it altogether. Mary talks of being actually done with the copying (as I will with the corrections) about the end of next week: you <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> then see it, if it could do the least good to you or anybody. If I ever try dictating again I must try it by some new scheme. But I begin to see no scheme will ever avail me; and that I am in all essential respects as good as done for;&#x02014;my right hand having lost its cunning.<note n="2" noteref="205">Cf. Ps. 137:5.</note>

 I find a real spiritual comfort in the noble fire wrath &#x00026; inexorability with which he smites upon all base things and wide spread public delusions; and insists relentlessly on having the ideal aimed at everywhere; for the rest, I do not find him wise, headlong rather, and I might even say weak. But there is nothing like him in England in these other respects.&#x02014; Froude has caught a bad cough (kind of nervous thing) the other day; I am going to him so soon as this is done. Poor Forster also is coughing horribly; thank Heaven he has now nothing more than a month of his public bondage to struggle with; and will then have freer field as well as better weather.</p>

He continued with the history of Mazzini&#x02019;s political work: &#x0201C;<supplied>[H]</supplied>e was the most tenacious man I ever met. &#x02026; As an Idealist in Italian politics, as the spiritual torch-bearer of a great cause, he was unsurpassable.

There was one Italian who fell in love with a <hi rend="italic">danseuse</hi> and stabbed himself; Mazzini took care of him, recovered him, and persuaded the girl to marry him.

<p><salute>Dear Emerson,&#x02014;</salute>I am covered with confusion, astonishment and shame to think of my long silence. You wrote me two beautiful letters;<note n="1" noteref="239">Since TC&#x02019;s last recorded letter to Emerson (<date when="1871-06-04">4 June 1871</date>), Emerson had written at least five letters, three of them as introductions to family or friends visiting Britain.</note>
 none friendlier, brighter, wiser could come to me from any quarter of the world; and I have not answered even by a sign. Promptly and punctually my poor heart <hi rend="italic">did</hi> answer; but to do it outwardly as if there had lain some enchantment on me,&#x02014;was beyond my power. The one thing I can say in excuse or explanation is, that ever since Summer last, I have been in an unusually dispeptic, peeking, pining and dispirited condition; and have no right hand of my own for writing, nor, for several months, had any other that was altogether agreeable to me. But in fine I don&#x02019;t believe you lay any blame or anger on me at all and I will say no more about it, but only try to repent and do better next time.</p>
<p>Your letter from the far West was charmingly vivid and free; one seemed to attend you personally and see with one&#x02019;s own eyes the <hi rend="italic">notabilia</hi>, human and other, of those huge regions,<note n="2" noteref="240">Emerson had traveled for six weeks through the western parts of the U.S., <date when="1871-04">April</date>&#x02013;<date when="1871-05">May 1871</date>; there is no trace of a letter written from the &#x0201C;far West,&#x0201D; but in his letter of <date when="1871-06-30">30 June 1871</date> he gave TC some descriptions of the country, the animals, and the people (Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi> 581&#x02013;83).</note>
 in your swift flight through them to and from.

 There is something huge, painful and almost appalling to me in that wild Western world of yours;&#x02014;and especially <pb id="pg-48-48" n="48:48"/>I wonder at the gold-nuggeting<note n="5" noteref="243">There is no mention of &#x0201C;gold-nuggeting&#x0201D; in any of Emerson&#x02019;s surviving letters.</note>
 there while plainly every gold-nuggeter is no other than a criminal to Human Society, and has to <hi rend="italic">steal</hi> the exact value of his gold nugget from the pockets of all the posterity of Adam, now&#x02014;and for some time to come, in this world. I conclude it is a bait used by All-wise Providence to attract your people out thither, there to build towns, make roads, fell forests (or plant forests), and make ready a Dwelling-place for new nations, who will find themselves called to quite other than nugget-hunting. In the hideous stew of Anarchy in which all English Populations present themselves to my dismal contemplation at this day, it is solid consolation that there will verily, in another fifty years, be above a hundred million men and women on ths Planet who can all read Shakespeare and the English Bible and the (also for a long time biblical and noble) history of their Mother country,&#x02014;and proceed again to do, unless the Devil <hi rend="italic">be</hi> in them, as their Forbeers did, or better, if they have the heart!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Except that you are a thousand times too kind to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, your second Letter also was altogether charming. You may depend on it, I will not employ Conway,<note n="6" noteref="244">Emerson wrote, <date when="1872-01-05">5 Jan.</date>, that he wished someone would write down conversations with TC: &#x0201C;<supplied>[someone]</supplied> competent to report your opinions,&#x02014;for you can speak as well as you can write &#x02026; &#x00026; let it not be Conway, who (this in your private ear), cannot, in my experience, report a fact or speech as it fell. It suffers a strange distortion in his mind. But he is a good fellow, &#x00026; bright, &#x00026; I owe him only good will.&#x0201D; Moncure Daniel Conway, U.S. Unitarian minister.</note>
 should I need a Boswell<note n="7" noteref="245">James Boswell (<date when="1740">1740</date>&#x02013;<date when="1795">95</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2950"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), companion and biographer of Samuel Johnson (<date when="1709">1709</date>&#x02013;<date when="1784">84</date>: <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14918"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), lexicographer.</note>
 (which I never shall): my opinion of him is completely your own, and indeed I see less and less of him, though never absolutely nothing, as the years roll on. He has one merit, that of a great deep and as if almost exclusive admiration for you; I think there is nothing so fixed in his mind as that. For the rest a windy, easy-going, <hi rend="italic">fluff</hi> of a creature; content with crudities everywhere, as if they were purities and talking a great deal of stuff that has only half meaning in it: but he is very sociable, good-natured, guileless, and is a general favourite I think among the people he frequents. Peace be with him, poor soul; only not too much of him; and let his visits be more and more like those of angels, short and far between!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Do you read Ruskin&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi>, which he cheerily tells me gets itself reprinted in America? If you don&#x02019;t, <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, I advise you. Also his <hi rend="italic">Munera Pulveris</hi>, Oxford-<hi rend="italic">Lectures</hi> on Art, and whatever else he is now writing,&#x02014;if you can manage to get them (which is difficult here, owing to the ways he has towards the bibliopolic world!). There is nothing going on among us as notable to me as those fierce lightning-bolts Ruskin is copiously and desperately, pouring into the black world of Anarchy all round him. No other man in England that I meet has in him the divine rage against iniquity, falsity and baseness that <pb id="pg-48-49" n="48:49"/>Ruskin has and that every man ought to have. Unhappily he is not a strong man; one might say a weak man rather; and has not the least prudence of management; though, if he can hold out for another 15 years or so, he may produce, even in this way, a great effect. God grant it, say I. Froude is coming to you in <date when="1872-10">October</date>.<note n="8" noteref="246">Froude went on a lecture tour of the U.S., <date when="1872-09">Sept.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-12">Dec.</date>, tracing the course of Irish history from the 12th century to the present, based on <hi rend="italic">The English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</hi> (3 vols. [<date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>]), that he was in the process of publishing.</note>
 You will find him a most clear, friendly ingenious solid and excellent man; and I am very glad to find you among those who are to take care of him when he comes to your New Country. Do your best and wisest towards him for my sake withal. He is the valuablest Friend I now have in England, nearly tho&#x02019; not quite altogether the one man in talking with whom I can get any real profit or comfort. Alas<note n="9" noteref="247">Word repeated with a line over it at the turn of the page.</note>
 here is the end of the paper, dear Emerson; and I had still a whole wilderness of things to say. Write to me, or even do not write, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> I will surely write again.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> three Letters have all come, the last of them, inclosing Alick&#x02019;s, this morning. The yesterday&#x02019;s one arrived soon after 2 p.m.; I meant to ans<hi rend="italic">r</hi> that once, but people came in, Forster, Brookfield &#x00026;c, and I could not get it done.</p>
<p>I took no hurt by my little Belton visit,<note n="1" noteref="249">TC visited, <date when="1872-04-05">5</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-04-08">8 April</date>, Belton House, Lincolnshire, home of Lady Marian Alford and her son, Lord Brownlow; his wife, Lady Adelaide Brownlow, wrote, <date when="1872-03-25">25 March</date>: &#x0201C;We do so hope to be able to persuade you to come to us here some time soon&#x02014;Brownlow says you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> been here once&#x02014;&#x00026; so I know that what has been done once can be done again&#x02014;&#x00026; I shall feel dreadfully offended if you will never come here in my time!! You would find no party here&#x02014;only ourselves, Lady Marian &#x00026; my sister Gertrude Talbot, who would both join with me in the warmest way to beg you to come.&#x0201D; Her sister was Lady Gertrude Frances Chetwynd-Talbot.</note>
 or none worth ment<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and I gained no benefit, except two days of the purest country air, spent in mournful, not miserable, solitary musing, or rational &#x00026; not quite useless conversat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, chiefly with that beautiful ingenuous &#x00026; graceful young Countess &#x00026; her d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> Sister &#x0201C;Gertrude&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Gartrudis</hi>), both of whom seemed heartily kind to me, much gratified with my visit, and are bright sylphlike eagerly-inquiring young souls, <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> making acquaintance with,&#x02014;if to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, at this date, anybody were certainly worth that; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, in sad fact almost nobody is! I got an illustrious <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> <pb id="pg-48-50" n="48:50"/>that night y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter was sent off (Sat<hi rend="italic">y</hi> last);<note n="2" noteref="250">John wrote, <date when="1872-04-07">7 April</date>: &#x0201C;We are all glad to hear that you did accept the kind invitation &#x02026; &#x00026; had got through the first night tolerably well. It might do you much good to stay some time longer than you speak of at Belton House which seems to be a quiet place, out of the reach of railways.&#x0201D;</note>
 but the next night, had next to none; and so made for home on Monday by express, instead of jaunting to Lincoln<note n="3" noteref="251">County town of Lincolnshire, 23 mi. (36.5 km.) N of Belton.</note>
 as had been in part proposed. Heigho heigho! I ought to stay at home, and hold my peace, as much as possible, in the years now come!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I am very sorry indeed, dear Brother, to hear of y<hi rend="italic">r dyspeptic</hi> ailments; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> are dismally well-known to myself, as among the heaviest and ugliest <hi rend="italic">inevitables</hi> one&#x02019;s old age has. Vichy,<note n="4" noteref="252">John wrote, <date when="1872-04-11">11 April</date>: &#x0201C;my flatulent dyspepsia has been more severe for the last few weeks. I often think I shall have to go back &#x00026; try Vichy again during the summer, though reluctant to go.&#x0201D; For John&#x02019;s previous trip to Vichy, <date when="1868">1868</date>, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680520-TC-JAC-01"><sic>45:132</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1868-05-20">20 May 1868</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 if you can stand it, is probably altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> advisable. At any rate, I have been looking for some pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> transit of you (to Dale-Park or somewhither)<note n="5" noteref="253">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720224-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref></note> this good while; and I think you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> at once gird y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self together, and let me see you ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> for a ten days, till you decide what farther? The weather is as beautiful as possible; and of quiet room, or of brotherly welcome to you, there is certainly no lack.</p>
<p>I myself don&#x02019;t design any &#x0201C;expeditioning&#x0201D; this summer, or any that I can possibly help. Nothing but bother and misery attend me on such occas<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>;&#x02014;the insolent intrusive importunity and gaping and gazing of my stupid fellow-creatures is itself quite a considerable nuisance over and above.</p>
<p>Lady Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is to leave Town ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a week hence,&#x02014;the kindest of all my friends here; but who can do me, as it were, no good at all! She goes to Melchet for some &#x0201C;2 months,&#x0201D;&#x02014;after that quite uncert<hi rend="italic">n</hi> whitherw<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.&#x02014; Forster&#x02019;s dinner I absolutely refused; but he comes tomorrow, at 3&#x000BD; p.m. &#x0201C;to <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> me out, for a <hi rend="italic">country</hi> walk&#x0201D;; &#x00026; I judge, will try to smuggle me home with him all the same.</p>
<p>Mary I saw two days ago, and expect today: I fear her &#x0201C;employ<hi rend="italic">t</hi>&#x0201D; adventure is not prospering (Ruskin &#x0201C;gone to Italy&#x0201D;<note n="6" noteref="254">Ruskin left England at the end of March, visiting France and Switzerland before arriving in Italy, <date when="1872-05-17">17 May</date>.</note>

 <hi rend="italic">Item</hi>, let me recommend you to bring for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self (if you still go upon that article) a bottle or two of genuine whisky: sound <hi rend="italic">brandy</hi> is abund<hi rend="italic">t</hi> here; as are <hi rend="italic">wines</hi>, of truly multifarious sort; but no whisky except dirty Irish.</p>
<p>Please do bring down that <hi rend="italic">Norse Kin</hi>g<hi rend="italic">s</hi> Ms. &#x00026; the <hi rend="italic">Saga</hi> withal may as well come, tho&#x02019; ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the latter I care little or nothing. The former cost me, poor Mary &#x00026; me, a deal of trouble; and I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like well to have it put right in all details <pb id="pg-48-54" n="48:54"/>by such an opportunity.<note n="3" noteref="273">John wrote, <date when="1872-04-25">25 April</date>: &#x0201C;Shall I bring with me the translation of Far&#x000F6;er Saga &#x00026; the Essay on the Norse Kings? &#x02026; The translation is in general accurate enough, but some errors occur which I have marked; &#x00026; I find that the German translation w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> you followed is not quite so good as I thought it. The &#x02018;Norse Kings&#x02019; is too long. Many passages are true &#x00026; valuable, but the minute details are often inaccurate &#x00026; imperfect. One might perhaps leave out a good many of them with advantage. At present the Essay is some thirty pages longer than the poor Saga &#x00026; could hardly be given as an Introduction to it. Much has been done since Dahlmann&#x02019;s time, by Munch, Keyser &#x00026;c. I have Munch&#x02019;s 8 large volumes of Norse History &#x02026; and they quote authorities throughout, &#x00026; have a pretty good index, &#x00026; detailed genealogical tables from Harold Fairhair downwards.&#x0201D; For Dahlmann, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date></ref>; Peter Andreas Munch (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1863">63</date>), Norwegian historian and philologist, <hi rend="italic">Det Norske Folks Historie</hi>, 8 vols.

The &#x02018;Norse Kings&#x02019; MS I read most carefully immediately after it came, &#x00026; have read it again twice. And three or four times already I have vehemently tried correcting the errors, &#x00026; could not satisfy even myself; so that I think there could be no hope of my being able to do any good in the matter. Indeed I think it would make me ill again with vexation as it has done.&#x0201D; He ended the letter: &#x0201C;Perhaps it may be as well after all to bring Munch &#x00026; Snorro with me; &#x00026; I will do so unless you forbid me, though I fear you would be too impatient, &#x00026; I myself also too thin-skinned &#x00026; too unwell.&#x0201D; He wrote again, <date when="1872-04-29">29 April</date>: &#x0201C;I was not very well when I wrote to you last night. Today I have again read your sketch of the Norse Kings, &#x00026; think it excellent. And I find that with a little patience all the errors in it may be easily corrected. I will bring with me Munch (pronounced Moonk) &#x00026; also Snorro; &#x00026; it will be a very good occupation for me, in the forenoon&#x02019;s I have to stay with you, to shew what errors need correction.&#x0201D; John presumably meant C. C. Rafn and G. C. F. Mohnike&#x02019;s edn. of Snorro&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">F&#x000E6;rey&#x000ED;nga saga</hi> (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711013-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-10-13">13 Oct. 1871</date></ref>).</note>
 I don&#x02019;t think I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to part with many (or perhaps with almost any) of the <hi rend="italic">anecdotic</hi> insignificances, the whole Norse &#x0201C;Hist<hi rend="italic">y</hi>&#x0201D; being nothing to me save <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes</hi>;&#x02014;but I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be very desirous to have everything <hi rend="italic">correct</hi>, instead of disgracefully <hi rend="italic">not</hi>.<note n="6" noteref="276">John wrote, <date when="1872-04-28">28 April</date>: &#x0201C;What one would like to accomplish would be to keep all the good passages in due coherence, without any errors in additional details which might be dispensed with. I failed in the attempt, &#x00026; that was the reason why I kept silent so long after receipt of the MS; &#x00026; then in my last letter suggested leaving many details out altogether. I need hardly say that it is not for want of will that I have failed. To one who knows nothing about Norse History the MS is excellent reading, but it would be unsuitable for you to send forth anything unauthentic after having gone to the bottom of so many matters of History, &#x00026; some of the errors are great.&#x0201D;</note>
 A tolerable (or even a fairly <hi rend="italic">legible</hi>) Map of Norway w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be a great acquisit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; but I suppose, that is impossible in these latitudes &#x00026; these habitudes!&#x02014; Think of all this; &#x00026; let us do <hi rend="italic">our</hi> best.</p>
<p>Forster is up to <hi rend="italic">par</hi> ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; his &#x0201C;faint&#x0201D; nothing but a <hi rend="italic">Stomachic</hi> affair (thinks <pb id="pg-48-55" n="48:55"/>Quain): F. called here, Thursday last, while I was out for the Emerson <hi rend="italic">Photo</hi>hg business.<note n="7" noteref="277">Emerson wrote, <date when="1872-01-19">19 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;I believe I shall give Edith a secret counsel, which, if she obeys, I hope you will be good, &#x00026; permit her to carry out.&#x0201D; The National Portrait Gallery&#x02019;s copy of the photograph of TC taken with Edith Forbes&#x02019;s eldest son, Ralph, has a handwritten note attached: &#x0201C;Mr Carlyle sat for this picture with the eldest grandson and namesake of Ralph Waldo Emerson by whose request the photograph was taken on <date when="1872-04-24">April twenty fourth 1872</date>&#x0201D;; see frontis.</note>
 That latter was not at all so bad as I had figured it;&#x02014;and was tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to have succeeded well. We shall see whether or <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> the time. Lady Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is still here, &#x0201C;bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi>&#x0201D; to the eyebrows; so that I see next to nothing of her: on Thursday <hi rend="italic">week</hi> (for <hi rend="small-caps">certn</hi>) she will have to quit London, house-<hi rend="italic">lease</hi> being <hi rend="italic">out</hi> then.<note n="8" noteref="278">Lady Ashburton had been renting houses in London, first in Stanhope St., then in Park Lane; she was currently negotiating with Mitchell Henry (<date when="1826">1826</date>&#x02013;<date when="1910">1910</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33823"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), businessman and politician, to purchase a plot of land on the Kent House Estate on the edge of Hyde Park; her house was built there <date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 151.</note>

During a stay of some duration in London, in <date when="1872">1872</date>, the Empress Augusta wished to make the acquaintance of the most gifted men in England. About twelve or fourteen of the leaders of English Art and Science, including Carlyle and Froude, were therefore assembled one day in the house of the then German Ambassador. The Empress conversed in the most amiable manner with each of them, especially with Carlyle. The following extracts from a letter which I received from the Cabinet of the Empress in Koblenz show how great was her reverence for the English historian and philosopher:&#x02014;/ &#x0201C;Koblenz, <date when="1886-11-03">3 Nov., 1886</date>. / Her Majesty had long felt a special reverence for the famous English historian, and therefore wished, during a stay in England, to make the acquaintance of Thomas Carlyle. Her Majesty received him in the German Embassy, and discerned, from her conversation with him, not only how he judged of the historical events in Germany with rare sympathy and clear understanding, and felt a real affection for this country, but also how he did justice to the historical past of the Royal House of Prussia, and recognized its present task with a warmth of feeling astonishing in a foreigner.&#x0201D;</note>

<p>As to Walt Whitman, it seems to me he is probably the loudest-roaring blockhead in all America (not with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> faculty either, but all gone into that fatal condit<hi rend="italic">n</hi>).

<p><salute>Dear Miss Clara,</salute></p>
<p>I have now read y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pamphlet<note n="1" noteref="299">Pamphlet untraced.</note>
 attentively twice over,&#x02014;having had a Copy several days ago, from a Yorkshire Lady<note n="2" noteref="300">&#x0201C;Yorkshire Lady&#x0201D; unidentified further.</note>
 whose address I couldn&#x02019;t quite make out, and yesterday a second Copy from y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self; for both of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> accept my thanks. I can assure you I have read with a great deal of satisfaction and approval,&#x02014;and with considerable surprise, too; not expecting from a young Lady the clearest and soundest utterance I have yet heard on this miserable <hi rend="italic">woman-versus-man</hi> Quest<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; surely the most tragic and anarchic that ever rose in any epoch, or (as you well wind up with saying) had <hi rend="italic">need</hi> to rise!&#x02014; Perhaps you may yet do much service on this sad matter; not alone by writing on it (high as y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> possibility that way is), but by silently working, meditating and contriving how the <hi rend="italic">roots</hi> of it might be cut away, the fatal <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of it be made to lessen &#x00026; at last cease. Two things surely are possible: 1<hi rend="italic">&#x000B0;</hi> That all women sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> endeavour (and be wisely aided and guided) <hi rend="italic">more and more to qualify themselves</hi> for becoming useful and loveable <hi rend="italic">wives</hi> of men; &#x00026; 2<hi rend="italic">&#x000B0;</hi> That if the men are not <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, but driven <hi rend="italic">abroad</hi> for a living, the women sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in some honourable &#x00026; decorous way be <hi rend="italic">emigrated</hi> to where they are! The difficulties, I well perceive, will be great, in both these direct<hi rend="italic">ns</hi>, and the progress only gradual; but <hi rend="italic">impossibilit</hi>y there is none in either of them. Courage, courage!&#x02014;</p>
<p>In reference to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Pamphlet I meant to have remarked farther, that you <pb id="pg-48-60" n="48:60"/>seem to me to underrate greatly the <hi rend="italic">quantity</hi> of Intellect that is in women, tho&#x02019; lucidly right as to its usual <hi rend="italic">quality</hi>. An excess of beautiful candour, this. Also that you do not touch at all, or hardly touch, on the <hi rend="italic">celestial</hi> (so we may call it) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it lies with a noble <hi rend="italic">wise</hi> and <hi rend="italic">loyal</hi> wife to throw into the existence of her Husb<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, irradiating by the beauty of her own dear soul, what were otherwise to the toilsome man, however valiant, a very dark and grim affair.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear young lady, Be wise, be humble, dilig<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, stedfast; and may a good Genius guide you,&#x02014;as, <hi rend="italic">in that case</hi>, he surely will!&#x02014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Duffy,</salute></p>
<p>Ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> ten days ago I rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the Report of Speech,<note n="1" noteref="302">Possibly the speech Duffy gave, <date when="1871-06-26">26 June 1871</date>, at the Mechanic&#x02019;s Institute Hall, Kyneton, after his appointment as premier of Victoria, <date when="1871-06-19">19 June 1871</date>, <hi rend="italic">Policy of the New Government: Speech of the Hon. Chas. Gavan Duffy, Chief Secretary of Victoria</hi> (Melbourne, <date when="1871">1871</date>). In it he declared support for the reinvigoration of &#x0201C;industrial and commercial prosperity&#x0201D; (4); he promised a focus on land law (4) &#x0201C;while the present Administration remains in power, no man in this wide territory who desires to become a settler shall ask in vain&#x0201D; (5). He considered the country&#x02019;s finances, pledging that &#x0201C;if a direct tax shall become necessary, it shall certainly not be a tax on industry&#x0201D; (6). He concluded with a commitment to an electoral system whereby every man would have a vote, which would be obtained &#x0201C;without inordinate effort,&#x0201D; and exercised &#x0201C;with as little sacrifice of time or money as may be.&#x0201D;</note>

 all of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, especially the first named Article, were very welcome and interesting. The <hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi> is not very like, tho&#x02019; it has some honest likeness; but in the <hi rend="italic">Speech</hi> I found a real image of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> best Self; and of the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Career you are upon; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> pleased and gratified me very much. Tho&#x02019; unable to write except with a pencil, and at a speed as of <hi rend="italic">engraving</hi> (upon lead or the like), I cannot forbear sending you my hearty <hi rend="italic">Euge, euge</hi> [well done, well done]!&#x02014;and earnestly encouraging you to speed along, and &#x0201C;improve the shining hour,&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="304">Cf.

 all you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, while it lasts.

Mr. Duffy is an Irishman, a Catholic, and a rebel, a typical man of the class which we English say can neither govern nor be governed; but he speaks like the man for whom the Tories are sighing, the born administrator, utterly free of flummery buncombe, clear as to his ends, clearer still as to his means.&#x0201D;</note>
 You seem to me to be, in some real degree, <pb id="pg-48-61" n="48:61"/>modelling the first elements of mighty Nations over yonder; scattering beneficent <hi rend="italic">seeds</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> may grow to d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> <hi rend="italic">forests</hi>, and be green for a thousand years!<note n="5" noteref="306">The Melbourne correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">London Standard</hi> wrote, <date when="1872-02-02">2 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;Now, under Mr. Duffy we certainly have not had stagnation; indeed, the only fear is that things are going too fast. Railways are to be opened, water works regenerated&#x02014;this branch in a dry country is one of the most important of the public system&#x02014;mining laws amended to some purpose, and many other things done which will be of great advantage and importance. The country, in short, appears to be waking up&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, <date when="1872-03-21">21 March</date>).</note>
 Stand to y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> work, <hi rend="italic">hero-like</hi> the utmost you can; be wise, be dilig<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, patient, faithful: a man, in that case, <hi rend="italic">has</hi> his reward. I can only send you my poor wishes; but then these veritably are, sorry only they are worth so little.</p>
<p>Nothing in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> list of projects raised any scruple in me; good, human &#x00026; desirable, one felt them all to be,&#x02014; except that of Gold-Mining only. And this too I felt at once was, if not <hi rend="italic">human</hi>, or to All men&#x02019;s profit yet clearly <hi rend="italic">Colonial</hi> or to Victoria&#x02019;s profit, &#x00026; therefore inevitable in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="italic">place</hi> &#x00026; season. But I often reflect on this strange fact, as perhaps you y<hi rend="italic">r</hi>self have done, That he who anywhere, in these ages, digs up a Gold-Nugget from the ground is far inferior in beneficence to him who digs up a Mealy Potatoe,&#x02014;nay is, in strict language a <hi rend="italic">Male</hi>factor to all his brethren of mankind; having actually to <hi rend="italic">pick</hi> the purse of every Son of Adam for what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="italic">money</hi> he, the Digger, gets for his Nugget,<note n="6" noteref="307">For a similar expression of TC&#x02019;s views on gold-mining, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720402-TC-RWE-01">TC to RWE, <date when="1872-04-02">2 April</date></ref>.</note>
 and Be bothered to it! I do not insist on this: I only leave it with you,&#x02014;and wonder silently at the ways of All-wise Providence with highly foolish Man in this poor course of his.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Duffy; I have written more than enough: if I had a free pen, how <hi rend="italic">many</hi> things c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> I still write;&#x02014;but perhaps it is better not!&#x02014; &#x02014; I am grown very old, and tho&#x02019; with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> specific ailment of body, very weak (in comparison), and fitter to be silent ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> what I am thinking of than to speak.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter was punctually lying ready for me on Monday morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>;<note n="1" noteref="312">John A.

 I picked it from the others &#x00026; their accompan<hi rend="italic">g</hi> trash, with intent to read it in walk<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; but c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>n&#x02019;t quite manage that. I had been, in my solitary musings, almost morbidly anxious on the matter; and was truly thankful that, so far, nothing had gone ill with you, but that on the contrary you had slept and were feeling better. The same day, I forwarded the little half sheet to Dumfries (ordering it to be preserved, along with those that might follow): except a Newsp<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, in James&#x02019;s<note n="2" noteref="313">Probably James Aitken, their brother-in-law; as newspapers were delivered free of charge the Carlyles put marks on them to indicate all was well.</note>

M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Peter Taylor has asked me to go to her (at Notting Hill) on the first of January or sooner. The duties are, to teach 4 nights a week for 2 hours in a school of hers (the &#x0201C;Aubrey Institute,&#x0201D; close to their house) for the poor children of the neighbourhood&#x02014;the rest of my time to be at my own disposal&#x02014;to live in M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor&#x02019;s house on the footing of a sister, and to receive &#x000A3;60 a year.

The offer is generous, and as M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor is a very nice woman I do not like to fall between two stools and cast it aside on the bare chance of returning to you. If you are willing that I should go back to you at Chelsea, that would seem to me to be the right and proper thing for us both; but if not it seems to me it would be foolish to let this offer slip through my fingers and have nothing to fall back upon. If you would like me to go back to you, I will with pleasure and not look upon it as a &#x02018;sacrifice&#x02019; to go. If you would rather not have me, then I will go to the Taylors, if I am spared, on New Year&#x02019;s day.&#x0201D; Clementia and Peter Taylor lived in Kensington, at Aubrey House. TC&#x02019;s reply is untraced, however John A.

Yesterday we were at Addiscombe, &#x00026; staid there for the afternoon &#x00026; evening, getting back to Chelsea about eleven&#x0201D; (MS: NLS 1775E.152).</note>

<p><salute>Dear Fitzgerald,</salute></p>
<p>I am glad you are astir on the Naseby-Monument question;<note n="1" noteref="340">FitzGerald previously owned land at Naseby, site of the battle between the Royalist and Parliamentary armies, <date when="1645-06-14">14 June 1645</date>; see <ref target="volume-15/lt-18420918-TC-EF-01"><sic>15:89</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-18">18 Sep. 1842</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="/lt-18420929-TC-EF-01"><sic>110</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1842-09-29">29 Sep. 1842</date></corr></ref>. In <date when="1855">1855</date> he and TC had planned to erect a monument (see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550823-TC-EF-01"><sic>30:40&#x02013;42</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1855-08-23">23 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>), but the plan was never implemented. TC apparently wrote to FitzGerald, late <date when="1871">1871</date>, about the projected monument, as FitzGerald replied, <date when="1871-12-20">20 Dec. 1871</date>: &#x0201C;I have not wholly neglected the wish you expressed in your last about the Naseby stone. / I was reading some months ago, your letters about our Naseby Exploits in <date when="1842">1842</date>: as also one which you wrote in <date when="1855">1855</date> (I think) about that Stone, giving me an Inscription for it. &#x02026; [W]hen you wrote in <date when="1855">1855</date>, we had just sold Naseby to the trustees of Lord Clifden [Henry Agar-Ellis (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866">66</date>) 3d Viscount Clifden].&#x0201D; He then wrote that Lord Clifden had since died, leaving a young son, Henry George Agar-Ellis [<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895">95</date>], 4th Viscount Clifden; on receiving TC&#x02019;s letter, he wrote to Clifden&#x02019;s lawyer to see what could be done; he continued: &#x0201C;If I get the Lawyer&#x02019;s and Agent&#x02019;s consent, I should be very glad indeed to have the stone cut, and lettered, as you wished. But whether I should pluck up spirit to go myself and set it up on the proper spot, I am not so sure. &#x02026; You will think me very base to hesitate about such a little feat as a Journey into Northamptonshire. &#x02026; But you know that one does not generally grow more active in Travel as one gets older.&#x0201D; FitzGerald then wrote, <date when="1872-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x0201C;A fortnight ago I heard from the Brother of the Lawyer who is concerned for Naseby now, that if I wrote to the Agent, I might hear of something to the purpose. So I wrote to the Agent: and I enclose his Reply.&#x0201D;</note>
 and that the <pb id="pg-48-68" n="48:68"/>auspices are so favourable. This welcome &#x0201C;Agent,&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="341">The agent was Thomas Watts; unidentified further.</note>
 so willing &#x00026; beneficent, will contrive, I hope, to spare you a good deal of the trouble,&#x02014;except indeed that of seeing with y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own eyes that the Stone is put in its right place, and the number of &#x0201C;yards rearward&#x0201D; is exactly given.</p>
<p>I think the Inscript<hi rend="italic">n</hi> will do;<note n="3" noteref="342">FitzGerald wrote: &#x0201C;I &#x02026; enclose your own scheme of an Inscription for the stone, as you wrote it soon after your Visit down here in <date when="1855">1855</date>&#x0201D;; see <ref target="volume-30/lt-18550823-TC-EF-01"><sic>30:41&#x02013;42</sic><corr>TC to EF, <date when="1855-08-23">23 Aug. 1855</date></corr></ref>. TC returned the inscription, perhaps with alterations, as FitzGerald replied, [<date when="1872-06-16">16 June</date>]: &#x0201C;<supplied>[Y]</supplied>ou have returned me your Inscription maimed in the beginning of the second Paragraph. &#x02026; And, as there may be some uncertainty &#x02026; about the exact number of &#x02018;Yards to rearward&#x02019; &#x02026; may I substitute &#x02018;Here, and for some Yards hereabout&#x02019;?&#x0201D;</note>
 and as to the shape &#x00026;c of the Monument, I have nothing to advise,&#x02014;except that I think it ought to be of the most perfect <hi rend="italic">simplicity</hi>, and sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi><note n="4" noteref="343">From here the letter is written in Froude&#x02019;s hand.</note>
 go direct to its object and punctually stop there. A small block of Portland Stone&#x02014;(Portland excels all stones in the world for durability and capacity for taking an exact inscription)&#x02014;block of Portland Stone of size to contain the words and allow itself to be sunk firmly in the ground; to me it could have no other good quality whatever; and I should not care if the stone on three sides of it were <hi rend="italic">squared</hi> with the hammer merely, and only <hi rend="italic">polished</hi> on its front or further side where the letters are to be.<note n="5" noteref="344">FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1872-06-12">12 June</date>: &#x0201C;Now then: what size&#x02014;and what Shape&#x02014;is the Stone to be of? And where made? I know of no one in those parts now: and I suppose I could scarce trouble this Agent with it. As to seeing it set on the exact spot, I think I shall have to go there myself for that&#x02014;which will be the hardest part of all, absurd and foolish as this may seem to you.&#x0201D; He then asked, [<date when="1872-06-16">16 June</date>]: &#x0201C;what height you think the Monument should be?&#x0201D; See also <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721207-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1872-12-07">7 Dec.</date></ref></note>
</p>
<p>In short I wish <hi rend="italic">you</hi> my dear friend to take charge of this pious ask<note n="6" noteref="345">Thus in MS; possibly for &#x0201C;task.&#x0201D;</note>
 in all its details; considering me to be loyally passive to whatever you decide on respecting it. If on those terms you will let me bear half the expense and flatter myself that in this easy way I have gone halves with you in this small altogether genuine piece of <hi rend="italic">patriotism</hi> I shall be extremely obliged to you.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Mary</salute></p>
<p>Your little stinging address to Elliot &#x00026; Fry seems to have &#x0201C;took an effect on them&#x0201D;<note n="1" noteref="349">John Joseph Elliott (<date when="1835">1835</date>&#x02013;<date when="1903">1903</date>) &#x00026; Clarence Edmund Fry (<date when="1840">1840</date>&#x02013;<date when="1897">97</date>), photographers, 55 Baker St., London, photographed TC many times during the <date when="1860">1860</date>s (for example, see 42:frontis. and 81); for their photographs, <date when="1868-03">March 1868</date>, of TC and one of Jean Aitken, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18680425-TC-JJE-01"><sic>45:120&#x02013;22</sic><corr>TC to JJE, <date when="1868-04-25">[25 April 1868]</date></corr></ref>. Apparently Mary Aitken had complained to Elliott &#x00026; Fry that they had published photographs of TC for sale without authority; they were presumably either copies from these earlier photographs or they had taken extras of TC at the sitting with Emerson&#x02019;s grandson, <date when="1872-04-24">24 April</date> (see below). For JWC&#x02019;s report of TC&#x02019;s other regular photographer, John Watkins, printing TC&#x02019;s and her photographs at a wholesaler and then displaying three of hers in a shop window, see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650730-JWC-TC-01"><sic>42:163</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1865-07-30">[30 July 1865]</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 (as the whiskey did on Dickey Kevil<note n="2" noteref="350">Richard Keevil, &#x0201C;a wandering, innocent creature&#x0201D; who stayed with TC&#x02019;s family for some months, <date when="1826">1826</date>&#x02013;<date when="1827">27</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:179</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 long ago); for the fact is they have this day through Forster given a complete account of themselves; proved that they have printed for sale only 3 of the 4 photos allowed by your Mother<note n="3" noteref="351">Why Jean Aitken would be involved in giving permission is not known; possibly they were negatives of photographs that had been promised to her.</note>
 (the fourth not turning out well when they tried it);<note n="4" noteref="352">TC had recently sent photos to Mary Austin, as she wrote thanking him, <date when="1872-06-04">4 June</date>: &#x0201C;I was glad of the two prints this morning, though I did not think you had forgotten me Still it was something more to see the T. C. and think of all the bother you would have in sending them They are very nice and will be well worth a place on some of our walls.&#x0201D;</note>
 still more important: they have sent me down in a firm little box the two negatives of the Old Man &#x00026; Emerson&#x02019;s grandson:<note n="5" noteref="353">For Elliott &#x00026; Fry&#x02019;s photograph of TC with Ralph Emerson Forbes, <date when="1872-04-24">24 April</date>, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720427-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-04-27">27 April</date></ref>, and frontis.</note>

 So that whether they write to you or not we may consider their beggarly affair as completely settled, &#x00026; wash our hands of it forever &#x00026; aday. Thank you kindly for the trouble you took, which I know you did not grudge.<note n="7" noteref="355">Although Mary was in Dumfries, she was still helping TC with his correspondence; she wrote, <date when="1872-06-03">3 June</date>, that she had sent off the letters he had asked her to, continuing: &#x0201C;The next things you get I shall be most happy to dispose of in the same way; and any copying will be &#x02018;carefully attended to.&#x02019;&#x0201D;</note>
</p>
<p>I liked your Letter very much; indeed it awakened in me many kindly emotions both joyful &#x00026; the contrary which I do not speak of at present. It was very pretty to me the picture you gave of yourself conning your German lesson in <pb id="pg-48-70" n="48:70"/>the woods of Dalscone,<note n="8" noteref="356">Dalscone Wood, about 2 mi. (3 km.) NE of Dumfries.</note>
 amid the soughing of the trees and the singing of the birds&#x02014;shut out from all other noises. It is an excellent use to put your time to just now, &#x00026; I could really wish much that <supplied>[you]</supplied> should actually acquire a correct &#x00026; effective knowledge of the German language after so long hovering on the outskirts of it.<note n="9" noteref="357">Mary wrote to Meta Wellmer, <date when="1872-06-02">2 June</date>: &#x0201C;I am &#x02026; working hard at German at present. I am going to try and learn to speak German &#x00026; am to get lessons next week from a German teacher in the town&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 9207).</note>
 I pray you apply diligently, &#x00026; do your best towards this important result. The best of all methods; I believe would be that you took a good solid bit of printed German, a dictionary &#x00026; a bit of paper &#x00026; actually wrote down the best Translation you could make of it,&#x02014;with the constant view of sending it to me to correct &#x00026; criticise. Set about this I advise you the instant you get home. All Schiller, all Goethe and various other works (as you yourself know better than I) are to be found both among your uncles books<note n="10" noteref="358">John A. Carlyle had a large collection of books in Dumfries.</note>
 &#x00026; mine here; I will with great pleasure overhaul your Translation, which will naturally be the very truest you can make, and you will find a feat or two of this kind to have a more condensing steadying &#x00026; clearing effect on you than a great deal of reading would. Do it I advise you.</p>
<p>For the rest write at any time on all things you like, or have upon your heart, certain of an affectionate reception here. Of that there need not at any time be a doubt with you. Try to grow wise &#x00026; wiser my dear little woman; there is nobody will more rejoice than I to see that result getting forward&#x02014;, which indeed is the one result worth striving after by any of us in this world.</p>
<p>I am not in worse health than usual tho&#x02019; suffering a good deal from heat.<note n="11" noteref="359">The temperature in London in the shade was 77.5 degrees (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1872-06-18">18 June</date>).</note>
 The enclosed Letter came from Maggie Welsh today, you can read it and burn. Good be with you always, dear Mary</p>

 Few days pass with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> being part of my silent company here.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-71" n="48:71"/>It is evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> I shall have to leave this dusty roaring roasting place, before long; but whitherward I cannot in the least settle. Dumfries occurs to me first, Dumfries or The Gill;<note n="2" noteref="362">Mary Austin wrote from The Gill, <date when="1872-06-04">4 June</date>: &#x0201C;I have often wondered if you would come to Scotland this summer. <hi rend="italic">None</hi> could be more pleased to see you, than us here.&#x0201D;</note>
 but the railways, the fatal railways!<note n="3" noteref="363">TC was much disturbed by railway noises, both at The Gill (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700608-TC-JCA-01"><sic>47:22</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1870-06-08">8 June 1870</date></corr></ref>), and at Dumfries (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700704-TC-JMN-01"><sic>47:40</sic><corr>TC to JMN, <date when="1870-07-04">4 July 1870</date></corr></ref>).</note>
 The one relief I have here is tolerable sleep;&#x02014;and every night, I feel that one <hi rend="italic">squeak</hi> of noise w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> blow me up for the height of <hi rend="italic">vigilance</hi>, and results too well known! Of that, therefore, I dare not think. Scotland, for a reason you will perhaps guess, Scotl<hi rend="italic">d</hi> especially Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neigh</hi>r<hi rend="italic">hood</hi>,<note n="4" noteref="364">TC presumably was thinking of JWC&#x02019;s grave in Haddington.</note>
 I do wish to see yet one other time: <hi rend="italic">Auchtertool Manse</hi>,<note n="5" noteref="365">Auchtertool Manse, Fife, home of JWC&#x02019;s maternal cousins Rev. Walter Welsh and his sisters Maggie and Mary.</note>
 accordingly, is a place I sometimes contemplate as possible,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; not likely, or especially not for long. Lady Ashb<hi rend="italic">n</hi> is ordered to the German Baths (<hi rend="italic">Marienbad</hi>, in Bohemia);<note n="6" noteref="366">Marienbad, spa town in Bohemia, now the Czech Republic.</note>

&#x02014;of this I am latterly thinking oftener, tho&#x02019; nothing what<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is yet settled, nor perhaps will be, at the time of the Dr&#x02019;s reappearance (if that were to have much influence on me, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> it isn&#x02019;t).&#x02014; So waste, so wae, so weary looks the world ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me, dear Jean;&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">no</hi> goal of any surety for me except <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> I daily think of as an <hi rend="small-caps">un</hi>failing &#x00026; eternal place of shelter; right sure and blessed that!

<p>I am weaker at <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> than I ever was; but have not yet left off eating, as I did last year this time,&#x02014;tho&#x02019; my &#x0201C;digestion&#x0201D; is something hideous to consider. No more of all that.</p>
<p>One thing I do definitely want, &#x00026; have been much longing for these ten days past: a <hi rend="italic">straw hat</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">any</hi> straw hat!

<p><salute>Dear Sir,</salute></p>
<p>Your letter, so candid, so patient amid such dreary imprisonment, bespeaks my sympathy;<note n="1" noteref="379">Clement K. Shorter (<date when="1857">1857</date>&#x02013;<date when="1926">1926</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36076"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), journalist and editor, wrote in his introduction to TC&#x02019;s letter that it was prompted by a letter from a twenty-five year old man who wrote &#x0201C;laying bare the spiritual struggle that had come to him through his study of Spencer and Darwin on the one hand, and on the other the pain which his growing predisposition to agnosticism had given to his pious and puritan mother.&#x0201D; Herbert Spencer (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1903">1903</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36208"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), philosopher and social theorist; he and TC were not in agreement politically; he sent TC one of his books, <date when="1844">1844</date>, and was surprised that TC acknowledged it; see <ref target="volume-18/lt-18440521-TC-RB-01"><sic>18:48&#x02013;49</sic><corr>TC to RB, <date when="1844-05-21">21 May 1844</date></corr></ref>. Charles Darwin, proponent of the theory of natural selection; he was first taken to Cheyne Row, <date when="1838-11-18">18 Nov. 1838</date> (see <ref target="volume-10/lt-18381202-TC-RWE-01"><sic>10:229</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1838-12-02">2 Dec. 1838</date></corr></ref>), by his brother, Erasmus Darwin, who had been friendly with the Carlyles since <date when="1835">1835</date>.</note> and surely my wish to help you, had I the power at all, would be very sincere. You seem to me to have been born with a naturally pious, just, and even devout turn of mind, but to have been swallowed into almost spiritual annihilation in the general deluge of what calls itself &#x0201C;Science,&#x0201D; and is, intrinsically mere trifling and baffling with the element external to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>, issuing in what the Fool said in his heart long ago, and what no wise man or generation till our own ever said to itself, &#x0201C;That there is no God.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>One thing I can affirm to you which is very certain. That these miserable speculators about &#x0201C;Protoplasm,<note n="2" noteref="380">Thomas Henry Huxley (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895">95</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14320"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), biologist and educational theorist, wrote &#x0201C;On the Physical Basis of Life,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> 11 (<date when="1869-02">Feb. 1869</date>): 129&#x02013;45, in which he argued that &#x0201C;Protoplasm,&#x0201D; the scientific name for the &#x0201C;physical basis of life,&#x0201D; was the &#x0201C;one kind of matter which is common to all living things,&#x0201D; binding life by a &#x0201C;physical, as well as an ideal, unity&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> 129). For TC&#x02019;s appalled reaction to this theory, see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690220-TC-JAC-01"><sic>46:16&#x02013;17</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-02-20">20 Feb. 1869</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690320-TC-JTY-01"><sic>35&#x02013;36</sic><corr>TC to JTY, <date when="1869-03-20">20 March 1869</date></corr></ref>.</note> Origin of the Species, Man&#x02019;s gradual descent from Apes or Oysters, &#x00026;c., &#x00026;c.,&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="381">Charles Darwin, <hi rend="italic">On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</hi> (<date when="1859">1859</date>) and <hi rend="italic">The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</hi> (<date when="1871">1871</date>).

 are by no manner of means the first Thinkers of their epoch, but are, to a contemptible degree, the very reverse; and that it would be wise in you to quit such company, and consider well whether this were really &#x0201C;discourse of reason,&#x0201D; or discourse of &#x0201C;want of reason,&#x0201D; on the part of a self-conceited, low-minded, and, in consequence, essentially blinded generation, &#x0201C;Age of Progress,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Aids of Science,&#x0201D; and whatever high names it may give itself.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-74" n="48:74"/>I doubt not you have still in you a sense, which you had at Thirteen, of what a great man calls the &#x0201C;Infinite Nature of <hi rend="italic">Duty</hi>&#x0201D;:<note n="4" noteref="382">A phrase TC used in many of his writings; e.g., <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 123, <hi rend="italic">On Heroes</hi> 65, <hi rend="italic">Past and Present</hi> (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 10:109); the &#x0201C;great man&#x0201D; was presumably Goethe, who highly influenced TC&#x02019;s ideas about duty.</note>
 study to resuscitate, to acquire, to strengthen this as the grand object of every human being; this is of itself Godlike, and it is there only that the evidence of God can begin for a Man. Trying it by chemical decomposition, by logical discussions pro or contra, leads no-whither; a man must begin at the other end: namely, at the Fountain of Light from Eternity implanted in man himself by the Unknown Creator, or he will arrive at no certainty.</p>
<p>You say you cannot read much. Let me advise you, at least, to read nothing but good Books: what you yourself earnestly trying can feel to be good; in whatever Author, never so popular, philosophic clever, you detect a mean, impious soul, with him have nothing more to do. By being earnest and conscientious in this you get to judge better and be more justly discriminative day by day. As indeed one does in all things. Try faithfully, light will rise on you if <hi rend="italic">so</hi>. &#x0201C;Knock and it shall be opened&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="383">See Matt. 7.7.</note>
 is a true saying. The great source of disappointment is, men do not truly knock, they do not &#x0201C;try&#x0201D; in a noble and heroic manner, but in a mean and huckstering with an eye to their own happiness and the like; to such there is no answer from the Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>On the whole I bid you still hope for victory. Honour your excellent and pious Mother; and believe that <hi rend="italic">her</hi> good prayers may verily, though in oblique ways and under unexpected forms, be answered in behalf of her loved son.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Sir! I write unwillingly and under great obstruction. Consider all this as strictly private and for yourself only.</p>

<p>Don&#x02019;t fret y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind heart, dear loving Lady that Melchet proved impossible!<note n="1" noteref="385">TC apparently stayed at Melchet Court for a few days; Allingham wrote to him there, <date when="1872-06-28">28 June</date>: &#x0201C;It gave me a shock to find you were gone.

 We sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> both of us recognise candidly the evid<hi rend="italic">t</hi> inexorable <hi rend="italic">Fact</hi> that, with so many reciprocal resources and with the most perfect will we can do each other little or no good, in this perverse practical world; and ought resolutely (with the <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> of vain regrets) to adjust ourselves to what will not and <pb id="pg-48-75" n="48:75"/>cannot alter for our poor wishings and lamentings. This seems a cruel doctrine; but I clearly perceive it is a true one. More is the pity; more also be the patience, be the silent courage!</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> slept here, to my own surprise, these 3 nights; and am certainly not <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> for what Melchet and its heavenlies and its earthlies did; nay, for the time, am as if in some degree <hi rend="italic">better</hi>.&#x02014; My Brother was not here on Monday Ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; he has been hovering &#x00026; hanging ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Caen, Bayeux, Honfleur<note n="2" noteref="386">Following his visit to Vichy, John A.

<p><salute>Dear Betty,</salute></p>
<p>Here again we have arrived at the eve of a Day<note n="1" noteref="417">JWC&#x02019;s birthday, <date when="1872-07-14">14 July</date>.</note>
 wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> is forever memorable to <hi rend="italic">both</hi> of us,&#x02014;to me memorable, beautiful, and sad (with the shadow of <hi rend="italic">April 21</hi><note n="2" noteref="418">The date of JWC&#x02019;s death. TC wrote in his journal, <date when="1872-07-12">12 July</date>: &#x0201C;A long interval, filled only with pitiful miseries and confusions (best <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi>),&#x02014;empty otherwise, except for here &#x00026; there an hour of serious, penitent refle<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, and of a sorrow wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> <hi rend="italic">c</hi>d be called loving, calm, and in some sort sacred and devout! Pure, clean <hi rend="italic">black</hi>, amid the gen<hi rend="italic">l</hi> <hi rend="italic">muddy</hi> gloom far <hi rend="italic">hitherward</hi> of those it is <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> being sad of heart for!&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned; Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi> 4:418, corrected against original).</note>
 resting on it!) beyond all other days of the Year. Accept this little Gift<note n="3" noteref="419">TC recorded in his checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1872-07-13">13 July 1872</date> / to Betty Braid (<hi rend="italic">Her</hi> dear old Betty!) / &#x000A3;5 .. 0 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>
 from me, as a sign of what I recognise you to be, my true <hi rend="italic">associate</hi> on this occasion, who shares and will do while we live, in all the feelings that belong to it. I know well that, except myself, there is no other who so loved her, &#x00026; loves, and daily thinks of her, as even you do. In her dear and blessed name, and in my own, I return you thanks and blessings.</p>
<p>I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> like to hear some tidings of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> health and welfare, dear Betty; but will not ask you to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> anything just now;&#x02014;send me an Old Newspaper addressed in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> hand; that will be sign enough for the present, <hi rend="italic">if</hi>, as I hope, nothing have gone notably wrong.</p>
<p>Several months ago, I had a most interesting Letter from Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Davison; detailing with great clearness his first visit to you in the new House,<note n="4" noteref="420">TC omitted the &#x0201C;d.&#x0201D; David Davidson visited Betty Braid, <date when="1872-02-17">17 Feb.</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720222-TC-DD-01">TC to DD, <date when="1872-02-22">22 Feb.</date></ref> Betty had recently moved two doors along the street in Greenend, Liberton.</note>
&#x02014;above reporting to me, almost as if in y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> own words abridged, that tragic <hi rend="italic">Narrative</hi>, wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> nobody but you c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> give,&#x02014;and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, often enough as the Tragedy itself was hinted at here, I never had in completeness before.<note n="5" noteref="421">The story of the death of JWC&#x02019;s father, Dr. John Welsh, <date when="1822">1822</date>, when Betty was a servant in the house; see <ref target="volume-48/ed-48-appendix">Appendix</ref>.</note>
 Ah me, ah me!&#x02014; I hope Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Davidson has seen you since, and will from time to time; he promised me as much. I keep his Narrative he got from you, as one of the most precious Documents connected with my life in this world.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear good Betty. I am not <hi rend="italic">ill</hi> in health; not sensibly worse than I was last year, tho&#x02019; of course one is daily growing weaker, and of mournfuller mood,&#x02014;may it also be of tenderer and purer (if God will)! I endeavour to wait with pious patience till the end come.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-80" n="48:80"/>God&#x02019;s blessing be on you, dear Betty.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Mrs Oliphant,</salute></p>
<p>I ardently desire you sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> succeed; I have a convict<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> fitness, too;&#x02014;and right willingly w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> help if in any way I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. But, knowing personally none of the persons you mention, I was,&#x02014;yesterday morning when y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Letter came,&#x02014;much at a loss how to proceed.</p>
<p>After considerat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I decided to call on Fr<hi rend="italic">k</hi> Chapman, my own Publisher; did so in the afternoon; found that he was familiar or &#x0201C;intimate&#x0201D; with Mr Virtue,<note n="1" noteref="423">James Sprent Virtue (<date when="1829">1829</date>&#x02013;<date when="1892">92</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28332"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), publisher; founder, and currently printer, of the monthly <hi rend="italic">Saint Paul&#x02019;s Magazine</hi>.</note>
 and was going to him &#x0201C;next morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>&#x0201D; (i.e. <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) &#x0201C;at 11,&#x0201D;&#x02014;and w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> punctually deliver my message,&#x02014;wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he himself quite agreed with, and wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> (being a <hi rend="italic">sanguine</hi> man!) he tho<hi rend="italic">t</hi> w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have a profitable influence. Message was to the effect, &#x0201C;That, in my opinion, you had <hi rend="italic">more</hi> of the likelihoods for such an office than any other person known to me;<note n="2" noteref="424">It is not known exactly what position Oliphant was hoping for; she supported herself and her two children writing stories and articles for magazines, and since <date when="1870">1870</date> had also been supporting her bankrupt brother Frank Wilson (<date when="1816">1816</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875">75</date>), a widower since <date when="1870">1870</date>, and three of his four children, Frank (<date when="1854">1854</date>&#x02013;<date when="1879">79</date>), Margaret (Madge) (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1897">97</date>), and Janet Mary (Denny) (<date when="1865">1865</date>&#x02013;<date when="1954">1954</date>); the older sister, Jeanie Helen (Nelly) (b. <date when="1856">1856</date>), went to live with a maternal aunt. Oliphant&#x02019;s two sons and her nephew were all at Eton, but able to sleep and eat at home, as they lived nearby.</note>
 and that it w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be clear wisdom to satisfy himself <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> as to <hi rend="italic">y</hi>r qualifica<hi rend="italic">tns</hi> before going farther, and perhaps faring worse!&#x0201D;&#x02014; Chap<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, no doubt, has delivered something substantially like this &#x0201C;ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 11 a.m.&#x0201D; and what its &#x0201C;influence&#x0201D; is or will be nobody yet knows.</p>
<p>If Mr Virtue wished to consult me farther on the affair, I w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> gladly give him a meeting;&#x02014;the rather as my own persuasion or convict<hi rend="italic">n</hi> ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> fitness is, on all or nearly <hi rend="italic">all</hi> points, candidly as above, and I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have nothing to hide in speaking with anybody on the subject.<note n="3" noteref="425">Oliphant never attained a salaried position with any publisher and was reliant on publishing her writings for income, in addition to her civil list pension of &#x000A3;100 a year, granted <date when="1868">1868</date>.</note>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Writing</hi>, as you may perceive, is nearly impossible to me; and I never try it (by dictat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> or otherwise) with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> disgust: but if there is any service by writing or otherwise that I can do, you in this case have good right to <!-- overline -->command me.<note n="4" noteref="426">Oliphant replied, <date when="1872-07-17">17 July</date>: &#x0201C;How can I thank you for acting for me so promptly and so kindly, and for writing to me with your own hand? &#x02026; One is so ready to think that nobody cares whether one stands or falls&#x02014;and there is strength and comfort in every word you say.&#x0201D; However she continued: &#x0201C;M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Virtue&#x02019;s letter which you have been so good as to enclose to me is cold and rather discouraging.&#x0201D; She concluded: &#x0201C;I hope that I may require to avail myself of your kind promise and refer to you again.&#x0201D;</note>

<p>The little note you left for me at Chelsea recorded a little bit of triumphant industry for me which I was really glad of on the whole, and certainly full of thanks for.<note n="1" noteref="440">Forster apparently sent TC a draft announcement of some kind of pension for Geraldine Jewsbury; he wrote, <date when="1872-07-31">31 July</date>: &#x0201C;If you approve of the printed announcement&#x02014;this will be sufficiently known by your not returning it with amendment.&#x0201D; Forster had been attempting to get a Civil List pension for Jewsbury since <date when="1869-05">May 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18690526-TC-JF-01"><sic>46:49</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1869-05-26">26 May 1869</date></corr></ref>, and with the help of Mary Aitken had obtained signatures from many prominent people in support of the petition; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710121-TC-JAC-01"><sic>47:141</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1871-01-21">21 Jan. 1871</date></corr></ref>. Although still unsuccessful with that, they had apparently achieved something. Forster wrote to Frederic Chapman, <date when="1872-07-28">28 July</date>: &#x0201C;Your suggestion is clearly an improvement and I have altered the announcement accordingly. When the correction is made, send one or two copies to me at Palace Gate House, that I may let Mr Carlyle have one&#x0201D; (MS: untraced). The printed announcement is untraced.</note>
 The note yesterday morning also brought good tidings and naturally did <hi rend="italic">me</hi> good also. I hope both of you will really profit by these fine summer airs at Knebworth<note n="2" noteref="441">Forster wrote: &#x0201C;I got on reasonably well at Knebworth&#x02014;and have promised to return in a few days for a little longer stay, when I shall take the Small One [his wife, Eliza] with me.&#x0201D; Forster had been staying at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, home of Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer, 1st Baron Lytton, his son, Edward Robert Bulwer-Lytton (both close friends of Forster), and Edward Robert&#x02019;s wife, Edith.</note>
 for a little while and then go down with new strength and hope to the sea side breezes and many-sounding main.<note n="3" noteref="442">Forster was to go to Torquay on the Devonshire coast, Nov.</note>
 This is a beautiful silent and solitary place; much grateful to one&#x02019;s wearied soul. The bathing, <pb id="pg-48-84" n="48:84"/>too, is excellent; the air delightful and within doors all that silent hospitality can do for us, is done to perfection;&#x02014;only <hi rend="italic">sleep</hi> hitherto has been a defective quantity; which, you know, is always my weak side. Nevertheless by human ingenuity, travailing assiduously in this high matter, especially making little wedges and putting them wisely and well, and putting them in<note n="4" noteref="443">TC put wedges of paper in the window frames to stop them rattling.</note>
 ditto, ditto&#x02014;I think I have at last succeeded; thank Heaven;&#x02014;for the last four and twenty hours at least, it is certain I have had more sleep, than in any day and night for the last three weeks. So that we may say all is now something like well for except in regard to sleep all was already favourable to me&#x02014; The very sound of that sea, bodeful, mournful great and continual is like that of Eternity pacifying and purifying to a weary, worn out soul. <hi rend="italic">Allah Kerim</hi> [God is generous], as the Moslem says&#x02014;</p>
<p>The news from Melchet, I am glad to say continues favourable but the poor Lady has had a bad adventure and one that I cannot get out of my mind; she is still very weak can hardly walk even down stairs and is reduced altogether to driving for exercise.</p>
<p>Quain<note n="5" noteref="444">Richard Quain, Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s doctor.</note>
, as usual, is full of encouragement and denies the room for any apprehension but I dont like such attacks: my own private opinion is her poor ladyship might do better here in her own quiet sea cottage than either at Buxton, Wiesbaden,<note n="6" noteref="445">Buxton, spa town in Derbyshire; Wiesbaden, spa town in central W Germany.</note>
 or any other bath place that could be appointed her&#x02014;</p>
<p>Good bye, dear Forster</p>

<p>Peace and blessing go with you and your&#x02019;s&#x02014;</p>

<p>My heart bleeds for you, dear Lady; and, alas, in poor me, what help or shadow of service is there?<note n="1" noteref="447">Melchet Court was seriously damaged by fire, <date when="1872-08-03">3 Aug.</date>; the <hi rend="italic">Hampshire Advertiser</hi> reported, <date when="1872-08-07">7 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;It seems that about half-past 2 o&#x02019;clock on Saturday morning one of the under gardeners saw smoke issuing from a gable in the roof of the building, at the north-west end, near an attic in the servants&#x02019; apartments, and he at once raised an alarm. Mr. Cross, the house steward, speedily summoned the whole of the men about the place to assist him to put out the fire, the flames at this time bursting out, and sent messengers on horse-back to Romsey and Broadlands for help, telegraphing also to Salisbury.&#x0201D; Joseph Cross (ca. <date when="1831">1831</date>&#x02013;<date when="1918">1918</date>), formerly head gardener at Addiscombe, now at Melchet. Many local people came to help with the &#x0201C;removal of the priceless works of art with which the place was fairly crowded, and paintings, sculpture &#x02026; bronzes, rare and curious china, tapestries, together with the valuable library, were quickly taken to the open air, the most commendable zeal and enthusiasm being shown, not only with the motive of saving such works of art, but from the sympathy and love felt for the noble proprietress &#x02026; . Her ladyship, notwithstanding being in a delicate state of health, persisted in remaining on the lawn, reclining on a couch, and watching the operations during the whole of the day. &#x02026; Nearly all the priceless treasures which the house contained were saved. &#x02026; Not so with the painted ceilings. &#x02026; Indeed the most stately apartments in the house appear to have sustained the greatest damage, together with some of the rare and costly furniture; and nearly two-thirds of the building have been reduced to a mass of blackened, shapeless walls.&#x0201D; The <hi rend="italic">Salisbury and Winchester Journal</hi> reported, <date when="1872-08-10">10 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;Lady Ashburton had &#x02026; returned to Melchet only a few days before. &#x02026; What the pecuniary loss sustained by her ladyship may be it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to say. We have heard it estimated at from some 20,000&#x000A3;. to 30,000&#x000A3;.&#x0201D; The <hi rend="italic">Athen&#x000E6;um</hi> noted, <date when="1872-08-10">10 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;The splendid new mansion of the Dowager Lady Ashburton, Melchet Court, Hants., has been destroyed by fire. It contained many of the splendid works of art formerly at Bath House, in Piccadilly, and the Grange, in Hampshire, and the library was, perhaps, one of the best private collections in England.&#x0201D; See also Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 157&#x02013;58.</note>
 I can fill myself with grief, confusion and astonish<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <pb id="pg-48-85" n="48:85"/>for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> dear kind sake; but what is the <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of that to any one! Seldom in my life have I had such an amazing, sudden &#x00026; wild bit of Job&#x02019;s news<note n="2" noteref="448">Evil tidings; cf. Job 1:14&#x02013;19. Presumably TC received the news by telegram.</note>
 as yesterday at dinner!</p>
<p>The one bit of consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> we have yet had is, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do not seem to have been hurt in the sudden overturn! God grant it be all <hi rend="italic">true</hi>;&#x02014;for who almost c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> believe it?&#x02014;</p>
<p>Mary does know; we found last night that she had caught <hi rend="italic">suspicion</hi> from the look of our faces, &#x00026; that it was better to tell her.<note n="3" noteref="449">Lady Ashburton and her da., Mary Florence, had apparently been at Seaforth with TC and John A. Carlyle for a few days, and Mary Florence remained when Lady Ashburton returned to Melchet Court; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 157.</note>
 Her one anxiety was ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> <!-- overline -->Mamma,&#x02014;&#x0201C;so weak, oh you don&#x02019;t know how weak!&#x0201D; Said she.</p>
<p>I give you my <hi rend="italic">word of honour</hi> that she is brilliantly well this morn<hi rend="italic">g</hi>;&#x02014;and knowing <!-- overline -->Mamma to be safe, I do believe cares little if all Wiltshire were on fire. Bonny little woman.</p>
<p>God be ever with you, much-suffering kindest of living Friends.&#x02014; Think <hi rend="italic">seriously</hi> of coming <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>, instead of to Wiesbaden &#x00026;c &#x00026;c!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,</salute></p>
<p>Thanks for y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> kind little word. I hope you will manage to continue on the Downs<note n="1" noteref="478">South Downs, extensive range of chalk hills in SE England.</note>
 a while yet, and enjoy to best advantage what of summer is still left. Last night&#x02019;s thunder &#x00026; rain-deluges, we may hope, will have brightened everything a bit.</p>
<p>Lady Ashburton has gone to Buxton<note n="2" noteref="479">Spa town in Derbyshire.</note>
 for a month. She is gratefully determined to accept y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> generous help:<note n="3" noteref="480">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720821-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref></note>

 therefore, dear F., with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> interrupt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; and let all the world have ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> from you what it is expecting!&#x02014;</p>
<p>I am completely solitary here; and rather find it profitable to be so, in comparison. Seldom has London so little of raging noise and d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> <hi rend="italic">nonsense</hi> as even now; small still voices <hi rend="italic">can</hi> speak to one, and tho<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> high and mournful that wander thro&#x02019; Eternity. Mournful exceedingly; yet also with gleams of very blessedness, and love stronger than death! Were not the fountain of <hi rend="italic">tears</hi> quite dried in me, I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> feel it a consolat<hi rend="italic">n</hi> sometimes to sit and weep, sheer weeping like a girl&#x02019;s or a child&#x02019;s all day.&#x02014; No more of this,&#x02014;nor to the Philistines anything of it at all.</p>

Although the plays were published without notes on the same page as the text, they all had comprehensive notes at the end of each play, covering disputed readings, explanatory notes, and comments from various previous editors and critics. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> is in vol. 7 of the edn. that TC owned.</note>

A wandering thro&#x02019; the Gardens as of Paradise,&#x02014;accompanied everywhere as with a whirlpool of barking curs, importunate cats, apes, and irrational unclean creatures!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Let me hear ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, as you promise, dear F.&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">item</hi> even see you some day soon. With many best regards to the amiable One,<note n="7" noteref="484">Eliza Forster.</note>

 they are really very good honest-hearted people,&#x02014;and their &#x0201C;Philanthropy &#x00026;c &#x00026;c won&#x02019;t infect <hi rend="italic">her</hi> clear little head or heart.

 That I never shall forget her unwearied loving-kindness to me, her <hi rend="italic">canty</hi> little ways, and what a <hi rend="italic">light</hi> she was in this dim scene.

<p>[I am much as usual] silent mostly as a stone. &#x02026; Twisleton (who called the other day, and talked, and poked my poor ribs through the Park) sent me next day an excellent little German book about Schiller&#x02019;s Father and Mother (my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> reading,<note n="1" noteref="497">Ernst Julius Saupe, <hi rend="italic">Schiller und sein v&#x000E4;terliches Haus</hi> [Schiller and His Father&#x02019;s Household] (Leipzig, <date when="1851">1851</date>).

<p>That is the best bit of news I have heard for months past, that you seem to be getting fairly well ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; thank Heaven along with me for that, and may Heaven mercifully confirm it! As I love to hope Heaven,&#x02014;and <hi rend="italic">Earth</hi> (i.e. y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="italic">careful Self</hi>) assisting!&#x02014;graciously and mercifully will. Continued languor, weakness and pain are a dreary accompaniment to the moil of troubles you are already in!&#x02014;</p>
<p>That Letter you have written to my Sister<note n="1" noteref="499">TC apparently told Lady Ashburton that her affectionate behavior towards TC had been misinterpreted by Mary Aitken who apparently suspected Lady Ashburton of wanting to marry TC; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 158&#x02013;60. Lady Ashburton wrote, [<date when="1872-09-05">5 Sept.</date>]: &#x0201C;I cannot tell you with what feelings of sorrow, &#x00026; perplexity I left you today&#x02014;How can it be otherwise?&#x02014; As far as my poor judgment on my own conduct serves me, I feel I have <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to reproach myself with&#x02014;How can I fail to revere, &#x00026; love you?&#x02014;you who were my young enthusiasm, the prophet of my soul. &#x02026; You who were the chosen friend of my husband&#x02014;the only person as he often told me, whose approval, or disapproval were of real importance to him&#x02014;&#x00026; who have been my unchanging friend, all these years&#x02014;it grieves my very soul, to feel that I have brought a moment&#x02019;s trouble to your life&#x02014;&#x00026; that I have been so Misunderstood.&#x0201D; Lady Ashburton wrote a letter to Jean Aitken on the subject, sending it to TC for forwarding. Kaplan interpreted the &#x0201C;altercation&#x0201D; with Lady Ashburton as the latter being critical of Mary Aitken&#x02019;s &#x0201C;unwillingness to continue as her uncle&#x02019;s attendant&#x0201D; (Kaplan 509).</note>
 seems to me a condescenscion <pb id="pg-48-94" n="48:94"/>[<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] with<hi rend="italic">t</hi> parallel;&#x02014;and it is simply my doubt whether s<hi rend="italic">he</hi> is worthy of it in this matter that has kept the Letter still here in silent suspense. A phrase in Jean&#x02019;s one Letter to me were as if&#x02014; Or perhaps I mistook it? In short I did not entirely like it: and being fixed not to speak ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi> at all on that inane &#x00026; mad affair, I kept, &#x00026; still keep, the Letter.<note n="2" noteref="500">Jean Aitken&#x02019;s letter to TC and Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s letter to Jean are both untraced.</note>
 All yesterday, my not<hi rend="italic">n</hi> was, to destroy the generous little Document, &#x00026; let my own mind be the only record of it in Creat<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Today ag<hi rend="italic">n</hi>, I have a kind of feeling that perhaps John ought to see it, and have the deciding ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> it. <hi rend="italic">Today</hi> it shall continue here; and tomorrow I will either send it to him, or else <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> it,<note n="3" noteref="501">Lady Ashburton replied, <date when="1872-09-13">13 [Sept.]</date>: &#x0201C;I have just got your letter of yesterday &#x02026; &#x00026; am but <hi rend="italic">much distressed</hi> at the news that you have not sent that letter &#x00026; are doubtful about sending it at all. I don&#x02019;t want to obtrude my feelings on this subject, but I feel really it is only <hi rend="italic">fair to me that some one of your family</hi> <hi rend="italic">sh</hi>d <hi rend="italic">see what I have written</hi>&#x02014;when you are gone away, &#x00026; your niece still continues to hold the opinions she does of me, &#x00026; will not be restrained from expressing them, by fear of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> displeasure, or your pain, there is no saying what harm my good name may endure, or what pain Mary &#x00026; I may suffer from the distortion of our friendship. I must therefore in justice to myself, <hi rend="italic">beg</hi> of you at once to send the letter to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle, if you will to Mrs Aitken much better&#x02014;as it is quite clear the poisoned tongue of calumny, added to the natural inclination to believe her own child, has made your sister take a jaundiced view of the matter.&#x0201D;</note>
 as an oblation to the silent gods.&#x02014; Think no more of it, therefore; except that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have done well in the matter, and wished to do!&#x02014;</p>
<p>My faithful regards to Mary Gold: is she still continuing her pretty little &#x0201C;Private Hour&#x0201D;?<note n="4" noteref="502">Mary Florence Baring; Lady Ashburton replied, <date when="1872-09-13">13 [Sept.]</date>: &#x0201C;Poor Mary&#x02019;s little private hour has been quite broken in to&#x02014;for she has been in her bed for some days&#x02014;with a very bad irruption which is now going.&#x0201D;</note>

The only conclusion I could draw was, that the kind of British Army he wanted would and must be, for years and ions, under the present invaluable British Constitution, entirely a desideratum. Mary has also being doing for me <pb id="pg-48-100" n="48:100"/>a little bit of Cromwell Letter copying<note n="8" noteref="540">Cromwell letter unidentified.</note>
 (altogether unimportant); and even proposes, were this done, to try some elucidating of the Cromwell piece by researches in the Commons&#x02019; Journals. This is all our Literary news.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly been thinking of what you said about the wet climate of winter in Dumfries, and of the probable preferability of London with its resources.<note n="9" noteref="541">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1872-09-24">24 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;I know not whether I shall be able to remain here during the winter, as the dampness of the climate seems to suit me badly; &#x00026; sometimes it seems possible that we might keep house together, &#x00026; I relieve you from all the botheration of household accounts by taking my half of all expenses&#x02014;a plan that might require only a little exercise of patience at the outset.&#x0201D;</note>
 I can well enter into all your feelings on the subject; and am myself frequently considering what could advisably be done. Beyond question, it would to me be very agreeable to have you within speaking distance instead of far-off, as now! It is certain also that the very loneliness of a Dumfries winter, to say nothing of the wet and mud &#x00026;c, must be widely inferior to London as a life-element with so many possibilities of intelligent society, useful reading and even some intellectual employment. But this is all the length I have yet got; and the poor sum of all I can yet do is to bid you revolve it with all the clearness, candour and justness of insight that you can command; and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to dismiss it (as I too will not) till you have come to a solid decision on it. No more today. My kindest regards to James to Jean and to all and sundry.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>I am deeply in your debt in the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> way; but I have been very busy; and you are beautifully tolerant in that respect. Thanks to you for that; and for the two letters you have sent me which are welcome proofs of the same.</p>
<p>Mary and I are faithfully standing to our poor bit of work; the translation fairly ended &#x00026; mostly recopied &#x00026; put right: but it will still involve me in good deal of petty fash, piecing and shifting into new combinations; &#x00026; I often fear no silk purse can be made of <hi rend="italic">Saupe</hi>,<note n="1" noteref="546">Ernst Julius Saupe; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720909-TC-LLA-01">TC to LLA, <date when="1872-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 who, though very honest, is intrinsically something of a sow&#x02019;s ear.<note n="2" noteref="547">In both his letter to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1872-09-09">9 Sept.</date>, and in his introduction to the &#x0201C;Supplement of <date when="1872">1872</date>&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25:207), TC was quite admiring of Saupe&#x02019;s book.</note>
 On the whole it keeps my hands and my head pretty full through the few working hours of the day;&#x02014;and in that respect may be counted a kind of blessing to me; Saupe&#x02019;s botchings and my own bother with them being better than the poor gloomy meditations which I should otherwise awake to every morning. I have got several other much superior Books about Schiller&#x02019;s early wanderings (especially one <hi rend="italic">Schwab</hi>,<note n="3" noteref="548">Gustav Schwab (<date when="1792">1792</date>&#x02013;<date when="1850">1850</date>), German writer, <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x02019;s Leben</hi> [Life of Schiller] (Stuttgart, <date when="1841">1841</date>); see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25:207.</note>
 which will be well worth your reading by &#x00026; by): all these I am looking into &#x00026; mean to read in some loose way; but I must avoid also carefully going into investigations &#x00026; details on the subject; or even to <hi rend="italic">seem</hi> to have taken much trouble with this &#x0201C;Supplement of <date when="1872">1872</date>&#x0201D; or have made any serious study on what is so insignificant to me now; and upon a Book which I have always felt &#x00026; declared to be entirely insignificant. Enough of all that for the present!</p>
<p>My health, sleeping &#x00026;c &#x00026;c are not to be called very bad, in spite of the shocking weather, perpetual rain, either drizzling or pouring; hardly above one dry day for a fortnight past: I think the bathing did me real good; and in a kind of <hi rend="italic">central</hi> way; but of course I do feel that I am dragging back towards the old state of matters; no cure yet discovered for the real disease I have, old age and its steadily increasing incapacity of digesting any food! Let us be thankful things are no worse than they are.</p>
<p>Poor Forster has been very ill for a three weeks past, mostly confined to <pb id="pg-48-102" n="48:102"/>the house; but for the last few days he is visibly better; has finished his second vol. of Dickens&#x02019;s Life (which is to come out next month, after which there will be a third and last still <hi rend="italic">in posse</hi> [in process]); he talks of going to Mentone for a 3 months; actually <hi rend="italic">talks</hi> but I don&#x02019;t know whether he will go. He is endlessly kind to me; and has in reality saved me I think, with complete success a very great deal of bother with Chapman and these poor Books of mine. Froude &#x00026; Tyndall, as you doubtless know, are both in America; Tyndall lecturing in Washington by this time; Froude d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in New York, with great splendour of reception,<note n="4" noteref="549">J. A. Froude&#x02019;s American publishers, Scribner, Armstrong &#x00026; Seymour, hosted a lavish banquet for him at Delmonico&#x02019;s Restaurant, New York, <date when="1872-10-15">15 Oct.</date>, which included speeches from several eminent writers, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, who gave the welcome address.</note>
&#x02014;as you see by the little slip, enclosed, from his Wife<note n="5" noteref="550">Henrietta Elizabeth Froude.</note>

 Actually so; but means to keep it secret all he can, being out of health &#x00026; sent straight way for Italy; not till after some months in which, will he return and openly shew himself to England; I fear he is not in a very good state of health,&#x02014; Perhaps beginning, like the rest of us, to feel that he too is entering the gloomy valley of Old Age. Meanwhile I shall be greatly interested to see Emerson once-again, on the terms there are.</p>
<p>Thank Jean for her letters to me; say I had already punctually heard from Mary about the flannels &#x00026;c; but that I did not immediately need any; and that we agreed to put off the question till this stupendous Literary Enterprise of ours were once got off the stocks.&#x02014; I am terribly whipt by want of time; and must add nothing more.&#x02014; With my love to you all, I remain, ever,</p>

<p><salute>Dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Being good for little during the last 2 days, and indeed sitting idle as to Schiller work, I may at least write you a few lines before the week end. The weather has been very wet; I myself very languid and lazy. This, with the other extraneous interruptions which have occured, has considerably retarded the poor <hi rend="italic">Saupe</hi> redaction,&#x02014;which essentially lies on the edge of completion too;&#x02014;and I see that nothing but remorse of conscience rousing me up into a certain small fury of real execution for a four and twenty hours or so will end that paltry enterprise,<note n="1" noteref="555">TC wrote about his dissatisfaction with the process, <date when="1873-03-01">1 March 1873</date>: &#x0201C;My delays &#x00026; hagglings (due chiefly to my <hi rend="italic">impatience</hi> under the miseries of <hi rend="italic">writ</hi>g <hi rend="italic">by dictat</hi>n, which were &#x00026; are <hi rend="italic">inevitable</hi>, &#x00026; only to be lessened by perfect <hi rend="italic">patience</hi>!) filled me with dissatisfaction, sharpened latterly by prickings of <hi rend="italic">remorse</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Do</hi> better next time: that is the one useful kind of &#x02018;remorse&#x02019;!&#x02014; Since then, except rather idle reading, and helpless musing, sad enough but mostly silent, my Hist<hi rend="italic">y</hi> again nothing&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s journal; privately owned).</note>
&#x02014;probably some time next week! I have got, in the meanwhile, a great deal of interesting satisfaction from reading those other books about Schiller;<note n="2" noteref="556">As well as Gustav Schwab, <hi rend="italic">Schillers Leben</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1841">1841</date>) (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721026-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-10-26">26 Oct.</date></ref>), TC also consulted Caroline von Wolzogen (&#x0201C;Schiller&#x02019;s sister-in-law&#x0201D;), <hi rend="italic">Schillers Leben</hi> (Stuttgart und T&#x000FC;bingen, <date when="1845">1845</date>), and Baroness von Gleichen (&#x0201C;Schiller&#x02019;s youngest daughter&#x0201D;) and Baron von Wolzogen (&#x0201C;her cousin&#x0201D;), <hi rend="italic">Schillers Beziehungen zu Eltern, Geschwistern und der Familie von Wolzogen, aus den Familien-Papieren</hi> (Stuttgart, <date when="1859">1859</date>); see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25:207.</note>
 which bring him so much more clearly than ever before my mind; and, along with him, so many memories, emotions and associations that now lie full 50 years behind me.<note n="3" noteref="557">TC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Friedrich Schiller</hi> was first pbd. <date when="1825">1825</date>.</note>
 He is upon the whole a most loveable fellow-man, full of affection, enthusiasm and nobleness of mind; but as a Poet, Man of intellect or otherwise of supreme talent in any kind, I do not recognise him more than heretofore. Poor Schiller, the account of his death, which I read yesternight the last thing (vividly described by one Voss,<note n="4" noteref="558">Presumably Johann Heinrich Voss (<date when="1751">1751</date>&#x02013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), German dramatist; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25:287&#x02013;88.</note>
 who sat up with him 12 nights, and saw him the day before he died, look at his last little Baby<note n="5" noteref="559">Emily Henriette Louise Schiller (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872">72</date>).</note>
 with inexpressible love and <hi rend="italic">Wehmuth</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sadness</hi>], and then bury his head among the pillows in a flood of tears) brought me also to the edge of weeping, or even over the edge.</p>
<p>Last night, before all this, we had been dining with Forster, as you are to <pb id="pg-48-104" n="48:104"/>understand! Allingham and young Emerson besides our two selves were the only company.<note n="6" noteref="560">Allingham recorded the event in his diary, <date when="1872-11-01">1 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;Dined at Mr. John Forster&#x02019;s, Palace Gate House, Kensington&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Allingham Diary</hi> 214).</note>
 Emerson spoke to me of your letter to him, and of his writing to you, as he had undertaken, when I saw him last, about 2 weeks ago. He now suddenly annnounces to us that he is just about leaving London, were his Father once fairly arrived! He goes to France I think, thence to America, for the sake of some privelege in the Boston Hospital, which he expects there. He was rather pleasant company last night,&#x02014;much as we found him at Seaforth in <date when="1872-08">August</date> last.<note n="7" noteref="561">Edward W. Emerson sailed from Liverpool to Boston, <date when="1872-11-12">12 Nov.</date>, to return to Harvard. He visited TC and John A.

 His Father it appears, he privately expects to arrive at Liverpool early next week, Father is then to be carried off to Chester for quiet&#x02019;s sake; to come almost incognito to London thereafter,<note n="8" noteref="562">Ralph Waldo Emerson arrived in Liverpool, <date when="1872-11-03">3 Nov.</date>, met his son in Chester the next day, and then traveled to London, <date when="1872-11-06">6 Nov.</date></note>
 and, with a minimum of delay, make for Egypt for the winter. I made him, with sincerity the offer of his old lodging in this house; but do not think he will accept, nor indeed can regret if he dont;<note n="9" noteref="563">Emerson stayed at Cheyne Row <date when="1847-10-25">25</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847-10-29">29 Oct. 1847</date>, see <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471026-TC-JCA-01"><sic>22:137&#x02013;42</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1847-10-26">26 Oct. 1847</date></corr></ref>; <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471028-JWC-LHB-01"><corr>JWC to LHB, <date when="1847-10-28">[28 Oct. 1847]</date></corr></ref>; and <ref target="volume-22/lt-18471028-JWC-WEF-01">JWC to WEF, <date when="1847-10-28">[28 Oct. 1847]</date></ref>. On this visit he was to stay in lodgings at Mrs. Bennet&#x02019;s, 11 Down St., Piccadilly.</note>
 so feckless fidgetty and dreary is my own way of life here.&#x02014; Forster is still in considerable afflutter, tho&#x02019; fairly a little better; and means to be off straightway to Torquay; to return before Xmas, and <hi rend="italic">not</hi> go to Mentone or any whither else. Of Froude&#x02019;s operations in America you probably hear through the newspapers; something of it you may see in this week&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Public Opinion</hi>,<note n="10" noteref="564">Reports from the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> of Froude&#x02019;s opening lecture on relations between England and Ireland at Association Hall, New York, were carried in <hi rend="italic">Public Opinion</hi> 22 (<date when="1872-11-02">2 Nov. 1872</date>): 555: &#x0201C;Mr. Froude, as is natural in a stranger to the American nation, and especially in an English stranger, makes the mistake at the outset of assuming that America and England are kindred. Our people are more Irish than English, and as much German as either&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, <date when="1872-10-18">18 Oct.</date>); &#x0201C;The mission of Mr. Froude is to be no holiday progress. The thesis which he only partly set forth last night&#x02014;that the misfortunes of Ireland are rather due to the congenital qualities of the race than to wrongs inflicted by their conquerors&#x02014;will excite earnest interest and perhaps bitter controversy&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>, <date when="1872-10-17">17 Oct.</date>).</note>
 if you care to read it, which is not much worth while.&#x02014; I see a good deal of James (or FitzJames) Stephen<note n="11" noteref="565">James Fitzjames Stephen returned to England from India, <date when="1872-04">April 1872</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700603-TC-JFS-01"><sic>47:20</sic><corr>TC to JFS, <date when="1870-06-03">3 June 1870</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 latterly he is good solid company for intelligence, sincerity and information about his own late &#x00026; present industries,&#x02014;which, however, tho&#x02019; really important to the world, are not so to me. Allingham too appears about once a week, with a great deal of innocent ingenious but croaky conversation, which is rather cheerfuller to me than none.<note n="12" noteref="566">Allingham reported, <date when="1872-11-05">5 Nov.</date>, TC&#x02019;s words about a Fenian meeting in Hyde Park, <date when="1872-11-02">2 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;&#x02018;Fitzjames Stephen and I passed through the tail of it; they were mainly London idlers. What are we coming to? People intend to try Atheism awhile. They will not find it answer&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Allingham Diary</hi> 215).</note>

<p>From Ruskin I hear nothing whatever; not even his <hi rend="italic">Clavigera</hi> for this month <pb id="pg-48-105" n="48:105"/>has yet come:<note n="13" noteref="567">Ruskin&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi> Letter 23 (<date when="1872-11">Nov. 1872</date>), &#x0201C;The Labyrinth.&#x0201D; Ruskin wrote from Brantwood, <date when="1872-08-30">30 Aug.</date>: &#x0201C;I should have written to you long since, but had only horrible things to write&#x02014;I am under more kindly stars, now. &#x02026; I am to be here, arranging rooms in my new home, till the middle of <date when="1872-10">October</date> I believe.&#x0201D; TC wrote on reverse: &#x0201C;Ruskin (Nothing <hi rend="italic">farther yet</hi>: <date when="1872-09-28">28 Sept<hi rend="italic">r</hi></date>!).&#x0201D;</note>
 today I had from Larkin the enclosed Letter about Ruskin &#x00026; his <hi rend="italic">Fors</hi>, which is worth your reading;<note n="14" noteref="568">Henry Larkin (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1899">99</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/ed-45-biographical-notes"><sic>45:226</sic><corr>45:biographical notes</corr></ref>) had been a friend of the Carlyles for many years, and he helped TC with maps and indexes for <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi>; their last recorded contact was <date when="1868-12">Dec. 1868</date>; see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18681123-TC-HL-01"><sic>45:200</sic><corr>TC to HL, <date when="1868-11-23">23 Nov. 1868</date></corr></ref>. He wrote from Rivington, nr. Chorley, Lancashire, <date when="1872-10-31">31 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;I have to thank you for the No. of &#x02018;Fors Clavigera&#x02019; you so kindly sent me. I have now obtained and read the whole series so far as published, and have been very deeply interested.&#x0201D; He wrote eight pages criticizing Ruskin&#x02019;s arguments, concluding: &#x0201C;I have written from the depth of my sympathy with their object, and not in any captious spirit &#x02026; and I again very heartily thank you for &#x02026; calling my attention to them.&#x0201D; TC presumably sent him Letter 22 (<date when="1872-10">Oct. 1872</date>), &#x0201C;The Mount of Compassion,&#x0201D; which dealt among other things with capitalism and the charging of interest. On Larkin&#x02019;s envelope, TC wrote: &#x0201C;Larkin (on <hi rend="italic">Interest</hi>): <hi rend="small-caps">good</hi> (<date when="1872-11">Nov<hi rend="italic">r</hi> 1872</date>).&#x0201D; John A.

<p><salute>Dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Half a word before I run out to extort from the cold day my bit of walk. Your letter came yesterday while Mary and I sat at work; thanks for your unwearied punctuality</p>
<p>Perhaps you may like to read this hand fast clear and solid Letter of Froude&#x02019;s which cames<note n="1" noteref="578">Thus in MS.</note>
 to us first two days ago, and a second time this morning back <pb id="pg-48-107" n="48:107"/>from his Wife, whose Letter too you may take the trouble of reading; both will come back at anytime. Froude&#x02019;s outlooks I consider to be good and useful. I have read most of his Book; and emphatically agree with nearly all I find there.<note n="2" noteref="579">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1872-11-22">22 Nov.</date>, that he had read Froude&#x02019;s first vol. on Ireland, &#x0201C;very interesting &#x02026; . Here &#x00026; there it is not quite so mature &#x00026; complete as it perhaps might have been &#x02026; it is perfectly true so far as it goes.&#x0201D;</note>
 <hi rend="italic">True</hi> words,<note n="3" noteref="580">Froude delivered his series of five lectures at Cornell Univ., Ithaca, N.Y., <date when="1872-10-28">28 Oct.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-11-01">1 Nov.</date>; the <hi rend="italic">Ithaca Daily Journal</hi> reported, <date when="1872-11-04">4 Nov.</date>, that the fifth and last, &#x0201C;The relations between England and Ireland,&#x0201D; &#x0201C;was the most interesting lecture of the course, as it treated of the relations of the countries down to the present time and the large audience listened with unabating attention and interest to the earnest sentiments which the great historian uttered.&#x0201D; On the subject of Fenianism and Home Rule, Froude declared: &#x0201C;what the Fenians accomplished amounted to nothing. &#x02026; Gladstone&#x02019;s [Land-reform] measure, passed three years ago, was the most healing measure ever adopted, and one for which English and Scottish farmers have pleaded in vain. &#x02026; But the Irish are not satisfied. They want home-rule. &#x02026; The only result of home-rule would be to compel the Protestants to vacate their properties in the Southern counties. And if Protestant ascendancy was evil, surely Catholic ascendancy would be more so.&#x0201D;</note>
 in spite of all the blustering Irish rowdies<note n="4" noteref="581">The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reported, <date when="1872-10-21">21 Oct.</date>: &#x0201C;We must spare a few moments for a neat little controversy which has broken out in this city between two of our distinguished guests, one of the most famous of living English historians, the other perhaps the most brilliant of living Irish orators.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,</salute></p>
<p>Many thanks for your welcome Letter, which we were much longing for here; you know what pleasure it must give to hear that all goes not ill but well, and that you find Torquay and its Hotel and your way of life there surpass expectation;<note n="1" noteref="586">Forster wrote from Cumper&#x02019;s Hotel, Torquay, <date when="1872-11-18">18 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;You will have thought me, dear Carlyle, a little unmindful of my promise&#x02014;but I wished, before writing, to give the place something of a trial; and now, for both of us, notwithstanding the doubtful variable weather, I have fair report to make. We are in a very comfortable &#x02026; hotel; kept by a nobleman&#x02019;s retired Cook who married a &#x02018;German governess,&#x02019; and this worthy couple have the good sense not to depute to others, but themselves to discharge in person, the requirements respectively of kitchen and of servants&#x02019; hall. &#x02026; After some difficulty, I have found a sheltered place to walk in, with view of a magnificent expanse of sea stretching out to Torbay point; and here, in the intervals of rain, I have managed nearly everyday to walk an hour and a half.&#x0201D;</note>
&#x02014;this, alas, is what we are bound to call &#x0201C;well,&#x0201D; since better is not to be had just now. We hope to see you come back with some real improvment.</p>
<p>Mary and I are in the death throes of that miserable Saupe (or Schiller) enterprise<note n="2" noteref="587">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720916-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-16">16 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 and do hope at last to see the end of it tomorrow. In the rash, nearly vain, attempt to help poor Saupe into something of artistic improvement, I have never felt the want of fingers of my own tenth-part so much; nor seen so clearly the truth of the proverb, that one cannot make the least resemblance <pb id="pg-48-109" n="48:109"/>to a silk purse out of a sow&#x02019;s ear,&#x02014;which kind of enterprise I will not for the world attempt again.&#x02014; I have had a good deal of broken sleep too, and in the dismal mud-element, feel generally as if I were losing strength. To gain any, in whatever element, cannot now be among my rational hopes.</p>
<p>Emerson, with his eldest Daughter, as I think you knew, was here about the time of your departure, but lying <hi rend="italic">perdue</hi> [hidden] for health&#x02019;s sake. He is now gone about a week ago for Paris, Rome, Brindisi, Egypt; but reappears publicly in <date when="1873-02">February</date>, towards the nation with redoubled [word unclear].<note n="3" noteref="588">Possibly a badly written &#x0201C;energy.&#x0201D;</note>
 Young Emerson, your late guest, must be near Boston by this time,&#x02014;hastening to be married, think some. Lady Ashburton set off yesterday for Paris and Italy, under escort of little Hosmer<note n="4" noteref="589">Harriet Hosmer.</note>
 the Yankee Sculptress; Quain<note n="5" noteref="590">Dr. Richard Quain; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720802-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref></note>
 was justly urgent that she should be carried off <hi rend="italic">immediately</hi>; she carries with her a deep sense of a certain person&#x02019;s excellence as a man of business,<note n="6" noteref="591">John Forster himself; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720821-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-08-21">21 Aug.</date></ref></note>
 to say nothing of his farther or primary good qualities. This I think is nearly all our news.</p>
<p>Like all mankind, I have been reading your Life of Dickens, which came to me correctly, according to programme, and has gone finally to Dumfries some days ago.<note n="7" noteref="592">Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi> vol. 2.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Here is the Dale Park Letter; which was well worth my reading. They seem to be all heartily desirous of a visit from you;<note n="1" noteref="596">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1872-11-22">22 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;The enclosed is from Mrs Fletcher who wants me to go to Dale Park.&#x0201D; For the Fletchers, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720224-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-02-24">24 Feb.</date></ref> John wrote again, <date when="1872-12-02">2 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;No farther letter from Mrs Fletcher. I refused to go at present to Dale Park, on the score of my sleeping badly &#x00026; being unable to venture on any distant change.&#x0201D; Dale Park was in Arundel, W Sussex.</note>
 and if you did think of breaking up the stagnation of a winter wholly at Dumfries by a little change of scene, this might do very well; especially as you dont care much for the long journey; and indeed have a resting point (as you always well know I hope), which w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> break it in two, both in going and coming. Our own arrangements here are as follows, if you do not already know them. Mary goes to her place with the Taylors<note n="2" noteref="597">Peter and Clementia Taylor; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720905-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-09-05">5 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 (which really looked quite inviting and reasonable) some time about New year&#x02019;s day; Maggie Welsh has long ago engaged to be with her Brother Alick<note n="3" noteref="598">Alexander Welsh in Liverpool.</note>
 at Christmas, and after him to make her appearance when I like. I often think of the grand proposal you made some months ago,<note n="4" noteref="599">Possibly John&#x02019;s suggestion that he might come and stay with TC during the winter; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721002-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-10-02">2 Oct.</date></ref></note>
 and were I not so weak a vessel, becoming daily weaker and more in physical respects <pb id="pg-48-111" n="48:111"/>becoming a baby again, fitter for a cradle than for housekeeping, I should have come nearer a decision and declaration than I yet can.</p>
<p>Your Dale Park letter might have come four or five days sooner had it mattered much. Since Monday we are out of that unutterable Saupe business. Mary&#x02019;s clean copy finished, and only some dirty burbles lying to be settled with my own hand some day when I feel in the vein (if ever I do so again).

 with my own hand in a slow determined manner, it will still be possible I hope! But at any rate since Sunday last I have been idle altogether, &#x0201C;idle as a dry bone,&#x0201D;<note n="6" noteref="601">For TC&#x02019;s previous use of the phrase, see <ref target="volume-34/lt-18581015-TC-AC-01"><sic>34:219</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1858-10-15">15 Oct. 1858</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650614-TC-RWE-01"><sic>42:79</sic><corr>TC to RWE, <date when="1865-06-14">14 June 1865</date></corr></ref>.</note>

<p><salute>Dear Mrs Froude,</salute></p>
<p>Your letter of yesterday morning was warmly welcome to me, and I am very much obliged by your sending of it so punctually. For two weeks or more I have been totally without news from our American Missionary; didn&#x02019;t even know with any certainty where he was till two days ago,&#x02014;when a slight Note from Emerson&#x02019;s Son-in-law (the Col. Forbes<note n="1" noteref="616">William Hathaway Forbes; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720420-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-04-20">20 April</date></ref>.</note>
 who was here some months ago) informed me that he was at Boston &#x0201C;lecturing with the old success.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>The loss or delay of his letters was naturally a great affliction to him, amid the raging of the Heathen all round; but on the whole there is nothing I seriously lament, or am anxious about except his <hi rend="italic">loss of sleep</hi>. For Heaven&#x02019;s sake bid him be careful about that, take double and treble care in regard to diet and regimen, and by every method try to keep himself quiet, and as much as possible (which I doubt is not very much!) to avoid company or communing except with himself.</p>
<p>The rest of the affair, all that loud whirl-wind of Bully Burke,<note n="2" noteref="617">For Father Thomas Burke, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 Saturday Review<note n="3" noteref="618">In a review of Froude&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">The English in Ireland in the Eighteenth Century</hi> (<date when="1872">1872</date>), the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> commented, <date when="1872-11-30">30 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;It is not a History, at least if by a History we are to understand a narrative with some approach to chronological order. &#x02026; Irish affairs are apt, even without Mr. Froude&#x02019;s help, to look very like an insoluble riddle. &#x02026; <supplied>[W]</supplied>e cannot make out what is Mr. Froude&#x02019;s object in the book. &#x02026; In his picture, the native Irish, the English colonists in Ireland, the English Government at home, all treat one another in such a way that &#x02026; we certainly cannot wonder at any of them doing anything to any of the others by way of retaliation&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> 34 [<date when="1872">1872</date>]: 698&#x02013;99). In the previous issue, <date when="1872-11-23">23 Nov.</date>, declining to review the book until they had properly read it, the reviewer focused instead on an advertisement for Froude&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi> on the fly-leaf at the end of the book: &#x0201C;We have often said&#x02014;judging from the book itself&#x02014;that Mr. Froude did not set to work to write history because he had given his life to the study of history. &#x02026; <supplied>[I]</supplied>t was plain that Mr. Froude had rushed at one particular part of history without any general historical training, without even thoroughly mastering the earlier history [of his proposed period]. &#x02026; And now he tells us &#x02026; . <supplied>[h]</supplied>e wrote, not because he loved history, not because he had studied history, but because he wanted something to do &#x02026; . An escape from involuntary leisure&#x0201D; (658&#x02013;59).</note>
 and Co. both at home and abroad, I take to be, in essence, absolutely Nothing; and to deserve from him no more regard than the barking of dogs or the braying of asses. He may depend on it, what he is saying about Ireland is the genuine truth, or the nearest to it that has ever been said by any person whatever; and I hope he knows long ere this (if he like to consider it) that <pb id="pg-48-114" n="48:114"/>the truth alone <hi rend="italic">is</hi> anything, and all the circumambient balderdash and whirl-winds of nonsense tumbling round it are, and eternally remain <hi rend="italic">no</hi>-thing. Tell him I have read his Book, and know others who have read it with attention; and that their and my clear opinion is as above. To myself there is a ring in it as of clear steel; and my prophecy is that all the roaring blockheads of the world cannot prevent its natural effect on human souls. Sooner or later all persons will have to believe it.</p>
<p>My notion is, were I in his place, I would make next to no apologies or explanations, but quietly and firmly read my lectures in the pre-appointed places; and that done walk silently about my own business,<note n="4" noteref="619">Froude&#x02019;s public reception in the United States was considerably more hostile than TC realized. &#x0201C;Irish servants in hotels and private homes &#x02026; declared that either he must leave or they would. Other partisans insulted him at railway stations. His life was threatened, and a special guard had to be provided for him&#x0201D; (Waldo H. Dunn, <hi rend="italic">James Anthony Froude, a Biography</hi> [<date when="1963">1963</date>] 2:378).</note>
&#x02014;especially not to be too long in walking home again to my own hearth and known friends; there to feel [words missing]<note n="5" noteref="620">Part of the MS cut away.</note>
 and at rest.</p>
<p>[words missing] and should, with all the old acceptance, be delivered in all the appointed towns. Perhaps I told you this before, but I consider the thing to be essentially proper and even necessary. Did I tell you also, what I learnt by a hint from Emerson, that the supernaturally candid Professor in Cornell&#x02019;s University was&#x02014;Goldwin Smith,<note n="6" noteref="621">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 the illustriously acrid? No man living but himself capable of such a bit of heroism!</p>
<p>I rejoice much to hear that the children are still doing well; and that Rose herself is not suffering hitherto.<note n="7" noteref="622">Rose Mary Froude was an invalid.</note>
 What a blessing for her Father beyond the sea!&#x02014; Do not neglect sending me any news you get; letter from the place itself, F. knows how welcome it would be; but I won&#x02019;t expect, or the least bother about it, well knowing what his already botherations are.</p>

<p><salute>Dear FitzGerald,&#x02014;</salute>I am sorry to hear of all the bother you have had and of the small result yet realized. But at least you have not gone astray or accomplished <pb id="pg-48-115" n="48:115"/>any <hi rend="italic">error</hi>. The deliverance from that monumental triangle with ball surmounting ought to be reckoned as a bit of good luck.<note n="1" noteref="625">The memorial stone for the Battle of Naseby; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720615-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1872-06-15">15 June</date></ref>; FitzGerald&#x02019;s letter untraced. FitzGerald wrote, <date when="1872-08-15">15 Aug.</date>, reporting on the progress of the proposed Naseby monument; he wrote twice to the agent, Thomas Watts, sending him &#x0201C;a sketch of the Inscription and a rough Indication of the size and shape of the Stone on which it might be cut&#x0201D;; he then wrote to the Naseby Estate Trustee, <date when="1872-09-12">12 Sept.</date>, approving a design they had sent him which &#x0201C;will surely satisfy Mr. Carlyle. &#x02026; The triangular top is, I conclude, necessary to let rain run off.&#x0201D; He wrote again to the Trustee, <date when="1872-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, thanking him for the latest plan, but saying &#x0201C;I must defer to my Master Carlyle&#x02019;s wishes in this matter&#x0201D;; quoting from TC&#x02019;s letter, <date when="1872-06-15">15 June</date>, and adding on a sentence from another, untraced, letter: &#x0201C;I should guess that a good solid block of four, or four and a half, feet high would be sufficient, and that a square, or squarish, form might be the suitablest.&#x0201D; He concluded: &#x0201C;<supplied>[TC]</supplied> insists on &#x02018;the most perfect simplicity&#x02019;&#x02026; <supplied>[as]</supplied> befits the Puritan Cause&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:365, 373, 375&#x02013;76).</note>
 Courage! In a new year you will get the real plan realized into a solid stone Fact original more or less Cyclopean block original simple English inscription upon it (letters cut very deep, stone Portland) and our poor little enterprise will be comfortably completed. A thing worth doing; though we have been too long about it; and have waited till we are both of us become so stiff and hard to move from our place.</p>
<p>For my own share I am not in respect of health worse than usual; I might say almost a shade better; and am peaceably struggling through the mud element on patient and altogether idle terms. What you say of Forster is true; I find in his big Book a veritable <hi rend="italic">Photograph</hi> of all the days of the years of Dickens, which will be held in some remembrance so long as Dickens himself is considered worth remembering.<note n="2" noteref="626">FitzGerald wrote to his friend William Aldis Wright (<date when="1831">1831</date>&#x02013;<date when="1914">1914</date>) about Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Dickens</hi>, <date when="1872-12-10">10 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I suppose that (as far as Volume I goes) Dickens did tell Forster of all he did; and I find the Book written unaffectedly and justly. And (as far as Volume I goes) I <hi rend="italic">love</hi> Dickens&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:387).</note>
 Today I send you a wonderful Irish puddle of a Book properly a huge jar of <hi rend="italic">Sarpants</hi> the wonderfulest and ugliest in nature; which a good humoured loyal kind of man, much a blockhead, has been at the pains to gather: read if you can; at any rate light your pipe with the thing and let me hear no more of it. Adjoined is a Sermon from Salt Lake City and Brigham Young&#x02019;s own mouth: use that in the same way.<note n="3" noteref="627">FitzGerald wrote to Wright: &#x0201C;I have Carlyle&#x02019;s yearly (dictated, but self-signed) Letter, telling me that he is much as before&#x02014;perhaps even a &#x0201C;shade better,&#x0201D; and I think his Letter shows more vivacity than for the last three or four years. He also posts me a &#x02018;Deseret&#x02019; Newspaper (of <date when="1871">1871</date>) [<hi rend="italic">Deseret Evening News</hi>, Salt Lake City] with a real Sermon of Brigham Young in it. &#x02026; Also, a Book of Irish Atrocities &#x02026; by a Mr. FitzPatrick, who politely sends Carlyle a copy, and gets called a Blockhead for his pains. I am ordered to read, or light Pipes with, the Book&#x02014;anything but return it to Chelsea&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:387). FitzPatrick and his book unidentified further.</note>
&#x02014; Should you like to see Froude&#x02019;s Book on Ireland I will send it (an excellent work it) on the smallest hint from you; and so Adieu, dear F; my blessings and thanks be on you Always</p>

 Edinburgh and the sight of old acquaintances, some of them friends and all of them friendly will surely do you good.&#x02014; I myself am not worse in health than usual; sometimes I feel almost as if I were a little better, easier, quieter,&#x02014;which, if accurate, is surely singular.

<p>There is nothing here but rain &#x00026; mud; in my life I have not such a dark puddle of a winter: rain, incess<hi rend="italic">t</hi> deluges of rain, the very atmosphere become as if it too were of attenuated <hi rend="italic">mud</hi>;&#x02014;nor on the spiritual side, with continual &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">strikes</hi>&#x0201D; and insolent mutiny<note n="7" noteref="646">Gas stokers in London came out on strike, <date when="1872-12-01">beginning Dec.</date>, in support of a co-worker they felt to have been unjustly dismissed; after several days 1,400 strikers were sacked, others hired in their place, and many of the strikers imprisoned (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1872-12-20">20 Dec.</date>).</note>

<p><salute>My dear Friend,</salute></p>
<p>I would not have been so long in expressing to you, on my Uncle&#x02019;s part and my own, the grateful thoughts which have been entertained of you here since the 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of this month<note n="1" noteref="653">TC&#x02019;s birthday; Wellmer wrote from Zurich, <date when="1872-12-02">2 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;In my life, now so sad, there is a bright moment when I send you happy birthday wishes. &#x02026; <supplied>[G]</supplied>ood health and as much happiness as is possible. &#x02026; Most of all I would like to know what a great man like yourself thinks about people today and public affairs. The 5 million and the great victory [in the Franco-Prussian war] seem to have brought little happiness to Germany where people look for wealth and reputation rather than inner happiness. All over Germany, in cities and in the country, there seems to be dissatisfaction. It is deplorable that the best people do not seem to be in charge of this our poor country but rather second- or third-rate, or mediocre or scheming people. &#x02026; How different would it have been in Europe&#x02014;or indeed in the whole world&#x02014;if a great man, like yourself, most learned Sir, had had the <hi rend="italic">control</hi> of a great country during the last 50 years! The moral development of our superior men makes but slow progress among the mass of people in these materialistic times&#x0201D; (editor&#x02019;s trans.).</note>
&#x02014;on which day your kind letters came; but that I have <pb id="pg-48-120" n="48:120"/>been kept very busy finishing off&#x02014;that is to say re-copying &#x00026;c&#x02014;some work which he had been doing, viz: translating a German Pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Schiller und sein V&#x000E4;terliches Haus</hi>, by Saupe of Gera, which is to be added to the Life of Schiller and published early next year<note n="2" noteref="654">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720909-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720928-TC-LA-01"><date when="1872-09-28">28 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 in the cheap edition of my Uncle&#x02019;s works which is being issued and very extensively sold in England at present. It was curious to see on the Steamboats on the Clyde last Summer so many tourists and ordinary travellers with their Copy of the &#x0201C;people&#x02019;s edition&#x0201D; in their hand.</p>
<p>My Uncle&#x02019;s health is, I am glad to report to you, pretty good. I can hardly say I think him stronger then he was last year, but on the whole he keeps well in the midst of the horrible element of mud and rain we have had this winter;&#x02014;people count that we have not had a day without rain for three months;&#x02014;he takes a cold bath in the morning and then walks or almost <hi rend="italic">runs</hi> for a quarter of an hour before breakfast; then walks for an hour or an hour and a half, often with some friend, in the afternoon then has another short walk in the evening before tea,&#x02014;after and even during this meal he always reads, and he looks upon this as the most enjoyable part of his day. He takes a sleep after dinner too, and I always wrap him up with your pretty warm quilt<note n="3" noteref="655">For the quilt, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720529-TC-MW-01">TC to MW, <date when="1872-05-29">29 May</date>.</ref></note>
&#x02014;and he finds it most comfortable.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your photograph. I like it very much, but I do not think the attitude is quite so good as the other one you were so kind as send, and which I have now got fixed in to a new Scrap-Book I made up while I was idle in Scotland last summer, but I mean to put this one beside it.<note n="4" noteref="656">Wellmer sent the previous photograph with the <date when="1871">1871</date> birthday letter; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711207-TC-MW-01">TC to MW, <date when="1871-12-07">7 Dec. 1871</date></ref>. Vol. 7 of the Thomas Carlyle Photograph Albums, Columbia, lists together four images in ovals, one of Jean Aitken, and one of Jean and Mary Aitken together, and two unidentified women, both seated.

 I am not one of the people who believe that by being educated as well as men are, women will become less &#x0201C;womanly.&#x0201D; I believe the more women&#x02019;s brains are cultivated, and the more they are given their freedom and looked upon as being equal with men the more apparent will become the difference&#x02014;people shriek that they will cease to care for domestic life if possibilities of earning their livelihood apart from men, that is to say, independent of men, are allowed to them; but I not <pb id="pg-48-121" n="48:121"/>only think they will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> cease to care for domestic life, but that they will like it ten times more than if they found themselves, as is too often the case, with no alternative before them than that of &#x0201C;comfortably settling down&#x0201D; (as it is called) when that event becomes expedient in the family arrangements.<note n="6" noteref="658">Presumably Mary&#x02019;s own struggle to plan her own path had contributed to her change of attitude; for her earlier, more conventional view, also expressed to Meta Wellmer, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18701203-TC-JAC-01"><sic>47:117</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1870-12-03">3 Dec. 1870</date></corr></ref>.</note>

<p><salute>Dear Forster,</salute></p>
<p>You know how the news of your sudden illness would affect us here; and also how your ever-mindful recognition of the poor Birthday<note n="1" noteref="662">Forster&#x02019;s letter for TC&#x02019;s birthday untraced.</note>
 was received: so that on these points I need <hi rend="italic">say</hi> nothing. I ought indeed to explain my silence, which has been so complete latterly in regard to everything; but this, too, as you already guess has been the fruit of mere indolence and utter languor and torpor, produced mainly by the unexampled weather we have had,&#x02014;an element <pb id="pg-48-122" n="48:122"/>of darkness, rain and mud, day after day and week after week, such as no force of human nature with so many years as mine on its back can in the end resist. In such an element one feels at last as if the right thing were to be a <hi rend="italic">fish</hi>; mute as to one&#x02019;s own feelings and everything else! The universal noisy stupidity of men is also in such circumstances is also a notable thing; and gives rise to reflections. Patience, patience, there is no resource in anything else.</p>
<p>By the dear bit of letter we received yesterday, it is evident the Christmas at P. G. House has become impossible;<note n="2" noteref="663">Letter untraced; Forster always invited TC to Palace Gate House for Christmas dinner; he replied, <date when="1872-12-22">22 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;I can never tell you what bitter pain &#x00026; disappointment this break-up of our Xmas gives!&#x0201D;</note>
 no help for it: but I trust you will personally reappear before long, in better case than now,&#x02014;and bring your friend Lytton<note n="3" noteref="664">Edward, 1st Baron Lytton; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720802-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-08-02">2 Aug.</date></ref> TC had met Lytton (then Sir Edward Bulwer) through Forster in <date when="1839">1839</date>; see <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390311-TC-JAC-01"><sic>11:49</sic> <corr> TC to JAC, <date when="1839-03-11">11 March 1839</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-11/lt-18390326-TC-RMM-01"><sic>61</sic><corr> TC to RMM, <date when="1839-03-26">[26 March 1839]</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 with you, whom I should regret to miss seeing again. The <hi rend="italic">essence</hi> of the thing will thus be achieved; &#x00026; with that we will rest content. &#x02018;<hi rend="italic">Merry</hi> Xmas,&#x02019; alas, to some of us that is becoming a very singular adjective; still more singular the adjunct to it &#x0201C;and many of them.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>Froude is raising a dreadful disturbance in America; your prophecy about him altogether coming true. In the last two days the report was he had resolved to come home at once, and leave the inane hurly-burly to settle of itself. But today we hear from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> F. that his &#x0201C;Bureau&#x0201D; wont let him; and that he has decided to quit the Irish subject altogether and give them five Lectures on certain more pacific subjects.<note n="4" noteref="665">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-13">13 Nov.</date></ref>; the American Literary Bureau organized Froude&#x02019;s tour and wanted him to complete his planned series of lectures; but, out of concern for his own and others&#x02019; safety, he decided to leave after his final lecture in Philadelphia on <date when="1872-12-21">21 Dec.</date>; see Waldo H. Dunn, <hi rend="italic">James Anthony Froude, a Biography</hi> (<date when="1963">1963</date>) 2:387.</note>
 I wish we saw him back again safe and sound after this tremendous raid across the Border! I never could more than you see what propriety there was in taking our extremely dirty Irish linen to wash it there, and call America to see. But probably in the whole civilized history of man there is no more despicable stupid and and deplorable phenomenon than the management of Ireland by England has generally, for seven centuries, been, and now is and continues. The biggest richest and essentially the grandest Empire now under the Sun perpetually tormented with the meanest of dirty dish clouts pinned to the tail of it, which might be settled, one would think, with a comparitively small investment of human genius! The &#x0201C;Curse of Cromwell&#x0201D;<note n="5" noteref="666">Oliver Cromwell led a particularly brutal invasion of Ireland, <date when="1649">1649</date>&#x02013;<date when="1650">50</date>, massacring many thousands of Irish Catholics, banning their religion, and seizing their lands, for which his name has ever since been cursed in Ireland; see <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> 7:165.</note>
 had completely done it at one time, and is clearly the one elixir for the case,&#x02014;<hi rend="italic">un</hi>suitable for the People&#x02019;s William in a high degree.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-123" n="48:123"/>One very wet day I went by appointment to Nortons, there to have sight of Ruskin<note n="6" noteref="667">Charles Eliot Norton spent the winter of <date when="1872">1872</date>&#x02013;<date when="1873">73</date> in London with his family, staying at 33 Cleveland Square. He wrote in his journal, <date when="1872-12-13">13 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Ruskin and Carlyle came to lunch with us&#x02014;both in their sweetest and best moods. Their talk was extremely characteristic, and full of interest. I am struck more and more with the depth of Carlyle&#x02019;s sympathies, and the delicacy and keenness of his sensibility. The essential quality of his talk and Ruskin&#x02019;s alike is not so much in the words of it as in the manner and expression. &#x02026; Each was delightful with the other, and each so perfectly at ease, so entirely free from self-consciousness of any disagreeable sort, so devoid of arrogance or disposition to produce false effect, each also was so full of humour and of thought, that the talk was of the best ever heard. &#x02026; After lunch we had a Punch and Judy show before my study windows. I had engaged it for Ruskin&#x02019;s sake, for he is fond of it and of seeing the children&#x02019;s amusement at the performance. Carlyle smoked a pipe by the fireside,&#x02014;and after Punch went off, we had more talk, and at sunset, Ruskin took Carlyle home in his carriage&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:441).</note>
 after so long an absence.<note n="7" noteref="668">Ruskin was now living at Brantwood in Cumbria; their last recorded contact was in <date when="1872-08">Aug.</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721102-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-02">2 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 The Norton party, children, sister, and mother, was all very <hi rend="italic">nice</hi>,&#x02014;Norton a man I like more and more;&#x02014;Ruskin too was very good and affectionate, but I got little light out of him, except that he was fallen into thick quiet despair again on the personal question;<note n="8" noteref="669">TC presumably refers to Ruskin&#x02019;s passion for Rose La Touche (<date when="1848">1848</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875">75</date>).</note>
 and meant all the more to go ahead with fire and sword upon the universal one. James Fitz Stephen on a long walk each Sunday is the main company I have had. He is writing weekly an Article or two in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall</hi> of a considerably forge-hammer type,<note n="9" noteref="670">James Fitzjames Stephen was publishing a series of articles in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> from <date when="1872-11-05">5 Nov.</date> (later pbd. as <hi rend="italic">Liberty, Equality, Fraternity</hi> [<date when="1873">1873</date>]), attacking John Stuart Mill&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">On Liberty</hi> (<date when="1859">1859</date>) and <hi rend="italic">Utilitarianism</hi> (<date when="1863">1863</date>).

 which it would do you good to read; extremely busy upon Law too, and beating Mill&#x02019;s &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Liberty</hi>&#x0201D; into small brayed glass (in a way rather wearisome to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>); and indeed I think has a real stroke of work in him, if only he do not <hi rend="italic">over</hi>task the giant strength of muscle and heart he now has.</p>
<p>Adieu, dear Forster; don&#x02019;t let us fret about the poor spoiled Xmas; it is the will of the upper elemental Powers! Give my loving regards to the excellent little Wife; and get well yourself, were it only for her sake. <closer><salute>Ever y<hi rend="italic">rs</hi></salute></closer></p>

<p>I am glad to hear your <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> is to come upon the boards after all;<note n="1" noteref="673">Richards&#x02019;s play <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> (<date when="1847">1847</date>) had not previously been staged; opening at the Queen&#x02019;s Theatre, <date when="1872-12-22">22 Dec.</date>, it was widely reviewed, most agreeing with the verdict of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>, <date when="1872-12-23">23 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;From the dramatic point of view &#x02026; the play is hopeless.

The play was a huge popular success.</note>
 which I heard of lately will have had one good result if this ensue!</p>
<p>It would have been pleasant and interesting to me to witness the first night of your <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi><note n="4" noteref="676">The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reviewer of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> wrote, <date when="1872-12-23">23 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Whatever may be thought of the free view of history taken by Mr. W.

 had health, spirits and liberty otherwise been at my disposal; but unluckily none of these items are, and I must decline with regret your kind offer; I thought next of appointing my Niece and a little party of hers to represent me on this occasion but she too I find is specially engaged for tomorrow night.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>I am sorry to confess that there has been considerable remissness in my writing to you lately; it was not from intention you were already sure nor from want of remembering you often enough; but only from mere idleness languor obsuration &#x00026; utter stupidity,&#x02014;produced mainly by the shocking weather and general element of Mud-in-solution, which has latterly been our allowance here. 106 days, somebody counts during which we have not had one 24 hours together of dry, generally too there is darkness; no trace of the Sun discoverable; and even for idle reading one needs to sit on the sofa with one&#x02019;s back to the window here</p>
<p>Nor have I today the least thing of interesting to tell you; only the assurance that nothing sinister has happened &#x00026; that my bits of embarrassments with regard to sleep &#x00026;<hi rend="italic">c</hi> have in some degree yielded to the measures I used, and that neither my health nor anything else is sensibly worsened.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Except that our weather is much improved, and the last three days have been rainless, sometimes with a sunny sky and unusually warm for the time of year there is nothing to tell you; but your welcome letter came yesterday, and I will send a word of answer before the week ends. Things here are in <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>; Maggie Welsh is expected on Tuesday from Liverpool; and Mary goes in few days after to the Taylors, the exact day not yet fixed.<note n="1" noteref="685">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721214-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-12-14">14 Dec.</date></ref>; Tues. was <date when="1872-12-31">31 Dec.</date></note>
</p>
<p>I have not heard again from the Forsters&#x02014;though he promised to write during the Xmas week, that will be tomorrow, if he be punctual. I am afraid they are not well, especially he; he is often in the hands of Quain, and seemed very depressed on leaving me; but I still pretty firmly persuade myself that he is slowly getting better. The <hi rend="italic">Dickens</hi> has had some abuse by the penny-a-liners I believe but is selling vigorously to the extent of 16,000 John<note n="2" noteref="686">John Aitken, their nephew, who was working for Chapman &#x00026; Hall, publisher of Forster&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Dickens</hi>.</note>

 I wish he were home again out of all that inane hurly-burly.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-130" n="48:130"/>You do not again mention the John Knox monument business.<note n="4" noteref="688">John A. Carlyle wrote from Edinburgh, <date when="1872-12-11">11 Dec.</date>, that David Laing &#x0201C;was going to some disorderly committee or meeting for erection of some monument to John Knox. I advised him rather vehemently not to attend &#x02026; because Knox needs no monument, &#x00026; if he did need one, there is no possibility of getting it &#x02026; in Scotland just now.&#x0201D; Laing reluctantly chaired the first meeting, at which many different kinds of monument were discussed; the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> reported, <date when="1872-11-23">23 Nov.</date>: &#x0201C;In connection with the ter-centenary of the death of John Knox, a meeting was held yesterday afternoon &#x02026; &#x02018;to form a committee of all denominations for the purpose of raising subscriptions for a suitable memorial to John Knox, the Scottish reformer.&#x02019;&#x0201D; John Knox (ca. <date when="1514">1514</date>&#x02013;<date when="1572">72</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/15781"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Scottish religious reformer.</note>
 They sent to me (a certain Rev<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Graham of Trinity<note n="5" noteref="689">Rev. William Graham (<date when="1820">1820</date>&#x02013;<date when="1887">87</date>), minister of Newhaven Church, Trinity, Edinburgh; one of the committee members and author of <hi rend="italic">Robert Bruce and John Knox</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1873">1873</date>).</note>
 <hi rend="italic">did</hi>) to put my name on their committee, wh. I at once emphatically declined. There came afterwards some private application to Mary from the same Graham; but no answer was made,<note n="6" noteref="690">John replied, <date when="1872-12-29">29 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;You did well in emphatically refusing to have anything to do with that invitation to become a member of the committee for memorial to Knox. I have heard of the man who invited you &#x00026; then wrote to Mary. He is described as even worse &#x00026; more stupid &#x00026; obstinate than the Rogers who sought subscribers for the Wallace monument.&#x0201D; For Rev. Charles Rogers (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1890">1890</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23968"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), Church of Scotland minister and historian, and the Wallace monument, see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620827-TC-JCA-01"><sic>38:164</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1862-08-27">27 Aug. 1862</date></corr></ref>; for Rogers&#x02019;s most recent venture, the Bruce monument, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700625-TC-CROG-01"><sic>47:35&#x02013;38</sic><corr>TC to CROG, <date when="1870-06-25">25 June 1870</date></corr></ref>. John continued that Laing had told him that the recent meeting resolved &#x0201C;to appoint a committee, &#x00026; wait till &#x000A3;10,000 had been subscribed for a monument of Knox, it being taken for granted that &#x02018;many noblemen &#x00026; gentlemen would give &#x000A3;500 a piece&#x02019; for such purpose; after which the committee might decide what sort of monument it should be. &#x02026; Laing expects no &#x000A3;500 subscriptions, but still hopes that &#x02018;at least a good statue of Knox may be realized for the honour of Edinburgh,&#x02019; where there are so many statues which serve only for ostentation.&#x0201D; A statue of John Knox, by John Hutchison RSA (<date when="1832">1832</date>&#x02013;<date when="1910">1910</date>), was finally raised in New College quadrangle, <date when="1896">1896</date>, and another inside St. Giles Cathedral, <date when="1906">1906</date>, by Pittendrigh MacGillivray RSA (<date when="1856">1856</date>&#x02013;<date when="1938">1938</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/49240"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>).</note>
 nor was any to another application to myself from a Col<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Davidson<note n="7" noteref="691">Col. David Davidson; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720222-TC-DD-01">TC to DD, <date when="1872-02-22">22 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 (well known to my Aunts at Morningside):<note n="8" noteref="692">JWC&#x02019;s aunts Elizabeth and Ann Welsh; John reported, <date when="1872-12-11">11 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;Yesternight I called at Craigen Villa, &#x00026; found Miss Welsh &#x00026; Miss Anne looking unusually well. They made many minute enquiries about you &#x00026; Mary. &#x02026; Miss Anne moves about as formerly in her missionary work &#x00026; could talk infinitely about it if one could willingly listen.&#x0201D;</note>
 nothing but nonsense and disgusting vulgarity unveracity and absurdity seemed likely to result from such a movement, so originated. I dont even expect they will realize a supportable bust of Knox,&#x02014;the general belief (even Laing&#x02019;s), being in some Cnox of, I think, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Bezas Icones</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="9" noteref="693">The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> reported Laing&#x02019;s words during the initial meeting: &#x0201C;We have a portrait of Knox, published by his colleague Theodore Beza, and there can be no doubt that it has a sort of general resemblance&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-11-23">23 Nov.</date>). Theodore Beza (<date when="1519">1519</date>&#x02013;<date when="1605">1605</date>), French protestant theologian; his book <hi rend="italic">Icones</hi> (Geneva, <date when="1580">1580</date>) included a portrait of Johannes Cnoxus Giffordiensis Scotus (Knox) which TC found unbelievable; he was to include it in &#x0201C;The Portraits of John Knox&#x0201D; (<date when="1875">1875</date>), Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:313 and 318; see 127.</note>
 and total incredulity in the picture at Torphichen(?) engraved <pb id="pg-48-131" n="48:131"/>in Craiks pictorial history,<note n="10" noteref="694">The Torphichen portrait (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:opp. 330) was, according to TC, an attempt to improve on the Beza portrait, but very similar; see 128. The portrait that TC believed to be a true likeness, engraved by Benjamin Holl, was the Somerville portrait. TC noted in &#x0201C;The Portraits of John Knox&#x0201D; that he had first seen it in Charles Knight&#x02019;s publication of George L. Craik and Charles MacFarlane, <hi rend="italic">The Pictorial History of England</hi> (<date when="1849">1849</date>) 2:opp. 548; &#x0201C;as soon as possible, <supplied>[I]</supplied> had another copy of the Engraving framed and hung up beside me&#x0201D; (Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:opp. 313, 30:360); the engraving is still in Carlyle House, Chelsea; see 129. TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;The Portraits of John Knox&#x0201D; was first pbd. in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> n.s. 11 (<date when="1875-04">April 1875</date>: 407&#x02013;39; see <hi rend="italic">CL</hi> vol. 49.</note>
 which to me has always appeared the one credible or conceivable likeness of Knox. Tell me a little how that affair, if it have not altogether collapsed, is going on. I hope Laing has nothing to do with it,&#x02014;&#x02014;tho&#x02019; if it is to go on at all, he would doubtless be a salutary element.

<p>This morning I rec<hi rend="italic">d</hi> the enclosed 2 letters (cover of them nearly altogether open) wh. you will read and send to Jean and the rest of the kindred in that region. Tom&#x02019;s<note n="1" noteref="698">Their nephew Thomas Carlyle.</note>

<p><pb id="pg-48-132" n="48:132"/>Between 12 &#x00026; 1, <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> than was to be expected, your own letter was handed in; and pleasantly interrupted the reading of a dull <hi rend="italic">Life of Raleigh</hi><note n="3" noteref="700">James Augustus St. John (<date when="1795">1795</date>&#x02013;<date when="1875">1875</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/24498"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), <hi rend="italic">Life of Sir Walter Raleigh</hi>, 2 vols. (<date when="1868">1868</date>).</note>
 I was engaged in, and have now concluded. It is by one St. John, of Chapman&#x02019;s publishing, a gloomy haggly intemperate dim &#x00026; boisterous piece of writing; wh. for almost sole result has left some faint notion in me of looking into Raleigh&#x02019;s Works,&#x02014;if perhaps one&#x02019;s spirits rose to such a pitch sooner or later!&#x02014; Your account of the Knox Memorial is completely satisfactory. I conclude <hi rend="italic">no</hi> result will be the issue, not even a portrait of Knox that is not worse than nothing. I have now another little matter to trouble you with proceeding from Norton the worthy American you know of in reference to the Harvard Bequest of Books.<note n="4" noteref="701">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721102-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-02">2 Nov.</date></ref></note>
 Norton called the other day, on behalf of a message he has had from Childs Editor of the Collection of Scottish Ballads wh. you used to think so well done;<note n="5" noteref="702">Francis James Child (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1896">96</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/57878"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), U.S. scholar, philologist, and folklorist, prof. of rhetoric and oratory at Harvard; he was an authority on early English literature, publishing various works on the subject, including <hi rend="italic">English and Scottish Ballads</hi>, 8 vols. (Boston, <date when="1857">1857</date>&#x02013;<date when="1859">59</date>). He was a close friend of Charles Eliot Norton. Norton wrote in his journal, <date when="1872-12-28">28 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;In the afternoon went to see Carlyle. Miss Bromley Davenport &#x02026; was sitting with him. Carlyle was most pleasant&#x0201D;; in his letter to Ruskin, <date when="1872-12-29">29 Dec.</date>, he described TC as &#x0201C;very well, and very beautiful his sweet, stern, rugged old face&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:449 and 451).</note>
 Childs appears in America too to be regarded as a man of real merit. He is now about publishing an improved &#x00026; enlarged edition of said Ballads;<note n="6" noteref="703">Child was working on a definitive collection of ballads, and was requesting information from scholars all over the world, which would result in his master work, <hi rend="italic">The English and Scottish Popular Ballads</hi>, 5 vols. (Boston, <date when="1882">1882</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898">98</date>).</note>
 &#x00026; Norton&#x02019;s object here was to see if I could give him, or direct him to, any list of Scottish Schoolmasters; to all of whom Childs was anxious that a printed set of queries on this subject should be sent, soliciting their best assistance in the matter. I c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> only answer that in all probability there was such a list somewhere, and that I should by the first opportunity write and ascertain. I wish you would therefore someday, if you do not yourself already know about the thing mention it to Gordon,<note n="7" noteref="704">John Gordon, old friend of both TC and John A. Carlyle.</note>
 and instruct me what is to be done. There is no manner of hurry, Norton told me; perhaps some fortnight yet before anything can be done in it from <hi rend="italic">this</hi> end of the chain: only let us be sure to have some definite word ready for him when he applies again.</p>
<p>There is no word yet from Forster,<note n="8" noteref="705">Forster wrote, <date when="1872-12-31">31 Dec.</date>: &#x0201C;This day week &#x02026; if all go as at present, I hope we shall be moving homeward. &#x02026; We have gone on quietly here of late: suffering much from cough at all hours, but not otherwise disturbed.&#x0201D;</note>
 wh. raises a little uneasiness as to his state of health. I must enquire again within a day or two if nothing come. M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren has got a sore throat (probably the fruit of Xmas dinner &#x00026;c); by <pb id="pg-48-133" n="48:133"/>aid of the common recipes things look better this morning.

 I had yesterday a long walk not with James Stephen alone but with him &#x00026; John Strachey<note n="10" noteref="707">Sir John Strachey had served with Stephen on the Indian Legislative Council.</note>
 together wh. was considerably more comfortable to me. Strachey, a brown little fellow of evident energy, tho&#x02019; his cheeks are a little baggy is Leading Member of the Indian Council, and has got home for a 15 months of furlough. Last time I remember to have seen him was as a bright black-eyed little Boy at Shooter&#x02019;s Hill, some 48 years ago!<note n="11" noteref="708">Strachey was the fifth son of the Carlyles&#x02019; old friends Edward and Julia Strachey; for TC&#x02019;s memories of the Strachey family and their home at Shooter&#x02019;s Hill, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 283&#x02013;85.</note>

<p><salute>My dear Brother</salute></p>
<p>This morning I was a little disappointed that there came no letter from you; but Mary suggested there would be something by afternoon Post; &#x00026; here accordingly your letter is, &#x00026; along with it a complete solution of the Norton <hi rend="italic">Schoolmaster Problem</hi>:<note n="1" noteref="715">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1873-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, replying to C. E. Norton&#x02019;s inquiry about Scottish schoolmasters for ballad-collector F. J. Child to contact; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721230-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-12-30">30 Dec. 1872</date></ref>. John wrote: &#x0201C;I applied to Gordon for the list of schoolmasters in Scotland, &#x00026; he has given me a big report that Mr Childs could hardly understand. But I have today myself found a more complete list of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, &#x00026; also of Free Church Schoolmasters (some of whom like our acquaintance Johnstone of Dunfermline might be able to give more information of the kind Mr Childs wants than any belonging to the Established Church); &#x00026; it will be quite intelligible at first sight.&#x0201D; The Free Church of Scotland broke away in <date when="1843">1843</date> from the established Church of Scotland.

 for all which many thanks to you. I shall now be able to meet Norton any day; or will probably send him the excellent little Almanac itself that he may study it before beginning.</p>
<p>The want of the Post-town may prove a little hindrance; but it is irremediable by any method visible to me; &#x00026; of course the name of the County <hi rend="italic">town</hi><note n="2" noteref="716">The almanac apparently listed schoolmasters by county rather than by town or village.</note>

 as you see drives the pen for me in her stead. I wish to send you this small notice, round by Dumfries; which will bring it you on Monday Morning.<note n="4" noteref="718">John replied, <date when="1873-01-06">6 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;I have received your letter this morning from Dumfries. &#x02026; . No time was lost by sending it round that way, for we have no delivery here on Sundays.&#x0201D;</note>
 We have the same wild blusterous weather as you; this or <pb id="pg-48-135" n="48:135"/>some other set of bad circumstances has of late begun to interfere with me a little, &#x00026; ever since Monday last I have been considerably bothered (though nothing like so much as sometimes in years past) for want of sleep &#x00026;c.; but at last by aid of my two friends Blue pill &#x00026; Castor I hope I have got the victory again. I often feel as if this winter I were a little <hi rend="italic">clearer</hi> than common, but also in the same degree weaker &#x00026; more sensitive.</p>
<p>I am perfectly idle latterly; &#x00026; do or attempt nothing but reading;&#x02014;&#x02014;sometimes with some result of edification; oftenest with none or the reverse of any. Lecky&#x02019;s attack on Froude you will by this time have seen in a copy of your own;<note n="5" noteref="719">W. E. H. Lecky, &#x0201C;Mr. Froude&#x02019;s English in Ireland,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> 27 (<date when="1873-01">Jan. 1873</date>) 246&#x02013;64. John wrote, <date when="1873-01-03">3 Jan.</date>, that he had read the article.</note>
 I meant as you would no doubt understand that the Macmillan was for Dumfries when you were done with it.</p>
<p>Lecky&#x02019;s article is decently &#x00026; clearly written, with earnestness too but of a very shrill &#x00026; shallow sort, &#x00026; will do in the way of confuting Froude simply nothing. With respect to that poor heresy of Might being the symbol of Right to a certain &#x0201C;Great &#x00026; Venerable Author&#x0201D; I shall have to tell Lecky one day that quite the converse or <hi rend="italic">re</hi>verse is the &#x0201C;Great &#x00026; Venerable Author&#x02019;s&#x0201D; real opinion, namely, that Right is the eternal symbol of Might,&#x02014;as I hope that he one day, descending miles &#x00026; leagues beyond his penny-a-liner philosophy<note n="6" noteref="720">Lecky, born in Ireland and a passionate advocate for that country, began his attack on Froude with a condemnation of Froude&#x02019;s &#x0201C;might equals right&#x0201D; principles, which were derived from TC: &#x0201C;The character of a writer is one thing. The principles he advocates are quite another, and nothing which is here written about the latter is intended to cast reflection upon the former. &#x02026; No system can strike more directly at the root of all that is noble and generous in human nature than this deification of success, this worship of force as the incarnation of right, this hatred of all that is weak and of all that is unsuccessful. &#x02026; It has led one great and venerable writer to make Frederick William a hero. &#x02026; It has made another great writer <supplied>[Froude]</supplied>, the panegyrist of Henry VIII., the apologist for the use of judicial torture, and the author of one of the most uncompromising defences of religious persecution it has ever been our fortune to peruse&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Macmillan&#x02019;s</hi> 247). John replied, <date when="1873-01-06">6 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;Lecky&#x02019;s article as you remark is nothing more than an excellent specimen of penny-a-lining, &#x00026; he will probably make amends for it by writing something better whenever he comes to sounder information.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Penny-a-liner&#x0201D;: a writer for hire or a hack; Lecky was a historian, possibly a populizer of others&#x02019; ideas, but not a journalist writing for a living.</note>
 will with amazement &#x00026; real gratification perhaps one day discover if he be a good boy; &#x00026; in fact that he probably never met with a son of Adam more contemptuous of &#x02018;Might,&#x02019; except when it rests on the above origin.</p>
<p>Poor Lecky he is really a good giraffe of a creature quite of graminivorous character not of carnivorous at all; &#x00026; is living in terror &#x00026; tremor<note n="7" noteref="721">Lecky was tall and thin, with disjointed limbs and a long nose, rather shy and gentle, so maybe he resembled a giraffe.</note>
 just now about the deadly offence that he thinks he has committed against Froude,&#x02014;offence like that of the vehement Navvie, Navvie declaring that as it was a <pb id="pg-48-136" n="48:136"/>comfort to her it did <hi rend="italic">him</hi> no conceivable mischief.<note n="8" noteref="722">Unexplained.</note>
 Poor James Baillie we heard last night is believed to be dying.<note n="9" noteref="723">James Baillie, JWC&#x02019;s impoverished cousin to whom TC regularly sent money (see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710411-TC-WILL-01"><sic>47:187</sic><corr>TC to WILL, <date when="1871-04-11">11 April 1871</date></corr></ref>), was to d. in <date when="1873">1873</date>.</note>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Within the last week or ten days I have had two short letters from you; one of them accompanying a much long longer<note n="1" noteref="726">Thus in MS.</note>
 one from my Nephew Tom, which last gave me a great deal of satisfaction,&#x02014;so minute and clear was its account of many things concerning you all not clearly known to me before.&#x02014; Pray tell Tom of this; and that I feel as if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> should be the individual replied to; but that he must excuse me for taking you as the one I am used to from of old! another time I hope to use him better; and in the meantime wish he w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> try me again with a new letter like the last.</p>
<p>Your account of poor old John&#x02019;s death,<note n="2" noteref="727">Their half-brother John; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721207-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-12-07">7 Dec. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 though very brief, was very touching to me and abundantly clear. A death from weary, old age alone; no disease visible, only a tabernacle wornout with 80 years of work, and the wheel at the cistern falling slower &#x00026; slower till at length it silently stops. The way of all the earth; none of us will escape it, and to some of us it naturally seems close at hand. We have only to say, in such dialect as we have, God&#x02019;s just and holy Will be done.</p>
<p>I forget when it was I last wrote to you, dear Brother; but suppose that since last Autumn you have heard little special of my history; and therefore I will begin there. John and I, after his return from France, escaped out of the sultry whirlpool of London down to the Southern coast of Devonshire<note n="3" noteref="728">Seaforth Lodge, Seaton, Devonshire; TC and John A. Carlyle stayed there from mid-July until the end of <date when="1872-08">Aug. 1872</date>.</note>
 (London smoke following us perceptibly for the first 30 miles; but the rest of the country green and beautiful as you can anywhere see). We went to a grand <pb id="pg-48-137" n="48:137"/>little Cottage overhanging the salt water; a place belonging to Lady Ashburton,&#x02014;where, in <date when="1865">1865</date>, I and Another,<note n="4" noteref="729">TC and JWC visited Seaforth Lodge <date when="1865-03">March 1865</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720620-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1872-06-20">20 June 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 not now here, made our last considerable visit in this world; you may conceive my thoughts on coming back to it again after such a 7 years as I have had! But we need not speak of that. I will say only that, in spite of my weakness, I walked a great deal, John oftenest accompanying; that the splendid cottage was by no means proportionately adapted for lodging a weak old man, liable to great misery from sounds and the like; and that there, as everywhere, though the kindness shown us was supreme, one daily needed all the &#x0201C;philosophy&#x0201D; one had; however I managed to get down every morning to the sea side; where you could bathe at any hour, and there had a hearty <hi rend="italic">swash</hi> in the sea, as the first thing done for the day. In the course of 2 weeks or so I began to perceive some influence from this practice, and before the end of the month, wh. was the limit of our stay there, I had judged it was an influence for good;&#x02014;wh. I continue still to think it. The only kind of medical appliance that for the last 20 years has had any effect upon me at all. John staid with me a while after our return hither; after which he went to Dumfries &#x00026; from there I believe you have more than once heard of him and from him. Of our other kindred the acc<hi rend="italic">ts</hi> are generally good; to the effect &#x0201C;going on as usual.&#x0201D; Brother Jamie is reported as going &#x00026; coming between Scotsbrig and Craigenputtock; &#x00026; rather in better health than has been usual for long years back. The Austins are very anxious about the new lease of their farm, wh. falls vacant next year: I always hope they will get the place again; but a painful uncertainty lies in such things. They have been prospering; they and most farmers, I understand, of late years, except the last one wh. has been very unfavourable in all parts of this country. Such a winter of rain I have never in my life seen; &#x00026; in Scotland last year the people were generally comparing the season to that of <date when="1815">1815</date>,&#x02014;which you and the rest of us dismally, though with a pathetic beauty in it too, so well remember in Mainhill!<note n="5" noteref="730">Mainhill, Hoddam parish, Dumfriesshire, where TC&#x02019;s father farmed <date when="1815">1815</date>&#x02013;<date when="1826">26</date>. The eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia, <date when="1815-04">April 1815</date>, produced an ash cloud which caused global cooling; many crops failed that summer, which was followed by a cold and wet winter, and a cold and wet summer in <date when="1816">1816</date>, causing much hardship and famine. Date probably <date when="1815">1815</date> on MS, altered from <date when="1816">1816</date>.</note>
&#x02014; For myself, dear Brother, I have only to say that there has no work come out of me whatever, except an accidental &#x00026; very simple bit of addition to the Life of Schiller; which, if my right hand had been my own, I could have finished in 5 or 6 days, though to poor Mary and me it cost 7 or 8 weeks of a very confused labour! This inability to write with my own right hand is a heavy calamity at present, and prevents all literary labour, of which otherwise I were now and then perhaps capable.&#x02014;I think I must send you that pitiful bit <pb id="pg-48-138" n="48:138"/>of addition to Schiller, or rather the Schiller volume altogether. It is to come out next month,<note n="6" noteref="731">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720909-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-09">9 Sept. 1872</date></ref>; Chapman &#x00026; Hall announced, <date when="1873-03-01">1 March</date>: &#x0201C;The LIFE of SCHILLER.

 soon after the end of February I expect you may have it.</p>
<p>The D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is in Edinburgh at present; some three weeks ago or more he went off thither to vary a little the rainy and muddy monotony of his life at Dumfries, where he has almost no society except within the house; in Edinburgh he is extremely popular; dines out almost every day; and complains rather of too much society than of anything else. He will probably stay there a week or two longer; the rather as there is now singularly bright weather; and paved towns are all trim and clean, though the country is still drowned in mud, and great part of the middle of England especially is a lake of water from overflowing of the rivers. Winter wheat is said to be all rotted; potatoes were a bad crop too, and between the farmers and their labourers there is rising everywhere a trouble, which it will be difficult to settle.<note n="7" noteref="732">In its review of the year, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported: &#x0201C;The extraordinary rainfall which has now lasted for seven months has been a grave drawback to the general prosperity. &#x02026; In the month of June there were heavy floods in many parts of the country, and the harvest was deficient both in quantity and quality. The consequent loss will be greatly aggravated by the unprecedented wetness of the Autumn, which has rendered it impossible to sow wheat except in the lighter soils. The potato crop was the worst for six-and-twenty years. &#x02026; Between bad weather and Labourers&#x02019; Unions, farmers have not enjoyed a cheerful year&#x0201D; (<date when="1872-12-31">31 Dec. 1872</date>).</note>
 Times not bright here at all, more than elsewhere!</p>
<p>Try if you can persuade your Tom to write to me again.

 &#x00026; probably there will be some specific tidings<note n="9" noteref="734">Word inserted in TC&#x02019;s hand.</note>
 got by him before long. I send my blessing, if it were worth anything, to you and all of them, my ever-dear Brother. Well may you fare, &#x00026; brave may y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> lives be, yonder far over the sea!&#x02014; Before very long, I hope to write to you once again.

<p><salute>My dear Lady</salute></p>
<p>I am very impatient to hear some news of you; &#x00026; no wonder, for it is many weeks since your second &#x00026; last letter came. Mine, in answer to it, I rather doubt doubt<note n="1" noteref="746">Word repeated in error.</note>
 if you could read; the day when I wrote was excessively dark, &#x00026; before finishing it I had lost light very nearly altogether, &#x00026; had to go <hi rend="italic">by grope</hi>.</p>
<p>Mary went away to her new place<note n="2" noteref="747">Mary was going as a teacher at Clementia and Peter Taylor&#x02019;s school, Aubrey House, Camden Hill; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720529-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-05-29">29 May 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 two days ago greatly to her own regret, poor little Soul, &#x00026; also to mine had there been any remedy; but I could find none. My persuasion is that this separation will have good results for both of us, especially for her. I never saw a creature kinder to me than she evidently is, or intends to be; I was much struck with the magnanimity &#x00026; clear <hi rend="italic">stoicism</hi> of her taking her departure. Miss Welsh, as you doubtless discern is now my ready writer &#x00026; companion: she had already been here some ten or twelve days, Mary&#x02019;s new place not being quite ready; her kindness to me also is constant &#x00026; unlimited, &#x00026; we hope to have a <hi rend="italic">quieter</hi> house henceforth than latterly.</p>
<p>Almost before my letter had gone to you I discovered that Palazzo Orango <hi rend="italic">was</hi> verily the Hanbury Villa where I had wished you to be. It is no doubt by far the comfortablest English residence on all the <hi rend="italic">Cornice</hi>,<note n="3" noteref="748">Corniche (from the Italian &#x0201C;cornice&#x0201D;), road on the side of a cliff; the Hanbury estate (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721214-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-12-14">14 Dec. 1872</date></ref>) was on the lowest corniche; there were two other higher corniches also running above the coast, SE France, past Menton (where TC had stayed) into Italy.</note>
 &#x00026; I have all along been hoping that the good weather &#x00026; it, &#x00026; the profound composure that environs it may have been silently doing you good all this time. Nobody had more need of rest; &#x00026; nowhere in all the world could you have found (I suppose) a <pb id="pg-48-141" n="48:141"/>more perfect resting place. My hope is that you won&#x02019;t stir from it till all the inundations &#x00026;c are <hi rend="italic">absorbed again</hi>, &#x00026; the season fairly got to be inviting.</p>
<p>We have had here such a winter for rain as was never seen by the oldest inhabitant. England in general has become a Continent of mud, &#x00026; in the midland Counties hundreds of square miles are lying now as lakes; the winter wheat was all rotted, &#x00026; a bad outlook for the next year&#x02019;s farmer! Twisleton<note n="4" noteref="749">Edward Twisleton.</note>
 told me lately as the latest bit of ham-strung wit on the part of English hunters &#x00026; their Meet at Burton-on-Trent that the Advertizement now ought to be &#x0201C;Trent-on-Burton&#x0201D;:<note n="5" noteref="750">Burton is a town on the river Trent in Staffordshire, in the middle of England.</note>
&#x02014;very ham-strung indeed.&#x02014; For my own share I have had a most dim, oppressive &#x00026; depressive element to live in (the want of light especially a grievance); but have not essentially suffered in health from it: I figure myself in general as being perhaps a little <hi rend="italic">clearer</hi> than last year, but also perceptibly weaker; as regard to sleep I have had no unusual difficulties, nay, I should say rather less than usual.</p>
<p>The pouring deluges do at least tend to abate noise! The worst item in my affairs is that I cannot myself write; and am thereby reduced to a Life definable as one of perfect idleness, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> a good deal of botheration, which, day by day fails not. My one employment is reading,&#x02014;lucky if it be in good books; but these I think are about as rare as good people!&#x02014;</p>
<p>A while ago there came to me from Ashridge<note n="6" noteref="751">Ashridge, Hertfordshire, family estate of Adelbert Wellington Brownlow Cust, 3d earl Brownlow; his wife, Lady Adelaide, had invited TC to visit the previous spring; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720413-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-04-13">13 April 1872</date></ref>. Lady Adelaide was the younger sister of Lady Lothian, widow of William Robert Kerr, Lord Lothian; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700710-TC-RDK-01"><sic>47:41</sic><corr>TC to RDK <date when="1870-07-10"></date></corr></ref>.</note>
 a very kind invitation to join for two or three days a most eligible looking party (Kers mostly with Lady Marion<note n="7" noteref="752">Lady Marian Alford, Lord Brownlow&#x02019;s mother.</note>
 etc.) which the young Countess had assembled round her there: She was very gracious and winning, but I absolutely durst not go. I have heard nothing more, nor seen anything of Lady Marion or her environment since then. I trust always the Great Lady is all vigilant upon your quack Architect &#x00026; his Edifice in Knightsbridge.<note n="8" noteref="753">Kent House, Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s new house, designed by Henry Clutton.</note>
 I see that Edifice enveloped in clouds &#x00026; rain now &#x00026; then from under the brim of my hat; but can only offer a silent prayer as to what is going on in the inside there.</p>
<p>Poor Forster has been at Torquay all this while, amid incessant rains and winds; &#x00026; only got home two days ago, instead of two days before Christmas, as his fixed purpose was. The consequence is (not an important one) that we have to eat our &#x0201C;Christmas Dinner&#x0201D; at Palace-Gate House next Monday! that is literally the fact; it being a sacred object with Forster <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to omit for any consideration under Heaven one Christmas dinner with me while we live. He <pb id="pg-48-142" n="48:142"/>has been and still is suffering an immense deal of physical misery, incessant coughing, want of sleep &#x00026;c. &#x00026;c.&#x02014;yet I always struggle to persuade myself that there has nothing deep gone wrong with him, &#x00026; that by degrees deliverance from toil will bleach him white again. He is always upon the inquiry as to the amiable Lady Ashburton &#x00026; Her affairs,&#x02014;but that Amiable Lady may herself know how unsatisfactory my replies are!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Froude is expected home from America next week. He has stirred up such an Irish tempest in America &#x00026; at home here as was never seen before; but all that he has said seems to me the indubitable truth <hi rend="italic">said for the first time</hi>; &#x00026; I feel certain all manner of good will come of it by-&#x00026;-bye.</p>
<p>My brother John is shifted to Edinburgh some weeks ago to vary the wet monotony of Dumfries, but is not likely, I think, to stay many days more,&#x02014;there being <hi rend="italic">too many</hi> dinners there.&#x02014; He reports of the Knox Monument project that it originates with scrubby, noisy persons, utters a great deal of noisy &#x00026; impracticable nonsense for itself, &#x00026; is expected to break down shortly into ruin and silence.</p>
<p>Here has entered the inimitable Allingham! the paper too is done &#x00026; the time.&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014; Do please send me at once a long &#x00026; precise account of how you are, what you are doing &#x00026; what you propose to do.</p>
<p>A thousand regards to that bonnie Bairn &#x00026; perpetual good wishes. Always Dear Lady,</p>

<p><salute>Dear James</salute></p>
<p>We were shocked &#x00026; astonished to hear of your strange &#x00026; perilous accident of which my Sister Mary sent us the first even slight description we had got. It seems next door to a miracle that you escaped with life! We heard from the first that there was no breaking of bones or other injury counted serious; but that you had got to Craigenputtock safe after such a hair-breadth escape.</p>
<p>The meaning of my writing you a word today is that we wish, all of us, to hear more specifically from yourself what the accident really consisted in, &#x00026; how it came about,&#x02014;for example if you <hi rend="italic">leapt</hi> or fell straightforward, &#x00026; whether towards the Villagewards side of that Bridge, or the opposite side; whether you were at once noticed, or how notice was had; in short all the particulars <pb id="pg-48-143" n="48:143"/>that you can find time to write to us. This is the first thing wanted; &#x00026; the second, which we still more pressingly want is, to hear from yourself what injuries you have received; &#x00026; what the progress of amendment, or prospects of such, accurately are.<note n="1" noteref="755">James Carlyle replied, <date when="1873-01-14">14 Jan.</date>, that he was taking his rams to Scotsbrig to be wintered there; usually this would be done by the shepherd, but as the shepherd&#x02019;s sister (neither identified further) was getting married, James took them, driving them from Craigenputtoch to Auldgirth Station, then taking them by train to Cummertrees Station, <date when="1872-12-31">31 Dec.</date>; James intended spending the night at The Gill, driving the sheep to Scotsbrig the next day. He wrote: &#x0201C;On arrival [at Cummertrees Station] the night being very dark &#x00026; foggy the train was stopped before the Engine quite reached the Platform and while the Break-Van (in which I was seated) was a few yards nearer Dumfries than the top of the bridge across the road from Annan to Dumfries. &#x02026; I therefore got out, thinking from the appearance of the station light that I was much nearer than the position above described. I had a sheep-dog with a cord round its neck the other end of which was firmly tied round the middle of my walking stick and thinking we should be safer on the side than the middle of the Railway I walked in a slightly slanting direction right over the bridge taking the dog with me. The Breaksman, who left the Van just before me, was walking down by the side of his Wagons and turned his light to see which way I had gone and shouted &#x02018;Mind the Bridge there&#x02019;!&#x02014;but I had begun to descend on the side of the Bridge next the Village and landed in the rib of the road which would be &#x02018;left hand&#x02019; going up to the Gill. I must have landed half on my back &#x00026; right side. I was quite sensible and felt my cheek laying in mud and heard the sound I made in recovering my breath. I was soon surrounded by several men with lamps and young James Austin who was waiting for me at the Station. &#x02026; James went for the Gig and took me to the Gill. Got a Doctor from Annan, who said no bones were broken and prescribed fomentation with hot water for an hour at a time. By 4 am. I was sitting up in bed writing notes in pencil to John at Scotsbrig and to my Father &#x00026; Kate here. / The bridge is 22 feet high I have been informed without parapet of any kind. That I sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> have fallen from such a height and travelled from the Gill to Craigenputtock &#x02026; within a week is really marvellous. My head must have been saved by a hard felt hat I wore and the rim of which was broken on the right side. / My right shoulder and right loin are still sore; but I can walk about a little on hard ground with two sticks. I have never been sick and have been able to take food quite well considering I that have been confined to the house.&#x0201D;</note>
 This is all my request at present dear James:&#x02014;</p>
<p>Our own state here is quite the usual one (except that Mary is gone to her new place, &#x00026; that Miss Welsh is here in her stead); &#x00026; in point of health, sleep &#x00026;c. I cannot call myself below par, nor much above it either.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the excellent grouse &#x00026;c., which were very wholesome eating. We wish you in the language of the Season a <hi rend="italic">luckier</hi> year than the last has been.</p>

<p>Your strong <hi rend="italic">pouch</hi> of one envelope brought us the precious letters quite safe;<note n="1" noteref="757">For JWC&#x02019;s letters to Susan Stirling, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730108-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-01-08">8 Jan.</date></ref></note>
 Maggie is busy copying them. They are naturally of the tenderest interest to me; very beautiful, very mournful, and bring back into clearness of an almost preternatural sort the days that are for ever gone. Most of the letters are undated, indeed all of them, except some of those that have covers: but I can recollect nearly every event they touch upon, &#x00026; by dint of strict search among the documents here, Maggie &#x00026; I ought to get an accurate or approximate date for almost all of them.</p>
<p>Mrs Stirling shall soon have the letters back; in the meanwhile if she could recollect for us the dates of her several visits to London, of her first acquaintance with us (at Edinburgh in <date when="1833">1833</date>?); at any rate, of her own marriage and removal from Dundee to Edinburgh,<note n="2" noteref="758">JWC apparently first met Susan Hunter (before her marriage) during the five months the Carlyles spent in Edinburgh, <date when="1833-01">Jan.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1833-05">May 1833</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330506-JWC-SS-01"><sic>6:383&#x02013;84</sic><corr>JWC to SS, <date when="1833-05-06">6 May 1833</date></corr></ref>.

<p>The thin book sent herewith is a gift to me from Norton, &#x00026; tells its own story.

 to you, if you have it not already, it will doubtless be of interest, even more than it was to me; &#x00026; if you care to have it, please consider it as yours,&#x02014;subject to my possible but not very probable asking you for a loan of it. It seemed to me that the actual face of Dante might fairly be considered to be in all likelihood actually represented to us by that mask, coupled with that Giotto.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-145" n="48:145"/>Mary has gone to Brighton with her new people, &#x00026; seems to like them well; the only drawback seems to be she is much held to the side of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor, with perhaps little of importance to do; but perhaps this too will mend when they come to their place in London &#x0201C;about a week hence.&#x0201D;</p>
<p>For the last three nights I have been unlucky in my sleep, worst of all last night, when our <hi rend="italic">inevitable Christmas dinner</hi> came off: the dinner itself with Norton for company was altogether wholesome &#x00026; pleasant &#x00026; harmless;<note n="4" noteref="760">Norton wrote about the dinner in his journal, <date when="1873-01-13">13 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;Dined with Forster&#x02014;Carlyle, Miss Welsh &#x02026; and Miss Hogarth, the only other guests. Forster much better than before his late stay at Torquay, but I fear he will never be well again. &#x02026; Carlyle talked excellently of many things, and he and Forster are such old friends that it is pleasant to see them together&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:457). He saw TC again a few days later, recording in his journal, <date when="1873-01-17">17 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;He was in a most pleasant mood;&#x02014;as I grow familiar with him &#x02026; his character becomes more and more open and delightful. &#x02026; He is one of the most sympathetic of men. &#x02018;I&#x02019;ve not had much sleep since I last saw ye. It&#x02019;s an old complaint, and I&#x02019;m wonted to it. That dinner at Forster&#x02019;s gave the finishin&#x02019; stroke &#x02026; I did not get to sleep till six o&#x02019; the clock next morning. And one&#x02019;s troubled with all kinds o&#x02019; whirlin&#x02019; thoughts in the long nights; spectres and hobgoblins, that won&#x02019;t be laid by any exorcisms, dance a wild reel through one&#x02019;s head&#x02019;&#x0201D; (1:458).</note>
 but I had been ruined two days before, by dining on boiled mutton &#x00026; eating a slobbery spoonful of boiled onion &#x00026;c. (much against my will too)! Last night&#x02019;s dinner brought all this to a crisis. Pity me as proprietor of certainly the worst <pb id="pg-48-146" n="48:146"/>stomach in the world, amongst my other wonderful gifts! For the present again I hope the crisis is over.

Please send the letter back as soon as convenient, &#x00026; I will answer it, &#x00026; do whatever is best to help James.&#x0201D; He wrote, <date when="1873-01-15">15 Jan.</date>: &#x0201C;I asked you to return James&#x02019;s letter which spoke of his application for a situation at Hamilton where Mary Hanning&#x02019;s husband is, &#x00026; I wanted to know what you thought would be possible in trying to help him.&#x0201D;</note>
 I think I had already said, that in whatever thing you could do for him, I would cheerfully go halves. Farming seems to be what he most affects: you might ask cautiously whether he could find no location of that sort near his Father&#x02019;s place; &#x00026; signify that in such case we two would be willing to help if it seemed wise.

You must just exercise your own best judgment, dear Brother; &#x00026; understand that in whatever help, or cautions delay of help, you may decide upon, I will stand good. Perhaps there may be some occupation, like a general apprenticeship to business in Hamilton itself, which might do the worthy</p>

<p><salute>My dear Miss Wellmer,</salute></p>
<p>Pray excuse me for not answering your Letter sooner; but as the question in it was for my Uncle, not for me, I could not answer it till I had seen my Uncle; I saw him last week and showed him your Letter (which I had received down here). He said he himself was very fond of animals&#x02014;and was always kind to them when they came in his way. But he would not care to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> anything on the subject&#x02014;for he thinks they have a position in this world in many cases superior to that of human beings. He is sorry you have taken to vegetarianism<note n="1" noteref="777">Meta Wellmer wrote in her birthday letter to TC, <date when="1872-12-02">2 Dec. 1872</date> (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721214-MA-MW-01">MA to MW, <date when="1872-12-14">14 Dec. 1872</date></ref>): &#x0201C;<supplied>[I]</supplied>n these last years I would like to write for like-minded persons a few articles on vegetarianism and animal welfare organisations, subjects that lie very close to my heart&#x0201D; (editor&#x02019;s trans.).

 for he thinks it must of necessity hurt your health&#x02014;he says that he himself would feel like the horse which his master had taught to live on a pile of corn a day&#x02014;but just when the horse had completely learned to live on this it died! I can not argue on the subject myself for I have not thought of it much&#x02014;when one thinks of the slaughtering of the animals for the use of man it is very disgusting; and yet it is clear that we cannot live without animal food&#x02014;at least from my own experience I should say it was a complete impossibility for a race of sturdy men and women to be reared on vegetables alone. I knew a family of children who had been so brought up&#x02014;they having a slight tendency to consumption&#x02014;and they died off one by one before they got to the age of 5 and 20. You will say that might have happened in any case; but my Uncle who is a physician said there was not the smallest doubt that they died from the want of animal food&#x02014;that their frames were so weak they c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> stand no stress at all. But perhaps you think we ought to run the risk for the sake of the Animals&#x02019; Lives. Death is appointed to every one; and if a bullock meets its death a little sooner than it would naturally do&#x02014;it escapes the tortures of old age&#x02014;and does not suffer more but rather less.</p>
<p>My Uncle is pretty well at present&#x02014;he said I was to send all sorts of kind messages to you and to say that he would have liked to comply with your request it he had been able.</p>
<p>With best regards, dear Miss Wellmer, and the hope that I may hear from you again before very long.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother</salute></p>
<p>Long ago I well meant to have written to you, but this last week has been of such bitterly bad weather, that I have fallen (being bothered on the score of sleep too) into a marked increase of languour, dis-spiritment, &#x00026; in fact for very laziness have been incapable of doing anything at all, but sit &#x00026; passively read,&#x02014;or perhaps speak to any talking one that came. On Sunday last, after a week of fierce cold, we had a night &#x00026; day of tumbling &#x00026; tumultuous snow; so that I did not go out at all till late in the afternoon; &#x00026; strenuously, in Jean&#x02019;s stocking-shoes,<note n="1" noteref="779">Possibly the buckskin shoes Jean sent him <date when="1871-10">Oct. 1871</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18711101-TC-JCA-01">TC to JCA, <date when="1871-11-01">1 Nov. 1871</date></ref>.</note>
 not without difficulty make out a bit of walking along the solitary streets. London even seems quite taken aback; I met only two cabs, &#x00026; never in my life saw London so solitary, silent, &#x00026; deserted: everybody seemed to have a look of surprize, &#x00026; tremulous quasi heroism; for the snow was still driving about, &#x00026; had heaped itself at all convenient places into a kind of wreaths, surprizing &#x00026; terrible to the Cockney mind. We have now for the last three days got veritable thaw; streets again, or at least pavements, swept clear, &#x00026; hopes risen among us that we shall have no more of such adventuress for <hi rend="italic">this</hi> year.</p>
<p>Except, this morning, looking over the first half of the poor Schiller Revise, which was almost as good as altogether correct, I have done nothing this day either; but do feel a little more equal for any poor vestige of work, should such turn up. The Schiller Revise has still the latter half of it (two sheets &#x00026; a half) in Robson&#x02019;s hands; on the days after tomorrow I can hope to discharge it also with equal ease, &#x00026; so wash my hands of that poor little enterprise for ever &#x00026; a day. It has turned out, after all the confusion poor Mary &#x00026; I had with it, a much better thing than I expected; &#x00026; will do very well as an adjunct to <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi>.<note n="2" noteref="780">For the republication of TC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730107-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1873-01-07">7 Jan</date></ref>; for TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Supplement of <date when="1872">1872</date>,&#x0201D; his trans. of Ernst Julius Saupe, <hi rend="italic">Schiller und sein v&#x000E4;terliches Haus</hi>, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720909-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-09">9 Sept. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 I keep a <hi rend="italic">spare</hi> copy of the Revise, privately intended for poor Mary: this I will send to Jean, who can forward it to Mary after a reading for herself.&#x02014; Mary called yesterday in person, looking fresh &#x00026; hopeful, considerably cheerfuller than the former time; they have a grand Reception,<note n="3" noteref="781">The Taylors, at their home at Aubrey House.</note>

 but really in a bad fit, he admits,&#x02014;incessantly coughing &#x00026; with very little sleep. Latterly there is some appearance that Quain is right in calling the disorder gout; &#x00026; there is even now some appearance of actual gout unfolding itself in the right foot;&#x02014;which would evidently be the best symptom of all.

 as a Memorial of the affection I have for him and of my thankful (and also hopeful) approval of all that I have ever got to know or surmise about him He can understand that of all my outward possessions this Watch is become the dearest to me.

 It had been her Father&#x02019;s. made to her Father&#x02019;s order; and had measured out into still more perfect punctuality <hi rend="italic">his</hi> noble years of well-spent time; and now it has measured out (always punctually, <hi rend="italic">it</hi>) nearly forty-seven years of mine,<note n="7" noteref="796">JBW and TC m. <date when="1826-10-17">17 Oct. 1826</date>; see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18261009-TC-JBW-01"><sic>4:150&#x02013;52</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1826-10-09">[9 Oct. 1826]</date></corr></ref>.</note> and still measures, as with an everloving solemnity, till time quite end with me: and may the new Thomas Carlyle fare not worse with it than his two predecessors have done. To Maggie Welsh my dear Cousin (and <hi rend="italic">Hers</hi>) One hundred pounds. To my House servant Mrs. Warren if in my service at the time of my decease Fifty pounds. Having with good reason, ever since my first appearance in Literature, a variety of kind feelings obligations and regards towards New England, and indeed long before that a hearty good will, real and steady, which still continues, to America at large, and recognizing with gratitude how much of friendliness, of actual credible human love, I have had from that Country, and what immensities of worth and capability I believe and partly know to be lodged, especially <pb id="pg-48-153" n="48:153"/>in the silent classes there, I have now after due consultation<note n="8" noteref="797">TC mainly consulted with Charles Eliot Norton and Ralph Waldo Emerson; for these consultations and the arrangements for the bequest of his <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Frederick</hi> books to Harvard College, see vol. 46 and 47.</note>
 as to the feasibilities, the excusabilities of it, decided to fulfil a fond notion that has been hovering in my mind these many years; and I do therefore hereby bequeath the books, (whatever of them I could not borrow, but had to buy and gather, that is, in general whatever of them are still here) which I used in writing on Cromwell and Friedrich and which shall be accurately searched for, and parted from my other books, to the President<note n="9" noteref="798">Charles William Eliot (<date when="1834">1834</date>&#x02013;<date when="1926">1926</date>), president of Harvard; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18700928-TC-JTY-01"><sic>47:72</sic><corr>TC to JTY, <date when="1870-09-28">28 Sep. 1870</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 and Fellows of Harvard College, City of Cambridge, State of Massachusetts, as a poor testimony of my respect for that alma mater of so many of my Trans-Atlantic friends, and a token of the feelings above indicated towards the Great Country of which Harvard is the Chief School, In which sense I have reason to be confident that the Harvard authorities will please to accept this my little bequest and deal with it, and order and use it, as to their own good judgment and kind fidelity shall seem fittest. A certain symbolical value the bequest may have, but of intrinsic value as a collection of old books it can pretend to very little. If there should be doubt as to any books coming within the category of this bequest my dear Brother John if left behind me, as I always trust and hope who already knows about this Harvard matter and who possesses a Catalogue and List drawn up by me of which the Counterpart is in possession of the Harvard Authorities, will see it for me in all points accurately done. In regard to this and to all else in these final directions of mine I wish him to be regarded as my Second Self, my Surviving Self. My manuscript entitled &#x0201C;Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle&#x0201D; is to me naturally, in my now bereaved state, of endless value, though of what value to others I cannot in the least clearly judge; and indeed for the last four years am imperatively forbidden to write farther on it, or even to look farther into it.<note n="10" noteref="799">Most of TC&#x02019;s work on JWC&#x02019;s letters was complete by <date when="1869-09">Sept. 1869</date>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691001-TC-LA-01"><sic>46:80</sic><corr>TC to LA, <date when="1869-10-01">1 Oct. 1869</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 Of that manuscript my kind considerate and ever faithful friend James Anthony Froude (as he has lovingly promised me) takes precious charge in my stead. To him therefore I give it with whatever other fartherances and elucidations may be possible, and I solemnly request of him to do his best and wisest in the matter, as I feel assured he will. There is incidentally a quantity of Autobiographic Record in my notes to this Manuscript; but except as subsidiary and elucidative of the text I put no value on such. Express biography of me I had really rather that there be none. James Anthony Froude John Forster and my Brother John, will make earnest survey of the Manuscript and its subsidiaries there or elsewhere, in respect to this as well as to its other bearings; their united utmost candour and <pb id="pg-48-154" n="48:154"/>impartiality. taking always James Anthony Froude&#x02019;s practicality along with it. will evidently furnish a better judgment than mine can be. The Manuscript is by no means ready for publication; nay the questions How, when (after what delay, seven ten years) it, or any portion of it, should be published, are still dark to me; but on all such points James Anthony Froude&#x02019;s practical summing up and decision is to be taken as mine.<note n="11" noteref="800">TC&#x02019;s bequest relating to JWC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Letters and Memorials&#x0201D; was essentially the same in his <date when="1871">1871</date> Will; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710411-TC-WILL-01"><sic>47:183&#x02013;84</sic><corr>TC to WILL, <date when="1871-04-11">11 April 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 The imperfect Copy of the said Manuscript which is among my papers with the original letters I give to my Niece Mary Carlyle Aitken, to whom also dear little soul I bequeath Five hundred pounds for the loving care and unwearied patience and helpfulness she has shown to me in these my last solitary and infirm years. To her also I give at her choice, whatever Memorials of my Dear Departed One she has seen me silently preserving here, especially the table in the Drawing-Room at which I now write and the little Child&#x02019;s Chair (in the China Closet) which latter to my eyes has always a brightness as of Time&#x02019;s Morning and a sadness as of Death and Eternity when I look on it;<note n="12" noteref="801">For TC&#x02019;s writing table and JWC&#x02019;s child&#x02019;s chair, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710411-TC-WILL-01"><sic>47:184&#x02013;85</sic><corr>TC to WILL, <date when="1871-04-11">11 April 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 and which, with the other dear Article, I have the weak wish to preserve in loving hands yet awhile when I am gone. My other Manuscripts I leave to my Brother John. They are with one exception of no moment to me. I have never seen any of them since they were written. One of them is a set of fragments about James First which were loyally fished out for me from much other Cromwellian rubbish, and doubtless carefully copied more than twenty years ago by the late John Chorley who was always so good to me.<note n="13" noteref="802">For John Rutter Chorley&#x02019;s copying of material on James VI and I (<date when="1566">1566</date>&#x02013;<date when="1625">1625</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14592"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), king of Scotland, England, and Ireland, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710411-TC-WILL-01"><sic>47:184</sic><corr>TC to WILL, <date when="1871-04-11">11 April 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 But neither this latter nor perhaps any of the others is worth printing. On this point however my Brother can take Counsel with John Forster and James Anthony Froude and do what is then judged fittest. Many or most of these papers I often feel that I myself should burn; but probably I never shall after all. The &#x0201C;one exception&#x0201D; spoken of above is a sketch of my Father and his life hastily thrown off in the nights between his death and burial,<note n="14" noteref="803">See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 4&#x02013;39; for James Carlyle&#x02019;s death, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320124-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:102&#x02013;8</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1832-01-24">24 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320124-TC-JAC-01"><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1832-01-24">24 Jan. 1832</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 full of earnest affection and veracity, most likely unfit for printing; but I wish it to be taken charge of by my Brother John and preserved in the Family. Since, I think, the very night of my Father&#x02019;s Funeral (far away from London and me) I have never seen a word of that poor bit of writing.

<p>I grieve much to find you so entangled, sunk over head and ears in the black and disgusting outburst of Atheism and Spiritual Confusion which has lately come upon us,<note n="1" noteref="810">Pullar wrote, <date when="1873-02-03">3 Feb.</date>, a long and anguished letter: &#x0201C;Being much troubled and perplexed with many things &#x02026; I have at last made up my mind &#x02026; to lay before you one or two of my difficulties, not knowing where else to turn or whom else to trust. You occupy to my mind such a pre-eminent position for experience, for truthfulness, for sympathy.&#x0201D; He had been: &#x0201C;Evangelical at 15, a doubter at 16, a raring infidel of the Shelley stamp &#x02026; at 18, a Kantean &#x02026; at 21, a general jumble of Tennyson, George McDonald, exact science &#x02026; Darwin &#x00026;c [at 23].&#x0201D; George MacDonald (<date when="1824">1824</date>&#x02013;<date when="1905">1905</date>), Scottish poet and novelist; see <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620814-TC-JWC-01"><sic>38:139&#x02013;40</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1862-08-14">[14 Aug. 1862</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-38/lt-18620816-TC-JWC-01"><sic>145</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1862-08-14">17 [16] Aug. 1862</date></corr></ref>. But now as &#x0201C;a Father of three &#x02026; <supplied>[he]</supplied> finds that while he managed to get along tolerably well with more or less unrest of mind while he was alone &#x02026; he <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> &#x02026; remain in this state of passivity, but it is demanded of him to teach his children some positive good&#x0201D;; this led to &#x0201C;terrible bewilderment of his own mind &#x02026; daily more painfully evident.&#x0201D;</note>
 and seems to be carrying our afflicted generation into depths <pb id="pg-48-159" n="48:159"/>of the &#x0201C;Blackness of Darkness&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="811">Cf. Jude 1:13.</note>
 it never knew before. I compare this ugly Spiritual upburst to the Physical one of Solway Moss (in <date when="1783">1783</date>),<note n="3" noteref="812">In <date when="1771-12">Dec. 1771</date>, after the heaviest downpour of rain in 200 years, Solway Moss, a lowland peat bog in Cumbria, burst and overflowed, drowning some 400 acres of surrounding farmland with mud. See &#x0201C;Irruption of Solway Moss,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> (<date when="1772-01">Jan. 1772</date>) 62:123&#x02013;27.</note>
&#x02014;both of them proceeded out of what we may call Dropsy: Solway Moss had long been dropsical, from the partial stoppage of a little brook; our generation has been growing so, ever since the times of Oliver Cromwell, by the stoppage of all real Reform, and the introduction of the &#x0201C;Putty and Varnish&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="813">Phrase popularized in the <date when="1860">1860</date>s by U.S. humorist Josh Billings, pseudonym of Henry Wheeler Shaw (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1885">85</date>); see also Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 16:391.</note> kind instead (in a word by continual hypocrisy and unveracity persisted in so long); and now it rolls and rushes in this proud manner; covering the green earth and face of Nature with liquid Peat, and miscellaneous and unfathomable slobber, such as the World never saw before!</p>
<p>I deliberately advise you to quit all that, and rigorously lock it away from you in silence till your own mind at least re-acquire its clearness, and can serenely look into what is written in yourself; and read, as all true men in all ages have been able to do, what the finger of the Most High has written there. You may depend on it these long-eared Sages of &#x0201C;Science&#x0201D; very &#x0201C;falsely so-called,&#x0201D;&#x02014;as men without reverence or piety of mind<note n="5" noteref="814">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720623-TC-UC-01">TC to UC, <date when="1872-06-23">23 June 1872</date></ref>.</note>
&#x02014;have not any word to say on this subject; and that every faithful and humble man possessing those first qualities of manhood <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a word, and for himself a conclusive word, to say upon it. Lock <hi rend="italic">them</hi> all away I seriously advise you, and try by all good methods (especially by more and more faithful performance of every Duty that is already clear to you) to get hold again of &#x0201C;that Light, which lighteneth every Man that cometh into the World.&#x0201D;<note n="6" noteref="815">Cf. John 1:9.</note>
 One of your first discoveries and conclusions I think will be, that no Entity could have gifted <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with longings towards nobleness; with love and pious feeling and the <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> sense of Right and Wrong, unless He had himself such qualities to give away!</p>
<p>Logic, I believe, will do nothing farther for you;&#x02014;but <hi rend="italic">thus far</hi> all blow-pipes, crucibles, mineralogical hammers, <hi rend="italic">Origin of Species, Descents of Man</hi>,<note n="7" noteref="816">Publications of Charles Darwin; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720623-TC-UC-01">TC to UC, <date when="1872-06-23">23 June 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 etc. etc. will never, and can never bring you.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-160" n="48:160"/>For the rest I would advise you (so far as my light goes) to give up the Spiritual training of your children to their dear and loving Mother, who will teach them everlasting Truths,&#x02014;precious and everlasting, though clouded over in their vesture at present, far beyond what long-eared Owls-of-Minerva,<note n="8" noteref="817">TC often uses the epithet &#x0201C;long-eared&#x0201D; to mean an ass; Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, was usually accompanied by an owl; TC meant that however clever the scientific thinkers were, in face of God they were as stupid as an ass.</note>
 with their Blow-pipes and scientific gear, have the least notion of, or are ever likely to have.</p>
<p>Your dear children, if they question <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on such subjects, you can for the present study to answer evasively, though with cautious admission of whatever <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> of truth may be in their bits of beliefs,&#x02014;which will be more and more possible for you the farther you yourself advance in real Truth: speak to them at all times with perfect veracity, and above all things study to awaken in their minds the feelings of reverence, of pious awe, and of the infinite, eternal difference between right and wrong; which is the corner stone and foundation of all real knowledge and intelligence, as of all other worth in Man.</p>
<p>And withal, know in general that for yourself too there is no other road towards Light and Peace, but ever more perfectly <hi rend="italic">Doing</hi> what is commanded you, what your hand findeth to do. &#x0201C;Doubt of any kind,&#x0201D; says the wisest man of these latter ages most truly, &#x0201C;is of Infinite nature and cannot be removed, except by action.&#x0201D;<note n="9" noteref="818">Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, book 5 chap. 16; see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 23:386.

<p><salute>Dear Lady</salute></p>
<p>I ought to have written to you twenty days ago; &#x00026; indeed have been helplessly thinking to do so more than ten times in the course of these, but was held back daily by the usual trifling interruptions &#x00026; bothers; &#x00026; chiefly by the <pb id="pg-48-161" n="48:161"/><hi rend="italic">feckless</hi>, poor and pining condition into which this dismal Winter, &#x00026; its unexampled course of weather, had reduced my own poor self. I know well you will understand, &#x00026; forgive all this. Your letter delivered me from a world of anxiety, &#x00026; I <hi rend="italic">should</hi>, in spite of hindrances, have answered sooner,&#x02014;&#x00026; will, as usual, hope to do better another time.</p>
<p>This winter has been unusually hard upon me: ten weeks of incessant rain, dark incessant mud-bath, terrestrial &#x00026; aerial; no weak person could endure it without damage, &#x00026; I do feel weaker, <hi rend="italic">blinder</hi> too, &#x00026; more entirely useless for the time being, than I almost ever used to be. We have now, for a three weeks, got into paltry, uncertain frosts, with snows, &#x00026; their slushes, &#x00026; their slippery streets intervening,&#x02014;to me more unpleasant than even the mud baths.<note n="1" noteref="820">The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> reported, <date when="1873-02-11">11 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;In London last night there was another fall of snow, which was sufficient to cover the ground in many places to the depth of nearly half an inch. &#x02026; The atmosphere this morning is intensely cold and the snowfall has not proved sufficient to interfere with the street traffic.&#x0201D;</note>
 But at any rate the days are lengthening, the Sun must vindicate himself at last, &#x00026; time &#x00026; hours, as usual, will wear out the roughest day. I am often thankful when I think what you have been escaping by this forced banishment to warmer latitudes; you, to whom such a Winter might have been still more dangerous.</p>
<p>Yesterday I saw Miss Bromley here, who had found a letter of yours after her return from the Country;<note n="2" noteref="821">Either from one of Caroline Davenport Bromley&#x02019;s country houses, Wootton Hall, Staffordshire, or Ripple Court, nr. Dover, Kent, or from a visit to friends.</note>
 she was speaking very kindly of you; grieved that you had had another fit of <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>;&#x02014;I try to believe it was the same you spoke of to me, &#x00026; not another? tell me that it was not.&#x02014; During her three weeks of Country, Miss B. had met with the John Stanleys<note n="3" noteref="822">Col. John Constantine and Susan Stanley; she was a niece of Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710926-TC-JAF-01"><sic>47:225</sic><corr>TC to JAF, <date when="1871-09-26">26 Sep. 1871</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 somewhere; &#x00026; liked them both well. Since her departure yesterday, &#x00026; my forced refusal to dine &#x00026; meet them at her house some &#x0201C;evening,&#x0201D; she has sent another pressing note, to the effect, &#x0201C;Stanleys coming tomorrow night; are you absolutely impossible&#x0201D;? to which I have had again to answer &#x0201C;Absolutely.&#x0201D; Stanley is going in as a Tory Parliamentary candidate for Maidstone, &#x00026; writes to me in great spirits about it.<note n="4" noteref="823">John Stanley came from a family of liberals, even radicals, so to stand as a Tory was surprising; the two Maidstone seats both went to the liberals in the <date when="1874">1874</date> election.</note>
 A good kind of fellow; with an honest, &#x00026; a brisk, light heart in him, this poor Colonel Johnny, to whom I wish heartily well! Miss Bromley notices that his wife, in the quietest way, has absolute command of him, &#x00026; leads him like the tamest Behemoth, with a thorn in his snout,<note n="5" noteref="824">Cf. Job 40:15&#x02013;24, and Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 18:153.</note>
&#x02014;and invisible halter fixed there. I have seen them here some twice, &#x00026; each time judged her completely equal to such a feat.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-162" n="48:162"/>My own sole work, if <hi rend="italic">work</hi> it could be called, since October last, has been that poor bit of Supplement to Schiller, which, had I possessed a right hand of my own, might have done in one week! however, I did yesterday complete the last Printers&#x02019; Proof, &#x00026; take leave of it for evermore. It is not a bad thing after all, but rather a good,&#x02014;presents the finest scene of Poverty ennobled (that worthy Schiller&#x02019;s paternal house) that I have almost ever seen in Literature. It awakens all the old thoughts of fifty four years ago,<note n="6" noteref="825">TC had been reading Schiller since at least <date when="1820">1820</date>; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200603-TC-EI-01"><sic>1:255</sic><corr>TC to EI, <date when="1820-06-03">3 June 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 &#x00026; has kept up, all the time I was working over it, a kind of pious <hi rend="italic">Worship</hi> in my mind, &#x00026; thus been not without a certain benefit to me after all. It comes out in <date when="1873-03">March</date>; &#x00026; I will please myself with keeping a copy of this poor Schiller volume for your Mary,<note n="7" noteref="826">Mary Florence Baring.</note>
 to whose bright little soul I know this Supplement will be bright &#x00026; instructive. My kindest love to that dear little lady,&#x02014;&#x00026; say, by the way, that she is not to be grown <hi rend="italic">too big</hi> next time I see her.</p>
<p>Poor Forster is still labouring, coughing &#x00026; suffering; confined to the house this last three weeks: Quain calls it undeveloped gout, and owns that this is a bad fit (got, I believe by the putting of Lord Lytton in his last bed in Westminster Abbey,&#x02014;rather superflous operation).<note n="8" noteref="827">Edward Lytton Bulwer, Lord Lytton, close friend of Forster (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720802-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-08-02">2 Aug. 1872</date></ref>), d. <date when="1873-01-18">18 Jan.</date>, Argyll Hall, Torquay.

 Quain, however, bates no jot of hope. Poor Forster to me, even during this bad misery, has been signally helpful &#x00026; obliging; &#x00026; would not, &#x00026; could not be forbidden, for all I could say.</p>

<p>Mary C.A. is still mainly at Brighton; takes handsomely, so far as I can see, to her new Secretariat, which seems to be a place of light work, among essentially worthy people, chiefly distinguished by punctuality,&#x02014;as of clock-work, a conditon that will not fail to do the Secretary good!

<p><salute>Dear Sir,</salute></p>
<p>It is not for want of sympathy that I have left your sad letter so long unanswered; but I have been much engaged, &#x00026; in a weak way of health, little suited for work of any kind, &#x00026; for writing, least of all.</p>
<p>I perceive with sorrow that you have got involved in that singular black deluge of Atheistic &#x0201C;Science falsely so-called,&#x0201D; which has suddenly broken <pb id="pg-48-164" n="48:164"/>out of late years on our faithless, sinful generation; that it has drowned away from you your religious Faith, &#x00026; that in this you justly feel bereft of everything that was vital &#x00026; precious to you. In this unhappily you are not singular;<note n="1" noteref="834">See also <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720623-TC-UC-01">TC to UC, <date when="1872-06-23">23 June 1872</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730207-TC-WBP-01">TC to WBP, <date when="1873-02-07">7 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 sincere inquiring minds, on all hands, are your brethren in this miserable calamity. My advice to you would be to push away from you all this miserable stuff, &#x00026; to consult <hi rend="italic">it</hi> no longer on such questions;&#x02014;I can predict that one day you may come to see clearly that <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, whatever self-conceited airs it give itself, is much mistaken in regard to such, &#x00026; can never, with its visible <hi rend="italic">ir</hi>reverence &#x00026; impiety, utter anything in regard to them that is not false, vain &#x00026; delusive.</p>
<p>In regard to these highest Spiritual Questions, my own conviction &#x00026; experience is that the Light is either written dimly in our own souls, &#x00026; growing ever clearer by reverent meditation, &#x00026; perhaps still more by faithful <hi rend="italic">performance</hi> of whatever duty it commands us, or else is not to be found any where at all. The clear rule for you therefore is, Persist with your whole heart, in more &#x00026; more perfectly discharging what you feel to be laid upon you; that will mean also the clearer &#x00026; clearer development in your own mind of the Eternal Sense of Right &#x00026; Wrong, which all wise men have taken, &#x00026; will for ever take to be, the handwriting in us of the Most High.</p>
<p>By far the highest speculator among the thinkers of our generation, Kant, the German Philosopher has said: &#x0201C;Two things strike me dumb, the Starry Firmament above me, &#x00026; the sense of Right &#x00026; Wrong in Man.&#x0201D;<note n="2" noteref="835">TC used the quotation from Immanuel Kant in <hi rend="italic">Shooting Niagara: And After?</hi> (<date when="1867">1867</date>), citing its German source, Kant, <hi rend="italic">S&#x000E4;mmtliche Werke</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1838">1838</date>) 8:312; see Carlyle <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 30:29. For TC on Kant, see <ref target="volume-45/lt-18671008-TC-JHS-01"><sic>45:46</sic><corr>TC to JHS, <date when="1867-10-08">8 Oct. 1867</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 Another still to me far higher &#x00026; grander Intellect has this maxim: &#x0201C;Speculative Doubt is by its nature endless,&#x0201D; speculation can only Change it into new forms, Action alone more &#x00026; more faithfully prosecuted can abolish Doubt.&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="836">Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730207-TC-WBP-01">TC to WBP, <date when="1873-02-07">7 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 Remember also what Samuel Johnson said, &#x0201C;this is a World where much is to be done, &#x00026; little is to be known.&#x0201D;<note n="4" noteref="837">Samuel Johnson (<date when="1709">1709</date>&#x02013;<date when="1784">84</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14918"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), &#x0201C;Against Inquisitive and Perplexing Thoughts&#x0201D; (<date when="1784-08-12">12 Aug. 1784</date>), <hi rend="italic">Prayers and Meditations</hi> (<date when="1785">1785</date>).</note>
</p>
<p>There is no specific book that I can recommend to you; it is serious &#x00026; reverent Meditation of your own, rather than much reading of books that can bring Light &#x00026; Wisdom to you; but there is one precept in regard to books that I will venture to give, or rather there are two, but the first of them you seem to be already fulfilling: these two precepts are, Diligently &#x00026; steadily employ all your leisure in endeavouring to acquire true insight, by reading &#x00026; otherwise; secondly, avoid reading <hi rend="italic">un</hi>wise books; namely in whatever book you find the author is of an irreverent, mean &#x00026; impious spirit, avoid reading farther in him, as you would avoid intercourse with the man himself, &#x00026; expect only harm <pb id="pg-48-165" n="48:165"/>from him; by this practice, faithfully followed, you will get to know more &#x00026; more decisively good books from bad, &#x00026; be able to avoid the latter more &#x00026; more, &#x00026; know them for Spiritual Poison.</p>
<p>Adieu my dear Sir, I can predict for you success &#x00026; progress into spiritual clearness if you bravely persevere. Hope always, do not despair; this World, wild &#x00026; waste as we find it, is still for all of us the Place of Hope.<note n="5" noteref="838">See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> 121.</note>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>I return to you Mary Hanning&#x02019;s letter, which is a snappy, gleg-like production, &#x00026; interests one for the poor little being with her difficulties over yonder. I should be extremely willing to help in getting the poor souls a wholesome, dry house, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> see your way to a wise solution of that little problem.<note n="1" noteref="840">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1873-02-17">17 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;Here is a rather good letter from Mary Holden, Jenny&#x02019;s second daughter who has been so long unwell, as her husband too has been all along till this year when he has no D<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> bill to pay, for the first time since their marriage. I feel a tendency to help them in getting a house of their own. Jenny herself seems to get much good of her house w<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we bought for her. Can anything be done to help poor Mary to get one too in some equally wholesome place?&#x0201D; Mary and Charles Holden lost a da., <date when="1870-12">Dec. 1870</date>; see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710213-TC-JCHA-01"><sic>47:156</sic><corr>TC to JCHA, <date when="1871-02-13">13 Feb. 1871</date></corr></ref>.

 think it would be good to have them first settle upon a bit of ground, wholesomely situated, &#x00026; to have shaped out by them an exact estimate of what the cost would be, house included. They should not be encouraged to consider that gifts of that kind drop into one&#x02019;s mouth by merely opening it;&#x02014;in fact that is the one questionability of the matter to us; and that once guarded against (as no doubt you can completely do by a little study &#x00026; precaution), I am willing and desirous to go halves with you in whatever you see good to do on that head.<note n="2" noteref="841">TC&#x02019;s checkbook recorded: &#x0201C;<date when="1873-04-12">12 April 1873</date> / (for Mary Henning&#x02019;s House) to D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle / &#x000A3;100 .. 0 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>

<p><pb id="pg-48-166" n="48:166"/>We hope soon to hear what your deliberate report of D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Russell is.

 I hope you may be able form a clearer &#x00026; more pleasant opinion; the advent of the Spring weather, which cannot now be distant, seems at any rate to form a hopeful feature in the business. But old men, alas, are a feeble kind of goods; &#x00026; Russell has always been so steadily healthy up to this point. Give my kind regards to him, &#x00026; to good M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Russell as well: the thought of Her, in case of any thing going wrong there, is very mournful to me; they are a pair of people <hi rend="italic">I</hi> never can forget,&#x02014;for reasons you well know.<note n="5" noteref="844">JWC often stayed with the Russells, who had looked after her during her illness, <date when="1864-07">July</date>&#x02013;<date when="1864-09">Sept. 1864</date>; see <ref target="volume-40/lt-18640725-JWC-TC-01"><sic>40:149</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1864-07-25">25 July 1864</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-41/lt-18640930-TC-WDC-01 lt-18641003-JWC-MR-01"><sic>41:58</sic><corr>JWC to MR, <date when="1864-10-03">[3 Oct. 1864]</date></corr></ref>.</note>

 tell her I was much gratified with the kind, sincere &#x00026; affectionate bit of letter she sent me.

Carlyle replied, <date when="1873-02-27">27 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I have told Masson that I mean to accept the unanimous offer of the Senatus to make me an L.L.D. as proposed by him.&#x0201D; John was awarded the honorary degree of LL.D at a graduation ceremonial in the Assembly Hall, Castle Hill, <date when="1873-04-23">23 April</date>. Prof. Norman Macpherson (<date when="1825">1825</date>&#x02013;<date when="1914">1914</date>), dean of the Faculty of Law, made the award: &#x0201C;I have next the honour to present &#x02026; a graduate in medicine of this University, who bears worthily the name made so illustrious by one whom he will gladly allow me to call his greater brother&#x02014;Carlyle &#x02026; the historian, philosopher, and moralist, recently Rector of our University and perhaps her most eminent living alumnus. Dr John Carlyle &#x02026; the friend &#x02026; of most of the best literary and scientific men of the day, has long enjoyed among them a consideration which could only be acquired by one possessing high intellectual qualities. The range of his linguistic studies has been very extensive. I shall only specify his minute acquaintance with Icelandic scholarship, and his mastery of Italian, evidenced by his translation of the &#x02018;Inferno&#x02019; of Dante, so often attempted, and achieved by Dr Carlyle with a success which makes the public much desire to have from him his rendering of Dante&#x02019;s other works&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1873-04-24">24 April</date>).</note>
 of course you <hi rend="italic">will</hi> accept: if it do anything it will do good to both you &#x00026; them; <pb id="pg-48-168" n="48:168"/>and at any rate it is sure to produce for the time-being an altogether honest &#x00026; mutual glow of friendly feeling between you.</p>
<p>I inclose farther a &#x0201C;Dividend&#x0201D; paper, which came to me last night, meaning 5&#x000A3; &#x00026; certain shillings,<note n="2" noteref="853">Dividends from his shares in the Artizans, Labourers &#x00026; General Dwellings Co.; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720323-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-03-23">23 March 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 but which it seemed to me ought to have been sent, as I suppose the last was, to <hi rend="italic">Adamson</hi>,<note n="3" noteref="854">Samuel Adamson, of the British Linen Co. Bank, where TC had an account.</note>
 for my behoof. Please step over to him with the two papers, one of which I have <hi rend="italic">endorsed</hi>;&#x02014;&#x00026; pray do not leave him till you have assured yourself that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> henceforth is to be the recipient of such things for me. If that cannot be secured I will sell out altogether rather than be bothered with such method farther! Verily &#x00026; practically <hi rend="italic">so</hi>: but I suppose you &#x00026; he will have no difficulty about it.&#x02014; I don&#x02019;t understand either, the <hi rend="italic">amount</hi> of Income Tax&#x02014;Yes, oh yes! on looking at it again I do; it is about 15/ or 16/ for 100&#x000A3;. (not of <hi rend="italic">income</hi> but of <hi rend="italic">property</hi>?)<note n="4" noteref="855">John wrote: &#x0201C;I read the Report for last year, &#x00026; thought the company was getting on well; but like you, could not understand by what &#x02018;Income Tax deducted&#x02019; our Dividends of six per cent each could be reduced to &#x000A3;5 .. 4 .. 4. About that matter Adamson is to enquire. &#x02026; The enclosed letter from Mr Martin of Birmingham, who got the Shares for us, asks us to take more shares, &#x00026; I should be willing to take ten more, &#x00026; ten for you too &#x02026; provided that the Dividends can be paid in the usual way to our Bankers.&#x0201D; J. Royle Martin was the company&#x02019;s manager.</note>
 Along with Masson&#x02019;s letter I inclose one from Forster, which you may keep, or give to Jean as a Memorial of the utterly extravagant man;<note n="5" noteref="856">John wrote: &#x0201C;Forster&#x02019;s note looks extravagant at first sight, but one sees by it how he feels that all that is required &#x00026; useful in Biography may be told completely &#x00026; coherently in few words.&#x0201D;</note>
 &#x00026; along with these a quantity of <hi rend="italic">tag rags</hi> which may amuse you for the moment, but are of no interest farther.</p>
<p>I write in the greatest haste, Miss Bromley sitting upstairs, waiting to take me to poor Norton&#x02019;s, who has had a dangerous illness (inflammation of the lungs) which is not yet altogether void of danger as I hear, but which I never heard of till not many days ago. I am glad of this opportunity of at least leaving a card.<note n="6" noteref="857">Norton wrote, <date when="1873-02-26">26 Feb.</date>: &#x0201C;I am very grateful to you for your kind inquiries concerning my health. I have had a slight attack of pneumonia, from which I am pretty well recovered. It has, however, pulled my strength, and I am likely to be a prisoner in my chamber for a week or ten days longer. &#x02026; I have missed nothing so much as my walks with you. Your friendliness has given the winter a different character from what it otherwise would have had for me, and the memory of it will be a lasting possession. &#x02026; I will not ask you to come and see me, for I am up three flights of stairs,&#x02014;but I hope it will not be very long before I have the pleasure of going to see you.&#x0201D;</note>

<dateline>[<date when="1873-02-28">late Feb. 1873</date>]</dateline>
<p><salute>My dear Sir&#x02014;</salute> Last night I heard, through the newspapers, of your offer on behalf of the thrifty work-people of Darley,<note n="1" noteref="859">Whitworth moved to Darley Dale, Derbyshire, <date when="1872">1872</date>; <date when="1873-01-30">late Jan. 1873</date> he had offered to contribute: &#x0201C;for the next five years such a sum yearly as will give to the inhabitants of North Darley three per cent. more interest on their deposits in the savings bank, thus making the total interest six per cent on their savings. Such inhabitants must be the working classes, receiving wages <supplied>[including]</supplied> domestic servants and children at school. &#x02026; If this proposal is found to work well in North Darley, he hopes to see it extended &#x02026; to the whole county&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Manchester Evening News</hi>, <date when="1873-02-20">20 Feb.</date>).</note>
 and of the thankful acceptance of it by the district authorities of the place. I cannot resist the highly unwonted desire that has risen in me to say that I highly approve and applaud the ideas you have on the subject, and to declare in words that in my opinion nothing wiser, more beneficent, or worthy of your distinguished place as a master of workers has come before me for many a year. Would to heaven that all or many of the captains of industry in England had a soul in them such as yours, and could do as you have done, or could still further co-operate with you in works and plans to the like effect! The look of England is to me at this moment abundantly ominous; the question of capital and labour, growing every more anarchic&#x02014;insoluble altogether by the notions hitherto applied to it&#x02014;is pretty certain to issue in petroleum one day, unless some other Gospel than that of &#x02018;Dismal Science&#x02019;<note n="2" noteref="860">TC&#x02019;s phrase, first used in &#x0201C;Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x02019;s Magazine</hi> [<date when="1849-12">Dec. 1849</date>]; renamed when reprinted as a pamphlet: &#x0201C;Occasional Discourse on the Nigger Question&#x0201D; [<date when="1853">1853</date>]); see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 29:354.</note>
 come to illuminate it. Two things are pretty sure to me; the <pb id="pg-48-170" n="48:170"/>first is that capital and labour never can or will agree together, till they both first of all decide on doing their work faithfully throughout, and like men of conscience and honour, whose highest aim is to behave like faithful citizens of this universe, and obey the Eternal commandment of Almighty God who made them. The second thing is that a sadder object than even the &#x02018;Coal strike,&#x02019; or any conceivable strike, is the fact that, loosely speaking, we may say all England has decided that the profitablest way is to do its work ill, slovenly, swiftly and mendaciously. What a contrast between now and, say, only a hundred years ago! At that latter date, or still more conspicuously for ages before that, all England awoke to its work with an invocation to the Eternal Maker to bless them in their day&#x02019;s labour, and help them to do it well. Now, all England&#x02014;shopkeepers, workmen, all manner of competing labourers&#x02014;awaken, as if with an unspoken but heartfelt prayer to Beelzebub, &#x0201C;Oh, help us, thou great Lord of Shoddy and Adulteration and Malfeasance, to do our work with a maximum of slovenliness, swiftness, profit, and mendacity, for the Devil&#x02019;s sake; amen!</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>These four days I have been determined to write a word to you, but every day have been prevented; &#x00026; today had determined to do it in spite of all the world,&#x02014;which accordingly (just after your Scotsman, with the Article on Gladstone<note n="1" noteref="866">Probably the article in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>, <date when="1873-03-03">3 March</date>, criticizing Gladstone&#x02019;s Irish University Bill for being too ambitious: &#x0201C;Theoretically, the Government Bill is a measure having national objects in view. &#x02026; It fails because it does too much. &#x02026; On the one hand, we now have the Senate of Trinity College denouncing the measure because it will remove from them much of the power which they possess; on the other hand, we have the Roman Catholic prelates denouncing the measure because it does not give them at once all that they demand.&#x0201D; Gladstone&#x02019;s plan was to construct a federal university in Ireland to which colleges could affiliate, specifically the Anglican Trinity College, Dublin, the secular Queen&#x02019;s Colleges of Belfast and Cork, and the Catholic University in Dublin, with no religious requirements for students, scholarships, or professorships. It would be funded partly by the state and partly by Trinity College&#x02019;s endowments. The govt. lost the vote on the 2d reading of the bill, <date when="1873-03-12">12 March</date>, 284 to 287 votes, with 36 Irish Liberals voting against and only 15 Irish M.P.s voting in favor.</note>
 has come to hand) I now proceed to do, <hi rend="italic">with the necessary brevity</hi>.</p>
<p>There is in fact very little to be said of essential, no news whatever as to health or the like; &#x00026; in regard to those Building shares, only necessary to say, that the explanation of the 6 per cent, &#x00026; other points, is clear &#x00026; complete; &#x00026; that if you want to venture another &#x000A3;100 in the thing, or another &#x000A3;200, I am perfectly ready to go along with you.<note n="2" noteref="867">John A. Carlyle wrote, <date when="1873-03-02">2 March</date>, with the explanation of the dividends sent him by the secretary of the Artizans, Labourers &#x00026; General Dwellings Co.; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-02-26">26 Feb.</date></ref> He continued: &#x0201C;I think [the company] &#x02026; is in a fair way of accomplishing much more, &#x00026; should be encouraged as far as possible.&#x0201D;</note>
 But in fact <hi rend="italic">you alone</hi> can judge in <pb id="pg-48-172" n="48:172"/>the matter. They seem to be a restless, agitating kind of people, these Birminghamites (&#x0201C;secular Education,&#x0201D; Suffrage for the Labourers &#x00026;c. &#x00026;c.);&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x00026; perhaps their Building Concern will not strike very deep root either for the times coming. Though of course the houses will still be there.<note n="3" noteref="868">J. Royle Martin, TC&#x02019;s original correspondent and company manager of the Artizans, Labourers &#x00026; General Dwellings Co., lived in Birmingham, whose town council, mid-19th century, was dominated by radical liberal reformers who wanted to improve the lives of working men and women in every way: through housing, slum clearance, education, libraries, clean water provision, and public parks; many radical organizations sprang up, such as the Birmingham Education League which promoted free, non-denominational education for all.</note>
 On the whole you alone can judge, &#x00026; shall.</p>
<p>It is very true also what you say about money lying idle at 1 per cent Interest; when it might be invested &#x00026; of some use.<note n="4" noteref="869">John wrote: &#x0201C;Both you &#x00026; I have too much money in Bank at one per cent interest lying quite idle; &#x00026; this year I should like to double the amount of my shares in the Company, which has so laudable &#x00026; necessary an object in hand, if you would join me.&#x0201D;</note>
 I, for my own part, never in the least want above &#x000A3;1000 lying in Adamson&#x02019;s hands; &#x00026; I dare say there are at present several thousands so lying,&#x02014;though the fact is I do not know with the least accuracy, &#x00026; you, I always reckon, do. If you care to inquire of Adamson,<note n="5" noteref="870">John replied, <date when="1873-03-10">10 March</date>: &#x0201C;On receipt of your last letter I went to the British Linen C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> to ascertain what was the balance in your favour there, &#x00026; found it was &#x02026; &#x000A3;5416 .. 16 .. 2. My advice would be to put the larger part of it on Deposit Receipt, say &#x000A3;4000 or &#x000A3;4400 &#x02026; . I myself have Deposit receipts for nearly &#x000A3;4000, &#x00026; last year it produced on an average 3&#x000BD; per cent.&#x0201D;</note>
 &#x00026; decide on taking a couple of thousands to invest in some good stock (say your South Western Railway, your Caledonian ditto, or where you like best),<note n="6" noteref="871">For previous purchases of railway shares, see <ref target="volume-47/lt-18710422-TC-JAC-01"><sic>47:196</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1871-04-22">22 April 1871</date></corr></ref>. John advised against railway shares: &#x0201C;Railway Shares have been very unsettled in price for some time past, Caledonian Ordinary Shares have varied more than 40 per cent. Glasgow &#x00026; S.

<p><salute>Dear Lady</salute></p>
<p>Your letter was a great relief to me from my many uncertainties. I found it one evening, above a week ago on returning from my nine o&#x02019;clock walk; it lay in the lobby there with others, but I knew <hi rend="italic">it</hi> by the feel of it, &#x00026; <hi rend="italic">it</hi> was my reading so soon as I got up into the light. Thank Heaven you have had no more of those heart attacks,<note n="1" noteref="880">Lady Ashburton suffered from a heart condition, rheumatism, and, late <date when="1872">1872</date>, an attack of mumps; see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 155 and 158.</note>
 but seem to be cheery, content, &#x00026; doing altogether well.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-174" n="48:174"/>Almost every day of this week I have been resolved to write, in token of my being a good boy; but every day there has something or other occurred to say absolutely <hi rend="italic">No</hi> to my pious intention;&#x02014;every day, &#x00026; this day too, had I not, in clear rebellion, determined to push it aside &#x00026; write you a little word in spite of very fate. The truth is I have been busy with some old L<hi rend="small-caps">etters</hi> which have come to me (you may guess perhaps, of what <hi rend="italic">authorship</hi>),<note n="2" noteref="881">Letters from JWC to Susan Stirling; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730108-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-01-08">8 Jan.</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730314-MW-SS-01">MW to SS, <date when="1873-03-14">14 March</date></ref>.</note>
 &#x00026; have not yet got done, so incessant are the interruptions &#x00026; intrusions upon me, mostly from persons altogether indifferent to me, or worse. Add to which my languor, torpor, &#x00026; utter laziness are extreme; the fruits partly, no doubt, of the dismal Winter we have had, &#x00026; are now getting through, with, as yet, only the <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> of improvement.&#x02014; The main errand I had to Rome today, however, is to send my poor little Mary, or rather <hi rend="italic">your rich</hi> little Mary, rich in all good gifts, dear Soul, her copy of Schiller, which is now lying ready. Maggie has wrapped it up, will address it &#x00026; post it punctually, &#x00026; we hope it will arrive safe. The new part of it, which is called &#x02018;Supplement,&#x02019;<note n="3" noteref="882">TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;Supplement&#x0201D; to <hi rend="italic">The Life of Friedrich Schiller</hi> (<date when="1873">1873</date>) contained an account of Schiller&#x02019;s family life; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720909-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-09-09">9 Sept. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 will surely interest her young soul; &#x00026; I hope will be pleasant to you too, who are a lover of beautiful people in this world. The Schiller people, especially the eldest Sister, &#x00026; the younger,<note n="4" noteref="883">The eldest and youngest were Christophine (<date when="1757">1757</date>&#x02013;<date when="1847">1847</date>) and Caroline (Nanette) (<date when="1777">1777</date>&#x02013;<date when="1796">96</date>); the middle sister was Luise (<date when="1766">1766</date>&#x02013;<date when="1836">1836</date>); see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> 25:277&#x02013;88.</note>
 they &#x00026; their humble Life-Scene are the beautifullest thing I have seen for a long time.</p>
<p>Another, &#x00026; in fact still more important matter, was, to tell you that poor Forster got out of his dismal gouty cough, which really seems to have alarmed both Quain &#x00026; himself, &#x00026; <hi rend="italic">ceased</hi> coughing, &#x00026; sat in comparative ease, though weak as water nine or ten days ago; &#x00026; has since been taking a drive daily, &#x00026; oftenest a walk too, in some horticultural promenade under glass, which stands near him;<note n="5" noteref="884">Probably the covered area of the Royal Horticultural Society garden, Kensington.</note>

I have not seen him since your letter came, or at least have not had any opportunity of mentioning your present wish for help for your Man of Business<note n="6" noteref="885">Probably James William Waterhouse; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720904-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-09-04">4 Sept. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 from him; but I believe I may confidently say, as if he himself had said it, that he would be both willing &#x00026; able to see that Helpless Gentleman at any time, on your note of introduction, &#x00026; to give him all the help in his power; which I believe might be very considerable, versus the vulpine Clutton.<note n="7" noteref="886">Henry Clutton; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720704-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-07-04">4 July 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 Think seriously of this I beg of you, &#x00026; put it in practice, if you have need, as I doubt not you may often feel to have!</p>
<p>I have seen or heard nothing of Lady Marion or of the Brownlows: I called <pb id="pg-48-175" n="48:175"/>some three weeks ago, &#x00026; left a card;<note n="8" noteref="887">Lady Marian Alford and her son and his wife, Lord and Lady Brownlow. Their London house, 11 Princes Gate, was not far from Forster&#x02019;s at Palace Gate House.</note>
 was informed that Lady M. had not been in Town for a good while, nor was expected soon; &#x00026; I have heard or seen nothing since.</p>
<p>We are all in a mighty toss about Gladstone&#x02019;s amazing Irish Education Bill,&#x02014;the most contemptible bit of Parliamentary thimble-rigging, &#x00026; the foolishest Parliamentary Bill I can remember ever to have seen; which everybody now tells me has no chance of passing. The only speculation is, whether it wont turn the People&#x02019;s William out;&#x02014;but alas, if it should, &#x00026; then only turn the people&#x02019;s Dizzy in,<note n="9" noteref="888">Gladstone&#x02019;s govt. resigned briefly, <date when="1873-03-13">13 March</date>, after the defeat of the 2d reading of the Irish University Bill.

 what better were we!&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>These were very interesting Roman news you sent me; especially that digging out of the ancient burned mansion with the skeleton in it still in the attitude of prayer, was one of the most impressive things I had heard of for a long time. You say his, the skeleton&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">name</hi> was there; of course therefore his epoch or date could be guessed at: I wish you would remember and instruct me on that point.</p>

<p>I did not send any Cheque to you yesterday; nor will now, till as you propose you have deliberated for a little on the condition of Railways &#x00026; other investments. The instant you give me warning I will despatch for you the command of &#x000A3;4,000.

 which I return, is that of a very earnest &#x00026; useful-looking man; happily, so far as one can see, got over the shallows with a judicious, diligent &#x00026; prosperous voyage now lying ahead.

He appears to me one of the contemptiblest men I ever looked on; a poor Ritualist, almost spectral kind of phantasm of a man, nothing in him but Forms &#x00026; Ceremonies &#x00026; outside wrappages; incapable of seeing veritably any fact whatever, but seeing, crediting, &#x00026; laying to heart the mere <hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> of the fact, &#x00026; fancying that all the rest does not exist. By this manoeuvring with his Bill he hopes to escape the stroke of Fate for some time, as no doubt many of the Radical Cohort, quite in a rage <pb id="pg-48-177" n="48:177"/>with this Bill, still wish; but everybody seems to think it can but be for a brief time. &#x0201C;Let him fight his own battle&#x0201D; in the name of Beelzebub the god of Ekron,<note n="4" noteref="896">See 2 Kings 1.2.</note>

<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle in returning these precious letters,<note n="1" noteref="901">Susan Stirling loaned JWC&#x02019;s letters to her to John A.

You can well imagine the deep, heartfelt, though sad interest each one of them has had for him: recalling so graphically to his mind many little incidents never forgotten by him; most of all bringing back so vividly the remembrance of those whose long &#x00026; faithful friendship both he &#x00026; she prized so warmly.</p>
<p>The Letters have all been copied, &#x00026; are now put past beside other similar precious ones. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle bids me say that we made out all the dates of those letters <hi rend="italic">not</hi> dated, he thinks almost <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> accurately; he thought you would perhaps be glad to have the original Letters also dated as the Copies are, so I have ventured to similarly date them.</p>
<p>It has given M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle true pleasure to hear often of you &#x00026; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Stirling from his Brother during the last Winter; he trusts sincerely that you are at least as well as when he last heard of you; though of late truly the variable weather has tried those not too strong at the best of times. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle himself has, as I know you will be pleased to hear, been pretty well on the whole, but he <hi rend="italic">does</hi> feel the cold and the sudden Changes of temperature very much too.

<p>Having so very often heard M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle speak of you &#x00026; of your kindness to them (from my earliest recollections) may I venture to offer my own kind regards&#x02014;</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Except the bitter March winds, which probably would not be news at Dumfries either, I have nothing that can deserve the name of tidings to convey: But Maggie &#x00026; I have been annihilating a great heap of rubbish here, &#x00026; the poor remnant saved here may perhaps be worth inclosing with the assurance that, in spite of these boisterous north Easters, we are all well. Tom Wilson&#x02019;s<note n="1" noteref="903">Thomas Wilson, probably still teaching in Weimar, although he had been intending to return to Britain; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721129-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-29">29 Nov. 1872</date></ref>.</note>

 Autograph &#x00026;c. came from, which done you may burn Tom. I myself can hardly read a syllable of the Christophine autograph, &#x00026; Miss Reichenbach&#x02019;s<note n="3" noteref="905">Either Elizabeth or Hedwig Reichenbach.</note>
 copy of it has but a dim sense to me anywhere, &#x00026; in the last stanza of it refuses to have any. If your superior skill both in Cursiv-Schrift &#x00026; literary style would make a brief sally upon it, perhaps you might succeed better.<note n="4" noteref="906">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1873-03-21">21 March</date>: &#x0201C;I return the German &#x00026; other articles &#x02026; except Wilson&#x02019;s letter which was difficult to read &#x00026; deserved nothing but the burning you ordered. I cannot make out the little poem &#x02018;Auferstehung <supplied>[Resurrection]</supplied>&#x02019; &#x00026; Miss R&#x02019;s copy of it can hardly be correct, for it makes no sense, especially in the first &#x00026; last stanzas.&#x0201D; &#x0201C;Cursiv-Schrift&#x0201D;: old German script.</note>
 If not don&#x02019;t waste time upon it, let it remain dark to this &#x00026; all generations. The little notice of Schiller&#x02019;s Friend Streicher, which came to me curiously from Chesterfield, is worth noticing &#x00026; at least reading to Jean.<note n="5" noteref="907">Johann Andreas Streicher (<date when="1761">1761</date>&#x02013;<date when="1833">1833</date>), German pianist and composer, close friend of Schiller. T. Frederick Smith wrote from Chesterfield, <date when="1873-03-17">17 March</date>, saying that as well as TC&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi> he had been reading &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x02019;s Leben und Werke von Emil Palleske</hi> (5th small ed. <date when="1872">1872</date>), and have found in the latter work two facts about the &#x02018;good Streicher&#x02019; which I think will be of interest to you. I therefore venture to send you two excerpts from Palleske.&#x0201D; Emil Palleske, <hi rend="italic">Schiller&#x02019;s Leben und Werke</hi>, 2 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1858">1858</date>) was trans., <date when="1860">1860</date>, by Grace, Lady Wallace (<date when="1804">1804</date>&#x02013;<date when="1878">78</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28532"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>); she ended her preface with a quotation from TC&#x02019;s &#x0201C;fine tribute to Schiller&#x0201D; (xi). Henry Inglis (<date when="1806">1806</date>&#x02013;<date when="1885">85</date>; see <ref target="volume-43/ed-43:biographical-notes"><sic>43:272</sic><corr>43:biographical notes</corr></ref>) translated the poetry.</note>
 I never heard of the Schiller <hi rend="italic">Bio-grapher</hi> from whom the words are quoted, nor does he state what the title of his book on Schiller is, otherwise one might conclude to buy it:&#x02014;but n&#x02019;importe, n&#x02019;importe.</p>
<p>Several days ago, a mass of Caledonian Railway remonstrances, criticisms &#x00026;c. came to me from one Richard Wilson of Edinburgh, &#x00026; others; by way of clearing my poor desk of an unsightly mass of rubbish I have first signed <pb id="pg-48-180" n="48:180"/>a Proxy for the said Wilson, &#x00026; subscribed ten shillings<note n="6" noteref="908">Richard Wilson (b. ca. <date when="1829">1829</date>), accountant, 28 Frederick St., Edinburgh. TC noted in his checkbook: &#x0201C;<date when="1873-03-20">20 March 1873</date> / Richard Wilson Esq / Caledonian Railway Shareholding Association / &#x000A3;0 .. 10 .. 0&#x0201D; (TC&#x02019;s checkbook; MS: NLS 20753).</note>
 to him for the purpose of helping to overhaul those ambitious Caledonian Directors, &#x00026; others of the like, &#x00026; compelling them to stand to their real business, &#x00026; give up their competitive &#x00026; other strategic &#x00026; ambitious operations. They have, those Caledonian Gentlemen have, so far as I can see the very best line for traffic that exists on the Planet; if they turn their attention almost exclusively towards the better &#x00026; better management of that, by promoting thrift, fidelity, punctuality &#x00026; safety over all their line, no Company in the World could surpass them in real success; &#x00026; it seemed to me that before burning that hat-ful of paper-litter I should give my vote &#x00026; half sovereign towards that side of the question. I had a sneaking expectation of some notice from you on the subject;<note n="7" noteref="909">John&#x02019;s letter, <date when="1873-03-20">20 March</date>, presumably crossed with TC&#x02019;s: &#x0201C;After due consideration I do not find it advisable to invest in Railway Shares just now. &#x02026; I should advise you to put your money on Deposit in the Bank, as I have put mine for the present.&#x0201D;</note>
 but none came, &#x00026; the gradually increasing litter became intolerable to me.&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>In looking at that matter with reference to the purchase of Shares, I think it may possibly take some considerable time before Railway matters settle again. If you, on considering &#x00026; inquiring are of that opinion, it would perhaps be proper to put the four thousand pounds at once into the shape of Bank Deposits; <hi rend="italic">changing</hi> them again <hi rend="italic">when</hi> Railway Shares do become safely purchasable? It is evidently proper to take the best Interest one can safely get, &#x00026; two per cent on 4,000&#x000A3; will amount to something noticeable every week. Consider this, &#x00026; write to me should you find it wise. I saw John Aitken yesterday at Chapman&#x02019;s looking brisk &#x00026; well; Mary has been here this morning d<hi rend="italic">o</hi> d<hi rend="italic">o</hi>,&#x02014;John had been at their great Soir&#x000E9;e last night,<note n="8" noteref="910">Peter and Clementia Taylor, Mary Aitken&#x02019;s employers, apparently held regular soir&#x000E9;es; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730205-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-02-05">5 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 his first appearance I think in any society in London! Mary, I think, is doing well, &#x00026; serving an apprenticeship that will be very useful to her: it is possible she, as well as John may join us at dinner next Sunday; but the Taylors themselves are to be off for Brighton tomorrow or even today.&#x02014; Tell Jean I read her letter with great sympathy, and affection, as both her Bairns have since done; nothing has so affected me for a good while as that departing phasis of poor Nith,<note n="9" noteref="911">&#x0201C;The dog&#x0201D; was inserted later (above &#x0201C;Nith&#x0201D;) by A. Carlyle.</note>
&#x02014;her last journey upstairs, the copy of her first; there is a force of gloomy depth in the inarticulate feeling of that poor dumb animal more eloquent than could lie in any words!&#x02014; Tell her further I have not failed to meditate her hint or request about the Johnstone Testimonial, but that I find it impossible to arrange <pb id="pg-48-181" n="48:181"/>myself under any clear category of his testifying Friends;<note n="10" noteref="912">John replied, <date when="1873-03-21">21 March</date>: &#x0201C;I can well understand your reluctance in having anything to do with Free Kirk testimonials. &#x02026; Jean will tell them her opinion that the money collected sh<hi rend="italic">d</hi> go direct to Mr Johnstone &#x00026; not be spent in buying any sort of silver plate for him in an ostentatious fashion.&#x0201D; For William Johnstone, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730104-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-01-04">4 Jan.</date></ref></note>
 &#x00026; that all I can with perfect truth say is, that I, vaguely, have always had a good opinion of him, &#x00026; am heartily sorry his finance so much requires the intervention of friends. I have therefore inclosed a ten pound for Jean herself, which I request her to forward for the Testimonial in her own name;<note n="11" noteref="913">TC&#x02019;s checkbook recorded: &#x0201C;<date when="1873-03-20">20 March 1873</date> / M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Jean C.

 she can call herself &#x0201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle Aitken&#x0201D; &#x00026; people will sufficiently know what Clan she is of.</p>
<p>Here is quite enough of writing about nothing, &#x00026; I may now fall back upon a mouthful of idle reading till my hour for sallying out arrive.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Yesterday we sent off the Richter Book for Jean; &#x00026; hope it has arrived safe. I meant well to send by the same Post the Four Thousand &#x00026; Fifty-Pound, but unhappily Miss Bromley stept in at the moment, &#x00026; she &#x00026; the wild stormy day <pb id="pg-48-182" n="48:182"/>swallowed me from all work from thenceforth. Today I send it, naturally with satisfaction that our notions in the matter have so coincided: tomorrow perhaps you can announce to me in a word that the Cheque has arrived safe,<note n="1" noteref="916">TC&#x02019;s checkbook noted: &#x0201C;<date when="1873-03-22">22 March 1873</date> / D<hi rend="italic">r</hi> J.

 &#x00026; that I can dismiss that matter out of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head. I am farther gratified that the Johnstone matter has been undertaken by Jean, &#x00026; seems to have been the true plan of managing that affair. Yesterday was a miserable cold slobber of hail, rain &#x00026; bitter wind: I made Miss Bromley take me up to Norton&#x02019;s (poor N. has had an attack of Pneumonia, &#x00026; been prisoner for many weeks, though now nearly well again);<note n="2" noteref="917">Charles Eliot Norton wrote in his journal, <date when="1873-03-20">20 March</date>: &#x0201C;Five weeks to-day since I was shut up by illness,&#x02014;a slight attack of pneumonia.

 he is a fine, gentle, intelligent &#x00026; affectionate creature, with whom I have always a pleasant, soothing &#x00026; interesting dialogue when we meet,&#x02014;the only fault yesterday was I liked it too well, &#x00026; staid too long. He read me a bit of letter, which reported Emerson&#x02019;s safe arrival in Paris, with &#x0201C;his age renewed&#x0201D; by his Egyptian Winter, &#x00026; in particular instead of the utterly bare, or slightly wooly scalp, a visible coat of hair growing again, or under way.

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Canada James&#x02019;<note n="1" noteref="926">Their nephew James Carlyle.</note>
 letter, which I now immediately return, pleases me very much. He writes in a distinct, brief &#x00026; lucid way; &#x00026; it seems to me he gives a clear answer as to his modest wishes, &#x00026; unpretending capabilities for farming as being decidedly the eligiblest-looking aspirations he has formed. You spoke more with him than I that day at Inverness,<note n="2" noteref="927">TC and John A. Carlyle met their nephews James and Alexander Carlyle in Inverness, <date when="1871-08-09">9 Aug. 1871</date>. Alexander later wrote: &#x0201C;We spent the whole day together, walking, dining and talking on endless subjects &#x02026; <supplied>[TC]</supplied> treated us most kindly &#x02026; and knowing we were going straight to London, wrote to his housekeeper &#x02026; telling her to use us well so long as we liked to stay in Cheyne Row&#x0201D; (&#x0201C;Jottings on Alexander Carlyle&#x02019;s Life and Work,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">Carlyle Annual</hi> 11 [<date when="1990">1990</date>]:70).

 &#x00026; may perhaps know more; but then, as in this letter, I discerned no signs of weakness or sluggishness in his character: &#x00026; it seems as if a modest, manageable little farm in his Father&#x02019;s neighbourhood is decidedly the tendency of his mind. My notion is you might with propriety (taking his Father into the consideration of the affair) intimate that if he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> find a likely farm, at a fair price, we could jointly advance the purchase money to him, depending on his honour, diligence &#x00026; integrity for paying the yearly instalment there,&#x02014;&#x00026; even for returning (if that could be a wish of his) to us or to our heirs here, the original purchase-money, should that ever be a possibility or a wish of his (which perhaps it won&#x02019;t)! If you took Alick himself into the Consult<hi rend="italic">n</hi>; &#x00026; received his consent before doing anything, it seems to me this would be a safe operation, &#x00026; the best that could be done for the poor fellow. But, for the rest, I leave the whole to your better study &#x00026; deliberation, &#x00026; merely say that I will go halves with you in whatever you decide on, that no kind of beneficence seems to me <hi rend="italic">so</hi> beneficent as that as helping a diligent young soul into tools &#x00026; arena, for the Work he is faithfully longing towards.<note n="3" noteref="928">John replied, <date when="1873-04-01">1 April</date>, that he had written to James: &#x0201C;I told him &#x02026; you would be ready along with me to assist in getting him the farm he wants near Brantford. &#x02026; <supplied>[H]</supplied>e should have the approval of his Father &#x00026; his brother Tom &#x02026; &#x00026; then &#x02026; we should be ready to furnish the money required.&#x0201D;</note>
</p>
<p>I am often thinking of poor Margaret Stewart&#x02019;s loss of her fine brood mare,<note n="4" noteref="929">Their widowed niece, Margaret Stewart, was running her farm on her own; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691103-TC-JAC-01"><sic>46:102</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1869-11-03">3 Nov. 1869</date></corr></ref>. John wrote, <date when="1873-04-01">1 April</date>: &#x0201C;Margaret&#x02019;s foal mare is not dead. &#x02026; It was James Austin who led me into mistake, thinking I was asking about a foal of his own.&#x0201D; He continued: &#x0201C;Margaret has really managed very well, &#x00026; made a good figure in farming without making any stir about it.&#x0201D; She was gradually paying back money lent by John: &#x0201C;It is really a pleasure to me to see how thriftily &#x00026; wisely &#x00026; temperately she has managed since her husband&#x02019;s death; &#x00026; she is very generous too on all hands to her Mother &#x00026; sisters.&#x0201D;</note>
 <pb id="pg-48-185" n="48:185"/>which will be very considerable to her, poor Soul. If you, who know her circumstances better, think she really <hi rend="italic">can</hi> support the evil, &#x00026; get over it without too much difficulty, perhaps it would be wise, &#x00026; charitable too, to leave her alone just now, (&#x00026; <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the end strengthened by consciousness of victory!)&#x02014; But if otherwise, &#x00026; we two can do anything, I will cheerfully go with you on the terms usual to us in such cases.</p>
<p>We have good March weather here also, but nothing like so warm as yours, or at least not till this day, our breath of wind, which is sometimes a very strong one, being always from the North East hitherto, with a dark fog till about eleven every morning. Forster is progressing slowly but steadily; wind to West, with weather dry would greatly accelerate him. Yesterday I had a pleasant walk with Froude (who is busy at the Record Office<note n="5" noteref="930">Public Record Office, Chancery Lane.</note>

 but made a holiday yesterday)&#x02014;&#x00026; with M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Norton the American, whom I find an extremely amiable man. He had no farther news of Emerson, who seemed to him to be amusing himself in that beautiful, but <hi rend="italic">too petrolean</hi> [fiery] City, where good Yankees go.

According to the report from the <hi rend="italic">Manchester Examiner</hi>&#x02019;s correspondent (quot: <hi rend="italic">The Freeman&#x02019;s Journal</hi>, <date when="1873-03-26">26 March</date>), Vaughan&#x02019;s message was that the Irish were the inheritors of the Jews as God&#x02019;s chosen people, who, through the spiritual training of oppression, wretchedness and poverty would rise to save the world: &#x0201C;It had not been to a comparatively great and powerful nation that the duty was entrusted of keeping alive religious truths in the ancient world when it was imposed upon the Jews; and in like manner, in the modern world, oppression, wretchedness, and their consequent poverty, were the blessed means by which the Irish were fitted for their sublime task of regenerating and purifying all the nations of the earth. &#x02026; The powers of the low Irish, as they were sometimes contemptuously called, were in reality at the present moment the greatest moral powers in the whole world. &#x02026; <supplied>[This]</supplied> was a force different from that of the hypocritical kings and ministers and parliaments, the legalised bandits who, in all European countries, were now oppressing and persecuting the Church.&#x0201D;</note>
 read it with attention, with amazement. It transcends all hierophantic utterances I have ever heard.

I am in my usual state of torpid health, fixedly mournful, though not miserable spirits &#x00026; contemplations; &#x00026; (paper being done) will add no more.

<p><salute>Dear Lady,</salute></p>
<p>For the last two weeks I have been expecting to hear from you, &#x00026; sometimes fretting myself with conjectures why I didn&#x02019;t; but at length it struck me that our last two letters crossed one another on the road, &#x00026; that probably you are expecting first to hear from me again. I write a word therefore; so except what the &#x0201C;Times&#x0201D; newspaper will already have told you, there is no news from this quarter of the world; as in particular from this house in Chelsea, there is absolutely none for the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> or any other vehicle. Maggie &#x00026; I go on here with the utmost composure; are in a silence which is probably beyond example between this &#x00026; Rome. I do know nothing, am good for nothing but idle, or semi-idle reading, all the forenoon; take a gloomily peaceful walk along the Park, with company or without, I am careless which; return home wearied to death about six o&#x02019;clock, smoke my Calumet of peace, drink my drop of Brandy grog, grind my three snaps of peppery parkins, &#x00026; tumble into my warm wrappages (the chief of them a certain yellow-brown extensive sheet, as soft as eider, &#x00026; as snugly warm) upstairs, in my excellent dark cell of a bedroom, &#x00026; fall sound asleep, quiescent as a stone for one hour; generally by far the soundest hour I get in the course of the four &#x00026; twenty. After what is called &#x0201C;dinner&#x0201D; (a thing I would daily give a guinea or more to anybody who <hi rend="italic">could</hi> eat for me), &#x00026; then after the chaotic half hour, of what in the language of flattery is again called sleep, followed by the languid feeble tottery walk along the streets, &#x00026; the due cup of tea that follows it, I get out my &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">good</hi> book,&#x0201D; &#x00026; sit reading there, Maggie also reading or knitting opposite to me, &#x00026; as quiet as a dream; in which attitude we sit, not a sound to be heard within doors or without till one A.M. come; &#x00026; some imagination of supper closes up the torpid day: one other day of my remaining few thus gone to its account,&#x02014;conscience often mournfully <pb id="pg-48-187" n="48:187"/>asking &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">How</hi>?&#x0201D; &#x00026; mournfully answering &#x0201C;but, Alas, could <hi rend="italic">I</hi> help it?&#x0201D; I feel as if the Winter, horrid, muddy, dark &#x00026; torpid season as it was, had done me sensible mischief, &#x00026; that I feel perceptibly weaker than ever before. But perhaps this is mostly a morbid imagination too, &#x00026; it is possible the fine Spring weather, which is at last come, may perhaps restore my strength a little. At any rate, as I often whisper to myself, I am still left graciously <hi rend="italic">Here</hi>, permitted for a season to gaze with pious wonder into the Eternal Mystery near at hand, &#x00026; with unspeakable reflections of mute awe &#x00026; wonder, consider what has been, &#x00026; what can yet be. Without spleen I may call myself sated of life, ready to go when my hour comes, &#x00026; entirely Commander-in-Chief at last of my poor wreck of a world, till <hi rend="italic">it</hi> please to disappear from me altogether. This what I suppose Philosophers call Euthanasia; if Old Age be a blessing (which I doubt, or rather don&#x02019;t believe) then this is it; &#x00026; so let us all be thankful,&#x02014;&#x00026; quit these unfathomable subjects for others more practical on this occasion.</p>
<p>The one point I had to urge concerning my last letter was, that there went along with it, a Copy of &#x0201C;Schiller&#x0201D; for Mary. Do not forget to tell me the next time that the dear little Bairn has got it:<note n="1" noteref="935">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730308-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1873-03-08">8 March</date>.</ref> Mary Florence Baring wrote from Rome, <date when="1873-04-28">28 April</date>: &#x0201C;I am so sorry not to have written before to thank you for sending me the Life of Schiller it will be doubly precious to me as coming from you. &#x02026; We see so many things that it is like a new world opening to one. &#x02026; I want so much to read some of the Middle Age history of Rome do you think Sismondi would be too old for me?&#x0201D; Jean Charles L&#x000E9;onard de Sismondi, <hi rend="italic">Histoire des r&#x000E9;publiques italiennes au moyen &#x000E2;ge</hi>, 16 vols.

 if there has been any failure, we will at once send another Copy for there are plenty here, &#x00026; I want Mary to read that innocent &#x0201C;Supplement&#x0201D;; which seems to me to hold in it a beautiful little picture of human life, such as these tempestuous, loud-rumbling nugget ages do not any longer offer,&#x02014;more is the pity, for said ages &#x00026; us. Gold nuggets, &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">&#x00026; nothing to buy</hi> with them,&#x0201D; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is not a good condition for an Age!&#x02014;</p>

 some haggle with that arch-quack and son of Beelzebub, Architect Clutton! Forster, however, has vigilantly his eye upon it, and I firmly believe will do whatever is humanly <hi rend="italic">doable</hi> in the matter. He called here yesterday, the first time he has been for many months; he had got your letter; had written to Clutton and expected soon to have a face to face meeting with that man of frauds and bunglings.<note n="3" noteref="937">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730427-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-04-27">27 April</date></ref>. Forster had written to Lady Ashburton, <date when="1873-03-10">10 March</date> that he was in some doubt &#x0201C;As to the degree of blame fairly attributable to Mr Clutton in regard to the obstructions and hindrances which have given you so much annoyance. Without clearer information as to this, I could hardly advise you. &#x02026; The object of this letter therefore is &#x02026; to ask you to send me a letter <hi rend="italic">asking Mr Clutton to see me</hi> simply as your friend in the matter&#x0201D; (MS: NLS Acc. 11388).</note>

In a former interview Forster, who had just been consulting with Waterhouse<note n="4" noteref="938">James William Waterhouse, solicitor; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730308-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A., <date when="1873-03-08">8 March</date></ref>.</note>
 about this affair, seemed to see nothing positive in it at that time, but the clear desirability of Waterhouse also being gently laid upon the shelf, for behoof of your Ladyship&#x02019;s affairs; a man unstable as water, Forster seemed to say; capable of veering round the whole compass in regard to any practical point; and in fact, equivalent to zero, and of know-nothingism, if Clutton was a ditto of subtle knowery,<note n="5" noteref="939">Probably &#x0201C;knavery.&#x0201D;</note>
 &#x00026; still more dangerous qualities. Truly my very heart is sad for you, dear Lady, in the midst of such an imbroglio! I am very sure Forster&#x02019;s business quality is of a very superior order, &#x00026; also that if he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do anything for you, he will faithfully and eagerly do it. I am in quiet hope that he actually <hi rend="italic">will</hi> (consulting with Lady Marion candidly surveying matters with his own best insight) <hi rend="italic">do</hi> some real good.</p>
<p>But the grand question with me now is, when you yourself are to appear on the scene again, &#x00026; let us see you in temporary settlement in England for the summer? I myself vaguely scheme out Seaforth Lodge as the prettiest position for you I can think of. If, as I suppose, the Water question<note n="6" noteref="940">For the water problem at Seaforth, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720822-TC-LLA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-08-22">22</date></ref> and <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720824-TC-LLA-01"><date when="1872-08-24">[24] Aug. 1872</date></ref>.</note> was all got settled about Christmas time, &#x00026; those huge pumps (the sound of which I shall never forget) fairly supplied with an inexhaustible current, there is not in England or the world a prettier little jewel of a residence; Melchet &#x00026; London alike accessible to it, both; wholesome breezes to be found in England; all your friends within reach &#x00026; the place your own&#x02014;I cannot think of any place so fit for dear little Mary &#x00026; you. Rome, I suppose, must be already getting too hot, &#x00026; our brightness of Spring is already fairly beginning. What can you do so wise as come home; &#x00026; especially as your health seems now to be taking a favourable turn. Tell me about this, all you can as yet, especially about that latter point, your health, which I naturally regard as more important than any other. Your Doctor Pianta Leone, I find, is an old Roman acquaintance of my brother&#x02019;s, a most acute, intelligent &#x00026; clever little man he says; by far the best Doctor he ever met in Italy; this was his experience 40 or 30 years ago.<note n="7" noteref="941">Dr. Diomede Pantaleoni (<date when="1810">1810</date>&#x02013;<date when="1885">85</date>), Italian doctor and politician.

He was small in stature but most active, had studied abroad &#x02026; &#x00026; also had the art of ingratiating himself with rich foreigners.&#x0201D;</note>

 I dimly guess that whatever was unusual in it must have sprung chiefly or altogether from Allingham&#x02019;s rather than any other person&#x02019;s loose tongue, and that it is a thing at any rate altogether superficial &#x00026; capable of being altogether expunged from your consideration. To me both she &#x00026; her husband seemed to feel truly obliged to you; (as they might well do) for your cordial welcome, &#x00026; the visible service you have done them.</p>
<p>Froude is busy the whole day now over his Irish Records &#x00026; foundations of Vol. 2nd, unless he play truant some day for my sake, it is usually only on Sundays that I see him. His volume on Ireland is visibly rising in Public Opinion; indeed I believe it will form an epoch in regard to our relations with Ireland, &#x00026; mode of dealing with that unutterable bit of savagery. The People&#x02019;s William though again got on the top of his dung-heap, is not thought to be long for that sorry elevation: No man in my time has made to me a more fantastic, dishonest and utterly imbecile appearance than the People&#x02019;s William, in his attempt to govern the British Empire by choosing Cardinal Cullen<note n="10" noteref="944">Paul Cullen; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730307-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-03-07">7 March</date>.</ref></note>
 &#x00026; his tag-rag of Irish savagery, as a fulcrum for that operation. Various reports are current about him; sometimes of his still crowing very high in bright moments; but it is generally understood that his crowing days are numbered; &#x00026; that no mortal can guess what delirious mischief &#x00026; nonsense he may yet embark in, when driven down from his sublime dung-heap, &#x00026; obliged to scratch for worms in a subaltern position. Let him fight his own battle, however, why should I expectorate my spleen upon him. One strong rumour I have heard, that he wishes (being dreadfully astounded with his discovery of Strauss &#x00026; Company)<note n="11" noteref="945">David Friedrich Strauss (<date when="1808">1808</date>&#x02013;<date when="1874">74</date>), German liberal theologian and philosopher, who distinguished between Jesus as a historical figure and the &#x0201C;myth&#x0201D; of his divinity.

In his introduction he frankly raises the question whether, considering the progress which culture has now made, there is any longer occasion to maintain religious worship in any form whatever&#x0201D;; he advised the students, &#x0201C;in preparing yourselves for the combat of life, I beg you to take this also into your account, that the spirit of denial is abroad, and has challenged all religion &#x02026; to a combat of life and death&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1872-12-23">23 Dec. 1872</date>).

<p>This day I had decided to write to you though without other purpose than that of quashing any groundless anxieties that might be pressing in about me: but in getting down stairs there presents itself, come by Post a sufficient mass of idle written matter to form a Post packet simply on its own account.

 He is very gentle, very amiable, clear &#x00026; wonderfully happy, but <pb id="pg-48-194" n="48:194"/>I do not get much solid talk with him, nor indeed does is much avail me when I do.<note n="16" noteref="964">&#x0201C;Is&#x0201D; in error for &#x0201C;it&#x0201D;; Norton wrote in his diary, <date when="1873-04-12">12 April</date>: &#x0201C;The difference between Emerson and Carlyle is very wide &#x02026; the outcome of their creeds and philosophies is so unlike as to limit their mutual sympathies. &#x02026; They will be friends to the end; but neither is dependent for sympathy on the other&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:477).</note>

<p>For the last two weeks we have had extremely uncomfortable weather, wild blasts of continual east wind; which I think must have been unfavourable to me on the health score:&#x02014;it seems as if I had been living in a perpetual <hi rend="italic">pluister</hi>, deeper than usual, &#x00026; generally of a slightly deeper tint of gloom, about all I have been doing or saying. What a contrast between Warrand Carlyle &#x00026; me, though he is within six months as old as I am.<note n="18" noteref="966">TC was b. <date when="1795-12">Dec. 1795</date>, Warrand Carlyle (previously Carlile), b. <date when="1796">1796</date>.</note>
 Courage, Courage nevertheless. Forster I have not seen for above a week, but I hear he is going on prosperously in spite of the weather: my last sight of him was at a dinner still more unwholesome than Froude&#x02019;s,&#x02014;the chief guest there being Lytton Bulwer&#x02019;s Son &#x00026; Heir, now Lord Lytton the second, who is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a man to get into dyspepsia for, though a very much superior person (as I judge) to his foolish Father, now vanished from the World.<note n="19" noteref="967">Edward Robert Bulwer Lytton, 2d Baron Lytton, succeeded on the death, <date when="1873-01-18">18 Jan.</date>, of his father, Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer, 1st Baron; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730211-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A., <date when="1873-02-11">11 Feb.</date></ref></note>
 But why do I go on with all this my dear Brother; there is nothing here that profits you or me.</p>
<p>We had a note this morning, by the by, from Mary, who professes to have quite recovered her little whiff of illness or incommodity, &#x00026; to be now doing well in spite of the cold. John also was here this morning, is gone to the Library on my account for books, &#x00026; is due here directly intending to go with Maggie to the National Portrait Gallery this afternoon. I know not whether &#x0201C;Easter Monday&#x0201D; also is a holiday, but he has already had two, which were very welcome. Adieu dear Brother. Give my love to Jean &#x00026; everyone.

<p>M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Norton, the writer of that note,<note n="1" noteref="969">Norton wrote, <date when="1873-04-13">13 April</date>: &#x0201C;I enclose a note which Ruskin wrote some year or two, or even more, since, addressed to the Translator of Omar Khayyam, that &#x02018;Old Mohammedan blackguard,&#x02019; as you call him. He took a fancy to the productions of the reprobate poet, and he left this note with an acquaintance of mine to be forwarded to the translator if ever his name should be discovered. The note has been lying all this while in a desk, and I am asked now to ask you to forward it.&#x0201D; The &#x0201C;acquaintance of mine&#x0201D; was presumably Georgiana Burne-Jones, b. Macdonald (<date when="1840">1840</date>&#x02013;<date when="1920">1920</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58271"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), as identified by Norton in his letter to her, <date when="1902-05-22">22 May 1902</date> (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:425&#x02013;27), rather than her husband, Edward Burne-Jones (<date when="1833">1833</date>&#x02013;<date when="1898">98</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4051"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), artist, whose copy of the poem Ruskin had read (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:414&#x02013;15).</note>
 is a distinguished American (Co-Editor for a long time of the North American Review) an extremely amiable, intelligent &#x00026; worthy man; with whom I have had some pleasant walks, dialogues &#x00026; other communications, of late months;&#x02014;in the course of which he brought to my knowledge, for the first time, your notable <hi rend="italic">Omar Khayyam</hi>,<note n="2" noteref="970">FitzGerald first pbd. <hi rend="italic">The Rub&#x000E1;iy&#x000E1;t of Omar Khayy&#x000E1;m</hi> (<date when="1859">1859</date>) anonymously, at his own expense.</note>
 &#x00026; insisted on giving me a Copy from the third edition, which I now possess, &#x00026; duly prize. From him too, by careful cross-questioning, I identified, beyond dispute, the hidden &#x0201C;Fitzgerald,&#x0201D; the Translator,&#x02014;&#x00026; indeed found that his complete silence &#x00026; unique modesty in regard to said meritorious &#x00026; successful performance, was simply a feature of my own <hi rend="italic">Edward F</hi>.!<note n="3" noteref="971">Norton noted in his diary, <date when="1872-12-09">9 Dec. 1872</date>: &#x0201C;Carlyle told me that he had known Edward FitzGerald well, though he had not heard of his translation of Omar Khayy&#x000E1;m till I mentioned it to him&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:439).</note>
&#x02014; The translation is excellent; the Book itself a kind of jewel in its way,<note n="4" noteref="972">Norton later recalled TC saying: &#x0201C;I&#x02019;ve read that little book which you sent to me, and I think my old friend FitzGerald might have spent his time to much better purpose than in busying himself with the verses of that old Mohammedan blackguard&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:426).</note>
 I do Norton&#x02019;s mission without the least delay, as you perceive; Ruskins&#x02019;s message to you passes through my hands sealed.<note n="5" noteref="973">Ruskin wrote, <date when="1863-09-02">2 Sept. 1863</date>: &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">My dear &#x00026; very dear Sir</hi> / I do not know in the least who you are, but I do with all my soul pray you to find and translate some more of Omar Khayy&#x000E1;m for us: I never did&#x02014;till this day&#x02014;read anything so glorious, to my mind as this poem&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:416).</note>

&#x02014;discharging you completely, at the same time, from ever returning me this letter, or taking any notice of it, except a small silent one.</p>
<p>I don&#x02019;t see Emerson since Sunday last, &#x00026; am a little anxious about the question of his health you mentioned when we last met.</p>

The effect that Carlyle has on him is always beneficial, and their humours played well together.

<p><salute>My dear Brother</salute></p>
<p>The third Post card missive, came this morning, kindly announcing, though in such hurry, that your Edinburgh journey, with all its errands, had got prosperously terminated.<note n="1" noteref="980">John A. Carlyle had been in Edinburgh to receive his degree of LL.D.; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730226-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-02-26">26 Feb.</date></ref>, <date when="1873-03-08">8 March</date>, and <date when="1873-04-12">12 April</date>. He wrote, <date when="1873-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x0201C;The graduation was gone through in excellent style, &#x00026; there were about 160 graduates in all, but only four LL.D.s &#x00026; four D.D.s who sat in the two front seats. &#x02026; I brought away with me what is called a &#x02018;cowl,&#x02019; sky-blue on the outside, &#x00026; very questionable in shape as you may see some day.&#x0201D; While there he had visited various friends, including JWC&#x02019;s aunts at Morningside; see also <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721227-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-12-27">27 Dec. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 Many thanks for your punctuality in carrying me along with you throughout. These Post cards<note n="2" noteref="981">John replied, <date when="1873-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x0201C;My postal cards, as you remark, were rather disorderly, but I had no time for any formal letter or details of any sort.&#x0201D; For John&#x02019;s earlier use of postcards, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720330-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-03-30">30 March 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 are very handy, but they have one considerable drawback, that of letting the whole world into your family &#x00026; other secrets, which entirely condemns them in my practice; indeed I rather disapprove of the invention altogether, &#x00026; for my own share have always preferred any odd bit of paper, slipped into an actual impenetrable cover at the expense of one halfpenny more! I have no doubt various people, Post office clerks &#x00026; the like learned at Edinburgh &#x00026; here how you were to dine with Blackie, to call at Peebles<note n="3" noteref="982">John wrote, <date when="1873-04-20">20 April</date>: &#x0201C;I mean to take poor Mrs Hunter, who lives solitary at Peebles, on my way <supplied>[home]</supplied> &#x00026; spend a few hours with her. She has lost her husband, three of her sons &#x00026; one daughter, &#x00026; now has only two daughters left, one in Liverpool &#x00026; the other in India.&#x0201D; Helen Hunter, widow of John&#x02019;s friend John Hunter, living at Kingsmuir House, Peebles; her surviving das., Jane and Henrietta, were married to John A. Carlyle&#x02019;s step-sons, Henry and Arthur Watt (see under John A. Carlyle, biographical notes). John wrote, <date when="1873-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x0201C;I found Mrs Hunter looking very thin &#x00026; worn, but resigned to what has taken place in the loss of her husband &#x00026; children.&#x0201D;</note>
 &#x00026;c. &#x00026;c,&#x02014;though indeed <hi rend="italic">except to one&#x02019;s imagination</hi> it made no matter at all. John Aitken amused me the other day by reporting how some fellow clerk in Chapman&#x02019;s office na&#x000EF;vely applied to him for help to read one of those Post cards he was handing to him from the Postman,&#x02014;&#x0201C;cannot quite make out this sentence,&#x0201D; said the na&#x000EF;ve clerk.</p>
<p>In return I have next to nothing, or altogether nothing of news to tell you. Except indeed that Emerson is just leaving us, &#x00026; that except in Edinburgh, about ten days; hence, I know not where there is any chance of meeting him. He came down hither day before yesterday, sat about a couple of hours, talking <pb id="pg-48-198" n="48:198"/>cheerfully in his mild, modest, ingenious but rather theoretic way; &#x00026; then rose inexorably to go for Forster&#x02019;s, who had asked him to dinner for this (Saturday) night, but was to find him inexorably engaged elsewhere. So he went his way, &#x00026; it is probable I shall see him no more, as he departs punctually tomorrow morning for Merthyr Tydvyll, Oxford, Manchester &#x00026;c. &#x00026;c; nothing fixed but that he <hi rend="italic">is to be</hi> in Edinburgh, &#x00026; that he sails with Norton from Liverpool on the 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of next month. I think sometimes the Edinburgh University people should give him a public dinner;<note n="4" noteref="983">John replied, <date when="1873-04-27">27 April</date>: &#x0201C;As to Emerson I dont think there could be any chance for a public dinner in honour of him just now. All the professors &#x02026; are out on holiday till the middle of May.&#x0201D;</note>
 things of the kind have been proposed here, but given up, or perhaps declined; Edinburgh is perhaps the fitter place, if any place can be fit. Should you be writing to Masson, you might fling out such a hint?&#x02014;&#x02014;&#x02014;</p>
<p>&#x02014;&#x02014;Alas, a good while before this (about the top of last page in fact) a flood of mostly stupid interruptions poured in &#x00026; still continues: Out, out upon it! I have not time for another word.</p>
<p>Tell Jean that Mary came to me yesterday, sat a good while talking, &#x00026; seemed well-doing &#x00026; cheerful. John is here at this moment intending a journey with Maggie to Hampstead to call for M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>. Frankau,<note n="5" noteref="984">Rosetta Frankau, widowed sister of Joseph Neuberg, living at Roslyn Park, Hampstead.</note>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>I suppose you are meditating now &#x00026; then upon your Summer movements, &#x00026; how to repair a little the injuries that Winter brings upon us; &#x00026; I have been expecting latterly to hear something from you on that subject.<note n="1" noteref="986">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1873-05-08">8 May</date>: &#x0201C;I have not yet formed any plans for the summer, except that I shall in any case endeavour first of all to see you again in Chelsea. &#x02026; I could start for Chelsea next week if that would suit you, say about the Thursday or Friday, &#x00026; then we should be able to talk over all plans that might suggest themselves.&#x0201D;</note>
 It is very natural &#x00026; proper to employ to one&#x02019;s best advantage the bright months of the year &#x00026; gain a little new strength, if it be possible! I myself feel to have suffered very considerably from the dark muddy Winter that is passed; &#x00026; if I had any <pb id="pg-48-199" n="48:199"/>basis to work upon (that is to say if I had any place in the world where I could be reasonably sure of getting sleep), I should really incline to migrate a little &#x00026; shift about on the green surface of the Earth. But with me that preliminary consideration is usually a check-mate; &#x00026; I have to continue in my own cell, which is at least utterly silent, till the heat &#x00026; smoulder burn me out.</p>
<p>For you it is considerably different;&#x02014;&#x00026; in case you should be thinking of Chelsea as a primary stepping stone (which you mentioned in one of your notes lately) I write to say that Chelsea is now, &#x00026; at all times perfectly open to you; &#x00026; that a change thither might probably elucidate the matter to both of us. I am today in rather special hurry &#x00026; special disability; but wish to say this before undertaking anything else;&#x02014;&#x00026; indeed I have nothing else that it is worth while to say at present.</p>
<p>Within an hour I expect Forster, who is to carry me up to Norton&#x02019;s (too far for a walk),<note n="2" noteref="987">The distance from Cheyne Row to Cleveland Sq. is about 3&#x000BD; mi. (5.5 km.); presumably TC meant it was too far for Forster to walk.</note>
 &#x00026; there to bid the good Norton Farewell along with me.

 &#x00026; has been all through Winter the most human &#x00026; really interesting of all the companions, or fellow-promenaders I had. And now to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> also there is Finis. Of Emerson I hear nothing whatever; but suppose him to be flourishing &#x00026; of good cheer at Edinburgh or wherever his wanderings lead him. He is an excellent, pure &#x00026; placid soul; the only fault I have to him, that which the Prophet Isaiah expresses in these words &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">Woe</hi> to them that are at ease in Zion&#x0201D;!<note n="4" noteref="989">Not Isaiah, but Amos; see Amos 6:1.</note>
 His Daughter is a much more determined kind of person; at least so I judge from this trait of her, that she openly expresses her utter weariness &#x00026; disgust at the Nigger, &#x00026; has one hope concerning him, that he will utterly perish out of the way of the United States, where he is nothing but a superfluity &#x00026; nuisance. This, after such an expenditure of broken bones &#x00026; exploded human brains upon the Controversy, is a little strong!&#x02014;&#x02014; Froude is intensely busy upon his final Irish volume, &#x00026; when I see him has nothing else that he is so free to talk upon. I confess my feeling sometimes about Cardinal Cullen &#x00026; his conciliation of his Paddy Savagery is a little analagous to Miss Emerson&#x02019;s about the Niggers.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>I must not let this otherwise utterly idle Saturday quite pass without a word of answer to your last letter, which was very welcome to me; there is nothing to hinder you, from coming up to us any day you like; nor, since you have already decided to come, does there seem to be the least reason for putting the day off beyond your own best convenience. Unless we hear to the contrary therefore, let us from this day expect you sometime about the end of next week.<note n="1" noteref="995">John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1873-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x0201C;<supplied>[I]</supplied> hope to be with you again in time for dinner on Friday evening.&#x0201D; He planned to go via Liverpool to visit his step-son Henry Watt.</note>
 Some day toward the <hi rend="italic">end</hi> of the week (not Saturday I suppose for the Crowded Railway&#x02019;s sake; you can judge of that yourself far better than I): let us know the day before if not sooner, &#x00026; your room &#x00026; every thing will lie ready. You never found me <hi rend="italic">idler</hi> than I am at this time, &#x00026; indeed am obliged to be, having neither strength nor spirit for anything worth calling employment: a series of little walks or excursions with you would probably be a wholesomer resource than any other open for me at present.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-201" n="48:201"/>Today I have spent, for example, wearisomely reading Browning&#x02019;s last new Poem,<note n="2" noteref="996">Browning&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Red Cotton Night-Cap Country, or Turf and Towers</hi> (<date when="1873">1873</date>), based on the scandalous story of Antoine Mellerio (<date when="1827">1827</date>&#x02013;<date when="1870">70</date>), heir of the French jewelry house Mellerio dits Meller.

B<hi rend="small-caps">rowning&#x02019;s</hi> poem. &#x02026; is a poetic version of a great tragedy which came before the law-courts in a department in the North of France last year, and &#x02026; the poet has in the outlines of the story kept closely to the facts&#x0201D; (440). Allingham wrote in his diary, <date when="1873-05-12">12 May</date>: &#x0201C;C. tells the story [of Browning&#x02019;s poem] very clearly (he always likes doing this kind of feat), and says there are &#x02018;ingenious remarks here and there; but nobody out of Bedlam ever before thought of choosing such a theme&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Allingham Diary</hi> 224&#x02013;25).</note>
 which was forced upon me yesterday by Forster;&#x02014;I do think the despicablest, most conceited &#x00026; utterly worthless performance I ever met with from the hand of a man of talent! I have still perhaps a hundred pages of it to read, &#x00026; vote then that I never think of it or hear of it more. Poor Browning: as Forster says, &#x0201C;he is really gone altogether to the Bad.&#x0201D;&#x02014; Yesterday I took leave of Norton, who came down to have one last walk with me, but to our regret the walk was interrupted by rain, &#x00026; then he had to call a cab, being rather on the sick-list at present; &#x00026; I had to take shelter at Forster&#x02019;s, which was close by,<note n="3" noteref="997">In his journal Norton described his final walk, <date when="1873-05-09">9 May</date>, with TC: &#x0201C;As we were going up Queen&#x02019;s Gate the rain began to fall and during one shower we sought shelter under a porch. The shower passed and we started to walk again, but before we had reached the Park the rain began again, more heavily than ever. &#x02026; We hailed a hansom, Carlyle said I might take him to Forster&#x02019;s, close by. &#x02026; &#x02018;I&#x02019;m sorry to have ye go. The relations between us this winter have been very humane,&#x02019; were among his last words to me. He was very grave, very tender, and my last sight of him was as he waved farewell to me with his hand from Forster&#x02019;s door&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:500&#x02013;1).</note>
&#x02014;whence this Browning infliction, which I would gladly have avoided, had not Forster been so irresistible. I was really sorry to part with Norton, &#x00026; his interesting family of little Motherless children,<note n="4" noteref="998">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730509-TC-MN-01">TC to MN, <date when="1873-05-09">9 May</date>.</ref></note>

Norton recalled in his journal: &#x0201C;As we went out of the door I spoke to Carlyle of the sad news of Mill&#x02019;s death. He had not even heard of his illness, and he was deeply moved at hearing thus without preparation of his death. &#x02018;What! John Mill dead! Dear me, Dear me! John Mill! how did he die and where? And it&#x02019;s so long since I&#x02019;ve seen him, and he was the friendliest of men to me when I was in need of friends. Dear me! It&#x02019;s all over now. I never knew a finer, tenderer, more sensitive or modest soul among the sons of men. There never was a more generous creature than he, nor a more modest. He and I were great friends&#x02019;&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:495&#x02013;96).</note>
 I had heard no whisper of <pb id="pg-48-202" n="48:202"/>such a thing before; &#x00026; a great black sheet of mournful more or less tragic memories, not about Mill alone, rushed down upon me: Poor Mill, he too has worked out his Life Drama in sight of me; &#x00026; that scene too has closed before my old eyes, though he was so much my junior!&#x02014; Goose Waylen<note n="8" noteref="1002">James Waylen, Wiltshire historian and artist, now living at 6 Cheyne Row; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721129-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-29">29 Nov. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 came down to me today very dirty, very enthusiastic, very stupid &#x00026; confused with a daily newspaper &#x0201C;containing two Articles ineffably sublime &#x00026; heart interesting upon Mill&#x0201D; one little bit of which he read, &#x00026; then pressed the paper on me; which I thinking it had been &#x0201C;the Times&#x0201D; accepted, with the thought of sending it to you.

A century may go by before men may be instructed again by a mind at once so acute and so intrepidly logical. &#x02026; Fifty or sixty years hence, when our thoughts and doings shall have become a subject of study, it is not to Parliamentary debates or to the lives of statesmen that inquirers will go to for the explanation of its character. They will search the pages of Carlyle for its mournful yearnings, and the pages of Mill for its systematised aims and thoughts. The one is its chief seer, the other has been its greatest philosophical teacher, and they have done more, perhaps, than any other Englishmen to give our period its shape and time.&#x0201D; For a second <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> report, see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730517-TC-HM-01">TC to HM, <date when="1873-05-17">17 May</date>.</ref></note>

<p><salute>Dear Miss Mill</salute></p>
<p>Your little note is very touching &#x00026; pathetic to me; &#x00026; I regret much that that poor story of the burnt Manuscript had ever oozed out (what surely was not owing to me or to <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>) into the ear or the imagination of the idle Public; or especially that the babbling newspapers should have brought it home to your sad heart in these solemn moments.<note n="1" noteref="1007">Harriet Mill wrote, <date when="1873-05-15">15 May</date>: &#x0201C;In all the more elaborate accounts of my dear brothers life, in the Newspapers, there are some mistakes; But in the notice in the D. Telegraph of Saturday [<date when="1873-05-10">10 May</date>], mention is made of the unhappy loss of your Manuscript.&#x0201D;</note>
 My clear advice is that you dismiss it wholly from your thoughts as a thing, which to me is now grown a No-thing,&#x02014;nay has even risen (by the sacred memories connected with it) to be a real possession, which it is blessed for me, &#x00026; as it were sacred, to look back upon!<note n="2" noteref="1008">TC learned from Mill on the evening of <date when="1835-03-06">6 March 1835</date> that his MS of the first vol. of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> had been burned; for TC&#x02019;s view of the incident at the time, see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350307-TC-JFR-01"><sic>8:66&#x02013;68</sic><corr>TC to JFR, <date when="1835-03-07">7 March 1835</date></corr></ref>, and for his later recollection, see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi> 92&#x02013;93. TC told Norton during their walk, <date when="1873-05-09">9 May</date>, about the loss of the MS, &#x0201C;a calamity quite irreparable&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">Norton&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 1:496).</note>
 This is truly the character of it to all that are concerned&#x02014;both to me, who still linger on this Earth, &#x00026; to your dear Brother whose memory alone now remains to us.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph writer in all his details of the matter is purely imaginary; though by no means disobliging either to me or to Him who is gone;<note n="3" noteref="1009">The <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi> reported, <date when="1873-05-10">10 May</date>: &#x0201C;Carlyle was writing at the time his &#x02018;History of the French Revolution&#x02019;. &#x02026; He had lent the manuscript of the first volume to Mill, who handed it on to Mrs. Taylor. &#x02026; One day, as Mr. and Mrs. Carlyle were sitting in their house in Chelsea, a cab rattled to the door, and John Mill immediately afterwards came into the room. Instead of saluting his friends, he threw himself down in a seat by the fireside, and buried his face in his hands with a passion that betokened speechless grief. Carlyle kindly asked what was the matter. Mill sobbed out, &#x02018;The manuscript! the manuscript!&#x02019; and rushed out of the room in a state of uncontrollable emotion. The sad truth was that Mrs. Taylor, to whom he had lent the manuscript, had left it lying on the table of her library, that it had fallen on the floor, and that some stupid servant, fancying it to be waste paper, had used it to light a fire! At first the loss seemed irreparable, for Carlyle had no copy of the manuscript, and his rough notes gave scarcely a fragmentary basis for what was really a great epic rather than a history. That fact drove Mill into a state almost of despair. &#x02026; Then, with a wonderful exercise of will and intellect, the great historian sat down to compose once more his magnificent rhapsody.&#x0201D;</note>
 &#x00026; in fact my impression really was, that night when your Brother came to us <pb id="pg-48-204" n="48:204"/>pale &#x00026; agitated, as I have seldom seen any mortal, that M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor&#x02019;s house &#x00026; some trifling neglect there, had been the cause of the catastrophe;<note n="4" noteref="1010">Harriet Mill wrote: &#x0201C;M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor is described as the &#x02018;heroine&#x02019;&#x02014;(a sad misnomer) of that incident. As far as my recollection goes, the misfortune arose from my brother&#x02019;s own inadvertence, in having given your papers amongst waste paper for kitchen use. I can perfectly well remember our search and my dear brother&#x02019;s extreme distress. &#x02026; My brother would surely have told you exactly how the disaster had come about; and if I am right, I should much wish to have this published account corrected.&#x0201D; TC told Norton that it had been burnt at Harriet Taylor&#x02019;s house. By the time of TC&#x02019;s death, Harriet Mill accepted that it had not been burned in the Mill household; see <ref target="volume-08/lt-18350307-TC-JFR-01"><sic>8:68</sic><corr>TC to JFR, <date when="1835-03-07">7 March 1835</date></corr></ref>.</note>
&#x02014;but in fact, to prevent him almost perishing with excess of misery, we had to forbear all questioning on the subject, which indeed was of no importance to either of us, &#x00026; to bid him &#x0201C;Be of Courage, never mind, Be certain I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> write it again &#x00026; will&#x0201D;! He sat a long time with us gathering some composure; &#x00026; I for ever since remember the beautiful &#x00026; heroic encouragement &#x00026; consolation I got from her, who then &#x00026; always loved me as her own Soul.<note n="5" noteref="1011">JWC.</note>
 Whether permission had been <hi rend="italic">asked</hi> to show M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Taylor the M.S. I don&#x02019;t the least know; but that it did not the least <hi rend="italic">need</hi> to be asked, in the relation she then had to us &#x00026; Him, I do well know;<note n="6" noteref="1012">Harriet Mill wrote: &#x0201C;I cannot think that my brother would have shewn your manuscript to anyone, without your permission. I shall feel indebted to you if you can spare the time to let me know the truth on this point.&#x0201D;</note>
 &#x00026; that your dear Brother&#x02019;s conduct to me in this matter, as indeed in all others, then &#x00026; afterwards, was conspicuously noble, generous, &#x00026; friend-like,&#x02014;conduct of the First, almost only Friend I then had in London, one who would have made any sacrifice for me &#x00026; what I then had most at heart. Believe this dear Miss Mill to be a very Truth; &#x00026; dismiss from your sorrowful heart all thought of the empty newspapers; for I again bid you clearly understand, that neither in my mind, nor in that of my heroic Life-Partner, was there ever at that time or afterwards, attached to your Brother the least shadow of blame in regard to this affair.

<p>I went yesterday with two companions for a look at your Bayeux Tapestry<note n="1" noteref="1015">The Bayeux Tapestry, an embroidered cloth depicting the events leading to the Norman conquest of England, 1066, thought to date from the 11th century. Cole negotiated with the civic authorities in Bayeux for photographs of the entire tapestry to be taken by Joseph Cundall (<date when="1818">1818</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895">95</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/66898"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-46/lt-18691129-TC-JF-01"><sic>46:119&#x02013;20</sic><corr>TC to JF, <date when="1869-11-29">19 Nov. 1869</date></corr></ref>), publisher and photographer, who was in charge of the South Kensington Museum&#x02019;s publications and reproductions, <date when="1866">1866</date>&#x02013;<date when="1889">89</date>. The <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News</hi>, <date when="1873-03-15">15 March</date>, reported: &#x0201C;Among the reproductions of works of art that are to be included in the forthcoming International Exhibition will be a full-sized photographic copy of the Bayeux Tapestry. This famous piece of needlework is about 230 ft. in length and 22 in. in width, and the copy will be the largest reproduction hitherto executed by means of photography&#x0201D; (247). The photographs remain at the V &#x00026; A National Art Library.</note>
 in the Albert Hall,<note n="2" noteref="1016">Cole was instrumental in the building of the Albert Hall (part of the South Kensington estate of museums and gardens), the large public hall suitable for exhibitions and concerts, opened <date when="1871">1871</date>.</note>
 and I cannot but express to you at once my very great contentment with what I saw there. The enterprise was itself a solid, useful, and creditable thing; and the execution of it seems to me a perfect success&#x02014;certainly far exceeding all the expectations I have entertained about it. Mr. Froude, who was one of my companions, was full of admiration; and a brother of mine, who had seen the tapestry itself at Bayeux last year,<note n="3" noteref="1017">John A. Carlyle visited Bayeux <date when="1872-07">July 1872</date>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720704-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1872-07-04">4 July 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 seemed to think that this copy you had managed to make (I hope in a <hi rend="italic">permanent</hi> and easily <hi rend="italic">repeateable</hi> manner) was superior in vivid clearness, beauty of colour, &#x00026;c., to the very original. Nothing amiss in any part of the series did I notice, or suspect, except perhaps, in one part of the series, the Funeral of King Edward preceding his Death; which is a point you can easily examine, and, if wrong, put right.<note n="4" noteref="1018">Edward the Confessor (<date when="1003">1003</date>&#x02013;<date when="1066">66</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8516"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), king of England 1043&#x02013;66; the panel in the tapestry showing his funeral procession at Westminster Abbey comes before that showing his illness and death; see http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/Bayeux13.htm</note>
</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-206" n="48:206"/>As the work is in essence photographic, I flatter myself you have preserved the negative and other apparatus whereby the thing can be completely repeated as often as you like, and at moderate expense&#x02014;in which case it might, with evident and great advantage, be imparted in the same complete form to all British large towns, British colonies, and even in America itself would be precious to every inquiring and every cultivated mind.<note n="5" noteref="1019">The Bayeux Tapestry was to be copied by Elizabeth Wardle (<date when="1834">1834</date>&#x02013;<date when="1902">1902</date>), embroiderer, and 35 members of Leek Embroidery Society, using the Museum&#x02019;s hand-color photographs for reference. First exhibited in Leek, Staffordshire, in <date when="1886">1886</date>, it was then sent around towns and cities across Britain and abroad. It is now in Reading Museum; see http://www.bayeuxtapestry.org.uk/Index.htm</note>
 In a word, I am much obliged to you for sending me to see this feat of yours (by far the reasonablest in completeness of its kind yet known to me), and very much obliged, above all, for your having done it, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> done it.</p>

<p><salute>Dear Lady,</salute></p>
<p>Your Letter came to me three nights ago. I had long looked for it; &#x00026; the news it gave me of your own improved health &#x00026; outlooks was extremely gratifying. About my dear Mary&#x02019;s<note n="1" noteref="1037">Lady Ashburton&#x02019;s da., Mary Florence Baring.</note>
 &#x0201C;nervousness,&#x0201D; &#x00026; the complete absurdity of that foolish rumour I had been already satisfied; but the news you now send, which I have heard of in various successive Letters of Forster &#x00026; others, of her precious young health being somehow out of order is altogether on the <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>! side of the balance. I do confidently trust there is nothing material gone amiss, and that the bright summer weather aided by <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> from all but sport &#x00026; amusement will soon set everything to rights again. I have sought out your poor swampy, rainy, solitary Marienbad in my maps, &#x00026; do heartily wish you were over the back of the Metal-mountains&#x02014;on to the Swiss Engadin<note n="2" noteref="1038">The Ore Mountains, between Saxony and the Czech Republic, so called because they contain rich silver and tin deposits; Engadin, an Alpine valley in SE Switzerland, very popular with travelers.</note>
&#x02014;or better still home to your own England again, where for five or six weeks past we have had the finest summer weather I have seen for these several years. Balmy, genial, agreeable to every sense: <hi rend="italic">warm</hi> enough in all conscience but generally veiled&#x02014;grayish &#x00026; dry enough, or with showers only in the night-time! Perhaps all this may tempt you even in the absence of swamps, scrubby-forests, &#x00026; baths of ill-tasted water with no certainty (generally to me with none) of help in them to <hi rend="italic">any living</hi> creature. &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">They</hi> were not <hi rend="italic">made</hi> with the least intention of that kind but are merely accidental dribblings &#x00026; oozings, through one knows not what:&#x0201D;&#x02014;that is always my reflection upon them!&#x02014;</p>
<p>Ever since your Letter came I have been engaged in nothing else but a solution of the little Problem you sent me:<note n="3" noteref="1039">The problem was Thomas Woolner&#x02019;s high-relief sculpture <hi rend="italic">Virgilia Bewailing the Banishment of Coriolanus</hi>, originally commissioned for Melchet; completed <date when="1867">1867</date>, it was exhibited at the Royal Academy <date when="1871">1871</date>. By then there was no space for it at Melchet; Lady Ashburton asked Woolner if he might be able to sell it for her, but he had refused (see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 134&#x02013;35).</note>
 to me <hi rend="italic">little</hi> but to you I can well <pb id="pg-48-210" n="48:210"/>fancy how <hi rend="italic">great</hi> in respect of the long-continued provocation, <hi rend="italic">fash</hi> &#x00026; vexation you have long had about it, &#x00026; are still continuing to have! Since yesterday when I saw Lady Marian<note n="4" noteref="1040">Lady Marian Alford.</note>
 upon it (with very great satisfaction to myself) &#x00026; did not find Woolner but have appointed him hither I flatter myself to have shoved that miserable business into its final posture, &#x00026; concluded for you all the long continuing bother you have had for this &#x0201C;Exquisite&#x0201D; but too rash bit of sculpture:&#x02014;except indeed the uses of repentance that may be derived from it, &#x00026; the resolution never to be so incautious again!</p>
<p>How I have settled it (that is, settled in my own mind how it could &#x00026; ought to be by way of bringing it to its true &#x00026; best conclusion) Lady Marian will, most probably by this post, explain to you: she entirely agreed with me yesterday, &#x00026; indeed seemed greatly pleased with my ideas on that head &#x00026; on others connected with it, of which she had herself been thinking altogether as I was found to do.&#x02014; From the first moment it was evident to me that there was not the faintest chance of Woolner&#x02019;s doing anything but roughly refuse to help you in <hi rend="italic">selling</hi> this thrice unfortunate bit of sculpture &#x00026; that I never could, or must for your own honour&#x02019;s sake whisper of such a proposal: nay furthermore it was distinctly evident that neither Woolner nor any other person <hi rend="italic">could</hi> possibly sell this piece of sculpture within any comfortable length of time, but that it must keep painfully lumbering after us year after year,&#x02014;nobody could say or guess how long. Then <hi rend="italic">secondly</hi> I had ascertained from Lady Marian (whose judgment on such matters I take to be the best) that the position meant for it on the staircase<note n="5" noteref="1041">Lady Ashburton now planned to place the sculpture on the staircase in Kent House.</note>
 was actually good &#x00026; appropriate,&#x02014;none fitter for such an article, or giving it a fairer chance of being <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>, noticed &#x00026; examined, I surely fancy? <hi rend="italic">Thirdly</hi> my opinion or feeble notion always was that this was really a meritorious bit of sculpture needing only, as <hi rend="italic">I long ago</hi> suggested to Woolner, some clear indication such as might be given, if not by some artistic symbol, then by some ingenious inscription, Latin quotation or the like, of what the real subject of it was,<note n="6" noteref="1042">The sculpture has the single word &#x0201C;Virgilia&#x0201D; inscribed on the base.</note>
 or what it meant to tell one,&#x02014;which was otherwise a total blot of darkness rendering it to my poor practical mind at least a mere insoluble enigma, distress &#x00026; kind of insult, more to be <hi rend="italic">avoided</hi> altogether than <hi rend="italic">sought after</hi> at such an expense (&#x000A3;2,000, &#x00026; a yearly rent<note n="7" noteref="1043">She had paid &#x000A3;2,000 for it, and had since been paying to keep it in storage (see Surtees, <hi rend="italic">Ludovisi</hi> 166&#x02013;68).</note>
 like that of a horse or pair of horses, standing at Livery without lifting a hoof for you all the year!)&#x02014;<pb id="pg-48-211" n="48:211"/>my Sole request to Woolner will be that he would give us this inscription or symbolic representation &#x00026; assist us (that is Lady Marian, Forster &#x00026; Clutton) in choosing the best position &#x00026;c, for this thrice weariesome bit of sculpture. This I have no doubt he will gladly do, &#x00026; take perhaps as a compliment to himself to be asked to do. The sculpture will then be off <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hands, out of your thoughts altogether; &#x00026; the value of it, the intrinsic value, whatever that may be, will then be secured to you &#x00026; yours as in the Bank of England itself:&#x02014;for we will have Woolner&#x02019;s inscription upon it &#x00026; the advantage of Woolner&#x02019;s highest fame, if it should rise as high as the Empyrean, which let us pray (faintly) that it may do! Enough now of him, &#x00026; of his exquisite sculpture,&#x02014;fully as dreary and exquisite vexations that sometimes follow them!&#x02014;</p>
<p>One word &#x00026; one only I force myself to add on this subject: That I think you must in nowise commission or permit any other Friend than Lady Marian or Forster to lay the least command or make any communication or suggestion to Clutten direct but always &#x00026; solely by <hi rend="italic">suggestion</hi>, through Lady Marian &#x00026; F.. This is more necessary than you think: F. alone of all your friends having a hook in the snout of that &#x0201C;Leviathan of Fraud&#x0201D; &#x00026; intending to keep it, in strict concert with that great Lady (the skillfullest decorator in all England I should think if you leave him &#x00026; her Ladyship to follow their own course) &#x00026; rigorously guide the Leviathan as I understand they altogether quietly <hi rend="italic">now</hi> do&#x02014; <hi rend="italic">Finis</hi> then at last in regard to this <hi rend="italic">business department</hi>.</p>
<p>Of myself I have nothing new to tell you, more especially nothing very cheering or <hi rend="italic">comfortable</hi>:<note n="8" noteref="1044">Word repeated at top of new page.</note>
 tho&#x02019; also, let it be said, nothing at all expressly of the other type. Miss Welsh, some short time after my Brother came, went away by Liverpool to Auchtertool always very kindly ministering to me there if in any thing she could. One of the last services she did me here was that of writing a long Letter to you from me:&#x02014;Letter which, I find, you have never yet got&#x02014;nor probably now ever will. It was punctually addressed to you at &#x0201C;Perugia,&#x0201D; punctually despatched, &#x00026; would arrive there, as I afterwards found, some day-or-two, after your departure, about <date when="1873-06-05">June 5</date> namely. It was a long Letter; rambled about considerably on Mary&#x02019;s education, her grand necessity of really <hi rend="italic">learning</hi> Latin &#x00026;c. It contained nothing of real importance; and if it wont come to you it can stay away. Dont the least bother about it!</p>
<p>Froude is going off to Devonshire on Tuesday<note n="9" noteref="1045">Froude was to stay at Glenlyn House, nr. Lynmouth, N. Devon; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730730-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1873-07-30">30 July</date></ref>.</note>
 next which will be a loss to me; Fitzjames Stephen going next week (as Substitute-Judge I believe)<note n="10" noteref="1046">Fitzjames Stephen had recently been appointed a circuit judge, visiting Winchester and then Dorchester.</note>
 will be another loss; Forster, as you know, is in Hertfordshire<note n="11" noteref="1047">At Knebworth Park; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730624-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1873-06-24">24 June</date>.</ref></note>
 for some three <pb id="pg-48-212" n="48:212"/>weeks past, &#x00026; I see nothing of him. I am perfectly idle except for reading; to say truth <hi rend="italic">good</hi> reading when I can get it <hi rend="italic">good</hi> suits me better than almost any company for truth to say I am weak, weary, &#x00026;, if by no means miserable&#x02014;sad &#x00026; sombre, &#x00026; willing that my Inn were here whenever such is God&#x02019;s will. It seems to be settled that I am to go with Mary Aitken &#x00026; my Sister, to a month of bathing, in the Island of Rothesay, or on the Galloway Coast about Stranraer;<note n="12" noteref="1048">Rothesay, seaside resort on the Isle of Bute, Firth of Clyde; Stranraer, town in Wigtownshire.</note>
 the strict conditon being that a place for absolutely quiet sleeping is to be found for me!&#x02014; Until the heat actually burn me out, it is certain I shall stay quietly <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. My Brother is very good to me, poor soul; soft, so far as his rough paws can be: and I think will certainly continue with me till I go to Scotland before going on any errand of his own.</p>
<p>Adieu, Dear Lady. God&#x02019;s blessing be upon you &#x00026; your Bonny Bairn! I am, &#x00026; remain,</p>

<p>Lady Marian had me to a quite artistic dinner lately,&#x02014;havn&#x02019;t seen the like of it for ten years past! Several of y<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Roman friends were there; especially Hare,<note n="16" noteref="1052">Augustus John Cuthbert Hare; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721129-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1872-11-29">29 Nov. 1872</date></ref>.

Houghton referred to &#x0201C;the constant friendship that existed between Lady Ashburton and Mr. Carlyle&#x02014;on her part one of filial respect and duteous admiration. The frequent presence of the great moralist of itself gave to the life of Bath House and The Grange a reality that made the most ordinary worldly component parts of it more human and worthy than elsewhere&#x0201D; (232).</note>
 I sorrowfully think like you. Ah me, Ah me!</p>

<p><salute>Dear Froude,</salute></p>
<p>Thanks for your kind Letter, which is very hospitable, altogether practical and very welcome to me.

&#x02014;you may depend on it, I will not &#x0201C;leave the matter out of mind&#x0201D;; and in the chaos of plans and possibilities, so far as I can judge at this moment, it really has a look of invitation and stands a good chance,&#x02014;good at least for Niece Mary and me, however it may be with others!</p>

 downwards: there I think one might have a still week of sunshine, quiet and sad musing. The only drawback is, uncertainty as to the means of getting towards Scotland out of Norfolk. At present the one possibility clear to me is that of coming back to London and starting afresh! That would be the chance upon Glenlyn for us: to have a little human talk and speculation in the shady woods there, and a dip in the sea, withal! We do not settle definitely till after another interview with Lady Gertrude, which takes place tomorrow. If we do go to Blickling we start on Saturday; and at any rate you will hear from us, either thence or from some other quarter within a few days. <hi rend="italic">Esperons</hi>.</p>

 the event is fateful and tragical and altogether sadder to me than I could have expected.

I find he was really of religious nature; and thought in secret in spite of his Bishophood very much in regard to religion as we do.&#x02014; I was much astonished at Stephen&#x02019;s Dundee <pb id="pg-48-215" n="48:215"/>affair,<note n="9" noteref="1068">Fitzjames Stephen had been advised by John Duke Coleridge, attorney general (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730307-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-03-07">7 March</date></ref>), that if he stood for a parliamentary seat it would help his career.

<p><salute>Dear Forster,</salute></p>
<p>We arrived here on tolerable terms last Saturday; a very pretty, high-cultivated and yet wholesome looking and natural country, all this region; and Blickling itself the beautifullest old mansion I have ever seen, built by I <pb id="pg-48-216" n="48:216"/><pb id="pg-48-217" n="48:217"/>cannot learn what Architect, (about <date when="1620">1620</date>);<note n="1" noteref="1073">Blickling Hall was extensively rebuilt by Robert Lyminge (d. <date when="1628">1628</date>), architect and carpenter, <date when="1618">1618</date>&#x02013;<date when="1624">24</date>, for Sir Henry Hobart (ca. <date when="1554">1554</date>&#x02013;<date when="1625">1625</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13391"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), lawyer and judge. The main door has &#x0201C;<date when="1620">1620</date>&#x0201D; carved on it.</note>
 but certainly by an excellent noble human creature,&#x02014;as far from the like of our friend Clutton as one human being c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be from another. The house contains all manner of beautiful antiquities, pictures &#x00026;c, with a noble old library gathered and catalogued early in the last century by Mattaire<note n="2" noteref="1074">Michael Maittaire (<date when="1668">1668</date>&#x02013;<date when="1747">1747</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/17841"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), French classical scholar and bibliographer, friend of Sir Richard Ellys (<date when="1682">1682</date>&#x02013;<date when="1742">1742</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8729"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), scholar and book collector. Elyss&#x02019;s substantial library was transferred to Blickling Hall after his death; his chief cataloguer appears to have been John Mitchell (ca. <date when="1685">1685</date>&#x02013;<date when="1751">1751</date>), tutor, traveler, tour guide, antiquary, physician, and, in later years, librarian, secretary, and book-buying agent to Sir Richard Ellys. The catalogue is in ten large volumes, much of it in Mitchell&#x02019;s hand; see Giles Mandelbrote and Yvonne Lewis, <hi rend="italic">Learning to Collect; the Library of Sir Richard Ellys (<date when="1682">1682</date>&#x02013;<date when="1742">1742</date>) at Blickling Hall</hi> (<date when="2004">2004</date>).</note>
 &#x00026; in which I am now reading pamphlets by Sir R.

The price of South Sea stock increased dramatically, 1720, as a result of the company&#x02019;s proposal, endorsed by Parliament, to assume the government&#x02019;s debt; by Sept. of that year the market had collapsed and many investors were ruined.</note>
 hitherto an inscrutable mystery to me);&#x02014;the house, too, has the farther invaluable particularity that it is from end as quiet as Sahara, inhabited only by two of the gentlest young ladies,<note n="4" noteref="1076">Lady Lothian and her sister Lady Gertrude Frances Chetwynd-Talbot; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730730-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1873-07-30">30 July</date></ref>.</note>
 one of them very handsome and both of them full of mild genial &#x00026; noble and quietly noble qualities. All this you perceive is to be reckoned as clear good luck. For the first three nights I had indeed my considerable difficulties about sleep, but on the fourth night commenced a better course of adjustment, wh. promises now to continue. The weather night and day is exquisite. The woods are in all their beauty, the fields far and wide are a golden sea of wheat (excellent crop everywhere); in short no chance could be more perfect for lounging about and lying and walking and all forms of <hi rend="italic">farniente</hi> [idleness], with book in hand or pipe in hand according to discretion. I do feel already perceptibly clearer and purer; but never in my life felt so weak, so skinless, vulnerable as a child of three years;&#x02014;on the whole very greatly altered from what I was in Chelsea and one hopes altered for the better.</p>
<p>We have had Elwin<note n="5" noteref="1077">Whitwell Elwin, rector of Booton, Norfolk, about 5 mi. (8 km.) SW of Blickling; he was a friend of Forster&#x02019;s.</note>
 here for a day and night, the excellent sagacious wholesome minded man, with whom a great deal of pleasant frank and solid <pb id="pg-48-218" n="48:218"/>talk: evening before yesterday he with great and to us at the time useful kindness, carried Mary off with him and next day was at the pains to rush along with her from Norwich to Yarmouth<note n="6" noteref="1078">Elwin took Mary to Booton, about 12 mi. (19 k.) NW of Norwich. Great Yarmouth, port on the E coast of Norfolk, about 14 mi. (21 k.) E. of Norwich and 33 mi. (53 km.) SE of Blickling.</note>
 and back searching out to the practical bottom the conditions of the Yarmouth Steamers Northward and ascertaining the clear possibility of our getting to Newcastle by that method and thence in an easy five hours or more to Dumfries,&#x02014;instead of jumbling back in a painful manner (as had seemed our only recourse) to Chelsea and thence taking a new departure. I really feel it a signal kindness on Elwin&#x02019;s part and reckon it in great part to Forster and the pleasant hours I have spent with him there. I am really very thankful to him,&#x02014;and design in future at least always to call him <hi rend="italic">Elwin</hi> instead of Alwin which out of mistake or etymological considerations I have been in the habit of doing. We are to sail from Yarmouth on Wednesday evening next, hope to be in Newcastle about five the next day and thence home to Dumfries early next morning; that is the address from Wednesday next; and I need add no more in proof that our history has all gone well hitherto and points rather to some small profitable issue than the reverse.</p>

 the other day; but no special details about the last days of your history since we parted.

<p><salute>Dear Froude,</salute></p>
<p>We have been here, Niece Mary and I, since Saturday week; and are to go tomorrow by Yarmouth to Newcastle, intending for Dumfries, where by programme we arrive on Friday afternoon. Our stay here has been of the most perfect style procurable on earth, of what may be called Elysian indolence; never before did I meet in the world such perfection of a Castle of Indolence.<note n="1" noteref="1083">James Thomson (<date when="1700">1700</date>&#x02013;<date when="1748">48</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27306"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), poet, <hi rend="italic">The Castle of Indolence</hi> (<date when="1748">1748</date>); see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18260425-TC-HCR-01"><sic>4:82</sic><corr>TC to HCR, <date when="1826-04-25">25 April 1826</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 So beautiful an ancient palace standing entire, such beautiful silent woods in the brightness of summer weather; our sole company two Beings of the lovelier sex, Lady Lothian &#x00026; Lady Gertrude her Sister (the invalid Lady Shrewsbury<note n="2" noteref="1084">Lady Sarah Elizabeth Chetwynd-Talbot, countess of Shrewsbury, an invalid who usually lived with one of her das.</note>

The <hi rend="italic">change</hi> accordingly in what I call my &#x0201C;health&#x0201D; has been for the time quite surprising, a change certainly for the better in some respects though whether in all or even on the whole I must wait for time to try. Tomorrow night at 9 we are to go on board a well reputed Steamer and enter on 48 hours of miscellaneous realities aquatic and terrestrial, which, were it possible, I would fain avoid; but these will tell me a more conclusive story.</p>
<p>But why wander further in this inane dialogue with you,&#x02014;unhappily not to be carried on by word of mouth, but merely to the vain waste of time and paper? The essential thing I had to say is that o<supplied>[u]</supplied>r prospect of Lynmouth<note n="3" noteref="1085">Froude had invited TC to visit him on holiday at Lynmouth, Devon; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730730-TC-JAF-01">TC to JAF, <date when="1873-07-30">30 July</date></ref>; &#x0201C;o<supplied>[u]</supplied>r&#x0201D; thus in printed text.</note>
 has sorrowfully faded into the vague (tho&#x02019; perhaps it still dimly remains as a shadow) the question of Scotch Bathing<note n="4" noteref="1086">TC had planned to go sea bathing with Jean and Mary Aitken on the Isle of Bute; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730706-TC-LA-01">TC to Lady A, <date when="1873-07-06">6 July</date></ref>.</note>
 too becomes problematic as I approach it; nothing certain ahead but that I must be in Edinburgh for one day. So soon as the heat has fairly gone, anchorage at Chelsea is the one thing ahead and a meeting with you once more in the end of September. I hope you will return with your book well forward! Do not neglect that: you were never on a wiser or usefuller bit of work.</p>

<p><salute>My dear M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Warren</salute></p>
<p>I was indeed glad to receive your note &#x00026; to hear your good accounts of yourself, &#x00026; of those around you. I know you will be pleased to hear of M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle &#x00026; perhaps Miss Aitken may not have had time herself to write. However you will no doubt have always been hearing from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Aitken,<note n="1" noteref="1089">John Aitken, living in London.</note>
 who I fancy will now be in Scotland for his holiday.</p>
<p>It was, as you can well believe, a very great pleasure to us to see M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle here&#x02014;my only one regret was that his visit was such a very short one, for we had always hoped he would stay some time with us if he found it quiet. He &#x00026; Miss Aitken came to us on Monday last week, &#x00026; those few days&#x02014;until Friday&#x02014;I really do hope he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> find it quiet &#x00026; pleasant; he slept <hi rend="italic">so</hi> well every night, &#x00026; during the day too at his usual hours; &#x00026; his appetite too he said he found so <hi rend="italic">much</hi> better, that I could not but feel that a longer stay would have done him <hi rend="italic">real</hi> good. However he was very anxious, as you know well, to go &#x00026; spend a day at Haddington (where she is buried),<note n="2" noteref="1090">JWC&#x02019;s grave in St. Mary&#x02019;s Church, Haddington; see <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660621-TC-WDO-01"><sic>43:236</sic><corr>TC to WDO, <date when="1866-06-21">21 June 1866</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-43/lt-18660623-TC-JCA-01"><sic>241</sic><corr>TC to JCA, <date when="1866-06-23">23 June 1866</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 &#x00026; unfortunately we found on consulting the Railway books that it would be impossible to go <hi rend="italic">from here</hi> &#x00026; return here the same day; so as this obliged him to remain a night in Edinburgh he felt, I saw, a little afraid of the journey he would <hi rend="italic">again</hi> have to make to Dumfries Shire on his way to Chelsea. He made up his mind therefore not to return here but to go straight to the Hill on Saturday, which he &#x00026; Miss Aitken did on Saturday afternoon. I had hoped we might hear today of their safe arrival there, but tomorrow I quite trust <hi rend="italic">will</hi> bring some word of them. M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle was so very kind as to ask me to go with him, &#x00026; you can well believe the real pleasure, though a <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> one, it was to me to go with him to Haddington. Neither Miss Aitken nor I had ever been there before. I wish you could see the churchyard where M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Carlyle lies&#x02014;it is a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> beautiful spot, &#x00026; all around the old Church is beautifully kept in order.</p>

 had secured such <hi rend="italic">quiet</hi> &#x00026; most comfortable rooms, so the visit was a less formidable one than one could at all have hoped for. I do trust M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Carlyle has not been the worse of all the fatigue. On Friday night he said he had slept really very well, &#x00026; he looked wonderfully well that day when I parted from them on their way to the Station&#x02014;I then went off to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> Station<note n="4" noteref="1092">TC&#x02019;s and Mary&#x02019;s train left from Caledonian Station, W end of Princes St., and Maggie&#x02019;s train from North British Station, E end of Princes St.</note>
 feeling very sorry to be returning here alone.</p>

<p><salute>Dear FitzGerald,</salute></p>
<p>There is something at once pathetic and ridiculous and altogether miserable and contemptible in the fact you at last announce that by one caprice and another of human folly perversity and general length of ear,<note n="1" noteref="1095">Phrase referring to the long ears of a donkey, meaning stupid and obstinate.</note>
 our poor little enterprize is definitely forbidden to us.<note n="2" noteref="1096">TC and FitzGerald wanted to erect a monument at the actual site of the Battle of Naseby; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18710615-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1872-06-15">15 June 1872</date></ref>, <ref target="volume-48/lt-18721207-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1872-12-07">7 Dec. 1872</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730418-TC-CEN-01">TC to CEN, <date when="1873-04-18">18 April</date></ref>. FitzGerald wrote to TC, <date when="1873-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Enclosed is the Naseby Lawyer&#x02019;s answer on behalf of the Naseby Trustees. I think it will seem marvellous in your Eyes, as it does in mine&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:439). FitzGerald had been to Naseby to look at the spot late June; he wrote to a friend, [<date when="1873-07">July</date>]: &#x0201C;I have a Letter dictated by Carlyle, in which he approves of my Naseby Journey, but insists still on as near a specification as possible of the number of Yards where the Dead may be supposed to be buried. I tell him that he would only believe in <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Grave when I had opened it; why should he believe in other Graves from Tradition? But he won&#x02019;t alter, you know&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:429). He also wrote to W. F. Pollock (see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720615-TC-EF-01">TC to EF, <date when="1872-06-15">15 June 1872</date></ref>), [<date when="1873-07">July</date>]: &#x0201C;I have been a wonderful Journey&#x02014;for me&#x02014;even to Naseby &#x02026; to authenticate the spot where I dug up some bones of those slain there&#x02014;for <supplied>[Carlyle]</supplied> thirty years ago. We are to put up a Stone there to record the fact, if we can get leave of the present Owners of the Field; a permission, one would think, easy enough to obtain; but I have been more than a Year trying to obtain it, notwithstanding; and do not know that I am nearer the point after all. The Owner is a Minor [Henry George Agar-Ellis (<date when="1863">1863</date>&#x02013;<date when="1895">95</date>), 4th Viscount Clifden]: and three Trustees must sanction the thing for him; and these three Trustees are all great People, all living in different parts of England; and, I suppose, forgetful of such a little matter, though their Estate-agent, and Lawyer, represented it to them long ago&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:431).</note>
 Alas, our poor little &#x0201C;inscription,&#x0201D; so <pb id="pg-48-222" n="48:222"/>far as I remember it, was not more criminal than that of a number on a milestone;&#x02014;in fact the whole adventure was like that of setting up an authentic <hi rend="italic">Milestone</hi> in a tract of country (spiritual and physical) mournfully in want of measurement; that was <hi rend="italic">our</hi> highly innocent offer had the unfortunate Rulers of the Element in that quarter been able to perceive it at all! Well; since they haven&#x02019;t one thing at least is clear that our attempt is finished, and that from this hour we will devoutly give it up.&#x02014; That of shifting the now existing pyramid from Naseby Village and rebuilding it on Broadmoor<note n="3" noteref="1097">Broad Moor, the actual site of the battle. FitzGerald continued, <date when="1873-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;You will see that I had suggested whether moving the Obelisk &#x02026; might not be accomplished in case the Stone were rejected. &#x02026; I cannot believe the Trustees would listen to this scheme any more than to the other. Nor do I suppose you would be satisfied with the foolish Obelisk&#x02019;s Inscription, which warns Kings not to exceed their just Prerogative, nor Subjects their lawful obedience, etc., but does not say that it stands on the very spot where the Ashes of the Dead told of the final Struggle&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:439).</note>
 seems to me entirely inadmissable;&#x02014;and in fact unless <hi rend="italic">you</hi> yourself c<hi rend="italic">d</hi> resolve, which I dont counsel, on marking, by way of foot-note, on the now existing pyramid, accurately how many yards off and in what direction the real battle ground lies from it? there is nothing visible to me which can without ridiculous impropriety be done.</p>
<p>The trouble and bother you have had with all this, which I know are very great, cannot be repaid you, dear old Friend, except by my pious thankfulness, which I can well assure you shall not be wanting. But actual <hi rend="italic">mone</hi>y, much or little which the surrounding blockheads, connected with this matter have first and last cost you, this I do request that you will accurately sum up that I may pay the half of it, as is my clear debt and right.<note n="4" noteref="1098">FitzGerald replied, <date when="1873-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;You give me too much thanks for the little Trouble I have taken. &#x02026; And, as to halving my Expenses! Which have been simply so many sheets of Letter paper, so many Postage Stamps &#x02026; and a very pleasant Journey to Naseby itself this summer, which really did me good. &#x02026; This is positively all&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:441).</note>
 This I do still expect from you; after which F<hi rend="small-caps">inis</hi> upon this matter for ever and a day.</p>
<p>I have suffered a great deal of misery in this confused of seven weeks; and have come to the conclusion that I ought never to attempt another.<note n="5" noteref="1099">FitzGerald also wrote, <date when="1873-09-17">17 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;You make your old complaints about being away from home &#x02026; but I do think you dictate as if you were well and strong&#x0201D; (<hi rend="italic">FitzGerald&#x02019;s Letters</hi> 3:441).</note>
 Day after <pb id="pg-48-223" n="48:223"/>tomorrow we rush off, my blithe little Niece and I, and hope to arrive at Chelsea with a speed of express train that same night, there to lie dormant. Good be ever with you, dear FitzGerald.</p>

<p><salute>D<hi rend="small-caps">ear</hi> S<hi rend="small-caps">ir</hi>,</salute></p>
<p>Several weeks ago I received from you at Dumfries Herr Moser&#x02019;s ingenious little book;<note n="1" noteref="1101">Samuel Moser, <hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x02019;s zweiter Faust, oder der ge&#x000F6;ffnete Walpurgissack</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Goethe&#x02019;s Faust part 2</hi>] (Weissenburg, <date when="1864">1864</date>). Samuel Moser, from Alsace, unidentified further. He wrote to TC, <date when="1873-10-18">18 Oct. 1873</date> (see vol. 49).</note>
 which, in the hurries and confusions then about me, I neglected to acknowledge at the moment. Accept now my thanks for your kind punctuality in regard to that matter.</p>
<p>I have since deliberately read over Mr. Moser&#x02019;s little book, with agreeable recognition of much talent, diligence and fine intellectual faculty in the same; but am sorry to report likewise (sorry in one sense, and yet relieved and gratified in another,) that I can find in those amazing footnotes of Mr. M. no clear credibility whatever, nor certainly the least <hi rend="italic">explanation</hi> of anything that is mysterious in <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, part II. or part I;&#x02014;and indeed am astonished that a person of Mr. M.&#x02019;s good sense and extensive information should have thought of representing Goethe&#x02019;s high and clear mind as ever grovelling into those base and cynical provinces of human life, from which in all his other writings he is conspicuously, healthily and nobly free. In the <hi rend="italic">final</hi> scenes of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, from p. 224 and onwards of Mr. Moser&#x02019;s book, I have found the illustrations perfectly credible, and have gratefully accepted the elucidation they yield. His preliminary excerpts, his epilogue, and indeed all these portions of his book have been new and interesting to me: they have moreover led me into a renewed perusal of this Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, and into an examination for the first time (though hitherto with little profit) of what the German doctors have found good to utter on the subject; a process which is yet by no means concluded on my part.<note n="2" noteref="1102">TC was reading widely about <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730920-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-09-20">20 Sept.</date></ref></note>
</p>
<p><pb id="pg-48-224" n="48:224"/>For all this I am clearly indebted to Mr. Moser; and I beg you will thank him very kindly for his goodness in sending me this book, the results of which may be of more advantage to me than we yet see; and which at any rate I cannot but accept as a proof of his kind regard.</p>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>You already know from Mary all of you that the Iron Devil carried us handsomely to London on Monday last<note n="1" noteref="1104"><date when="1873-09-15">15 Sept.</date> John A. Carlyle replied, <date when="1873-09-21">21 Sept.</date>: &#x0201C;Thanks for your long letter &#x02026; &#x00026; thank Mary too for her punctuality in writing immediately after your arrival in London. It was a great relief to us all to hear that you had got through the long journey so well &#x00026; with so little trouble.&#x0201D;</note>
 without the least mistake, and with considerably less of misery than I had anticipated,&#x02014;nay less than I had lazily suffered in most of the few preceding days of mere torpor and do-nothingism. England was all very wet, seeming to grow wetter and wetter the farther South we went; indeed there was not much of rain, if we had the least cared for that, but the landscape everywhere had a drenched look in parts almost a swampish, the railway stations all lying miserably in <hi rend="italic">dubs</hi> &#x00026;c &#x00026;c and till Rugby<note n="2" noteref="1105">Rugby, town in Warwickshire about 80 mi. (129 km.) NW of London.</note>
 itself wet stooks standing visible whether farther south we cannot say, daylight having there left us. London itself was <hi rend="italic">drooket</hi> and <hi rend="italic">glarr</hi>y as we splashed rapidly through it: but n<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 5 here was all as clean as new pins and (except for Mills the carpenter,<note n="3" noteref="1106">Mills the carpenter unidentified further.</note>
 who by some mistake had not quite finished his operations on a sofa here, but kept hammering for half an hour longer) all had a calmness and correct composure which was mournfully beautiful to me. Mary&#x02019;s guidance of me through the transit and since and onwards has been what you may suppose it, mere kindness and affection. Unluckily, with all this, I got only half a sleep in my own welcome bed and was astonished and annoyed by various accursed sounds, miraculous intrusions of <pb id="pg-48-225" n="48:225"/>chanticleer<note n="4" noteref="1107">John replied: &#x0201C;We felt somewhat alarmed about the cock which had waked you the first morning after your arrival, but it seems now to be got rid of.&#x0201D; For TC&#x02019;s horror of crowing cocks, see, for example, <!-- add target --><ref>14:49</ref>.</note>
 and other phenomena;&#x02014;of which I say nothing more except that they are all victoriously swept into the abyss again, and that last night, after five half failures I have at last got what may be called a good sound sleep again, and feel as if I had fairly got over the hill, and were to have plain stepping and some tolerable composure and perhaps even some improvement for the time next coming.</p>
<p>London is emptier than I almost ever saw it; next to no carriages on the streets, on the pavements, sparse straggles of specimens one has to reckon of the genus Snob, happily all unknown to me. One day M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Ness the Architect<note n="5" noteref="1108">William Eden Nesfield; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18720821-TC-JF-01">TC to JF, <date when="1872-08-21">21 Aug. 1872</date></ref>.</note>
 (if you remember him at Seaforth last year)<note n="6" noteref="1109">TC and John stayed at Seaforth, <date when="1872-07-25">25 July</date>&#x02013;<date when="1872-08-26">26 Aug. 1872</date>.</note>
 leapt from a Cab and ran to salute me face at first irrecognizable with sunburning, for the rest very civil and enquiring in a cordial tone about you. Another day in Piccadilly there suddenly stood beside me a younger unknown figure of Scotch accent, whom I cannot yet name to you, except as the Minister of some place near Kilwinning, who was once Tutor at poor Tom Spedding&#x02019;s,<note n="7" noteref="1110">John Sime (<date when="1837">1837</date>&#x02013;<date when="1904">1904</date>), minister of Kilwinning, Ayrshire, <date when="1864">1864</date>&#x02013;<date when="1866">66</date>; he was previously tutor to Henry Anthony Spedding, son of TC&#x02019;s old friend Thomas Story Spedding; see <ref target="volume-42/lt-18650718-TC-JWC-01"><sic>42:133</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1865-07-18">18 July 1865</date></corr></ref>.</note>
 he also lovingly enquired for you and hung along with me, rather encumbering my stroll, till in Regent St., I took shelter in a Chelsea Omnibus and got rid. These are the two only known figures I have yet seen on the streets or elsewhere. Forster I called upon, &#x00026; he has called here; but we missed both times, and the proposed &#x0201C;dinner&#x0201D; on Sunday night had to be declined with civility and even secretly with horror. Froude I have not seen or heard of; didn&#x02019;t call there yet, nor at Allinghams whom however I dimly understand to be in town, unless I preferred silence as hitherto. For the rest the days are oftenest really beautiful, brisk winds often enough with spotted sunshine, the clearest sleekest streets for promenading, seldom any considerable rain, except by night since we returned. I have also got a number of books, all the critical pamphlets about Goethe&#x02019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> that are in the Library, and have sent for the others while diligently reading those on hand. Except Falk,<note n="8" noteref="1111">Johannes Daniel Falk (<date when="1768">1768</date>&#x02013;<date when="1826">1826</date>), German writer, philanthropist, and friend of Goethe, author of <hi rend="italic">Goethe aus n&#x000E4;herm pers&#x000F6;nlichen Umgange dargestellt</hi> [Goethe portrayed from personal circumstances] (Leipzig, <date when="1832">1832</date>). Sarah Austin (<date when="1793">1793</date>&#x02013;<date when="1867">1867</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/916"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>), TC&#x02019;s old friend, trans.

 who treats of Goethe generally those latter are all decidedly rather stupid;&#x02014;but I feel not yet to have done with <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, part II, nor probably shall have decided for some little while. I wrote to Moser and the Falkirk man<note n="9" noteref="1112">For Samuel Moser and the &#x0201C;Falkirk man,&#x0201D; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730920-TC-UC-01">TC to UC, <date when="1873-09-20">20 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 this morning; them I have at least finished.&#x02014; I wish you would <pb id="pg-48-226" n="48:226"/>as minutely tell me, dear Brother, what you are doing; though this is a very dull account I give you.</p>
<p>Inclosed is a rational kind of letter from Leighton,<note n="10" noteref="1113">Presumably Sir Baldwyn Leighton.</note>
 probably worth your reading: please to return it when you write next. The letter forwarded yesterday from Dumfries was some beggarly tag rag about an Autograph which is ended this day.<note n="11" noteref="1114">Unidentified further.</note>
 That of autographs is truly a characteristic, and a highly sordid one, of the humour of young people of this day.</p>
<p>I hope you are a little better than when I left you; and that rigorous attention to diet exercise &#x00026;c will soon bring you round to the old pitch. I also with much earnestness recommend some translation from the Icelandic or other light work which, far from burdening one&#x02019;s weak life would, as I know by long experience, sensibly steady and cheer and alleviate it.<note n="12" noteref="1115">John replied: &#x0201C;I feel rather better in regard to health, especially sleep, &#x00026; have not had any very bad night since the Sunday before you started for Chelsea. &#x02026; I have looked &#x02026; into some of my Icelandic books and will consider what you advise about translating some of them. &#x02026; I too know by experience how beneficial it is to have some fixed work from day to day in which one can make progress, instead of mere reading without purpose of actually turning it to account.&#x0201D;</note>
 Let me beg of you to think seriously of this, and take it as sound advice from your elder Brother. Write to me soon, and as much at large as you can; for I should like well to know, as lucidly as possible, how you and all the rest of you are getting on.</p>
<p>We expect John<note n="13" noteref="1116">Their nephew John Aitken, who had been on holiday in Scotland; see <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730909-MW-SW-01">MW to SW, <date when="1873-09-09">9 Sept.</date></ref></note>
 in about a week and send him our united regards. Give my particular remembrances to James,<note n="14" noteref="1117">Their brother-in-law James Aitken.</note>
 who, alas, cannot lend me his umbrella tomorrow or try walking with me again. My kindest love to Jean and the two good lassies.<note n="15" noteref="1118">Anne and Margaret Aitken.</note>

<p><salute>My dear Brother,</salute></p>
<p>Before the week end I must send you a word;&#x02014;and unluckily it must be a very brief one, such the poor fettle I am in. In fact it will be pretty much the only thing I manage to get done today; and the hour for walking out is near come. My prophecies of last week have only in part fulfilled themselves: yet in part they have. I have got completely freed from noises in my bedroom;<note n="1" noteref="1122">See <ref target="volume-48/lt-18730920-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1873-09-20">20 Sept.</date></ref></note>

&#x02014;and that is really a great conquest to me, properly the only one I have yet made; every night too I get some kind of sleep, often of the muddiest vilest quality but still sleep of some kind. Only my digestive faculty seems altogether gone; wretched stomach dragging me down all day, as if into utter wreck,&#x02014;scarcely ever in my life have I felt so utterly powerless. Nevertheless I steadily keep hoping that, were this fit past, I shall get into my old poor track again, and live with a little less burden tied to my heels than now. So let us say no more about it; only strive to keep out of the &#x0201C;<hi rend="italic">waes of war</hi>&#x0201D;<note n="3" noteref="1124">Cf.

 in time coming!&#x02014;</p>
<p>The weather in general is good and fine for the season; thick fog indeed till about 10 oclock, then gradual brightening up, till at three or four when one goes out, all is bright as diamonds, fallen utterly silent too, and the grass in garden or park still of emerald greenness only the trees beginning to look a little woebegone, and take on their funerial colours. Nobody is yet, not even Allingham, come to town; but both Froude and he are expected early next week: in truth I cannot much say I would long to hasten their or anybody&#x02019;s arrival till once I have got a little to my balance again.

<dateline>[early <date when="1872">1872</date>].</dateline>
<p>It was in the beginning of <date when="1872">1872</date> that I found myself at the door of old Betty&#x02019;s &#x0201C;poor cottage at Greenend.&#x0201D; Betty opened to my knock, and exclaimed, &#x0201C;Eh, Maister Davidson!&#x0201D; I was soon seated beside her in her tidy little room, and deep in the memories of auld lang syne. Among other subjects we came upon Dr. Welsh. She said, in reference to his regard for religion, &#x0201C;Some folk didna think sae muckle o&#x02019; the Doctor, but I thought a hantle [good deal] o&#x02019; him. Ye see, when he got auld, he didna tak&#x02019; the lang rides he used to tak&#x02019;, but he got a kerridge; and just aboot that time I was takin&#x02019; in a Bible an&#x02019; commentary in pairts,&#x02014;that&#x02019;s it on the table there,&#x02014;and as the Doctor gaed his veesits, mony a read he had o&#x02019;t. I mind as weel as yesterday his sayin&#x02019;, as he cam&#x02019; thro&#x02019; the kitchen to the kerridge, &#x02018;Betty, could ye obleege me wi&#x02019; a bit o&#x02019; yer Bible?&#x02019; Says I, &#x02018;What pairt wad ye like, Doctor?&#x02019; says he,&#x02014;for the Doctor was aye very pelite,&#x02014;&#x02018;Weel, Betty, if it&#x02019;s quite convenient for you, I wad like a bit o&#x02019; the Gospel o&#x02019; John!&#x02019; Ay! He was fond o&#x02019; the Bible.&#x0201D; Then I was telling how I remembered that solemn Sabbath morning when he died, which led her to go into the circumstances of his illness and death. &#x0201C;Ye see,&#x0201D; said she, &#x0201C;the Doctor was a regular man in his habits. He used to come hame at four o&#x02019;clock, an&#x02019; tak&#x02019; a bath before his denner; but yae Thursday he cam&#x02019; hame, an&#x02019; took neither his bath nor his denner, but gaed straight to his naked bed. The next day he was in a high fever, an&#x02019; word was sent to Edinburgh for a grand doctor (Hamilton,<note n="1" noteref="1132">Dr. James Hamilton Sr. (<date when="1749">1749</date>&#x02013;<date when="1835">1835</date>; <ref target="volume-48/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12095"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330210-TC-JAC-01"><sic>6:319</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1833-02-10">10 Feb. 1833</date></corr></ref>); JWC continued to consult him when she visited Edinburgh, <date when="1833-01">Jan.</date>&#x02013;<date when="1833-05">May 1833</date>; see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-MAC-01"><sic>6:299</sic><corr>TC to MAC, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan. 1833</date></corr></ref>.</note>

 Whan it was ower, he cam&#x02019; thro&#x02019; the kitchen, for that was the nearest way to the kerridge. Mrs. Welsh was wi&#x02019; him, wi&#x02019; a bottle in her han&#x02019;, for she wanted to gie him a glass o&#x02019; wine, but we couldna find the screw; so she just took a knife an nicket aff the head o&#x02019; the bottle. As he was takin&#x02019; the wine, he saw I was lookin&#x02019; at him, an&#x02019; he said, &#x02018;Ow, he&#x02019;ll get roon [round], he&#x02019;ll get roon!&#x02019; But he didna get roon ava [at all], for the next day he was waur [worse], an&#x02019; on the Sabbath morning he was sae bad they put a laddie on a horse to ride to Edinburgh for the doctor, but before the laddie was weel awa&#x02019;, the breath gaed clean oot o&#x02019; him! There was deid silence in the hoose for aboot half an oor, an&#x02019; the first that brak it was Miss Jean. She was sitting on the stair, when up she got wi&#x02019; a scream, an&#x02019; cried, &#x02018;I maun see my father!&#x02019; an&#x02019; rushed to the locked door o&#x02019; his room; but, before she could open it, Dr. Howden gat her in his airms, an&#x02019; she fainted clean awa&#x02019;. He carried her through the drawing-room, ye ken, to the little bedroom aff it, an&#x02019; laid her on the bed beside her puir mother that was lying there in a deid swoon; an&#x02019; there they were, like twa deid corpses! Eh, but it was waefu&#x02019;! I thocht I wad look in an&#x02019; say a word, whan the mistress brak oot into sic a fit o&#x02019; greetin&#x02019; I thocht she wad break her heart. So I went to Dr. Howden an&#x02019; telled him to come an&#x02019; see her, for I thocht she wad dee, but he said, &#x02018;Oh, Betty, I&#x02019;m gled o&#x02019;t, for it&#x02019;s juist the best thing that could happen to her;&#x02019; an&#x02019; he only wished Miss Jean could get a gude greet too.&#x0201D; Such was Betty&#x02019;s account of this tragic event, which cast a gloom over the whole town and countryside. After a little I said to Betty, &#x0201C;Suppose we read a bit out of this same Gospel of John, that the Doctor was so fond of;&#x0201D; and, taking the same Bible off the round table, I turned to the 17th chapter, and read that wonderful prayer, in which our Lord gives vent to the pent-up feelings of His heart;<note n="4" noteref="1135">See John 17.</note>
