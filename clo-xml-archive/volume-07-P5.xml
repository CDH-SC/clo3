<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>All your Letters came punctually to hand; the last one from Calais<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> on the Sunday, as you hoped; greatly to our solacement, and to our Mother&#x2019;s, to whom this like the others was without delay transmitted. The Wednesday you appointed me to write on for Milan, at least the <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi> preceding it, having now arrived, you shall find no less punctuality in me. Jane and I are for Dumfries tomorrow, on shopping business; where I will despatch this sheet myself. Let us hope that it will find you safe over the Alps, and in good heart to enjoy the comfort <supplied>[that]</supplied> may lie in it. You did not say, at Calais, when you were to write again; nevertheless I calculate on again hearing from you before you reach Italy; perhaps from Lausanne, or even some nearer resting place?</p>
<p>We often try a little to picture out your route up the Rhine, in the vintage-season: but our knowledge is too imperfect, your own data for us were too unfixed; the whole swims in vagueness, and only our affectionate wishes can go with you. My Mother charged me, thro&#x2019; Jean, in answer to the Letter <hi rend="italic">she</hi> got to say that she was much satisfied with it, and sent you her heart&#x2019;s-blessing. For me too at present there is little else of importance to be said. I reckoned favourably of your Company, from the little glimpses you gave us into it: there is, to all appearance, goodness enough in it to ensure moderate peace, and let the diverse elements there brought together work with moderate harmony. Discords too will come, discords are nowhere wanting and can be nowhere wanting in this Earth; but these, as you know, are properly but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">unregulated</hi> concords,&#x201D; and I think will prove no deeper or greater than are essential for the music. You are all kindly people, trustful and deserving trust; of few travelling or resting Parties can so much be said. As for you, continue to remember always that even in <hi rend="italic">regulating</hi> those same &#x201C;unregulated concords&#x201D; does, in all situations, the wise man&#x2019;s task and happiness lie.</p>
<p>With regard to Craigenputtoch and ourselves there has nothing of the smallest moment happened since you heard last: no news either <pb id="pg-07-4" n="07-4"/>here or at Scotsbrig; which means at least no bad news. We have had visitors enough; too many sometimes. On that Wednesday Night before you left London, William Graham made his appearance; the white horse glimmered on me thro&#x2019; the trees as I stood pruning among them, and next moment the honest man and I were exchanging our somewhat boisterous salutations. He staid till Friday, amid rather bad weather, and rather wearisome conversation (for he has become altogether <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> in his ideas), yet with much honest feeling on all sides; and then on Friday, he and I rode over together to Templand, and spent the night (tolerably enough) there; and parted next day at Auldgarth,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Auldgirth, 8 miles NNW of Dumfries.</note> Graham being bound for one Robson&#x2019;s (your &#x201C;Eng<hi rend="italic">rush</hi>&#x201D;!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;Engrush&#x2019; for &#x2018;ingratiate&#x2019; (a very old expression of ours)&#x201D;&#x2014;TC&#x2019;s note on a letter by Jane written in <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date> (Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, II, 180, 182). The context here suggests that the expression could have originated with Robson, otherwise unidentified.</note>), and with him to Hazliebrae, on some business of his Sister&#x2019;s. I told him you had mentioned in your Letter a <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> purpose to write him, and that probably he would find a Letter lying for him at Ecclefechan; a hope that seemed to flatter him greatly. Was it fulfilled? I have not heard of him since. That day, by the bye, was the &#x201C;shake-wind&#x201D; day, and did some damage, to Alick and Jamie as well as others: it was the night before that that frightful business of the Amphitrite occurred near you;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330920-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1833-09-20">20 Sept.</date></ref></note> but with us I remarked, the wind did not begin till towards midnight on Friday; for it came from the North, the vacuum lay in the South, and the torrent was first set flowing there.&#x2014; After shaking hands with Grahame I turned in by Whigham;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably George Whigham, of Allanton, Dunscore.</note> who detained me perforce for a dinner-party consisting of Closeburn Mundell,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mundell, schoolmaster of Closeburn Grammar School.</note> Sir T. Kirkpatrick<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18211109-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:391</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-11-09">9 Nov. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> and many women and children; out of which I realised but a moderate day. Whigham himself I found coarse but forcible, mirthful, shrewd; the most sufficient kind of fellow I have yet met with here: by and by I mean to see him again.&#x2014; Some days after this Jane went off with her Mother and Helen<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Welsh, one of the Liverpool cousins.</note> to Moffat, leaving me here in perhaps the most perfect seclusion any European man was suffering or enjoying. I made a point not to be <hi rend="italic">idle</hi>; and spent those ten days better than I have done many: was glad enough nevertheless to seek my little companion home again from Templand; who for her <pb id="pg-07-5" n="07-5"/>share seemed no less glad to get back to me. Moffat was &#x201C;detestable&#x201D; enough: she had found the Andersons there, however, and could report handsomely of them. It seems meanwhile that John <hi rend="italic">is</hi> going to Law about Stroquhan; most unjustly, as I think, yet not without chance of success, which to most people will justify all.&#x2014; The next visitor we got was poor Glen&#x2019;s Brother Archy; one night late, his rap sounded strange thro&#x2019; the house; he had come to Dunscore by the Glasgow Coach. A most amiable, sensible creature we found him, one of the best youths I have seen for long. What a blessing, in the mournful state of his little household, now all resting on his shoulders alone. We talked greatly about his poor Brother; strove to sift out his true position in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> respects; in Conclusion we came upon this project: to have Glen boarded and lodged with Peter Austin here, who can furnish up a tolerable room for him, and will undertake at 12/ a-week; we shall then have the poor fellow close by, can endeavour to put him on some employment and amusement, and <hi rend="italic">try</hi> if any influence of ours can assist him. Archy at least was to take the plan home in his head, and submit it to the Glasgow Doctors: we are to hear from him either tomorrow, or next Wednesday. My own hopes of Glen rather strengthened by questioning Archy; I learned among other things that the poor Law-Student&#x2019;s money had been all done, and his proud heart grieved by robbing a younger Brother for support: in midst of an inward chaos and an outward too his sight had grown confused. My hope grounds itself chiefly on Glen&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">honesty of heart</hi>. If he come here I will set him to read Homer with me, or something of that kind, and see him as often as I can. Alas, what wreck of young hopes there is in this Earth! Archy Glen was not gone, with his sad errand, when with a whole bevy of biped and quadruped attendants, arrived William Gray and Wife. A couple not very unlike the Badamses: vehemence, irresolution, sinking bewilderment amid a world of Confusions; finally indolent sensuality, and&#x2014;a bottle of whisky in the day! No visit that we ever had here was so intolerable to both of us: at last, after five mortal days they went out, without being thrown out. I think they will not trouble us again. For poor Gray, a man not without force, quickness, light-gleams in all kinds (a sort of Frank Dixon in many things) I feel much pity: but how can you help a man that will not help himself; that in all straits finds a <hi rend="italic">present</hi> aid in the whisky-bottle? One night I lectured him earnestly; he was in tears albeit unused to that mood; but, next day, must again demand &#x201C;a little whisky to mix with it, if you&#x2019;ll allow me.&#x201D; I afterwards rather avoided earnest talk with him: the thing to be done is already <hi rend="italic">spoken</hi>, ascertained; <pb id="pg-07-6" n="07-6"/><hi rend="italic">do</hi> it! On the whole, these things are Tragedies: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schicksal und eigne Schuld</hi></foreign> [Fate and one&#x2019;s own guilt]!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For William Gray, see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300211-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-02-11">11 Feb. 1830</date></ref>. Carlyle wrote of him in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> on <date when="1833-09-08">8 Sept.</date>: &#x201C;Poor Grey! One might read homilies enough out of him; he is another of those Life-Tragedies one sees so many of. To all appearances a nearly ruined man; bloated, blotched, quivering (as with palsy, at the age of 35); talking loud incoherently, fond of whisky-grog. Yet a certain savage energy looks now and then thro&#x2019; the poor fellow; who knows but he may rally again! Heaven grant it. He sat here, and talked; at times, when you guided him, not quite unprofitably; cut out my <hi rend="italic">Erasmus</hi>, but in return gave me much local Biography, with touches of Self-biography. Would fain have had me down with him to his &#x2018;Doubting Castle&#x2019; or Cave of Despair at Auchencairn; but I would not.&#x201D; For Frank Dixon, see Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, ed. Ian Campbell (London, <date when="1972-00-00">1972</date>), pp. 208&#x2013;11.</note></p>
<p>If you ask now, what in suffering and witnessing all these little matters I have performed and accomplished for myself? the answer might look rather meagre. I have not yet put pen to paper. The <hi rend="italic">new chapter</hi> of my History as yet lies all-too confused; I look round on innumerable fluctuating masses; can begin to build no edifice from them. However, my mind is not <hi rend="italic">empty</hi>, which is the most intolerable state. I think occasionally with energy; I read a good deal; I wait, not without hope<supplied>[.]</supplied> What other can I do? Looking back over the last seven years, I wonder at myself; looking forward, were there not a fund of tragical Indifference in me, I could lose head. The economical outlook is so complex, the spiritual no less. Alas, the <hi rend="italic">thing</hi> I want to do is precisely the thing I cannot do. My mind would so fain deliver itself adequately of that &#x201C;Divine Idea of the World&#x201D;; and only in quite <hi rend="italic">in</hi>adequate approximations is such deliverance possible. I want to write what Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh calls a story of the <hi rend="italic">Time-Hat</hi>; to show forth to the men of these days that they also live in the Age of Miracle!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 260&#x2013;1.</note> We shall see. Meanwhile one of the subjects that engages me most is the French Revolution, which indeed for us is still the subject of subjects. My chief errand to Paris were freer inquiry into this: one day, if this mood continue, I may have something of my own to say on it. But to stick nearer home: I have as good as engaged with myself not to go even to Scotsbrig till I have <hi rend="italic">written something</hi>. With which view partly, on Saturday last, I determined on two things I could write about (there are twenty others, if one had any vehicle): the first a <hi rend="italic">History of the Diamond Necklace</hi>;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March</date></ref>.</note> the next an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Saint-Simonians</hi>.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Never written.</note> I even wrote off to Cochrane,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> as diplomatically <pb id="pg-07-7" n="07-7"/>as I could, to ask whether they would suit him. Be his answer what it may, I think I shall fasten upon that <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi> business (to prove myself in the Narrative style), and commence it (sending for Books from Edinburgh) in some few days. At this then you can figure me as occupied. For the rest, I have Books enough: your great Parcel came about a fortnight ago; some of the Scotsbrig volumes a little crushed on the back; otherwise uninjured: I sent these latter forward to their place; and have already read what Mill sent for me. Finally, yesterday, no farther gone, I drove over to Barjarg (in the middle of thick small rain) to get the <hi rend="italic">keys of the Barjarg Library;</hi> which accordingly, after negotiation enough, I found most handsomely left for me by the Hunters; so that I could seize the Catalogue and some half-dozen volumes and hasten off with them, to return at discretion! It is really a very great favour; there are various important works there; reading which I am far better than at any University. For the first time in my life I have free access to some kind of Book-Collection; I a Book-Man.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-10-26">Oct. 26</date> Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal:</hi> &#x201C;Have read almost incessantly, from the Barjarg Library. Highly miscellaneous; not very profitable. Written nothing.&#x201D; Yet he goes on to put down in considerable detail the titles of books and details from them dealing with France in the second half of the eighteenth century.</note> One way and other, we look forward to a cheerfullish kind of winter here.</p>
<p>You already gather that I have <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> none of the Scotsbrig people since the day after you saw them. Several Letters have passed, however; the tenor of which has always been favourable. Wednesday last was Roodfair too; and besides Letters that came that day (and others that <hi rend="italic">went</hi>&#x2014;with your Book-parcel), the Austins saw Jamie and Alick, and brought tidings of them. Neither had <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> done with shearing; but good crops, and were far on: the weather since then has been of the worst, and only today grew dry again. Our good Mother seems to be cheerful, hearty, as well as she was. She will not come up, till after I go down; and urges me to get on with my writing. Jamie sold the Colt that was here to Alick. He hired <hi rend="italic">Will</hi> Austin for winter; Mary&#x2019;s Austin wishing to be free, and seek for farms. We also have to change our servant; and think of engaging Grace Cavens,<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310329-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-03-29">29 Mar. 1831</date></ref>.</note> the only creature of the servant species, whom we have tried, and found to be above <hi rend="italic">Lying:</hi> at such low altitude is the moral elevation of our people here; in fact, their total <hi rend="italic">want</hi> of morality is very astonishing, very frightful.&#x2014; Your Sister-in-law seems to me and to herself very considerably improved since you first prescribed for her; Moffat did her <pb id="pg-07-8" n="07-8"/>considerable mischief; nevertheless she is getting into heart again, into good looks, and anticipates the winter with more spirit than usual. She gives me a little tune or two many a night; and so we sit, as still as we can. Alick is to be up, he promises, &#x201C;between shearing and Potatoe-time,&#x201D; with a cart that will bring corn for Harry, and take down larches. Such are the private news. Of public I think of none that could interest you for a moment. Gavin Johnstone (poor Homicide!) was fined in thirty pounds, and three months imprisonment: he held his hands on his face, all the time of the trial, and inspired compassion rather than any other feeling.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gavin (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251026-TC-JJ-01"><sic>3:398</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1825-10-26">26 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>) was brother of Carlyle&#x2019;s old friend James (see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18130624-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:4</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1813-06-24">24 June 1813</date></corr></ref>). On <date when="1833-09-14">14 September</date> he was tried at Dumfries for the culpable homicide of William Craik, joiner. Craik and John Johnston (another brother) had started a fight over an apprentice, in the Blue Bell Inn, Annan; the fight was taken over by Gavin; Craik was knocked unconscious and died half an hour later. James Johnston was present at the trial; General Matthew Sharpe gave evidence as to Gavin&#x2019;s good character; and the jury found culpable homicide not proved but that he was guilty of assault. He was sentenced to a fine of &#xa3;30 and four months in Annan jail. Gavin, as the <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi> reported (<date when="1833-09-19">19 Sept.</date>) &#x201C;appeared to be affected by a deep sense of contrition; and during the whole trial his face was buried in his hands.&#x201D;</note> The &#x201C;Tongues&#x201D; go on here, and some it is said have got the length of Bedlam (Dow, for one); but the reports are so manifestly spiteful and exaggerated, one knows not what to believe.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Rev. David Dow or his brother. The <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi> (<date when="1833-10-03">3 Oct.</date>) reports that &#x201C;enthusiasts, not content with &#x2026; a chapel, come forth to our public streets and quays to utter their blasphemies&#x201D;; it speaks of &#x201C;the hideous yells &#x2026; of these self-dubbed Apostles&#x201D; and calls for them to be &#x201C;quelled like any other public nuisance.&#x201D; The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-11-02">2 Nov. 1833</date>) was to report that Anderson, one of the prophets, was &#x201C;now confined in a madhouse.&#x201D;</note> My namesake preached a while on the Highstreet, Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>; but the Police turned him off: I fear he too will soon be in a Strait-waistcoat. Of Irving no tidings. Jeffrey has never yet written; but a Letter from him <hi rend="italic">is</hi> expected&#x2014;<foreign><hi rend="italic">unbeschreiblich ruhig</hi></foreign> [indescribably quiet]. Mill tells us in person that he is going to Paris and cannot see us this year. He expresses himself in a loving manner towards you; does not yet <hi rend="italic">know</hi> you; yet enough of you to anticipate true satisfaction from knowing you. I set him on investigating Paris for us; will probably write him again, for books to be bought, before he go. I find Mill one of the purest, worthiest men of this country; but, as you say, much too exclusively <hi rend="italic">logical</hi>. I think, he will mend: but his character is naturally not <hi rend="italic">large</hi>, rather high and solid.</p>
<p>The Paper is nearly done here; and yet I feel as if innumerable things had been forgotten. Properly as if nothing had been remembered; for my head is none of the clearest this morning. I will try for <pb id="pg-07-9" n="07-9"/>Fea&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Win</hi>[<hi rend="italic">c</hi>]<hi rend="italic">kelmann</hi><note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlo Domenico Fea (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), Italian archeologist, published his translation <hi rend="italic">Storia delle arti del Disegno presso gli antichi</hi>, 3 vols.

For you it is naturally the most appropriate study of all; there where you sit in the very scene of it study to profit by your place whatever be the produce of it, all places (even Craigenputtoch) produce something. I wish I might get Fea, for then I should read it with you: I almost need company to carry me thro&#x2019; it. In my own heterodox heart there is yearly growing up the strangest crabbed one-sided persuasion, that all Art is but a reminiscence now, that for us in these days <hi rend="italic">Prophecy</hi> (well understood) not Poetry is the thing wanted; how can we <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">paint</hi> when we do not yet <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">see?</hi> There is some considerable truth in this; how much I have not yet fixed. Now what under such point of view is all existing Art and Study of Art? What was the great Goethe himself?

<p>Your account of Badams is very verisimilar, very sorrowful: I doubt if there will be found strength in him to save himself. You once sent me his address but the Letter is at Scotsbrig (I think), and I know not how to direct, else probably I should write to him. What good can one do? Remind him that a friendly eye is upon him; that is all. Poor fellow! One grieves and grudges to see him perish.&#x2014; Nothing of Holcroft; except the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> duly. Did you deal with him at all on that matter? You have heard me speak of Mr Swan of Kirkcaldy. I got a Letter some weeks ago, announcing that he was dead! His household and environment seemed but last <date when="1833-05-00">May</date> one of the most virtuous and prosperous in the world; and now! I wrote to his widow; not what I felt, for somehow I could not express that. Swan was, on the whole, one of the best men I ever came in contact with. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die raschbewegliche Zeit! All-zerst&#xF6;rend</hi></foreign> [Fast-moving time!

<p>This is not the thin foreign post; neither is that sort done yet. Tell me whether the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of it makes much difference, and how much. This holds the ink better.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh, who seems rather unusually nervous &#x26;c, is for Liverpool in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>When you write tell us the <hi rend="italic">biographic</hi> doings of your Travelling party; dramatically, epically, lyrically. Little touches in all these kinds will bring us far nearer you than all &#x201C;general views&#x201D; could. Explain all with copiousness, frankness.

<salute>My dear Inglis,</salute>
<p>This is not an answer to the letter lately sent my Wife,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> tho&#x2019; I too enjoyed and laughed over that: it is a new call on your benevolence;&#x2014;such as, in this imperfect fallen state, are seldom wanting among men. The thing I need at present is <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>.</p>
<p>After a long period of half-idleness, I have resolved on putting on paper a little piece on the history of the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace:</hi> this is a <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> which (under penalties) you can disclose to no third party. For accomplishing my small purpose there are certain volumes wanting, which I had in my hand last winter, but must now apply to your influence and kindness for a new sight of. As nearly as I can recollect here is the list of them:</p>
<p>1. Abb&#xE9; Georgel (<hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires de</hi>);<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois Georgel (<date when="1731-00-00">1731</date>&#x2013;<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires pour servir &#xE0; l&#x2019;histoire des &#xE9;v&#xE9;nements de la fin du 18e si&#xE8;cle depuis <date when="1760-00-00">1760</date> jusqu&#x2019;en <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>&#x2013;<date when="1810-00-00">10</date>,</hi> 6 vols. (Paris, <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>).</note> the <hi rend="italic">Second volume</hi>, I am almost sure: however, you will see by the table of Contents; and indeed by a huge picture of the Diamond Necklace itself, as large as nature, by way of frontispiece to the volume in question. It is in the Advocates&#x2019; Library; perhaps too in yours.</p>
<p>2. Memoirs of the <hi rend="italic">Countess de la Motte:</hi> there are two Books bearing this title, both of which I want; the first in French (one volume); the second in English (two volumes): if you be straitened as to faculty, the <hi rend="italic">latter</hi> alone will suffice me; I have a kind of version of the other at home. These also in the Advocates&#x2019;.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jeanne de Saint-R&#xE9;my de Valois, Comtesse de la Motte (<date when="1756-00-00">1756</date>&#x2013;<date when="1791-00-00">91</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires justificatifs de la Comtesse de Valois de la Motte, &#xE9;crit par elle-m&#xEA;me</hi> (London, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>); and, in English, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Countess de Valois de la Motte; &#x2026; written by herself</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>). See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XVIII, 350 ff.</note></p>
<p>3. If you will look in the Advocates&#x2019; Catalogue under the head <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi>, you will find some four or five Books mentioned; among others, a certain <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moire</hi>, or some such thing, &#x201C;for the <hi rend="italic">Demoiselle Gay d&#x2019;Oliva</hi>&#x201D;; that is the thing I principally want: another somewhat similar law-paper &#x201C;for the <hi rend="italic">Sieur Villate</hi>&#x201D; (?) is probably (if you look <pb id="pg-07-12" n="07-12"/>well) contained in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> little volume: nay, at worst, I can dispense with it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marie Nicole Le Guay d&#x2019;Oliva (b. <date when="1761-00-00">1761</date>), <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moire pour la demoiselle Le Guay d&#x2019;Oliva &#x2026; accus&#xE9;e &#x2026; en pr&#xE9;sence &#x2026; du Sieur de Cagliostro &#x2026;</hi> (Paris, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>) (a <hi rend="italic">Seconde M&#xE9;moire</hi> of her appeared in Paris the same year); Louis Marc Antoine R&#xE9;taux de Villette, <hi rend="italic">Requ&#xEA;te pour le Sieur M.-A. R&#xE9;taux de Villette, accus&#xE9;; &#x2026; en pr&#xE9;sence &#x2026; du Sieur Cagliostro &#x2026;</hi> (Paris, <date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>). Cf. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 398 n.</note></p>
<p>4. If in the <hi rend="italic">Signet Library</hi>, or any other Library, you could by great good luck light upon a certain French <hi rend="italic">Recueil des Pieces</hi> relating to this same famous <hi rend="italic">Collier</hi>, and despatch the same to me, I should esteem it a real Godsend. Such a work I am pretty sure was published; but I never yet could get eye on it; and dare not hope that you will be more fortunate.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Affaire du Collier; Suite de l&#x2019;Affaire du Collier</hi> (Paris, <date when="1785-00-00">1785</date>). The &#x201C;Collier Affair&#x201D; was that of the Diamond Necklace. See Carlyle&#x2019;s excellent notes on these two volumes in &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 334&#x2013;5.</note></p>
<p>Now having, by energy and goodwill, collected me these volumes, the next thing to do is to have them tightly wrapped in paper, addressed to me &#x201C;Care of Mr M&#x2019;Kie Bookseller Dumfries,&#x201D; and left with Oliver &#x26; Boyd <hi rend="italic">before Monday night</hi> next; the next Wednesday I get them, safe and cheap. For attaining this if you will direct the Books to be taken over to Messrs Bell and Bradfutes in Bank Street, and yourself look in there, and ask for Mr Aitken, and mention the business to him, he will for my sake cheerfully undertake to pack and transact what is needful, and relieve you of all farther trouble. A small <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> (of a Letter) from your own hand would indeed still be most welcome.</p>
<p>Finally (for the patience even of a Henry Inglis must at last end for me), if any heavy obstacle occur, if in any way my good Friend and Provider feels his hands tied in this matter, let him without shadow of scruple apprise me of it forthwith; I shall take some other course in this instance, and the more freely apply to him in the next. And now, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Laus Deo</hi></foreign> [Praise to the Lord]! The <hi rend="italic">business</hi> is ended.</p>
<p>If you knew in what a wretched state of equipment I am here, for writing, for speaking, for thinking, you could not in charity desire me to say a single word more. We go home tomorrow; I can there write to you, to almost any length you like. There is hardly one of my correspondents, I think, whom I love better at present. Indeed, in looking back over Edinburgh and last winter, scarcely another object but yourself and your environment smiles on me with any heartiness. The Devil is so busy; the flesh so weak! But you, your pretty little household, <pb id="pg-07-13" n="07-13"/>your good and beautiful little Wife (to whom, pray, lovingly remember me), your whole, reasonable and manful, attitude towards the world: all this is a thing I dwell upon with real pleasure. Glory to Heaven! you have quitted <hi rend="italic">Gigmanity</hi> forever: not &#x201C;always keeping a Gig&#x201D; (to be &#x201C;respectable&#x201D;), but always standing on your own two legs (to be honest), will you front the world. Adhere <hi rend="italic">resolutely</hi> to this plan, let the <supplied>[wind blow?]</supplied> as it lists; year after year I shall find you better and wiser; strong, manlike, ready for the duties and destinies of Time; and of Eternity, for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> too is near at hand to us all.</p>
<p>Remember me to Ferriar [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and Colquhon;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably James Frederick Ferrier (<date when="1808-00-00">1808</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">64</date>), metaphysician and a friend of Sir William Hamilton. John Campbell Colquhoun was also an intimate friend of Sir William Hamilton. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330411-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, [<date when="1833-04-11">11 April 1833</date>]</ref>.</note> I still think of them as of the hopefullest I saw in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>You are a wicked rogue to write so of poor Hunt. Outwardly the poor youth was but a sick Cockney stranded in foreign parts; for whom Tolerance, of all things, were the needfullest. However, he says you treated him with most paternal kindness; this makes amends for all.</p>
<p>The hour is come for setting off, they say; a most ugly drizzling hour it is!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Believe me ever, / Your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>P.S. M&#x2019;Diarmid has got three names for Hunt: his own, <hi rend="italic">John M&#x2019;Diarmid;</hi> then Macalpine Leny of Dalswinton, and&#x2014;Comelin (of the Something-Bank) Dumfries:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently John M&#x2019;Diarmid had persuaded two friends to put their names down for one of Hunt&#x2019;s works, to be sent from Adam Black, the Edinburgh bookseller&#x2019;s, 27 North Bridge: probably <hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works</hi> (London, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>).

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Will you allow me to write you a few words on a matter very important to you and all of us. I have unluckily very little time at present: however, the business does not now first come before me; if my language be hurried, my meaning may be calm enough.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-14" n="07-14"/>I hear often of late that you are of mind to, what is called, &#x201C;change your life&#x201D;; that you have fixed on a fair partner,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1890-00-00">90</date>) was to marry Isabella Calvert (d. <date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>) in <date when="1834-06-00">early June 1834</date>. They had four children: James, the eldest son, who farmed Craigenputtoch and then Newlands, near Kirtlebridge and Ecclefechan, and married his cousin Kate Austin; John, who took over Scotsbrig from his father; Thomas (ca. <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1840-00-00">40</date>); and Jessie (ca. <date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1874-00-00">74</date>), who married a Birmingham merchant named Scott. The problem now uppermost in the mind of the family was with whom Mrs. Carlyle was to live, although she was not unduly concerned; there were evidently difficulties in arranging for her to live with any of the children. Marrs, p. 334, also says that it was thought that Isabella &#x201C;had only a short while to live.&#x201D;</note> and, as the latest accounts run, are rather inclined to wed so soon as Martinmas<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1833-11-11">11 Nov.</date></note> coming. That you should resolve on anything that promises to increase your happiness, above all in so regular and honest a way as that of Marriage is what none that loves you can in the least object to: we will all join in heartily wishing you happiness, and by every means in our power contributing to it. Nevertheless, it is a precept of high authority: &#x201C;Do all things decently <hi rend="italic">and in order</hi>&#x201D;:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Cor. 14:40.</note> this also you will not forget. I have found you always one of the most fair and just persons, in all dealings with you; it seems to me, you have only to be reminded of one or two things to resolve on accomplishing them, were it even at a greater sacrifice than they will cost as we now stand. Let me then, who am doubtless <hi rend="italic">cooler</hi> than you in regard to this matter, explain a little how it lies.</p>
<p>Of your fair intended I know nothing personally, and have heard very little; that little, however, was all in her favour: we shall take it for granted, therefore, that on this <hi rend="italic">head</hi> all is well, and nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>Under another point of view, you have doubtless considered that such an engagement must presuppose one condition: Our Mother and Sisters forming some other establishment also. I should not be surprised indeed if you had fancied that our Mother and your Wife might try to live together at Scotsbrig: but depend upon it, my dear Brother, this will never and in no case do. My Mother herself, I feel sure, and all of us that have more years on our head than you will utterly and in all shapes oppose such an arrangement; and you yourself, if not now yet at some future day, will heartily thank us for doing so. The house must belong to your Wife from the instant she sets foot in it: neither Mother nor Sister must any longer be there to contest it with her.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-15" n="07-15"/>The next question then for all of us, and for you too, is What will my Mother and the two Lasses<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean and Janet, both unmarried, were still at Scotsbrig.</note> do? I have thought of it often; and tho&#x2019; changes are always greivous [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], I think there are means to get a new way of life devised for our dear Mother and those that still need her guidance, and see them supported without burdening any one. They must have of course a habitation of their own; with my Mother&#x2019;s money, with the interest of the Girls&#x2019;s money, with mine (or what was Alick&#x2019;s, now in your hands) which I think of adding to it, they will be able to live decently enough, I think, if we can bejudicious in choosing some place for them.</p>
<p>For this latter &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">if,</hi>&#x201D; however, you yourself see that <hi rend="italic">Martinmas</hi> is by no means the fit time; that Whitsunday, the universal term-day of the country, is the soonest they can be asked to find new quarters. Now as your Wife cannot be brought home to Scotsbrig before that time, my decided advice were that you did not wed till then. I understand what wonderful felicities young men like you expect from marriage; I know too (for it is a truth as old as the world) that such expectations hold out but for a little while. I shall rejoice much (such is my experience of the world) if in your new situation you feel <hi rend="italic">as</hi> happy as in the old; say nothing of happier. But, in any case, do I not know that you will never (whatever happen) venture on any such solemn engagement with a direct Duty to fly in the face of? The Duty namely of doing to your dear Mother and your dear Sisters <hi rend="italic">as you would wish that they should do to you</hi>. Believe me, my dear Brother, wait; half a year for such an object is not long! If you ever repent so doing, blame me for it.&#x2014; I would add also (tho&#x2019; with real delicacy and reluctance) that two visits a <supplied>[week]</supplied> or even one a week (if you have other work to mind) may easily be an <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> <supplied>[of &#x201C;too]</supplied> much of nothing&#x201D;! Remember, my dear Brother, that without <hi rend="italic">self-restraint</hi> <supplied>[and]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">forbearing</hi>, there is no such thing as virtue possible. You must excuse this last remark; and if in considering it you find it to be wind, treat it as such.</p>
<p>In all this, I have said nothing about Alick, to whom I believe the half of the Scotsbrig Lease belongs. I fancy he too is partly aware of your intentions or wishes. In all probability his purpose may be already formed too. If you mean nothing but honourable affectionate Conduct (as I believe in my heart you do) he, on his side, is bound by every tie to mean nothing else.</p>
<p>And so now my dear James you have it all before you; and can <pb id="pg-07-16" n="07-16"/>consider what you will do. Do nothing that is <hi rend="italic">selfish</hi>, nothing that you cannot front the world and the World&#x2019;s Maker upon! May He direct you aright.</p>
<p>Enclosed is a small note for Alick; who will let me know next Wednesday whether I am to come down or not&#x2014;in his judgement. You may, if you like, show him this Letter; or if you do not like, then do not.&#x2014; God bless you, dear Brother!&#x2014; My kindest affection to Mother and Sisters.&#x2014; <closer><salute>In great haste, / Ever your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Supper is past, and the Wife away to bed; and I, if I can keep my eyes so long open, have still another Letter to write. I have sat reading the whole day, and huddled all my remaining duties into a corner. The inclosure that I now send you will make amends for the trifling cover.</p>
<p>Jack, as you will see, dates from the borders of Switzerland a fortnight back; is well and quiet, and we may hope and trust, over the Alps by this time. Let us be thankful for what is come; and anticipate the best we can as to what is coming. A Letter from me will be in Milan probably before now; full of all kinds of details: I trust our poor wanderer may have arrived to take pleasure from it. All seems to go quite tolerably with him; nothing worse than <hi rend="italic">weariness</hi> to complain of: all good principles too seem to be confirming themselves in him.</p> 
<p>Last week Jamie would get a Letter; the effect of which I could like well to know. I gave him the best counsel and admonition I had; and think perhaps he will see right to follow it. If otherwise, Alick or Jean must let me know, and I will come down directly, and see face to face what is to become of it. As for you, my dear Mother, and the bits of Lasses, be under no discouragement, go as it may: while one of us has a home left, or a sixpence of money, or a grain of invention and understanding, to whom so much as to yourself does it by natural right, by gratitude and justice, belong? If James <hi rend="italic">will</hi> form a new arrangement, doubt not but we shall form another to meet it: only there must be fair warning given.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-17" n="07-17"/>I am longing much to see you all again; but still keep my engagement in my eye. I expect some Books tomorrow to enable me to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> a little Piece of writing, which will not detain me very long: and then! Jane too says she is coming with me: she seems to be considerably improving; tho&#x2019; the Moffat Expedition has done her no good, I imagine. We expect Alick here before that time.</p>
<p>I lead the stillest life here; fully happier than usual. I have been two <foreign><hi rend="italic">raiks</hi></foreign> [trips to collect something] at the Barjarg Library; the second on Saturday last, when I brought home a box-ful of Books, which busy me incessantly, with profit and pleasure. It is like a good <hi rend="italic">coat of manure</hi> at worst, which my mind had need of. I expect to spend this winter as profitably as most: we shall be the readier for whatsoever the Future may offer or demand.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Letter I have to write is to poor Glen&#x2019;s Brother: there has some demur occurred about Glen&#x2019;s coming (the Doctors fear he will not <hi rend="italic">stay</hi>): his Brother wishes much (and most modestly) that he could see me before settling. I think of asking him to bring his Brother <hi rend="italic">hither</hi>, and let us see <hi rend="italic">him</hi>.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh went off to Liverpool, the end of last week. She had received the Scotsbrig Cheese, and was more delighted with it and with the note that accompanied it than you could imagine. At that Time she says a word of affection from you was particularly opportune.</p>
<p>Mary&#x2019;s Letter came here in due course; and we have learned since how Jamie means to keep himself free and on the outlook thro&#x2019; winter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Carlyle did not marry until <date when="1834-06-00">early June 1834</date>.</note> We hope much they may find some suitable place. Is the <hi rend="italic">Orchard-town</hi> (&#x201C;worchat&#x201D;)<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A farm in Rerwick parish, Kirkcudbrightshire; &#x201C;worchat&#x201D; is a mispronunciation, adapted for some now inexplicable reason, as coterie speech.</note> far too large for them?

They will surely get some place<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>The Paper (which seems to be greasy too) is done: had I had more, I find I should have filled it,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; with mere babbles. Good night, my dear Mother. I rejoice to fancy you still holding on with some measure of health and heart; I hope Sandy&#x2019;s or Jean&#x2019;s Letter will make it certain for me.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The answer to your interesting Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> has been delayed far too long; partly by accidents which I grudged not a little. Pray understand, at all events, that anything rather than indifference to the subject of it was the cause.</p>
<p>I am generally one of the worst Travellers; hardly ever stirring from home without more or less derangement of health: at this time too I am rather specially anxious not to move till I have finished a little thing begun lately. Beyond doubt, nevertheless, if it became plain or probable that my presence with you could in the smallest contribute to such an object, there were an end to hesitation, were the journey three times as far. However, after some consideration, a second course has suggested itself; whereby perhaps the business may be managed still more effectually.</p>
<p>You remember, we had some talk, before Austin was spoken of, of your bringing William down hither for a few days. Now it seems to me if you did so still, there were probably some labour saved, and certainly a far better opportunity given us of deciding with full knowledge. We see him on the ground, in the very circumstances we propose to place him in; and judge by actual trial how he will behave. If it will not answer, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> failure were less grievous than any other we could risk. You observe too that if we should determine at Glasgow in opposition to the Doctors, the very journey I am recommending would be required; and in that case mine will have proved unnecessary.</p>
<p>The Austins have got their house cieled [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and put in order, and are ready at any time.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Carstammon, near Craigenputtoch.</note> The little articles of furniture we spoke of can (as Peter tells me) be dispensed with, or supplied otherwise, for a time; and then, if need were, could be sent best by yourself after your return. But at any rate you would first bring poor William <hi rend="italic">hither</hi> <pb id="pg-07-19" n="07-19"/>for a day or two; that we might judge whether it was good to take him farther. I know not what difficulties there may be about getting him out of the Asylum; and then (if we were forced to that) about getting him in again: but I rather think, unless they are considerable, you ought to encounter them. It were well too perhaps to ask him in distinct terms what he himself thinks of coming to see us, of living beside us: it gave me some hope to find that he had still a morality left, and would not promise what he did not mean to perform. Finally if this plan of mine seem suitable, let me know what day you are to come (remembering that <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi> is our only Post-day,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>, I fancy, with you); and I will wait for you at Dunscore with the gig; and this roof shall screen us all once more. My Wife votes also for this plan: she thanks you for your remembrances; and can I believe quite honestly assure you of a no ordinary interest. We both continue to bid you <hi rend="italic">hope</hi>, in this, as in all things; and are truly gratified to recollect the truthful, modest, manful front you can make against whatsoever may betide. On this subject I could say more, but do not. Pray look on us not as new acquaintances but as old friends.</p>
<p>Those French sheets are of the utmost confusion; yet one cannot say <hi rend="italic">how much</hi> insanity they betoken. The <hi rend="italic">thin film</hi>, which for any of us separates Hallucination from Reality, is here rent asunder; and on poor William the vague Infinite storms in, and chaotically shapes itself. I know almost nothing of these matters; and for him I have only one sure hope; this one, that I knew him to be at heart a good man, and that Goodness in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> circumstances tends towards health <supplied>[and away from]</supplied> malady. I long much to see him.</p>
<p>In the Asylum I think I gather from you that he shows no visible tendency towards cure. This is a strong argument for trying something else, if anything else can be tried. Do not despair. There is a Literary man now living, one Loyd<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Lloyd (<date when="1775-00-00">1775</date>&#x2013;<date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>), poet, friend of Coleridge, Hunt, Lamb, and De Quincey, from all of whom Carlyle might have learned about him, spent a number of years in an asylum near York, but even after he left was subject to relapses.</note> (a man of considerable genius) who spent <hi rend="italic">five years</hi> in a madhouse, and came out sane. With William too I rather incline to augur, at best, delay.</p>
<p>It once partly seemed to me that perhaps Spring, when the Country, even this wild part of it, begins to get beautiful and hopeful, might be the best time for a removal: but I bethink me of a possibility that we may be absent after Whitsunday. This I call a possibility; tho&#x2019; the chances are rather the other way.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-20" n="07-20"/>I add only that if you cannot come as I advise, and still wish to see me, I will set out without delay.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>If this Letter reach you in Paris, it will deserve to be considered as one of the triumphs of human art; a bringing together of what we may call the opposite ends of the world. No two positions, no two manners of existence, could be more different than yours and mine, at this hour. I sit here in the middle of moors, of leafless or red-leaved trees, in the blustering of winds and desolate rain; in the completest isolation; conversing only (thro&#x2019; heaps of Books) with the absent or the dead; nothing alive in my environment but myself and my coal fire. While you&#x2014;! But I will not try to picture out your situation in that crackling, sparkling, never-resting chaos; where nevertheless you shall hear my voice, and hold fellowship with me: such feats can five fingers and the four-and-twenty Alphabetic Letters do.</p>
<p>Should I tell you all I have to say, whole reams of paper would not hold it: how then shall a miserable scrap of a single sheet! The Pen too so ill represents the thousand-voiced Thought; which I could not even <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> with the smallest completeness; for it is true what Goethe teaches, and every day I feel it truer: &#x201C;The first <hi rend="italic">word</hi> we utter we begin to <hi rend="italic">err</hi>.&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> But I will keep all that <hi rend="italic">silent</hi> (the depth and greatness of Silence also should be known to me); and abide mainly by matters of business; the articulation of which, even in a sheet, is easy. Your patience I know is great, and I apply again without apology.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had written in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> in <date when="1830-09-00">late Sept. 1830</date>: &#x201C;What folly would one avoid, did the tongue lie quiet till the mind had finished, and were calling for utterance. Not only our good Thoughts but our good Purposes also are frittered asunder and dissipated by an unseasonable speaking of them. <hi rend="italic">Words</hi>, the strangest product of our nature, are also the most potent. Beware of speaking. Speech is human, Silence is divine; yet also brutish and dead; therefore we must learn <hi rend="italic">both</hi> arts, they are both difficult.&#x201D; For the fullest development of the idea, see Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 218&#x2013;19. The quotation from Goethe is untraced. The journal passage is quoted from <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books</hi>, pp. 176&#x2013;7.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-21" n="07-21"/>Some two weeks ago I determined, by way of practicing myself in Narrative, to write a small historico-poetico Piece on the famous <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>. Foreign Quarterly Cochrane declines having anything to do with it;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cochrane in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-10-09">9 Oct.</date> had said that &#x201C;public opinion is pretty well fixed upon the shares of guilt or innocence attached to the various parties implicated in the transaction&#x201D; and that &#x201C;it would be difficult to say anything now likely to unsettle it.&#x201D;</note> I persist all the more freely for this: and now you will answer me, or get me answered where you are, a question or two:&#x2014; Is it known to anybody, who wrote those Memoirs of Lamotte? There is first one thin volume (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>); then two thicker (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date> perhaps, but they are not here); all three more like the screeching of some plundered rookery than the utterance of an articulate-speaking mortal; falser they seem than any book I ever read. Orleans is by some said to have been at the bottom of them: was there any truth in this? Lamotte interests me as an original; zoologists must dissect even rattlesnakes: but look as I will, she shows all too dim thro&#x2019; that confusion. It were something if I knew that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> wrote those lies, and under what circumstances. Next (when you get back to London), do you know what house it was, what street it was, she alighted <hi rend="italic">from</hi> and <hi rend="italic">on</hi>, in that last fall of hers? The Book says &#x201C;near the Temple of Flora,&#x201D; which I never heard of. Again, what became of her Count; did he perish in those &#x201C;Horrors of the F. R.&#x201D;? Was Oliva ever heard of again? It seems Vilette was still alive in Paris, in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>; by oversight of the Devil, he may be there yet?&#x2014; Abb&#xE9; Georgel and Madame Campan are both thought to be <hi rend="italic">true</hi>, with the bias natural to each? Nay, if you can learn it easily, tell me even in what street Boehmer and Bassange lived; whether any trace of them yet lingers <foreign><hi rend="italic">sub Luna</hi></foreign> [under the moon].&#x2014; Some of these questions will make you smile: nevertheless, small as the objects are, they would help me to <hi rend="italic">locate</hi> my little story, and be worth the paper they cost. I would ask a hundred such questions about a hundred things, were I in Paris beside you. For the rest, do not <hi rend="italic">plaugue</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] yourself about these; do not seek far after them, or spend much room in answering them.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the Comtesse de la Motte, Guay d&#x2019;Oliva, Villette, and Georgel, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331008-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1833-10-08">8 Oct.</date></ref> For Carlyle&#x2019;s discussion of the mystery of the Comte de la Motte&#x2019;s death (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), see &#x201C;The Diamond Necklace,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 401&#x2013;2. Of the death of the Comtesse de la Motte, Carlyle writes (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 397n.): &#x201C;The English Translator of Lamotte&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> says, she fell from the leads of her house, nigh the Temple of Flora, endeavouring to escape seizure for debt,&#x201D; and died. He adds: &#x201C;Where the &#x2018;Temple of Flora&#x2019; was, or is, one knows not.&#x201D; Jeanne Louise Henriette Campan (<date when="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>) was first lady of the bedchamber to Marie Antoinette and author of <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires sur la vie priv&#xE9;e de Marie-Antoinette</hi>, 3 vols. (Paris, <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>); in her later life she also wrote on education and ran a school. Boehmer, who had the title of the King&#x2019;s Jeweller, made the necklace; Bassange was his partner (see Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 330&#x2013;31). Mill did not give Carlyle precise answers to his questions, but he spoke of them to Adolphe d&#x2019;Eichthal, who collected some books and pamphlets to send to Carlyle (see Mineka, XII, 190&#x2013;91, 203).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-22" n="07-22"/>This Necklace affair has wasted so much of my sheet, I must repress a multitude of others. One that still claims mention is of the commercial sort; for there is no end to your variety of functions as my Factotum! It is to buy me for a franc or two some map, about a foot square, of the Environs of Paris. Is there such a thing? A map of the Department <hi rend="italic">Seine et Oise</hi>, still better of the old Province <hi rend="italic">Isle de France</hi>, would be of real use to me. Perhaps you can procure it. Rolled round a piece of wood, or spread out in some book, it could come to me by Fraser&#x2019;s Parcel. Also, can you get me, cheap, a Henault&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Abr&#xE9;g&#xE9; chronologique?</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Jean Fran&#x26;ccedil;ois H&#xE9;nault (<date when="1685-00-00">1685</date>&#x2013;<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>), <hi rend="italic">Nouvel abr&#xE9;g&#xE9; chronologique de l&#x2019;histoire de France</hi> (Paris, <date when="1744-00-00">1744</date>).

It is one of the worthiest Books I know; were there such another, of England. I would gladly exchange my whole historical Library for it (lingering only over <hi rend="italic">Hume</hi>), were there as many <hi rend="italic">Hallams</hi><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry Hallam (<date when="1777-00-00">1777</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">1859</date>), English historian, author of <hi rend="italic">View of the State of Europe during the Middle Ages</hi>, 2 vols.

Lastly, if you can get any such thing as some little supplementary <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Neologique</hi>, in any shape, pray bring it. I give you leave to spend a sovereign for me, on these three things; but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to harrass yourself searching for them; the map too, observe, is the only one I have really much <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of. And now, take breath; for my commissions, this time, are done. Henceforth I do nothing but <foreign><hi rend="italic">illudere chartis</hi></foreign>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Sport on paper&#x201D;: cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, iv, 139.</note> while there is paper left.</p>
<p>I recognised your criticism of the poor Whig Ministry almost at the second sentence.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-09-22">Sept. 22</date> Mill had started a series of weekly articles in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> attacking the Whig Government.</note> You are sharp enough upon the poor mongrels; but how be otherwise, if one is to speak of them at all? Perhaps there were intrinsically few functions ever baser than the one they have, with their talent, in their place, at this hour to fill. Whigs nevertheless are necessary, tho&#x2019; daily growing a viler necessity; intolerable to gods, men and columns.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi>, I. 373.</note> Unbelieving mediocrity, barren, dead and death-giving, speaks itself forth more and more in all they do and dream. <pb id="pg-07-23" n="07-23"/>The true Atheist in these days is the Whig; he worships and can worship nothing but Respectability; and this he <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>, unhappy man, to be&#x2014;nothing but a two-wheeled vehicle! The Tory is an Idolater; the Radical a wild heathen Iconoclast: yet neither of them strictly are &#x201C;without God in the world&#x201D;: the one has an <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi> hope, the other an infinite remembrance; both <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be men and not gigmen. Lord pity the poor necessary Whigs, then; as for me the less I say or think of them the better. In last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> I recognised (before the &#x201C;A.B.&#x201D;) another piece on &#x201C;Commissions&#x201D;;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Corporation Bill,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-10-20">20 Oct.</date>, pp. 659&#x2013;60.</note> which also, as the Germans say, I could heartily <foreign><hi rend="italic">gelten lassen</hi></foreign> [give praise to].

Your Morpeth philosopher &#x201C;with spectacles and no eyes&#x201D; (poor fellow!) is a Hatter, I think: Sir W.

<p>Best of all do I sympathize with you in regard to the New Testament.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had said in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-10-05">5 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;As far as I know <hi rend="italic">your</hi> impressions about Christ, <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> from this reading are exactly the same. How strikingly just for instance is your contrast in your last letter, between the Christ of the Gospels, &#x26; the namby-pamby Christ of the poor modern Christians. Many things have struck me in reading this book. One is that nearly all the good of the four Gospels is in St Matthew alone; &#x26; we could almost spare the other three. Mark and Luke however do no harm; but John has I think been the cause of almost all bad theology: the Christ of that Gospel also strikes me as quite unlike the Christ of the other three; a sort of Edward Irving, one might say.&#x201D;</note> Every wor<supplied>[d I]</supplied> say is spoken out of my heart. Great, soul-inspiring, unfathomable in significance, is that poor artless Biography <pb id="pg-07-24" n="07-24"/>by Saint Matthew! Of all <hi rend="italic">Antigigmen</hi> too, in any time in any place, the greatest is that divine Hero of St Matthew. A thousand times have his words, even thro&#x2019; all <hi rend="italic">these</hi> impediments, brought life and hope back into my heart: I have wept warm tears, as I thought of <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; and how the voice of his Glad Tidings (the <hi rend="italic">gladdest</hi> of all; for it was of man&#x2019;s indefeasible divineness) had gone forth to all lands, had reached even the English land and me. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Be of good cheer! I have overcome the world&#x201D;:</hi><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John 16:33.</note> <hi rend="italic">I!</hi>&#x2014;if you consider that, and who the <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was, a whole Gospel lies in it.&#x2014; St John I regard with you as a kind of <hi rend="italic">didactic</hi> Biographer, less taken up with his hero than with what he fancies to be his hero&#x2019;s philosophy; of far inferior value therefore; less artless, perhaps one might say less sincere. On the whole it is the thorough <hi rend="italic">heartiness</hi>, the intense and entire <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> of the Bible that makes it still the Book of Books. In no other Book is there the same quality in such a degree; some touches of it (under circumstances strangely new) I meet with in Goethe, almost alone of the moderns. I advise you to persevere in reading the Bible (in <hi rend="italic">seeing</hi> it, through all distances and disguises): that here too you have discarded Dilettantism, and can earnestly look at the Earnest, this is a new pleasure to me.</p>
<p>As for myself, not having &#x201C;a ream of paper,&#x201D; how shall I explain what passes with me? I feel in general that I am at the end of an epoch, for good or for ill; if these disquietudes were but &#x201C;growth-pains,&#x201D; how gladly should I bear them! All barriers seem <hi rend="italic">overthrown</hi> in my inward world; nothing is to <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi>, to deter me, but also nothing to <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>. I pause over a boundless, <hi rend="italic">unpeopled</hi> prospect; ask how I am to walk and work there; <foreign><hi rend="italic">nehm&#x2019; mich zusammen</hi></foreign> [gather myself together]. One of the questions that oftenest presents itself, is <hi rend="italic">How</hi> Ideals do and <hi rend="italic">ought to</hi> adjust themselves with the Actual?<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 196&#x2013;97; and &#x201C;Realised Ideals,&#x201D; the title of Book One, Ch. II, of Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>.</note> A vast question, as I take it up. On which ground our John Knox and Scottish Kirk is so peculiarly significant for me. A <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi> Ideal, that did subsist, in spite of men and devils, with <hi rend="italic">life</hi> in it, for a hundred and fifty years! On the same ground too, my value for the Actual (in all senses), for what <hi rend="italic">has realized</hi> itself continues and increases: and often I ask myself, Is not all Poetry the essence of Reality (could one but get at such essence), and true History the only possible Epic? What limits my affirmative answer should have, are yet nowise clear.</p>
<p>If to all these internal fermentations you add one&#x2019;s strangely anomalous <pb id="pg-07-25" n="07-25"/>external position, you have confusion enough. My whole trade is to think and <hi rend="italic">speak;</hi> but as the world goes. I have absolutely no permission to speak! Think of poor <hi rend="italic">me</hi> and poor <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine!</hi> Yet such is my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> speaking-mechanism at this moment; for aught I know, it is my only one. With the Reviews I think I have nigh done, or am fast getting done; and as to Books, what Book I could at this moment write and be paid for (be &#x201C;furnished with meat and tools&#x201D; for), nay could even get rid of if I had it written,&#x2014;is quite a problem to me. Bookselling even Effingham Wilson finds to be about <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>&#x2014;of Puffery.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written in his letter of <date when="1833-10-05">5 Oct.</date>: &#x201C;I find both from enquiry and observation that the puffing system has worn itself out, even more rapidly than seemed likely; &#x26; a united chorus of praise from all the press will scarcely now sell fifty copies of any work: Effingham Wilson the bookseller is so sensible of this that he has resolved to cease advertising the praises of periodicals and to sell his wares by <hi rend="italic">samples</hi>, advertising passages of the works themselves. Thus does all lying contain the seeds of its own destruction.&#x201D; Effingham Wilson (<date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>) was a publisher who brought out such works as Tennyson&#x2019;s first volume and Browning&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Paracelsus</hi>.</note> I do not think <hi rend="italic">it</hi> will ever revive; nor perhaps aught satisfactory instead of it for some generations. Me (by God&#x2019;s blessing) the death of it cannot kill; yet it can confuse me, and give me pause. He who has a tongue and has anything that he <hi rend="italic">knows</hi>, cannot be kept silent. I think of various things; some of them you shall counsel me in by and by. Meanwhile what a blessing that I can sit here, not <hi rend="italic">forced</hi> to speak, for months yet; till the Inward have grown clear; to which the Outward (were it of adamant) <hi rend="italic">must</hi> give issue!</p>
<p>Nay one of the best things that has befallen me for years occurs this very winter. A not inconsiderable Library in these parts, collected by a virtuoso deceased now, is given up to my pleasure; I actually this winter have a free command of Books. Once in the three weeks I drive over, and return loaded. Figure me then, say only ten hours a day, with the fiercest appetite; forgetful of all but the thing read of! In this way shall I <hi rend="italic">top-dress</hi> my poor understanding with the wonderfullest compost; much need it had of some: thus writing or not writing I can expect a winter much happier, much profitabler than many have been.&#x2014; On all this, you shall hear enough in future; you have heard more than enough (I fear) at present.</p>
<p>The remedy is write again soon! If you have time in Paris, well; if not, when <hi rend="italic">first</hi> you have time. <closer><salute><foreign><hi rend="italic">Vale mei memor</hi></foreign> [Farewell remember me]. / Ever your&#x2019;s truly</salute></closer></p>

For her grand fault was being too <hi rend="italic">conscious;</hi> too much of a reasoner, too little of a prophetess (one must put up with these words); but on the verge of Time, she too looks into the Eternal, one can fancy her too inspired.

<salute>My dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>It is above two long months since the sight of your handwriting last gratified me at Dumfries. I was there in person, I remember; and read the kind lively sheet, with a pipe and tumbler (of water), taking with double relish &#x201C;mine ease at my inn.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">I Henry IV</hi>, III, ii.</note> Why I have not answered sooner, looks foolish to tell. I waited for &#x201C;opportunities&#x201D;; had but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> and missed it by pressure of haste. A Reformed Parliament having now, by Heaven&#x2019;s grace, taken itself into retirement, there are henceforth no &#x201C;opportunities&#x201D; possible. What can I do but what I should have done six weeks ago&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">make</hi> an opportunity? You shall pay thirteen pence and odds into His Majesty&#x2019;s impoverished Exchequer; and on this long sheet get talk from me enough:&#x2014;soon, I hope, through the <pb id="pg-07-27" n="07-27"/>same channel, repaying with interest, to the Patriot King&#x2019;s benefit and mine.</p>
<p>Your new situation looked so cheerful and peaceful, I almost fear to inquire what it has become. Chances and changes hardly leave us a week at rest in this fearful Treadmill of a World. The prophet said &#x201C;Make it like unto a wheel&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 83:13.</note> that is the kind of wheel I think we are made like unto. Meanwhile, ever as I figure you, that cheerful Tree, seen from your window, rises leafy and kind on me; I can hardly yet consent to have it leafless, and its kind whisper changed into a loud October howl. Be patient, and nestle near the chimney corner: there is a Spring coming. Nay, as I hope, one day, an Eternal Spring, when all that is dead and deserved not to die, shall bloom forth again, and live for ever!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt, writing from a new address, 4. Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, &#x201C;near London,&#x201D; had said in his letter of <date when="1833-07-29">29 July</date> (Sanders, <hi rend="italic">CH</hi>, XLV, 458): &#x201C;I have the pleasure of telling you, that I have just experienced a more than ordinary improvement in my position, having, as you will see by my new address, got at last into another far cheaper yet better house,&#x2014;at least to my taste; for it is of the good old solid wainscotted fashion, such as reminds me of the times of my father &#x26; mother; &#x26; instead of paying a hundred &#x26; sixty guineas a year for paltry heavy furniture of the people, it costs me thirty guineas with honest furniture of my own; &#x26; instead of being swept all day by a tempest of carts and omnibuses, <supplied>[it]</supplied> is as quiet as if it were a hundred miles from town,&#x2014;a remnant of the rustic part of the old village, up in a corner where there is no thorough-fare, no houses to overlook us, with gardens &#x26; trees back &#x26; front, &#x26; I have got a tree to look at as I write, with a cottage window peeping under it, amid a nest of green &#x26; you have no conception,&#x2014;as the phrase is (for you <hi rend="italic">have</hi>) of the comfort this is to me, &#x26; how my head seems to bathe itself in the quiet.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You must tell me more specially what you are doing. How prospers your Poem? Has the winter checked it; or is it already branching out to defy all storms both of outward and of inward weather?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330718-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, <date when="1833-07-18">18 July</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I see nothing here; scarcely more of you than a small &#x201C;wishing-cap&#x201D; incidentally in <hi rend="italic">Tait</hi>, and even that not lately.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hunt had written a series of essays, &#x201C;The Wishing Cap,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, <date when="1833-01-00">Jan.</date>&#x2013;<date when="1833-09-00">Sept., 1833</date>, and an earlier series in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18241220-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:234</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-12-20">20 Dec. 1824</date></corr></ref>).

The whole Literary world seems to me at this time to be little other than Chaos come again; how should I see your course in it, when I cannot see my own? This only is clear for both of us, and for all true men: mix not, meddle not with the accursed thing there; swim stoutly, unweariedly, &#x201C;if not towards landmarks on the Earth, then towards loadstars in the Heaven!&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified, but cf. the last sentence of &#x201C;Count Cagliostro.&#x201D; For &#x201C;Chaos come again,&#x201D; cf. <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi>, III, iii.</note> For the rest, as our good Scotch adage has it: Fear nothing earthly; there is ever Life for the Living.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Kelly&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi> (London, <date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>), p. 323; Carlyle also uses it in writing <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01">to his brother John, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July 1834</date></ref>. The phrase was often used by his mother.</note></p>
<p>Since I wrote last, I have read all your Poems; the whole volume, I believe, without missing a line.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had read his subscriber&#x2019;s copy of <hi rend="italic">The Poetical Works of Leigh Hunt</hi>, published in <date when="1832-00-00">late 1832</date>.</note> If you knew with what heart-sickness I in general take up a volume of modern rhymes, and again with a silent curse of Ernulphus,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230810-TC-JBW-01"><sic>2:412</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1823-08-10">10 Aug. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> (for where were the good of making a spoken one?) lay it down, this fact would have more meaning for you. I find a genuine tone of <hi rend="italic">music</hi> pervade all your way of thought: and utter itself, often in the gracefullest way, through your images and words: this is what I call your vocation to Poetry: so long as this solicits you, let it in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> forms have free course. Well for him that <hi rend="italic">hath</hi> music in his soul! Indeed, when I try Defining (which grows less and less my habit), there is nothing comes nearer my meaning as to poetry in general than this of <hi rend="italic">musical thought:</hi> the unpardonable poetry is that where the word only has rhythm, and the Thought staggers along dislocated, hamstrung, or too probably rushes down altogether in shameful inanition. One asks, <hi rend="italic">why</hi> did the unhappy mortal write in <hi rend="italic">rhyme?</hi> That miserablest decrepit Thought of his cannot even walk (with crutches); how in the name of wonder shall it <hi rend="italic">dance?</hi> But so wags, or has wagged the world literary: till now, as I said, the very sight of <hi rend="italic">dancing</hi>, drives an old stager like me quick into another street. More tolerable were the Belfast Town and Country Almanack, more tolerable is the London Directory, or McCulloch&#x2019;s Political Economy itself in the Day of Judgment than these!<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle would remember the <hi rend="italic">Belfast Town and Country Almanack</hi> because as a young man he had actually contributed to it. J. R. McCulloch (<date when="1789-00-00">1789</date>&#x2013;<date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>), author, among other works of the same kind, of <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>), renowned for its dryness.</note> To come a little to particulars: we all thought your <hi rend="italic">Rimini</hi> very beautiful; <pb id="pg-07-29" n="07-29"/>sunny brilliancy and fateful gloom most softly blended, under an <hi rend="italic">atmosphere</hi> of tenderness, clear and bright like that of Italian Pictures. Beautifully <hi rend="italic">painted;</hi> what it wanted to be a <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> (and a picture) I believe you know better than I. <hi rend="italic">Leander</hi> also dwells with me; I think, that of his &#x201C;bursting into tears,&#x201D; when he feels the waves about to beat him, is eminently natural. Thank you also for the two children&#x2019;s pieces: I remember, some seventeen years ago, seeing <hi rend="italic">Dick&#x2019;s</hi> one quoted by a Quarterly Reviewer, as an instance of &#x201C;bad taste&#x201D; (may the Devil, in his own good time, take &#x201C;taste,&#x201D; and make much of it!): but the effect on me quite baulked the Reviewer. In the same Article, I first saw that picture of the mother (&#x201C;a poor, a pensive, but a happy one&#x201D;), singing as she mended her children&#x2019;s clothes, when they were all asleep; and never lost it, or am like to lose it.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In the <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi> see &#x201C;The Story of Rimini,&#x201D; pp. 1&#x2013;98; &#x201C;Hero and Leander,&#x201D; pp. 123&#x2013;37; the two children&#x2019;s pieces are &#x201C;To T. L. H., six years old, during a sickness,&#x201D; pp. 179&#x2013;81, and &#x201C;To J. H., four years old;&#x2014;a nursery song,&#x201D; pp. 182&#x2013;87. The criticism in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> was of Hunt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Foliage</hi>, XVIII (<date when="1818-01-00">Jan. 1818</date>), 324&#x2013;35, in which, though the second poem (<hi rend="italic">Dick&#x2019;s</hi>) is criticized, the first is praised. The poem about the mother is &#x201C;The Dryads,&#x201D; pp. 198&#x2013;200.</note></p>
<p>You shall now get quit of criticism; and hear a little about Craigenputtoch. For a long while, for eight or nine months almost, I have been not idle, yet fallow; <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> not a word. A cynical Extravaganza of mine is indeed beginning to appear in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, and will continue there till you are all tired of it but it was written wholly three years and a half ago:<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-10-28">28 Oct.</date> Carlyle wrote in his <hi rend="italic">Journal: &#x201C;Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> to begin appearing this month in <hi rend="italic">Fraser.</hi> Poor Teufel<hi rend="italic">k</hi> I have got a kind of pitying love for him, much otherwise as I feel his shortcomings, his worthlessness.&#x201D;</note> it was some purpose of publishing it as a Book that brought me up to London. The last thing I wrote was a <hi rend="italic">Count Cagliostro</hi> in that extraordinary Periodical. When I shall put pen to paper next is quite a problem. It ought to be when I have <hi rend="italic">mended my ways;</hi> for nothing is so clear to me at present as that, outwardly and inwardly, I am <hi rend="italic">all in the wrong.</hi> I believe, one is hardly ever all in the right. Let us not mourn over that. But the strange thing at present with me is the outward economic state of Literature. Bookselling I apprehend to be as good as dead; without hope of revival, other than perhaps some galvanic one: the question therefore arises, what next is to be done? A monstrous question, which I think it may take two centuries to answer well. We, in the mean time, must do&#x2014;the best we can. I have various projects, some of which may become purposes; I reckon, I may see you again in London by and by, for one thing.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-30" n="07-30"/>This winter, at all events, and who knows how much more, we mean to spend here in the depths of the wilderness; divided from all men. Probably it may be a healthier winter; probably a happier and usefuller one. London I liked much, but the fogs and smoke were pestiferous; Edinburgh I find has left but a sad impression of hollowness and dulness on me: however, both might yield profit; and now a solitary winter, filled to overflowing with Books (for I have discovered a Library here), may be the profitablest of all. You, as a determined Book-moth, will appreciate my felicity, when you hear that I read some ten hours often at a sitting, divided by <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, for a walk, which I take like physic. My head grows a perfect &#x201C;Revolt of Paris&#x201D;;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, II, 180 ff.</note> nothing occurring to divert me; only the little Table-clock (poor little fellow) suggesting now and then that I am still in the world of time. I fall asleep at last towards midnight, amid the Cannon vollies, shrieks and legislative debates, the laughter and tears, of whole generations;&#x2014;for it is mainly History and Memoirs that I am reading. Now and then I shall perhaps write something, were it only for Prince Posterity. Thus you see us with winter at our door; but with huge stacks of fuel for the body&#x2019;s warmth, and for the mind&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>A benevolent artist arrived lately, moreover, and rehabilitated the Piano: a little music is invaluable to me; better than sermons; winnows all the bitter dust out of me, and for moments makes me a good man.</p>
<p>Pray think of us often; send now and then a Paper Messenger through the snow to us; to which I will not fail to reply.</p>
<p>I had innumerable questions to ask you about matters literary in London. Who manages the New Monthly Magazine now?

<salute>My dearest Eliza</salute>
<p>I was aware of your absence and the captivity in which my letter was likely to remain: but I considered it was in excellent quarters, and gave myself no concern either on its account or my own. In any case it would not have occurred to me to accuse <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of carelessness: however negligent you may be about <hi rend="italic">writing;</hi> I should be a wretch not to entertain a deep sense of your willingness and alacrity, whenever <pb id="pg-07-32" n="07-32"/>there is any thing to be <hi rend="italic">done</hi> and not to give you credit for such, on the ground of past experience, in spite of any incidental appearances that might argue the contrary.</p>
<p>The frame I find quite suitable to its contained&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">good</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plain</hi>, just as I could have wish<supplied>[e]</supplied>d it; the tea proves an excellent article at the Money; for the barley sugar I have to return the childrens joyful thanks&#x2014;you were kind to think of <hi rend="italic">them</hi>, but you are always mindful. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Nota Bene</hi></foreign>&#x2014;the next time there is <hi rend="italic">a sixpence</hi> over you may give it to the poor.</p>
<p>It filled me with astonishment that Taylor<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Thomas Taylor, 7 Caltonhill; possibly John Taylor, West Thistle St.</note> should have recollected my name and address: having transacted with him only <hi rend="italic">once</hi> in my life, and to so very limited an extent. What a pity that such a singular business talent should be employed in frame-making, and so little&#x2014;apparently&#x2014;to its possessors profit even then. I take your congratulations on the benefit received from my Moffat expedition in good part; tho nothing in the world could be more misplaced. The expedition was <foreign><hi rend="italic">ennuyante</hi></foreign> [boring] while it lasted and injurious in its effects: I am hardly yet so well as before I went thither. However I am much better now than I was last year at this time, and have a sort of moderate hope that I shall by degrees get quite well; or rather as well as ever I was&#x2014;for to say the truth my whole life has been a sort of <foreign><hi rend="italic">puddling</hi></foreign> [muddle] as to health, Too much of schooling hadst thou poor Ophelia!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, IV, vii).</note> and perhaps too much of dis<supplied>[s]</supplied>ipation also&#x2014;if we credit our friend of Kirknewton<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified; the place is a village about 11 miles west of Edinburgh.</note>&#x2014;who pronounced my &#x201C;morals corrupted and my constitution ruined&#x201D; so far back as the year <date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>, by means of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Leith Assembly! To a certainty my <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;charming naivete&#x201D;</hi> was then&#x2014;lost for ever and a day; which was the greater pity, since so little charmingness of any other sort remained behind. So I say myself in sincerity of heart, tho&#x2019; I should not exactly like that another said it &#x2014;&#x2014; And here I must positively digress from my digression just to observe that I wonder I do not send to you a letter once a week instead of once in the sixmonths; it is so pleasant to talk with you about old times whether by the fireside, or on paper&#x2014;with the profoundest disregard of all sense or ceremony.&#x2014; But so it is&#x2014; &#x201C;Man&#x201D; as Carlyle was saying last night &#x201C;is a Mass of contradictions&#x201D;&#x2014; What a quantity of wisdom new and old falls from his lips in the course of one solar day! had I but M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Taylor<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s memory to keep hold of it! <pb id="pg-07-33" n="07-33"/>On the crumbs that fall from <hi rend="italic">his</hi> table I might positively set up a respectable little breadshop of my own; if I were not too indolent to gather them up into a whole&#x2014; Just figure me dealing out <hi rend="italic">cats-meat</hi> after this sort; and realizing a <hi rend="italic">name</hi> (<hi rend="italic">over my door</hi>) (most Authors have <hi rend="italic">no more</hi>) and a snug little pin-money to boot! This indeed would be not <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;lighting the Candle at both ends&#x201D;</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> as we see some improvident couples do, but a notable invention for <hi rend="italic">burning the candle twice over</hi>. But I am all to<supplied>[o]</supplied> rapidly approaching the end of my paper; so must &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cease this funning</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

Know then (to give the Devil his due) (meaning by the Devil not you but myself) that I have really been a tolerably good child for some weeks back, My time (of which valuable commodity the people here have perhaps more at their own disposal than any other individuals on the habitable globe) has been spent more satisfactorily and profitably than usual.

You cannot figure what an inestimable benefit it is, in our situation nearly impracticable on this side: or what exhalations of gratitude rise from my Husbands soul towards the Minister of the Trone [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. I verily believe if he were in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, he would even go and hear him preach, to show his sense of the kindness.

<salute>My dear Jane</salute>
<p>I commissioned Alick to transmit my thanks to you in the handsomest
manner; but, &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">it may be strongly doubted</hi>,&#x2019;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Scotchman&#x2019;s phrase in an <hi rend="italic">Edgeworth Novel</hi>, in frequent, or over frequent, use by Brother John&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note in A.

So I now send them &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">under my own hand</hi>&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210102-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:301</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-02">2 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> with the same warmth <hi rend="italic">warmth</hi> [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in which they were at first conceived, and which is not likely to know any diminution so long as a morsel of <hi rend="italic">the dainty</hi> remains.</p>
<p>How are you <hi rend="italic">getting on?</hi> Bravely I hope, but the question would be better asked at your Husband than at you. There is never much to be feared for any one that is born with sense and truth in him, whatever else he may have or want. And so I always augur well of the judicious Crow<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Crow</hi> (a nickname of Jean the black-haired)&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note).</note> in whatsoever circumstances she may find herself. If the Devil should get into her by a time, he will find her good sense and truthfulness such bad neighbours, that he will be fain to decamp before he have done any serious mischief. It is indeed a trying change to have <hi rend="italic">two</hi> wills to consult instead of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> always sufficien<supplied>[t]</supplied>ly imperative. I know it by experience and can sympathise with you: but my experience also permits me to give you the encouraging assurance that the thing <supplied>[can]</supplied> be managed without bloodshed.</p>
<p>I have made up my mind, after four years of deliberation, to be at the expence [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of framing the Lord Advocate in <hi rend="italic">imitation</hi>&#x2014;rosewood.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Florence Letter of the <date when="1833-10-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> October</date> has been here above ten days: I was hindered from answering it till now by the current of several important processes, which I wished to see reach their issue first. We have been kept in a state of unusual bustle; and I shall have a whole bagful of news to tell you, if I can recollect them all. First and most memorable is our Sister Jane&#x2019;s marriage. The poor little Crow! She is wedded hard and fast, since yesterday gone a week; and lives in her own house in Lochmaben-gate,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Dumfries.</note> with James Aitken her Chosen. Our first intimation of it was some four weeks ago, just after the arrival of your Milan Letter; one night hard on twelve o&#x2019;clock, when all were asleep but Nancy and I, the sound of horse&#x2019;s hoofs was heard, which proved to be Alick&#x2019;s: in the course of talk, he told us that all was settled. About two weeks before that, Jean herself had sent me a Note, that <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> was extremely determined on marriage, whereby my presence down at Scotsbrig were highly desirable forthwith. I had fancied that a Letter to James, sent next week, had done the business; but now it stood out in clearer light, and one saw the roots of it extending farther, and the Scotsbrig Establishment doomed <pb id="pg-07-37" n="07-37"/>in a short time to dissolution.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had written &#x201C;a Note&#x201D; about <date when="1833-10-04">4 Oct.</date>, about her brother James (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331008-TC-JC-01">TC to JC, <date when="1833-10-08">8 Oct.</date></ref>); Alick&#x2019;s midnight visit was about <date when="1833-10-18">18 Oct.</date>; then Jean wrote [<date when="1833-10-22">22 Oct.</date>] to say that she was to be married on either <date when="1833-11-04">4 Nov.</date> or (as she was) on <date when="1833-11-11">11 Nov.</date>, inviting Thomas and Jane to the wedding: &#x201C;no strangers are expected; perhaps both of you would much rather avoid such a thing which is always a sort of hubble at best: if so of course we will not consider your not coming as any way unfriendly.&#x201D;</note> What could we do but accept the unalterable, with our best preparation; and rejoice heartily that it was no worse? Alick left us next forenoon; and we determined to be ready for attending the wedding.</p>
<p>Accordingly, on Saturday gone a week,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1833-11-09">9 Nov.</date> The wedding was on <date when="1833-11-11">Monday, 11 Nov.</date> The &#x201C;Middlebie Priest&#x201D; mentioned subsequently in this paragraph was Richard Nivison (<date when="1790-00-00">1790</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">1858</date>), minister of Middlebie since <date when="1820-00-00">1820</date>.</note> my Dame and I set off betimes; and after hard drawing on Harry&#x2019;s part, and hard driving on mine, reached Catlinns (with lamps burning) towards six o&#x2019;clock. Catlinns at this season is most bleak, most muddy; but Alick&#x2019;s welcome was of the warmest, and made amends for all: he drove us down next morning (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">between</hi> showers&#x201D;); all was well at Scotsbrig, and delighted to see us. Your Italian Prints all framed in flaring imitation-rosewood with gilding (by Aitken&#x2019;s help) hung round the room up stairs, and made a most dashing appearance. Preparation commenced next morning long before earliest dawn; all, including our Mother, seemed content; the poor little Bride herself had a suitable air, expressive of much, wherein a shade of resoluteness, almost of sternness was also traceable. At half past nine arrived the Middlebie Priest and his Wife (while I was only half-dressed); had to sit half an hour looking at the Pictures and the Book-case. Few minutes after ten came Alick <foreign><hi rend="italic">mit Weib und Kind</hi></foreign> [with wife and child], and more essential still, the Bridegroom with Jemmy (who had gone up on Saturday) for <supplied>[the]</supplied> man; and a Gigful of Griers and so forth for wedding-company. The ceremony was over in ten minutes more, and the whole party lashing away at Breakfast. Our Mother stood it all with the greatest composure; a few separate tears, while the Priest did his work, and no <hi rend="italic">word</hi> of complaint whatever. Indeed, I rather fancy she felt it at bottom to be a good arrangement; Jean, she had often said, was growing &#x201C;a bauld hizzy [a bold hussy],&#x201D; and, not submitting well to her discipline, gave her somewhat to suffer. By and by the Priest (shallowest of men) went his ways; Jemmy, as &#x201C;best man,&#x201D; strove lustily, by all means, liquors included, to keep his company in heart; at last, about one o&#x2019;clock, they set to a cold mutton-pie, of gigantic dimensions; which having reduced to pygmean, they all (I too now <pb id="pg-07-38" n="07-38"/>joining) drank the stirrup-cup,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A parting glass of liquor.</note> and dashed off along by the Cauldronedge, amid mud enough, yet with bright sunshine,&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">another</hi> stage forward, on their Life-journey! To me none of these Epochs are other than solemn even sad things; but the thoughts they cause are perhaps better suppressed than uttered. We saw poor Jeankin again, as we came homewards; and had tea with her and her Husband: she looked &#x201C;as well as could be expected&#x201D;; a wise, little resolute creature; who in no situation whatever were to be despaired of. We calculate that they may do moderately well: James Aitken (for whom she had finally <hi rend="italic">refused</hi> W. Brand<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably William Brand of Craighouse. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310911-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-11">11 Sept. 1831</date></ref>.</note>) is no bad fellow perhaps &#x201C;after all&#x201D;; certainly an ingenious, clever kind of fellow, with fair prospects, no bad habit, and perhaps <hi rend="italic">very</hi> great skill in his craft. I saw a copied <hi rend="italic">Ruysdael</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A picture by Salomon van Ruisdael or Ruysdael (<date when="1600-00-00">1600</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1670-00-00">70</date>), his son Jacob Salomonsz (<date when="1630-00-00">1630</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1681-00-00">81</date>), or his nephew Jacob Isaakszoon Ruisdael (<date when="1628-00-00">1628</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1682-00-00">82</date>), Dutch painters.</note> of his doing, which certainly amazed me. Let us all send them our good wishes, and hope, here as always, the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>. He is not worthy of Jean: but &#x201C;one must take the best she can get.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Of Brother James who set off again to Dumfries and only returned the night before our departure, I saw very little. It appears to be a fixed resolution with him to wed that Miss Calvert of his; nothing almost, since Werter&#x2019;s time,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> (Leipzig, <date when="1774-00-00">1774</date>).</note> has equalled the intensity of his devotion in that quarter. By Letter I had explained to him that he must needs wait till Whitsunday, till our Mother was provided for; and then we should all wish him good speed. This I reckon to be at present his outlook. Our Mother keeps the best heart; neither fears the future, nor needlessly mourns over the past. From all we could learn in talking with her, the arrangement that would suit her best were a house of her own, and a field or two, in the close neighbourhood of Mary. Mary&#x2019;s Jemmy had actually offered for a farm, where our Mother thought she could have managed well enough: but that, we have since learned, is a lost chance, the farm being let otherwise. There are still plenty of Farms (tho&#x2019; with more than plenty of competitors); Austin too has left himself disengaged after Martinmas<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1833-11-11">11 Nov.</date></note> to seek for one. Various other schemes for our Mother offer themselves. We expect her here in two or three weeks; and shall then consult farther of it. She seems to be in the same sort of health as you left her in, far better she says than you found her in: she had been &#x201C;twenty <foreign><hi rend="italic">rake</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-07-39" n="07-39"/>[trips]&#x201D; at the Post-office asking for that Letter you half-promised her: however, I brought some comfort; namely, your Florence News just arrived, in my pocket. She sends you always her blessing from the heart: I think you should write to her specially; she were poor indeed when she grudged the postage of one from you. She is insatiable on that head.</p>
<p>I will now record for you a little <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> section of Universal History; the scene still Annandale. The tuesday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] after the wedding, I sat correcting the second Fraction of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsd</hi>k for Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine: but towards night Alick, according to appointment, arrived with his &#x201C;little black mare,&#x201D; to drive me &#x201C;somewhither&#x201D; next day. We, after some consultation, made it Annan; and saw ourselves there about one o&#x2019;clock. A damp, still afternoon, quite Novembrish and pensivemaking. The look of those old familiar houses, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">jow</hi></foreign> [sound] of that old bell, went far into my heart: a straggling funeral proceed<supplied>[ed]</supplied> up the street; Senhouse Nelson (now Reform-bill Provost), with Banker Scott in such priggish clothes as he wears, and two others of the like, stood on Benson&#x2019;s<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Senhouse Nelson was of High St., Annan; James Scott, Agent, Commercial Bank of Scotland; and James Benson, Queensberry Arms Hotel, High St.</note> porch-stairs gazing into Inanity: Annan still stood there; and I&#x2014;here. Ben<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nelson.</note> was from home; his little son gone to London; the maid thought, into some Hospital, some Navy appointment, into she knew not what. Finally we determined on seeking out Waugh. Old Marion, as clean and dure as ever, hobblingly admitted us: there sat the Doctor, grizzle-locked (since I saw him), yellow-wrinkled, forlorn and out-cast-looking, with bees&#x2019; wax and other tailor or botcher apparatus on a little table, the <hi rend="italic">shell</hi> of an old Coat lying dismembered on the floor; another, not yet so condemnable, which with his own hand he was struggling to rehabilitate! A new cuff I saw (after he had huddled the old vestment on) evidently of his own making, the front buttonholes had all exploded, a huge rent lay under one armpit, extending over the back; the Coat <hi rend="italic">demanded</hi> mending,&#x2014;since burning was not to be thought of. <hi rend="italic">There</hi> sat he; into such last corner (with the pale winter sun looking thro&#x2019; on him) had <foreign><hi rend="italic">Schicksal und eigne Schuld</hi></foreign> [fate and one&#x2019;s own guilt] hunted the ill-starred Waugh. For the first time, I was truly <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> for him. He talked too with such meekness; yet is still mad; talking of &#xa3;1200 to be made by a good comedy, and such like. When we came out (since the state of his Coat would not allow Waugh to come with us to the <hi rend="italic">Buck</hi> [cart]), Alick and I settled that at least we would assure ourselves of his having <hi rend="italic">food:</hi> Alick therefore <pb id="pg-07-40" n="07-40"/>got twenty-shillings to take him 4 cwt. of potatoes and 8 stone of meal;&#x2014;three-fourths of which have been already handed in (without explanation), the rest will follow at Candlemas. So goes it in native Annandale. A hundred times since has that picture of Waugh botching his old coat, at that cottage-window, stranded and cast out from the whole occupied Earth, risen in my head, with manifold meaning. His <hi rend="italic">Prophecy-Book</hi> has not covered expenses; his <hi rend="italic">Pathology</hi> the Longmans, very naturally, would not have.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John S. Waugh&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Dissertations on the Prophecies of Sacred Scripture which Relate to the AntiChristian Powers</hi> (Annan, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>). His rejected <hi rend="italic">Pathology</hi> may be the same as <hi rend="italic">The Science of the Cerebro-Spinal Phenomena Attempted</hi> (London, <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>).</note> I endeavoured to convince him that Literature was hopeless, doubly and trebly hopeless for him; farther advice I did not like to urge. My sole consolation is to know that for the present he has plenty of meal and potatoes; and salt cheap. Perhaps it is likely he will fall into his Mother&#x2019;s state; let an indolent <hi rend="italic">insanity</hi> get the mastery over him; and spend his time mostly in bed. I rather traced some symptoms<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle first wrote <hi rend="italic">likeness</hi>, then crossed it out and wrote <hi rend="italic">symptoms</hi>.</note> of that. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gott beh&#xfc;te</hi></foreign> [God forbid]!<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For further details concerning Waugh, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18140618-TC-TM-01"><sic>1:14</sic><corr>TC to TM, <date when="1814-06-18">18 June 1814</date></corr></ref>, and Froude, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 378 n.</note></p>
<p>It is now time you had a paragraph about Craigenputtoch. Everything is in the stillest condition here. I have read many books; &#x201C;put thro&#x201D;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The phrase is probably an echo of a comment which John had made on Coleridge in his letter to TC of <date when="1830-05-17">17 May 1830</date>: see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300518-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-05-18">18 May 1830</date></ref>.</note> me a vast multitude of thoughts unutterable and utterable. In health we seem to improve, especially Janekin: we have realised a Shower-bath at Dumfries, and erected it in the room over this (Library); the little Dame fearlessly plunges it over her in coldest mornings: I have had it only twice. Farther, of external things, know that (by science) I extracted the dining-room <hi rend="italic">lock</hi>; had it repaired; and now it shuts like a Christian lock! This is small news, yet great. In my little Library are two bell-ropes (brass-wire and curtain-ring) the daintiest you ever saw; finally the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Segretario Ambulante</hi></foreign> [itinerant secretary],<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to a picture given to him by John of an itinerant beggar with a pen who gained a livelihood by writing letters for a small fee. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June 1834</date></ref>.</note> in fittest framing, hangs right behind my back (midway between the door and the fire), and looks <hi rend="italic">beautiful</hi>, really the piece of Art I take most pleasure in of all my <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kunstvorrath</hi></foreign> [art supply]. He is a delightful fellow; shows you Literature in its simplest quite steadfast condition, below which it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> sink. My own Portrait was to <pb id="pg-07-41" n="07-41"/>have been framed similarly, and hung by him as counterpart; but Jane has put it in rosewood and gilding, much to my dislike, and it hangs now on the other side of the wall (in the Drawing-room), and keeps mostly out of my sight. If you think that our Piano will still act, that one <hi rend="italic">reach</hi> [load] of the Peatstack is carried in, and all else in its old state, you may fancy us all tight and right so far as the <hi rend="italic">case</hi> of Life goes. As to the kernel, or spiritual part there can hardly <hi rend="italic">any</hi> description be given; so much of it has not yet translated itself into words&#x2014;I am quiet; not idle, not unhappy; by God&#x2019;s blessing, <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> yet see how I am to turn myself. Cochrane refuses both my projected Articles: I have nevertheless written the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>; at least it lies rough-hewn in the drawer here, only these marriages have kept me from finishing it. The other Article I could not <hi rend="italic">now</hi> have undertaken to write; the Saint-Simon<hi rend="italic">s</hi> as you may perhaps know, having very unexpectedly come to light again, and set to giving missionary lectures of a most questionable sort in London.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The missionary work of the Saint-Simonians in England had been taken over by a Signor Fontana and Dr. Prati, and Carlyle would have read reports of their first meetings in London in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-11-03">3</date> and <date when="1833-11-10">10 Nov.</date>, pp. 697 and 713. They were attempting to give the movement a more popular character at the same time as explaining its view on property and the emancipation of women. The latter aroused more interest, most of it ribald and hostile. They published their views in <hi rend="italic">St. Simonism in London. Community of Goods, or the Organisation of Industry. Community of Women, or Matrimony and Divorce</hi> (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>), published by Effingham Wilson.</note> Mill is not there to tell me about them, but in Paris; so I can understand nothing of it; except that that [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be written of, being once more in the fermenting state. Cochrane and I have, probably enough, done: but as Wull Brown says, &#x201C;it is perhaps <hi rend="italic">just as well</hi>; for I firmly intended&#x201D; &#x26;c. I believe I must go back ere long, and look at London again. In the meanwhile, learn, study, read; consider thy ways and be wise!<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise&#x201D; (Prov. 6:6).</note> <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>, as was hinted, is coming out, in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>; going &#x201C;to pot&#x201D; probably, yet not without leaving me some money, not without making me quit of him. To it again! Try it once more!&#x2014; Alick was here since Saturday; came up with two Sacks of old oats for Harry; went away this very morning (Tuesday) with a load of wood. He is to be back again some time in winter; he has purchased from Jamie the pony you rode on, and will travel on it,&#x2014;when the pastern-joint is mended, which has been wrong for some time. Poor old Macadam was shot (did I not tell you?) the day after you went away.&#x2014; We have engaged Peter Austin&#x2019;s Boy to ride down weekly till Whitsunday, and seek our <pb id="pg-07-42" n="07-42"/>Letters &#x26;c; also a stall of a stable for him at Dumfries, under James Aitken&#x2019;s eye; so we have now settled that foolish matter of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Kerrag,&#x201D;</hi><note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The context, about the collection of letters from Dumfries, makes it clear that <hi rend="italic">Kerrag</hi> was someone&#x2019;s idiosyncratic pronunciation or spelling of &#x201C;kerridge&#x201D; or &#x201C;carriage.&#x201D; Used in a different sense later: see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340225-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-02-25">25 Feb. 1834</date></ref>.</note> and hope it will do.&#x2014; Not till Saturday last, when Alick came, did we hear a word from the Advocate. He now writes to Jane in the frostiest, most frightened manner; makes honourable mention of you; to me hardly alludes except from a far distance. Jane will have it that he took many things to himself in the Article <hi rend="italic">Diderot</hi>; a possible thing, which corresponds too with the cessation of his Letters. I love the Advocate, and partially pity him, and will write to him in such &#x201C;choicest mood&#x201D;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281200-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:424</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-12-01">1 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> as I can command at present. He has got the Burgh Reform Bill<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A Burgh Reform Bill for Scotland, guided by Jeffrey, had been passed <date when="1833-07-08">8 July 1833</date>, when Jeffrey wrote to his friend Cockburn (<date when="1833-08-20">20 Aug.</date>): &#x201C;I shall never have any task of equal importance to perform, and should be well enough pleased if this should be the last that is required of me.&#x201D; Cockburn, <hi rend="italic">Life of Jeffrey</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), I, 351.

<p>And now, dear Brother, what of Italy and Rome? Are you once again settled in that wondrous City; and getting on tolerably there? We cannot but regret the changes you hint at in your domestic element; yet without fear that you will not master these too.

A nobler arena to work in yet lies in store for you: for it prepare yourself. And now is the Time for your Tolerance; practice well what you can so earnestly preach. On the whole too is it impossible to extract any good, any amusement even from Miss Elliot, and that wild Irish Girl?<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Miss Elliot was apparently the travelling companion of Lady Clare, who was Irish.

The Church <pb id="pg-07-43" n="07-43"/>also is an interesting thing; tho&#x2019; now I think nearly an extinct one.

What would please me best of all would be to hear that you had got <hi rend="italic">patients</hi>, and were pushing on your own noble science a little. The estimate I have formed of your power to excel therein is the highest in my whole sphere of observation; I rejoice also to see that you yourself love Medical Art, and honour it. Of professions it is the only one extant in this world which an honest man in these days can with the smallest assurance prosecute. Forward then! Forward with God&#x2019;s blessing!

<ps><p>Jane offered to write this whole Letter, if I would give her time&#x2014;till another week. I could not; but fancied she might fill up the margins at least; but it now turns out to be impossible: the Macadams are going off <hi rend="italic">instantaneously</hi> (we are to take <hi rend="italic">them</hi> this week), and there is not a moment of time.

<salute>My dear Sir</salute>
<p>I beseech you, do not estimate my gratitude for your letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> by the alacrity I have displayed in answering it. It was delightful to laugh with you again at anything, even a fellow creature&#x2019;s indigestions; and still more delightful to find I was remembered by you, while modestly supposing myself forgotten of the whole earth: I thanked you, then, from the very bottom of my heart; and would have told you so on the instant but for an inveterate habit of procrastination I have somehow acquired. Whatever is to be done, tho&#x2019; it were but to sti<supplied>[t]</supplied>ch a button on my Husband&#x2019;s shirt; I must put off till &#x201C;a more convenient season&#x201D;: and it is inconceivable what woes are thus originated,&#x2014;just in that single matter of shirt-buttons, to go no further. &#x201C;Females&#x201D; that are fulfilling <pb id="pg-07-44" n="07-44"/>the end of their being, <foreign>videlicet</foreign>, &#x201C;bringing up children,&#x201D; should be attentive to whip at the very first symptom of this tendency.</p>
<p>Why did you not come in Autumn, and make amends to us for the loss of Hunt? &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Craigen-poo-toch</hi>&#x201D; looked so well this year, and I felt so well, and could have enjoyed your company after a quite other fashion than thro&#x2019; the last winter; <hi rend="italic">when &#x2018;my memory was a long train of indigestions,&#x2014;my prospects more of the same</hi>.&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane may be satirically quoting Carlyle himself.</note> John Mill had to go to France; so we were disappointed of him also: and were thankful to Providence for the windfall of a stray American,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson.</note> &#x2018;come out for to see whatsoever things were wise and of good report,<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Phil. 4:8.</note>&#x2014;from one end of Europe to the other. With such accuracy of investigation did he prosecute this object, that he arrived, by paths unknown, at the door of Craigenpootoch, which was, of course, opened to him with all the pleasure in life. To find the Christian charities inside, and even the Graces seemed to occasion him the most agreeable surprise. Carlyle had been represented to his transatlantic imagination, quite <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdreckish</hi>,&#x2014;a man severe&#x2014;living in complete isolation, and partial barbarism: the Individual before his bodily eyes was shaven and shorn, overflowing with the milk of human kindness,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, I, v.</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">und mit Weib im Hause</hi></foreign> [and with a wife in the home]; a blessing which the amiable American estimated highly&#x2014;himself having <hi rend="italic">lost it</hi> after an <hi rend="italic">exceedingly brief</hi> trial.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His wife, <foreign>n&#xE9;e</foreign> Ellen Louisa Tucker, had died of tuberculosis in <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>.</note> He went &#x2018;on-on&#x2019;&#x2014;and we saw him no more.

But they also passed on, and again all was silent and continues silent to this hour. Yet here in the midst of this almost fearful silence we are fixed for the winter&#x2014;resolute to assert the superiority of mind over matter, by neither going out of our wits nor attempting our lives thro&#x2019; the dismalities of the ensuing season.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here is your <hi rend="italic">Picture of Paris</hi>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Lillie Craik (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">1866</date>), <hi rend="italic">Paris and Its Historical Scenes</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), in the <hi rend="italic">Library of Entertaining Knowledge</hi>.</note> which has lain many weeks ready for returning. Unfortunately, as it came up hither from Scotsbrig, its neighbourhood had not been of the best; some edible, adipose material; bacon-ham, or such like;&#x2014;whereby, tho&#x2019; wellwrapped, it had got an ugly stain, on one of the Volumes; as you will still see, and <hi rend="italic">rue</hi>. No art of ours here would bring out that foul spot; so what can I do but leave it standing, a monument of my ill-fortune, and of your forgivenness<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>The Book did me some good, and no evil. It is of the <hi rend="italic">Useful-Knowledge</hi> kind; such as that Society usually gets together,&#x2014;one might almost fancy, by a sort of steam machinery. I believe in fact the main writer of them is a poor hungry Scotchman from St Andrews; set there to write (at the rate of &#xa3;50 a-volume) &#x201C;in spite of nature and his stars.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200318-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:231</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1820-03-18">18 March 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> Which amounts to much the same thing.</p>
<p>On Wednesday gone a week I called for you; having run down half-truanting to Annan. Mary could only tell me you were at Dumfries; and Mr Edward<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Nelson&#x2019;s son.</note> gone to London, &#x201C;to some situation,&#x201D; I strove <pb id="pg-07-47" n="07-47"/>vainly to learn what. Will you be kind enough to let me, as a party interested, know? Write me a long Letter: you have a Parcel to send at any rate.</p>
<p>That Volume of Goethe is what I mean. It is not mine but my Dame&#x2019;s; and she has set her heart on having it and the other three bound.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The volumes to be bound for Jane may well have been Goethe, <hi rend="italic">Gedichte</hi>, 2 vols. (Stuttgart and T&#xfc;bingen, <date when="1829-00-00">1829</date>) which had an autograph presentation inscription from Goethe to &#x201C;<foreign>Der entfernten theuren Freundin Jane W.

Perhaps indeed some of my Brothers have already called for it; in which case there is nothing for you to do&#x2014;but write me a Letter by Post.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to speak of your coming in person now, tho&#x2019; perhaps at this dead se<supplied>[as]</supplied>on it were as practicable as ever. No Figure could darken our door who were welcomer. Sitting in these long nights, over piled logs and pit-coal, in the middle of the frozen wilderness, what conferences we could have! It is really a pity you will not come. Nay why should you not get into the <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of coming?</p>
<p>Your Townsmen, I see with real satisfaction, have done themselves the honour to elect you <hi rend="italic">first Councillor:</hi> I hear too that you had to decline the Provostship. That is right; both things are as they should be.</p>
<p>If the Government would next march out the whole rural Quorum, Commissioners, Trustees, <foreign>Custodes Rotulorum</foreign>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200607-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:261</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-06-07">7 June 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> bag and baggage, and bid them never while Time ran, return, it were another great benefit.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>The Note<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> here inclosed is for Alick, and I see no safer mode of conveying it than by Scotsbrig, tho&#x2019; it must loiter a little by the way: there is nothing very pressing <supplied>[in]</supplied> it. A few lines to yourself must reconcile you to being made a <hi rend="italic">Carrier</hi> of.</p> 
<p>I hope Notman delivered you the Pills, so stupidly forgotten. The hasty scrawl that went with them would signify that we were here, and little more; I was hardly this twelvemonth in such a hurry. Since then, all goes on as it was doing; in spite of this most disastrous weather, the worst we have had for long. We, indeed, sit snug; and defy the tempest: but Macadam&#x2019;s stable-slates jingling off from time to time suggest to us what many are suffering; some, doubtless, far out in the &#x201C;wide and wasteful main&#x201D;!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> Both Jane and I go walking, by <hi rend="italic">night</hi>, if not by day, when there is a gleam of clearness; I take now and then a kind of <hi rend="italic">deck</hi>-walk, to and fro, at the foot of the avenue, in a spot where, you know, the wood shelters one from all winds that can blow. Last night (about dusk rather) coming along Blackmark Road right in the teeth of wind and rain, I&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">frayed the skin of my heel</hi> (with the wet clog-leather); and so, <hi rend="italic">shall ride</hi> for the next day or two: this, I think, is all the misery that has befallen since you saw us!</p>
<p>Grace came home at her appointed time, and Nancy had not gone away; having no service to go to. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> went at last, with a blessing; seemingly in a very strange humour: Jane surmises there may be a &#x201C;misfortune&#x201D; in the wind! Poor Grace does her very best; and tho&#x2019; slow, yet being regular as clock-work, makes wonderful way. It is augured that she may cut a quite reasonable figure; and from her, as one of the faithfullest characters living, we ought to put up with much. Harry (whom she saddles) and she have got into the most intimate terms; and converse a good deal; he by nickering and whinnying; she in the human Scotch dialect.</p>
<p>We saw Jean and her man and household as we passed thro&#x2019; Dumfries: it was all looking right enough; one could hope that they might do very well there. Aitken, I find by a Picture<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-11-18">18 Nov.</date></ref></note> over his mantel-piece, has quite another talent for <hi rend="italic">painting</hi> than I gave him the smallest <pb id="pg-07-49" n="07-49"/>credit for: it is really a <hi rend="italic">surprising</hi> piece to have been executed there. As to Jean we have always known her as a most reasonable, clear and resolute little creature: of her in all scenes and situations good is to be anticipated. So we will wish them heartily a Blessing; with hope.</p>
<p>Ever since Alick left us, I have been <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> with all my old vehemence: this day too I insisted on doing my <hi rend="italic">task</hi>. It is about the <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Diamond Necklace&#x201D;</hi>; that story you heard some hint of in <hi rend="italic">Cagliostro</hi>. We shall see what it turns to.&#x2014; I am in the Drawing-room tonight with my big table (and side <hi rend="italic">half</hi> to the fire, which is hot enough): Jane at my back, also writing; <hi rend="italic">what</hi> she will not tell me. We have been here together, these three days; the rain had run down the vents actually in large streams, and damped everything. This is what I call descriptive minuteness.&#x2014; Let me also say, I have been reading in poor Waugh&#x2019;s Book,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-11-18">18 Nov.</date></ref></note> and found your opinion of it verified: it is actually &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">far</hi> better than one could have expected,&#x201D; and contains some interesting things, things at least which give rise to thoughts that interest. Poor Waugh! &#x201C;Poor fellow, after all!&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18191215-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:211</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-12-15">15 Dec. 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s little Letter (one of the smallest I ever read, but not the <hi rend="italic">emptiest</hi>) informed us of what had been passing at Catlinns, and that you were there; he said, <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. Have you returned from the expedition still <hi rend="italic">well?</hi> I cannot too often impress on you the dangers of winter weather: you have a tendency to apprehension for every one but for yourself. Catlinns is not a good place in winter; and were Jenny not the healthiest of women must have been very trying for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.</p>
<p>But there is another expedition, My dear Mother, which you are bound, which I hope you are getting ready for. Come up with Austin and Mary to Jean; stay with her till you <hi rend="italic">rest</hi>; sending me up word <hi rend="italic">when:</hi> on Wednesday, or any other day, I will come driving down, and fetch you. In about <hi rend="italic">a week</hi> hence, as I calculate, I shall be done with <hi rend="italic">this</hi> scribblement; and then we can read together and talk together and walk together!&#x2014; Besides this in the horrid winter weather is a better Lodging for you than any other, and we will take better care of you&#x2014;we promise. The blue room shall be dry as fire can make it: no <hi rend="italic">such</hi> drying except those you make at Scotsbrig where on one occasion, as I remember, you spent the whole time of my visit in drying my clothes. Lastly that when &#x201C;you come you may <hi rend="italic">come</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. &#x201C;&#x2018;When I come, I come,&#x2019; [said a country woman,] laying down her gift of four eggs&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note to <ref target="volume-08/lt-18351223-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, <date when="1835-12-23">23 Dec. 1835</date></ref>, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 49).</note> Jane <pb id="pg-07-50" n="07-50"/>bids me communicate to Jamie that she wants three stones of meal; but will not take it, unless he take pay for it.</p>
<p>And so, Dear Mother, this scribble must end&#x2014;as others have done. Tomorrow I believe is my eight-and-thirtieth birthday! You were then young in life; I had not yet entered it. Since then&#x2014;how much! how much! They are in the Land of Silence (but while we live, not of Forgetfulness), whom we once knew, and (often with thoughts too deep for words) wistfully ask of their and our Father Above that we may again know.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> of Wednesday gone a week did arrive in due season; and, I need not say, was read with much interest. It might have struck me that some direct affirmative answer to such a Letter would be agreeable and reassuring to you: but I too hastily judged that it was only <hi rend="italic">in case</hi> of &#x201C;inconvenience&#x201D; you would expect one; the rather as you spoke of writing again, should anything postpone your journey;&#x2014;the rather too, I may add, as we have no <hi rend="italic">completely</hi> regular post-day (for writing) except the Tuesday, which would have been too late for you. Fancying accordingly that Silence was an affirmative Answer (if you also kept Silence), I had Rob Austin, our faithful Errand-boy <pb id="pg-07-51" n="07-51"/>and riding Factotum, appointed hither this morning, to go down with the Gig to Dunscore, and wait for you there. But your Second Letter has now come; so Rob, instead, will ride to Moniaive or Allanton with this, which I hope will make all clear.</p>
<p>Come to us, then, with perfect freedom; either on Saturday or Tuesday, or whenever it best suits you. Consider that if we could be so happy as contribute in any measure to poor William&#x2019;s recovery, it were in the strictest sense a pleasure and a duty for us. Feel that it is to Friends you are coming; to such a <hi rend="italic">home</hi> as Friends find open for them. Mr Lamond<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Robert Allan Lamond (<date when="1805-00-00">1805</date>&#x2013;<date when="1859-00-00">59</date>), at Glasgow University at the same time as William Glen, member of the faculty of procurators, <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, of the firm of Lamond and Monteith, writers, 60 Ingram St., secretary to the Royal Infirmary for about 20 years.</note> also shall be most welcome to us: he may be very useful in such an expedition.</p>
<p>In coming from Moniaive, I thank you should advise your <hi rend="italic">Car</hi>man, who probably is not well acquainted with the road hither, to drive by <hi rend="italic">Drumwhirn</hi>, rather than by <hi rend="italic">Loch Orr</hi> Farm and <hi rend="italic">Shillingland:</hi> both roads are miserably circuitous; but the former scarcely more than the latter, and it has the advantage of being tolerably smooth and altogether safe, which in night-time the other hardly is. Or if your man know nothing about <hi rend="italic">Drumwhirns</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Shillinglands</hi>, direct him thus: to drive along as if for Castle Douglas, till you reach (a little past that same Drumwhirn) <hi rend="italic">the cross-road</hi> with its Bridge of Orr,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Drumwhirn Bridge, built over the River Orr in <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, was the subject of a poem written by Carlyle the same year, printed in <hi rend="italic">Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s London Journal</hi>, <date when="1834-10-22">22 Oct. 1834</date>, and reprinted in Wylie, pp. 230&#x2013;31, and elsewhere. See Dyer, pp. 72&#x2013;73. The River Orr or Urr provides one of the boundaries on the west side of Craigenputtoch, and Craigenputtoch Burn runs into it.</note> <hi rend="italic">which you and I drove; along the Glaister Hillside</hi>, that morning; the rest of the details you yourself will know. Drumwhirn is a white farm-house, on your right hand, alone among the Moors, some 7 miles from Moniaive: the Crossroad is perhaps a furlong farther, and leads of course to the left: when you come to what you think <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, drive on some thirty yards farther, and you will find the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">it</hi>: the first was a failure and mistake of the roadmen, and will not lead you upon the Bridge,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; indeed the turning back is no great matter.</p>
<p>We shall not know whether to reckon upon Saturday night or Tuesday. However, from the chances of delay, and the short time now to work on, I think Tuesday the more probable. And so Good Speed, and Luck by the Way! Mrs Carlyle joins me in all kind wishes.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>On Wednesday gone a fortnight I said to myself, &#x201C;there will be a Letter from Mill tonight&#x201D;; neither was I disappointed. Wednesday Evening brought Tea, and our draggled Postboy from Dumfries, with a whole bag of Letters, and the best of the whole from the Correspondent in question.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1833-11-25">25 Nov.</date>; see Mineka, XII, 190&#x2013;97.</note> Many thanks for your long close-written close-meditated Answer to all my queries! It is the best account of Paris I ever saw in equal bulk; contains as much as some Colburns&#x2019;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As full as one of the three-volume travel books published by Henry Colburn.</note> would have been glad of, to beat out into three volumes.</p>
<p>My wish decidedly were to go and see Paris with my own eyes; my purpose also, in all but one too probable contingency: The want of Money not needed for other more pressing objects. We shall see how matters turn. Alas, unless one go soon, the actors and spectators in those Tragedies will all have withdrawn, and one great interest of such a visit be past forever. That Necklace Baron,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had sent Carlyle a paper by a Baron Antoine Darnay (died <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), who was able to write from contemporary experience. See Mineka, XII, 191. He was author of <hi rend="italic">Notices Historiques sur son altesse royale le prince Eug&#xE8;ne &#x2026;</hi> (Paris, <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>).</note> for example, what would I not give to have the questioning of him for one solar day! The &#x201C;dignity of History&#x201D; has buckramed up poor History into a dead mummy. There are a thousand purposes which History should serve beyond &#x201C;teaching by Experience&#x201D;: it is an Address (literally out of Heaven, for did not God order it all?) to our <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> inner man; to every faculty of Head and Heart from the deepest to the slightest: there is no end to its purposes; none to one&#x2019;s amazement, contemplation, over it. Now for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> such purposes, high, low, ephemeral, eternal, the first indispensable condition of conditions, is that we <hi rend="italic">see</hi> the things transacted, and picture them out wholly as if they stood before our eyes;&#x2014;and this, alas, of all considerations, is the one that &#x201C;dignity of History&#x201D; least thinks of. You must manage this by many indirect methods for yourself in your own person.</p>
<p>The actual Paris, from your account of it which confirms all that I gather elsewhere, seems (if we except its <hi rend="italic">restlessness</hi>, which is no <pb id="pg-07-53" n="07-53"/>sublimity of the highest kind) to wear but a trivial aspect: a singular deficiency of great thoughts, great actions, great men. The merit of it, beyond England, appears to be mainly its <hi rend="italic">abandon:</hi> it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a real existence of man, not hampered, dislocated, falsified at every step by side-feelings of responsibilities and respectabilities: this however is an immense merit,&#x2014;for the spectator at any rate. But, on the whole, the French character puzzles me more and more. There never seems to have been in it generally any <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> basis, in our sense of the word (which I take to be a <hi rend="italic">Puritanical</hi>, to be therefore an Old-Hebrew one, and of the greatest worth and depth), but rather a quick graceful Sensuousness (<foreign><hi rend="italic">Sinnlichkeit</hi></foreign>), whereupon naturally enough Honour, Gallantry, a light joyous way of life originated; and in later times also, September-work and enough else. In reading many French books, and even books of genius, I find this a necessary key to much. The authors seem to get along, in the strangest manner, quite comfortably without any <hi rend="italic">Conscience</hi> at all, or ever feeling the want of one; taking the Given World as it is given; and getting many a sapid little mess of victual from it, come whence it may. At bottom, a <hi rend="italic">Pagan</hi> kind of being, yet not without its significance.&#x2014; And now as to this <foreign><hi rend="italic">Litteratur der Verzweiflung</hi></foreign> [Literature of Despair],<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330910-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-09-10">10 Sept.</date></ref></note> is it not really a Desperate Literature, yet with a Desperation of the flimsiest sort? Nothing struck me more in the <hi rend="italic">Livre des Cent-et-Un:</hi> a small-beer run sour! Everybody in the most indignant Opposition&#x2014;to Providence; and not so much as a good Faust&#x2019;s Curse comes of it. They eat their victuals there, with a <foreign><hi rend="italic">sacre</hi></foreign>-ing [damn-ing] between the teeth (at the bad Cookery), and live uselessly, and die as the fool dieth.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >2 Sam. 3:33; cf. Eccles. 2:16.</note></p>
<p>Your Pictures of Carrel and Cavaignac<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean Baptiste Nicolas Armand Carrel (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">36</date>), political journalist; El&#xE9;onore Louis Godefroy Cavaignac (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>), revolutionary republican, who took part in the Parisian risings of <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>, and <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>. Cavaignac escaped to England in <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date>, when he became acquainted with the Carlyles, and returned to France in <date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>. He was one of the founders of the Society of the Rights of Man, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>. Mill had spoken of Carrel as &#x201C;the most powerful journalist in France &#x2026; combining perfect self-reliance with the most unaffected modesty &#x2026; the Fonblanque of France.&#x201D; Cavaignac he described as &#x201C;a man whose name is energy &#x2026; who impresses you with a sense of irresistible power &#x26; indomitable will &#x2026; full of sweetness and amiableness &#x26; gentleness he is: intense in everything &#x2026; the intensest of atheists&#x201D;; a believer in perfectibility and progress who enjoyed battling against the principle of evil, &#x201C;son of a Conventionalist and regicide,&#x201D; who could discourse on a wide range of subjects including Art, &#x201C;always throwing all he has to say into a few brief energetic sentences.&#x201D; See Frederick W. Hilles, &#x201C;The Hero as Revolutionary: Godefroy Cavaignac,&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Carlyle and His Contemporaries</hi>, ed. John Clubbe (Durham, N.C., <date when="1976-00-00">1976</date>).</note> indicate at least a more <pb id="pg-07-54" n="07-54"/>emphatic species of man. I had seen Cavaignac&#x2019;s Pleading (in the French <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>); but nothing that led me to prophecy a character such as his present one. There is much in it you must respect: his very Atheism is a better Theism than that of Shovel-hat-dom;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The general run of the clergy.</note> the wretchedest <hi rend="italic">dishwashings</hi> (literally, if you will think of it; from Christian and Pagan <hi rend="italic">dishes</hi>, that had once food in them) anywhere to be met with, at present, perhaps in the whole world. For the rest, I cannot without a very deep kind of commiseration, behold an earnest truth-loving man driven by perversities environing him, into this saddest of counter-perversities: the denial that Man or the World has any Father but Death. Sad enough, to &#x201C;look upwards for the divine <hi rend="italic">Eye</hi>, and see nothing but the empty black glaring bottomless Death&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Eye-socket!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Richter&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Blumenst&#xfc;ck</hi> (&#x201C;Flower-Piece&#x201D;) in Carlyle&#x2019;s translation, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVII, 157.</note> However it is his business not ours. Whoever recognises the infinite nature of Duty believes in a God, against his own Consciousness: <hi rend="italic">our</hi> feeling towards his Atheism is dissent and sympathy, nothing more. In almost all the rest that Cavaignac teaches I go, a greater or a shorter way, heartily along with him. Carrel and his well-whiskered Coadjutors<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written that when he had gone to the office of <hi rend="italic">Le National</hi>, of which Carrel was editor, to meet him, he had found &#x201C;six or seven of the innumerable <foreign><hi rend="italic">r&#xE9;dacteurs</hi></foreign> who belong to a French paper, all dark-haired men with formidable <hi rend="italic">moustaches</hi> (which many of the republicans have taken to wear) &#x26; looking fiercely republican&#x201D; but that Carrel had no moustache.</note> stand out in lively relief before me: one almost regrets to see such a man a Journalist merely: his voice might reach farther than the day; yet perhaps the day has need of him, and all voices (the most prophetic ever heard) reach only to <hi rend="italic">some</hi> day. True also that recognised or not, <hi rend="small-caps">no</hi> thing a man ever did can be annihilated; it lives onwards, into Eternity, and even (as our Fathers well knew) thro&#x2019; Eternity.</p>
<p>One other characteristic that strikes me much in your Description, and much in many other quarters is this strange universal hubbub the French are all making (and most of us make) about the &#x201C;good of the species,&#x201D; and such like. How each man seems to mind all men&#x2019;s business,&#x2014;and leave his own to mind itself! <hi rend="italic">Something</hi> is to be done; but not for Me or for Thee; no, for Mankind,&#x2014;when I and Thou are quite past helping. What would all manner of Socinian Preachers think of me, if I confessed, as I do now to you with little misgiving (or at worst appealing to your future Self) that this manner of existence is to me almost as good as altogether foreign! Nay, I cannot find that <pb id="pg-07-55" n="07-55"/>it ever entered for much into the heart of any <hi rend="italic">real benefactor</hi> of Mankind (as he proved to be): his guidance and purpose lay much nearer home; the working out of what was best and purest <hi rend="italic">in himself:</hi> in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> lay for him all the Law and the Prophets. The Good of the Species (a thing infinitely too deep for my comprehending) I leave, with the most perfect trust, to God Almighty the All-governing who does comprehend it; believing withal (when I do consider Causes and Effects&#x2014;which is as rarely as possible) that no good thing I can perform, or make myself capable of performing, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be lost to my Brothers, but will prove in reality all and the utmost that I was capable of doing for them.&#x2014; Now what think you of this Creed, my dear Friend?<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle is disagreeing with some of the ideas of the St. Simonians, discussed in Mill&#x2019;s letter, as well as some of those of Carrel and Cavaignac. Mill replied on <date when="1834-01-12">12 Jan.</date>: &#x201C;I have never, at least since I had any convictions of my own, belonged to the benevolentiary, soup-kitchen school. Though I hold the good of the species (or rather of its several units) to be the <hi rend="italic">ultimate</hi> end, (which is the alpha &#x26; omega of my utilitarianism) I believe with the fullest Belief that this end can in no other way be forwarded but by the means you speak of, namely by each taking for his exclusive aim the development of what is best in <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>. I qualify or explain this doctrine no otherwise than as you yourself do, since you hold that every human creature has an appointed task to perform which task he is to know &#x26; find out for himself; this can only be by discovering in what manner such faculties as he possesses or can acquire may produce most good in the world.&#x201D;</note> It is a point which I have long seen we differed in; but seen also, and with great pleasure, that we were approximating in. If you still differ from me, even with vehemence, I will not take it ill: in the calmest manner, as above said, I will appeal to the future John Mill, and he shall decide between us. The present John is no common Radical, but a most uncommon one, and daily growing more uncommon&#x2014;onwards as I fancy to &#x201C;speculative radicalism of the darkest tinge,&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh in <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> is more than once described as a &#x201C;speculative radical.&#x201D;</note> and also of some other.&#x2014; In sober truth, I cannot so much as imagine any peace or solid foundation of improvement in human things till this <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">univer</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">sal</hi> scheme of procedure go out of men&#x2019;s heads again, and each take to what alone is practicable for him<supplied>[self&#x2014;]</supplied>mending of his own ways;&#x2014;wherefrom Benevolence enough, and infinitely better things, will be sure enough to result. Since you have read the <hi rend="italic">New Testament</hi>, and understood it <hi rend="italic">anew</hi>, I tell you all this, with the greater freedom. It seems to me, Jesus of Nazareth was of all men the least of a &#x201C;Penny Lady,&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;In Scotland the &#x2018;Penny Ladies&#x2019; (extraneously so-called) were busy, &#x2018;benevolent&#x2019; persons; subscribers of a penny a week for educating, &#x26;c. &#x26;c., not with much success&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 349).</note> or comprehensive universal Soup-Kitchen <pb id="pg-07-56" n="07-56"/>character: he pitied sorrow and sin and pain, with an infinite, outbursting, helpful pity, wheresoever he met with it; but so likewise did he smite with an infinite withering indignation whatsoever deserved that; and on the whole went about with a quite other object than consciously <hi rend="italic">seeking</hi> either of these. &#x201C;To do the Will of my Father,&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 12:50.</note>&#x2014;were it even that of being scourged out of existence, as a failure and nonentity, and disgrace to the world.&#x2014;</p>
<p>But here surely is too much of dissertation. You have a long arrear of London business to bring up with me; pray do not delay with it. I write a line to Buller along with this; but hardly imagine he will answer soon: my best almost sole dependence is you. I have not seen his <hi rend="italic">Mirabeau</hi><note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Buller, &#x201C;Mirabeau,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, XII (<date when="1833-10-00">Oct. 1833</date>), 455&#x2013;95, recommended by Mill in his letter of <date when="1833-11-25">25 Nov.</date></note> yet; much to my dissatisfaction; from some delay in Booksellers.&#x2014; You never tell me anything of Roebuck<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330112-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan.</date></ref></note> now: I remember once saying that he reminded me of Robespierre, and I could not take to him: this is not to hinder my feeling a true interest in what a true man (lean tho&#x2019; he be) does, and grows to. I will even ask you to let me see him, when I return to London.&#x2014; Hayward, writing about his <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, surprises me with something about difficulties in the way of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, and a necessity for pecuniary help, and: whether any lies within my sphere? I will at least <hi rend="italic">do no ill</hi>; by altogether holding my tongue about it. There is not out of Edinburgh a single man known to me, that were worth applying to. This fact of the <hi rend="italic">Examiner&#x2019;s</hi> distress (if it be a fact) seems to me the most scandalous sympton <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> of our literary taste. But from your silence about it, perhaps it is no fact, or an exaggerated one.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-12-22">22 Dec.</date>, Mill gives a detailed account of the difficulties through which the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> was passing and a critical appraisal of its editor, Fonblanque.</note></p>
<p>No Books have yet come; but I expect Books tomorrow, and perhaps certain of yours may be among them. Have you <hi rend="italic">Beaumarchais&#x2019;</hi> Writings; his <hi rend="italic">Figaro;</hi> his Goezman <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires?</hi><note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Beaumarchais&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331123-JWC-HI-01">JWC to HI, <date when="1833-11-23">23 Nov.</date></ref>; <hi rend="italic">Le Mariage de Figaro</hi>, a comedy first produced in <date when="1784-00-00">1784</date>; and L.

I wanted to try whether by sticking actually to the Realities of the thing with as much tenacity and punctuality as the merest Hallam, one could not in a small way make a kind of Poem of it. The result is there: perhaps not quite so unsuccessful as one could have expected. I wish you had it to read it; for I have some thoughts of printing it as a little Book; and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> advertisement at all (except perhaps <hi rend="italic">one</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>) sending it forth with my name on it to lie on, say, 100 Booksellers&#x2019; Counters, and ask (without <hi rend="italic">any</hi> Lying) whether any one has aught to say to it. A good Bookseller, to make the sheets into bales, and send them off punctually &#x26;c &#x26;c, one at least that would not <hi rend="italic">steal</hi>, were of the truest service in such a case: I fancy it will by and by be found to be the sole use of such.&#x2014; We shall judge of it better, when it is farther gone from us, and the <hi rend="italic">dust of hewing it out</hi> is laid.&#x2014;&#x2014; <closer><salute>In conclusion, or rather in <hi rend="italic">abruption</hi> (for Paper and Time are done) I beg the most plentiful tidings from you; and will myself write more <foreign><hi rend="italic">menschlich</hi></foreign> [humanly], less <foreign><hi rend="italic">geistlich</hi></foreign> [spiritually], next time;&#x2014;and remain ever&#x2014; Your affectionate&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your last or Roman Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. John describes it in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-12-14">14 Dec.</date> as &#x201C;a very circumstantial letter.&#x201D;</note> greatly to our Mother&#x2019;s satisfaction, reached her almost three weeks ago; and Jamie Austin, few days afterwards, unexpectedly stept in with it one evening here. You not u<supplied>[n]</supplied>reasonably lament a little that my Letter for Rome had not come to hand; which however I can calculate that it has long before this done: and now, having or making for myself an hour or two of leisure I will despatch you another, tho&#x2019; you did not positively so appoint it. I easily guess how doubly and trebly significant Annandale Letters become on the Pincian Hill: if this only assure you again that all is still well, it will be amply worth its postage. Take that assurance, then, my dear Brother; and the more joyfully read the following development of it.</p>
<p>The description you give us of your Roman Life is copious and clear; very gratifying to us; such matter as we like best of all to see in your Letters. For myself, however, I can discern, what perhaps our good Mother does not so well, that with all favourable circumstances, you have need of your philosophy there. Alas, all modes of existence need such: we are once for all &#x201C;in a conditional world.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not traced.</note> Your great grievance doubtless is that properly your office gives you nothing to do. Three hundred a year with sumptuous accomodation you have; but that is all. The Days have to fly over you, and you seem to remain as it were windbound: little more than an article of Aristocratic state, so far as your own household goes: this I can well see and sympathize in. It is hard indeed, and grating to one&#x2019;s love of action; a thing <hi rend="italic">intolerable,</hi> did it threaten to continue forever. But you are no longer a headlong youth, but grown a deliberate man; accordingly I see you adjust yourself to this also, from this also gather nourishment and strength. You are <hi rend="italic">equipping</hi> yourself (in that strange way; so it was ordered) for your Life-voyage: patience, and the ancher [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is lifted. In the mean while too you know well <hi rend="italic">no</hi> situation imposes on <pb id="pg-07-59" n="07-59"/>us the necessity of <hi rend="italic">idleness:</hi> if not in one way, if not in one of a hundred ways, you will work in the hundred-and-first. Continue, I beg of you, to be mild, and either tolerant, or <hi rend="italic">silently</hi> intolerant; let them go their way, go thou thine. What medical practice is to be come at, eagerly take. In defect of this, read your <hi rend="italic">Win</hi>[<hi rend="italic">c</hi>]<hi rend="italic">kelmann,</hi> or any other solid Book most appropriate to the place; converse with all manner of mortals whose knowledge or whose ignorance can directly or indirectly teach you aught. I should prefer Romans, I think, to such a set of English as you have; in any case if it is a man and not a shadow of a man, one can get some good of him. My poor <foreign><hi rend="italic">Segretario Ambulante,</hi></foreign><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-11-18">18 Nov.</date></ref></note> actually converting Disorder into Order here, in a small way, and realizing victual for himself, is worth a hundred men Clothes-horses and patent-digesters, by what glorious name soever they may call themselves, that either do nothing, or the reverse of Doing, which is even lower than nothing. Patience, therefore, my dear Brother! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ohne Hast aber ohne Rast</hi></foreign> [Without haste but without rest]. Let the Cooks boil, and the Tailors sew, and the Shovelhat emit weekly his modicum of dishwater disguised as water-of-life; it is all in the course of nature: &#x201C;like the cranes&#x2019; hoarse-jingling flight that over our heads in long-drawn shriek sends down its creaking gabble, and tempts the silent wanderer that he look aloft at them a moment: these go their way, and he goes his; so likewise shall it be with us.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The lines seem to be a loose recollection of Schiller&#x2019;s &#x201C;Die Kraniche von Ibykus&#x201D; (&#x201C;The Cranes of Ibycus&#x201D;).</note> Send me the minutest account of all you do and endure; and let us wait courageously for <hi rend="italic">the</hi> day coming. It must and will come.</p>
<p>And now so for a little Dumfriesshire news. Our good Mother continues in her old state of health, or &#x201C;rather better,&#x201D; as they report to me. Her Pills she continues to find exceedingly beneficial: I forwarded a Box of them last time I was in Dumfries. I expect her here perhaps about Wednesday week: Austin and Mary are coming to Carstammon; will bring her to Jean&#x2019;s, and then on some appointed day, I go down to fetch her with the Gig. Austin can find no Farm, he told us; the whole country is running after every offer of one, and all are taken palpably too dear. What arrangement he will make for the coming year is not apparent yet; our Mother&#x2019;s destination, which partly depended on this, is therefore also uncertain; we shall talk of it fully when she comes up. Many a time, I think the foolish creatures, had they known better what stuff Hope is made of, might as well have staid where they were: but, at any rate, it was a change to be made; <pb id="pg-07-60" n="07-60"/>whether today or tomorrow is perhaps of little moment. A kind of sadness naturally comes over our Mother&#x2019;s mind at this new proof of terrestrial vicissitude; but withal she is quite peaceful and resolute; having indeed a <hi rend="italic">deeper</hi> basis than Earth and its vicissitudes to stand on. I hardly know now another person in the world that so entirely believes and acts on her Belief. Doubt not but all will shape itself or be shapen in some tolerable way.&#x2014; Jean, as you heard, is in her own house in Lochmabengate;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Dumfries.</note> to all appearance, doing perfectly well. Our Errand-boy, Rob Austin, draws up there on Wednesdays; and often brings us up a little Note from her.&#x2014; Alick has got a new son, whom he has named or purposes naming <hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Carlyle (<date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1921-00-00">1921</date>), of Bieldy Knowes, near Brantford, Canada, who married Margaret McVicar and by her had two sons and three daughters, including Thomas, who married Margaret Brown, Blanche, who married Ernest Clump, and John A., who married Jean Brown. See Edwin W. Marrs, Jr., &#x201C;Reminiscences of a Visit with Carlyle in <date when="1878-00-00">1878</date> by His Nephew and Namesake,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Thoth</hi> (Department of English, Syracuse University), VIII (<date when="1967-00-00">Spring, 1967</date>), 66&#x2013;83.</note> after me. He can get along amid the bleak mud-acres of Catlinns, but with a continual struggle, one of his daydreams for many a year has been America; I have ceased to oppose it so firmly of late: indeed, I often enough think, What if I should go to America myself! Thousands and millions must yet go: it is properly but another section of our own Country,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; they rebelled, very justly, against George Guelph, and beat him, as they ought. We shall do or determine nothing rashly; the rather as for the present nothing presses.&#x2014; Do you remember poor old Jenny Morrison?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> She was found burnt and dead in her hut at Ecclefechan some six weeks ago: a little piece of halfpenny Candle stood blown out on the hob,&#x2014;never to be lighted again by her. Suspicions were entertained of violence and some travelling Tinker; but they came to nothing. Poor old Jenny, who could have begged with her Daughter &#x201C;thro&#x2019; the nine kingdoms,&#x201D; has departed far beyond the boundaries of them all.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As reported in the <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> there was an inquiry on her death; she was over 80 and feeble-minded; the suspected tinker was the wife of a traveling brush-maker; and, much as Carlyle says, she was found burned almost to ashes on the floor of her cottage in Ecclefechan.</note></p>
<p>As for Craigenputtoch, it stands here in winter grimness in winter seclusion. Nothing could exceed the violence of the December weather we have had: trees uprooted, Macadam slates jingling down, deluges of rain; one friday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] in particular did immense mischief to ships and edifices all over the Island; such a day as has not been seen <pb id="pg-07-61" n="07-61"/>for a quarter of a century, they say. We nestled ourselves down here; &#x201C;better a <foreign>wee</foreign> bush than no <foreign>bield</foreign>.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220407-TC-JAC-01"><sic>2:80</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1822-04-07">7 April 1822</date></corr></ref>. There had been a stormy autumn, and on <date when="1833-12-20">Friday, Dec. 20</date>, a hurricane and torrents of rain. The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-12-25">25 Dec.</date>) commented: &#x201C;We do not remember to have ever experienced so long a tack of boisterous and suddenly variable weather.&#x201D;</note> The shortest day is now behind us; we shall look forward to a Spring which will be all the gladder. I continue to read great quantities of Books: I have also, with an effort, accomplished the projected Piece on the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>. It was finished this day week: a really queer kind of thing; of some forty and odd pages: Jane, at first, thought we should print it at our own charges; set our name on it, and send it out in God&#x2019;s name: neither she nor I am now so sure of this; but will consider it. My attempt was to make Reality Ideal: there is considerable significance in that notion of mine; and I have not yet seen the limits of it; nor shall till I have tried to go <hi rend="italic">as far</hi> as it will carry me. The story of the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> is all told in that Paper with the strictest fidelity; yet in a kind of <hi rend="italic">musical</hi> way: it seems to me there is no Epic possible that does not first of all ground itself on Belief: what a man <hi rend="italic">does not believe</hi> can never at bottom be of true interest to him.&#x2014; For the rest, I remain in the completest isolation from all manner of Editors: <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k is coming regularly out in <hi rend="italic">Fraser,</hi> with what effect or non-effect I know not, consider not; and this is all I have to do with the world of Letters or Types. Before very long I shall most probably begin something else; at all events, go over again to the Barjarg Library, and so use my time and not waste it. I have a considerable quantity and quotity of things to impart to my Brothers in this Earth, if God see meet to keep me in it; and no Editor nor body of Editors, nor indeed the whole World and the Devil to back it out, can wholly prevent me from imparting them. Forward, then, <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten Muthes</hi></foreign> [with a cheerful spirit].&#x2014; Jane also is writing something but will not tell me what, &#x201C;till she have got past the fiftieth page.&#x201D; She complains of never having been so well, since we were last in Annandale.</p>
<p>What a kind of scene this may be you will begin to guess better when I tell you that poor Glen and his Brother Archy are both here, since Thur<supplied>[s]</supplied>day last; and a third friend that accompanied them from Glasgow only went off the day before yesterday. We had sat expecting them, for almost a week, not without trepidation. Now that it has actually taken place, all the worst is over. Poor Glen is many degrees better than I anticipated; indeed they say a very great change has taken place since he quitted Glasgow and Confinement; had even begun before he quitted it. So far as I can see there is little doubt <pb id="pg-07-62" n="07-62"/>but his Delusions will wholly evaporate, and perhaps leave him much wiser than ever. The foundations of his mind are evidently <hi rend="italic">much</hi> sounder; his whole character more compact and pronounced, his very manner has a kind of quiet distinctness and manfulness, which it formerly wanted. Neither has he any <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi>-idea; his malady seems rather a preternatural vividness of conception, whereby his actual recollections of things become hardly distinguishable from the <hi rend="italic">thoughts</hi> of such recollections: a malady too which he himself seems already sensible of or dubious of; wherefore he for most part keeps his whims altogether to himself, and speaks very little, and that little of the most perfect sanity. Sometimes when he does state a whim, and you reason with him, he will give it up with appearance of shame. He expresses his past state in emblems, which (if you take them for emblems) are perfectly just: say, &#x201C;it is a system&#x201D;; a &#x201C;ventriloquism by which all kinds of foul creatures are made to speak thro&#x2019; you, and you cannot distinguish their voice from your own&#x201D;; a &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">p&#xE8;ine forte et dure</hi></foreign> [severe and lasting punishment],&#x201D; whereby however man learns much about &#x201C;the Theory of the Planet,&#x201D; and will come out all the clearer with &#x201C;Sentience&#x201D; or vision in place of probabilities and doubt. Poor Glen! <hi rend="italic">This</hi> then was to be his practical Apprenticeship; this struggling against the Phantasms of his own mind; and manfully conquering them! He says with an air of Coolness such as I never saw in him (for his old indignancy is quite suppressed, and no man was ever quieter) &#x201C;I have been quite a Martyr&#x201D;; but &#x201C;I wait now till my head grow clear, and I learn what is substance what is shadow: I shall then know how to act, and certainly be burdensome to no one.&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x2014; I know not whether you can make much of all this: but the sum of it is that I have very considerable hopes of the poor fellow; and think if he will himself consent to take up his abode at Peter Austin&#x2019;s, it will be the best place for him. Our own house would perhaps suit still better, for he seems to have no squeamish feeling about being here; thinks it probably a &#x201C;part of the system&#x201D;; and indeed generally fronts me and all men with a kind of quiet manfulness and composure never visible in him before: but our little household with none but honest Grace Cavens to keep it moving could hardly stand such a thing. We shall see how it turns: for Archy Glen is to be here or hereabouts for some fortnight yet; something can be settled before then. Our &#x201C;Patient&#x201D; in the mean time has taken to reading (<hi rend="italic">Schmelzle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fixlein</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Richter&#x2019;s &#x201C;Army-Chaplain Schmelzle&#x2019;s Journey to Flaetz&#x201D; and &#x201C;Life of Quintus Fixlein.&#x201D;</note> it was yesterday) and expresses his <pb id="pg-07-63" n="07-63"/>readiness to begin <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> with me whenever I like. Wish him good speed, then, since you are not here to <hi rend="italic">Counsel</hi>. He spoke of your Letter to him (from Naples) with gratitude: that too, <hi rend="italic">after dinner</hi>, when, as I observe, he is always worse. &#x201C;Pity the poor white man,&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-03/lt-18251019-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:390</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1825-10-19">19 Oct. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> and do all we can to help him! He may one day be <hi rend="italic">rich</hi>&#x2014;with the best riches.</p>
<p>To Badams I have never yet written; tho&#x2019; I still mean to do it: nor have I heard the smallest tidings from him<supplied>[.]</supplied> I doubt with you there is nothing good to be heard. Holcroft still sends the <hi rend="italic">Examiner;</hi> but his address too I have mislaid: he never came near Scotland that we heard of.&#x2014; Mill was in Paris, I fancy, when I wrote last: he has since returned, and sent me a long Letter about things doing and to be done in Paris. A strange world that French one; in which I should like very well to look about me half a year: but at the present conjuncture it will not do; the <hi rend="italic">cheapness</hi> of it, according to Mill, is very similar to that of London. I had better content myself for a while with French <hi rend="italic">Books</hi>, and use <hi rend="italic">them</hi> well. Adolphe D&#x2019;Eichthal got me (thro&#x2019; Mill) several questions, about the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi>, answered, from an old eye witness<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Baron Antoine Darnay. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331217-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-12-17">17 Dec.</date></ref></note> of that Business: but the answers did not throw much light on it: I also expect a Map of the Environs of Paris, and a Book or two&#x2014;of small price.</p>
<p>My thirty-eighth Birthday happened on the <date when="1833-12-04">4<hi rend="italic">th</hi> last</date>: I am fast verging towards Forty; either as Fool or Physician! The flight of Time is a world-old topic; I was much struck, and consoled, to see it handled quite in my own spirit in the <hi rend="italic">Book of Job</hi>, as I read there lately. O Jack! Jack! what unutterable things one would have to utter, had one organs!&#x2014; Waugh&#x2019;s Book on the Prophecies is absolutely not so bad. There is a kind of sincerity in it; graspings after a heart of Truth to hold by. Poor Waugh! I have heard nothing of him since last time; except that the meal &#x26;c had been duly delivered.&#x2014; We have had some five or six Letters from the Advocate; mostly unanswered yet.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu in writing to Jane on Christmas Eve protested: &#x201C;You do not write to me, and I fear have relinquished altogether my unprofitable correspondence&#x2014;if this is idleness it ought to be amended; you are not a safe person to be idle, your thoughts are too active too sharp to be turned in upon yourself, you might as well run upon your own sword, as upon your own imagination. &#x2026; Your barbarous treatment of the Lord Advocate (by your own shewing) quite reconciles <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to &#x2018;neighbour-Jane,&#x2019; but it only encreases your guilt. &#x2026; What ought to be the penalty&#x2014; Your <hi rend="italic">just</hi> and true Husband shall adjudge it.&#x201D;</note> He asks me why I am not as cheerful a man as you? babbles <pb id="pg-07-64" n="07-64"/>greatly about one thing and the other. They gave him a Dinner in Edinburgh;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On <date when="1833-11-06">6 Nov.</date> at the Waterloo Rooms a public dinner was given to Jeffrey and his fellow member of Parliament, James Abercromby, attended by about 400, which was fully reported by the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-11-09">9 Nov.</date>). Jeffrey reviewed the activities of the ministry of which he had been a member, including its stand on the Irish disturbances bill and compensation to slave owners in the West Indies.</note> listened patiently to his account of himself; pardoned him for sake of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Langsyne</hi></foreign>. We hear now (not from himself) that some Lord Cringletie<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Wolfe Murray, Lord Cringletie (<date when="1759-00-00">1759</date>&#x2013;<date when="1836-00-00">1836</date>), Sheriff of Peebles, <date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>; became a judge, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>; judge-admiral, lord commissioner of the jury court, <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>.</note> or other is about resigning, and that Jeffrey is to be made a Judge. It will be a happy change. Macaulay goes to India with &#xa3;10,000 a year: Jeffrey calls him the greatest (if I remember rightly) man in England not excepting even the Chancellor; how we are to get on without him &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> Depend upon it we shall get on, better or worse.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Macaulay had been appointed member of the Supreme Council of India on <date when="1833-12-04">4 Dec.</date>, at &#xa3;10,000 a year, sailing in <date when="1833-02-00">February</date> and returning in <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>. Jeffrey wrote to Macvey Napier on <date when="1833-12-07">7 Dec.</date> regretting that Macaulay did not &#x201C;know the extent of the damage which his secession may be to the cause of Liberal Government.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014; Buller is also in Town. The Austins too; A. has got some Govt appointment as Law Commissioner (&#xa3;500 a year); Mrs A. has a Booklet (from the German) on its way hither. These are all my news.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Brother, leaving all these extraneous things and persons, let me commend us all again to you the Absent, and therefore <hi rend="italic">best</hi> Loved. We shall not see you at our Newyear&#x2019;s day; but I here promise to think of you quite specially; and even drink your health (from the heart) tho&#x2019; it were only in water that day. Let us, as I said, be patient and peaceable: there are other newyears coming, when we shall not be so far apart. Meanwhile be strong! Remember always what you said of the Rush-bush here at Puttock on the way side: &#x201C;It stands there because the whole world could not prevent its standing.&#x201D; One of the best thoughts I ever heard you utter; a really true, and pregnant thought. So too with ourselves. Let us <hi rend="italic">resist</hi> the Devil, the World, and the Flesh: alas, it is ill to do; yet one should forever endeavour. Cheer up your lone heart in the midst of those Roman ruins: there is a Time still young and fruitful, which belongs to <hi rend="italic">us</hi>. Get impatient with nobody: how easy is it to <hi rend="italic">bid</hi> you do this! Yet really it is right and true: the thing we have to do were to <hi rend="italic">abolish</hi> and abandon the worthless; if we cannot do this (all at once), let us <pb id="pg-07-65" n="07-65"/>at least not make it worse&#x2014;by adding our own <hi rend="italic">badness</hi> to it.&#x2014; <closer><salute>God be with you, my dear John!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>This Note is not worth Twopence, or indeed half one penny: but I write it to remind you of me, and prevent a possible supererogation on your part; the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> supererogatory, as you have so much of the necessary to do.</p>
<p>It strikes me that in the last Letter I mentioned <hi rend="italic">Beaumarchais&#x2019; Works</hi>. Now it so happens that next day, a complete Copy of these arrived here; and I have already satisfied myself about the <hi rend="italic">Mariage de <pb id="pg-07-66" n="07-66"/>Figaro</hi>, and various other points;&#x2014;and you, my beneficent purveyor, are discharged from all care on that head.</p>
<p>Will you tell Mrs Austin that we received her two Notes; that I have taken order about the Book,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sarah Austin&#x2019;s translation from the German of F. W. Carov&#xE9;, <hi rend="italic">The Story Without an End</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), a popular children&#x2019;s story; copies were ready for Christmas, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>.</note> and will write when I have read it.</p>
<p>Poor Glen has actually come! It seems to me, in spite of superficial hallucinations, he is <hi rend="italic">far wiser</hi> than when we used to see him in London. His mouth has lost that foolish undecided twist: he is very greatly calmer, manfuller, more distinct and resolved, in his general manner and bearing, than I ever saw him. He has come thro&#x2019; what he calls the <foreign><hi rend="italic">p&#xE8;ine forte et dure</hi></foreign> [severe and persisting misery] (and hopes he is to grow clearer for it)&#x2014;in battling not with flesh and blood, but with his own Phantasms; any way <hi rend="italic">in battling</hi>. Strange are the ways of Destiny with us! I hope, to poor Glen, it will one day prove all for good.</p>
<p>Wild winter is howling around; but from time to time one snatches a glimpse of clear weather; and remembers that the Sun is not extinct, only gone into the other room. He will be back in Spring: <foreign><hi rend="italic">reparaitra au printems</hi></foreign>.</p>
<p>None of your Books have come; nor indeed any Book from London, last month. I have taken order about it tonight.</p> 
<p>That notice of the <hi rend="italic">Repository</hi> was by you? There is much in Fox that I wholly agree with; or rather I agree with almost all in him, only do not rate it so high as he.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill replied in his letter of <date when="1833-01-12">12 Jan.</date> that he had written two articles on the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi>, the one to which Carlyle referred and another. These were &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> for <date when="1833-12-00">December</date>,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-12-15">15 Dec. 1833</date>, pp. 788&#x2013;89; and &#x201C;The <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> for <date when="1834-01-00">January</date>,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1834-01-12">12 Jan. 1834</date>, p. 21. The <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi> was edited by W. J. Fox.</note></p>
<p>The old Criticism on <hi rend="italic">Napier</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A review of Sir Charles James Napier (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1853-00-00">1853</date>), <hi rend="italic">The Colonies, Examiner</hi>, <date when="1833-11-24">24 Nov. 1833</date>, pp. 740&#x2013;41.</note> happened to be carried away before I got it read.

In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1834-01-12">12 Jan.</date> Mill said, &#x201C;The paper on Miss Martineau was really a paper on Impressment.&#x201D;</note> I did not recognise as yours; tho&#x2019; I remember feeling it to <supplied>[be]</supplied> wiser than much that I had read about her. But the truth is, so much mere babbling pro and con has taken place about poor Miss M. that wherever I see her name, I feel a kind of temptation to skip. She is the most intelligible of women; also the most measurable. There was the abominablest tirade <pb id="pg-07-67" n="07-67"/>about her in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Miss Harriet Martineau,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> VIII (<date when="1833-11-00">Nov., 1833</date>), 576, by William Maginn.</note> which you I suppose were happy enough not to see.</p>
<p>Reports are current here that L<hi rend="italic">d</hi> Advocate Jeffrey is to be made a Scotch Judge.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Became judge of the court of session; accepting the appointment in <date when="1834-05-00">May</date>, he took his seat in <date when="1834-06-00">June, 1834</date>.</note> He himself says nothing of it.</p>

<salute>My dear Jean,</salute>
<p>There is almost nothing to say this week; except that you are to pay yourself from the beginning of Rob&#x2019;s Pound.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The pound which Carlyle had sent to Dumfries by his factotum Robert Austin.</note> My account bears 10/9&#xBD;&#x2014;unless either you gave me, or I gave you, the <hi rend="italic">pence</hi> in, to make even money of it? Or perhaps this is but a mere chimera of my own?</p>
<p>There is a little haddock of a white shelty (a great Beauty when in condition) coming down from Templand next wednesday for my Mother at Scotsbrig. The Boy will bring it to you; you can send it over to Garthwaite, and give him charges about it.</p>
<p>Jane rejoices to hear that the lost Letter has finally come back into <hi rend="italic">your</hi> hands last Saturday! Unless Mrs Welsh (who only went off yesterday) send you some word about it, you had better blot out the &#x201C;Andrew Watson,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Andrew Watson, carrier: see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281230-JWC-TC-01"><sic>4:438</sic><corr>JWC to TC, <date when="1828-12-30">30 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> and put it into the Post-office.</p>
<p>We got no Letters or Newspaper last week, till (by a new effort) on Sunday. Dame M&#x2019;Adam and our Missus between them contrived to omit it. There was nothing of moment that suffered thereby.</p>
<p>If James has the old frame that my Mother&#x2019;s Picture (of <hi rend="italic">me</hi>) stood in, and is not for putting some other piece into it, will he send it [torn] the <hi rend="italic">queerest print</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Maclise&#x2019;s sketch of Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine,</hi> VII (<date when="1833-06-00">June 1833</date>), opp. p. 706.</note> ready to go <supplied>[into it]</supplied> here; which you shall see when you come up.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Your first Letter did, as you conjecture, lie six days at Dumfries: I found it there, as I had gone down to meet my Mother, and bring her up hither on a visit to us; there was another Letter from Rome too; so that all good things came at once. You should have had an answer sooner, had you not half-predicted that you would write again &#x201C;within a week.&#x201D; It so chanced that I was at Dumfries a second time last Saturday, and there found another belated Letter; and so now on Monday night, close-shrouded from these howling winds and rains I proceed to clear accounts with you.</p>
<p>The Book-parcel (I cannot yet speak in the plural number) had, in the mean while, arrived; the <hi rend="italic">Morellet</hi> one<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires in&#xE9;dits de l&#x2019;Abb&#xE9; Morellet,</hi> 2 vols. (Paris, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>).</note> I mean: that of the <hi rend="italic">Collier,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331008-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1833-10-08">8 Oct. 1833</date></ref>.</note> Fraser tells me, is still in his hands; and he knows not well when it will come. He has altered his method of conveyance to Edinburgh, it seems, and now sends his Magazines by the Mail; and so, for any foreign package, must <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> a conveyance by sea, such being not regular but casual. What next are we to do? I suppose Bookbales go off to Edinburgh almost weekly by sea; but I can bethink me of none at this moment that are open to me. The shortest way I fancy in this and all similar cases will be to have the Parcel sent to Simpkins and Marshall, addressed &#x201C;Care of Mr M&#x2019;Kie Bookseller, Dumfries&#x201D;: it will reach me sooner (about the end of every month), and cost only 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi> per Pound, which rate is still an easy one. Will you therefore tell Fraser to take this method with it, if he have not an <hi rend="italic">early</hi> prospect otherwise; and also that his Edinburgh Agents have now faithfully sent me <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the rest that was due. I am ashamed to trouble you so often on such matters: but what can I do? The Necklace Collection<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written to Carlyle on <date when="1833-12-22">22 Dec. 1833</date>: &#x201C;I long to see your <hi rend="italic">collier</hi> book, yet could wish for the sake of it that you had received long since what you will receive soon, unless the diligence to which Adolphe d&#x2019;Eichthal has entrusted it, prove unfaithful. This is, (if I rightly recollect, for I have not his letter by me) a collection, in two volumes 8<hi rend="italic">vo</hi>, of all the <foreign><hi rend="italic">pi&#xE8;ces du proc&#xE8;s;</hi></foreign> a book without which, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> says, <hi rend="italic">everybody</hi> says there is no getting any conception of what it was. This book is to come, along with the H&#xE9;nault [see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331028-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-10-28">28 Oct. 1833</date></ref>], &#x26; shall go by Fraser&#x2019;s next, if it come in time.&#x201D;</note> is the very Book I inquired after over all Edinburgh, <pb id="pg-07-70" n="07-70"/>but with the most imperfect result; and cannot fail to interest me. Montgaillard (not Gaillard?) I have never seen or heard of: Bauchamont [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] was not to be got trace of in any Edinburgh Library, keenly as I searched for it.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abb&#xE9; Guillaume Honor&#xE9; de Montgaillard (<date when="1772-00-00">1772</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>) and others, <hi rend="italic">Revue chronologique de l&#x2019;histoire de France &#x2026; <date when="1787-00-00">1787</date>&#x2013;<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>,</hi> 9 vols.

Some Extracts from it that have come in my way are most lively gossip.&#x2014; Another thing I wish you could investigate for me, some time; yet not till I request you more specially: the manner of Countess de Lamotte&#x2019;s death. At the end of her <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> Memoirs (the English Translation in two volumes)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Jeanne, Comtesse de La Motte, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331008-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1833-10-08">8 Oct. 1833</date></ref>.</note> it is said she <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> from the leads of a house, in such and such a street; flying from some Bailiff: in all the French and other foreign accounts, it is said she was <hi rend="italic">thrown</hi> out of a window in the course of a nocturnal carouse. The <hi rend="italic">Coroner&#x2019;s Inquest</hi> that must have been held on her were doubtless still accessible (for day and date are given), and would throw light on several things. In the British Museum, you shall look for it some time, if I fail elsewhere: but not till I tell you.</p>
<p>Your news of the projected Periodical<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-12-22">22 Dec.</date> Mill had given details concerning plans which led to the founding of the <hi rend="italic">London Review:</hi> &#x201C;The principal radicals in parliament &#x26; many of those out of it have a scheme for starting a new quarterly review, &#x26; are exerting themselves so much for it that they will probably succeed in setting it going. The first promoters of it were Roebuck, Buller, &#x26; I; &#x26; we shall probably be the surest &#x26; most regular contributors; though there will be abundance of others. &#x2026; The rich radicals, Strutt, Warburton, Sir W. Molesworth, the Marshalls of Leeds, &#x26; others, are going to raise money of the necessary amount among themselves &#x26; their friends. &#x2026; The plan (Roebuck&#x2019;s &#x26; mine, to which all have at once assented) is, to drop altogether every kind of lying. &#x2026; There is to be no <hi rend="italic">we;</hi> but each writer is to have a signature. &#x2026; They would I believe make <hi rend="italic">me</hi> editor if I would take it&#x2014;but I cannot. &#x2026; If this scheme goes on, I hope you will write <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the review or at least <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it. As an organ of utterance it will be at least more congenial to you than Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine.&#x201D;</note> are of true interest for me: I only regret that I stand at such a distance, and can so inadequately understand what is purposed in the Enterprise; with what means; under what prognostics. It were so pleasant for me, so profitable, could I, seeing clearly what I did, <hi rend="italic">unite</hi> myself with a set of men whom I believe to have the faithfullest intentions, and take a far <pb id="pg-07-71" n="07-71"/>heartier share in their work than (as you know) writing for it now and then means with me. Alas, we are fallen into wondrous times in that respect! To enter some Dog&#x2019;s-meat Bazaar; muffled up; perhaps holding your nose, and say: &#x201C;Here you, Master, able Editor or whatever your name is, will you buy this mess of mine (at so much per pound), and sell it among your Dog&#x2019;s-meat?&#x201D;&#x2014;and then having dealt with the able Editor, hurry out again, and wish that it could be kept secret from all men: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is the nature of my connexion with Periodicals; to this does the strange condition of the Book-trade, and my own unpropitious star at this time drive me: perhaps it will not be forever; but even if forever I must be patient with it, and not act foolishly under it.</p>
<p>Already, as I meditate the matter, arises a considerable series of subjects which might be treated in that Work of yours better than elsewhere. Two, in particular, that have lain in me for years; both of which might be handled with some effect, and made instructive even to the Radical world: I mean an <hi rend="italic">Essay on Authors,</hi> and another Essay on <hi rend="italic">John Knox</hi>. The first of these, which I was thinking to write at any rate, I will cheerfully (on faith of <hi rend="italic">you,</hi> for that is all I yet know of the Project) write for the new Work. The second is not so ready in me; but can also be made ready. My farther contributions must depend on the treatment I experience, on the course matters take; and I need not assure you, the closer my connexion can grow the better pleased shall I be.</p>
<p>For the present, I can see but a little way. Have you not for instance a Radical Review already, the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi>; and Radical Magazines, <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Repository</hi> and so forth? What, at bottom, is the meaning of a new Work of the same sort; what newness is there to be in the doctrines of it? Or is it mainly certain new <hi rend="italic">men</hi> that find themselves more or less foreign in these Publications, and would rather be at home in one of their own? Tell me, in any case, how the project shapes itself into fulfilment; and when the First Number may be looked for, which perhaps will be the best answer of all. I approve greatly of your purpose to discard Cant and Falsehood of all kinds: yet there is a kind of Fiction, which is not Falsehood, and has more effect in addressing men than many a Radical is aware of. This has struck me much of late years in considering <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fraser:</hi> both these are furnished as it were with a kind of theatrical costume, with orchestra and stage-lights, and thereby alone have a wonderful advantage; perhaps almost their only advantage. For nothing was ever truer than this: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ubi homines sunt modi sunt</hi></foreign> [Where <pb id="pg-07-72" n="07-72"/>there are men there are manners];<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels, Works,</hi> XXIV, 338.</note> a maxim which grows with me in significance the longer I meditate it; modifying innumerable things in my Philosophy. The Radicals, as you may observe, appear universally <hi rend="italic">naked</hi> (except so far as decency goes); and really have a most prosaic aspect. Barren, barren, as the Sahara sand is that Speculation of theirs (as for example, in <hi rend="italic">Tait</hi>); almost more afflicting, only that it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> poisonous, than the putrid fermenting mud of <hi rend="italic">Fraser!</hi>&#x2014; The grand secret, I fancy, is that the Radicals as yet have almost no <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> (tho&#x2019; now not absolutely none); and so with prosaic <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> and a vehement belief must do the best they can.</p>
<p>The sheet must not be all filled with facts; otherwise there were much more to say. I wrote to Tait about Fonblanque&#x2019;s business;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An early reference to Fonblanque&#x2019;s financial difficulties occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1833-06-23">23 June 1833</date>, p. 396, where in the Court of Common Pleas action had been brought against him by Cunningham and Salmon, printers. Mill had written on <date when="1833-12-22">22 Dec.</date> that the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> and Fonblanque as its editor and proprietor, were in financial difficulties and that to overcome these it was proposed to raise subscriptions of &#xa3;10 each from 100 persons, who would each &#x201C;receive the paper <foreign>gratis</foreign> for ten years.&#x201D; This would pay off all debts, and give Fonblanque a fresh start. Tait was presumably to find some subscribers.</note> enjoining <hi rend="italic">Silence,</hi> if nothing else could be looked for: it was all I could do; and if Tait, &#x201C;the centre of Edinburgh Radicalism,&#x201D; was not written to before, might be of some small effect. He was to communicate with you, in case of any success. I am not to hear from him till a week hence, when some of your Books are to be sent him, on their return to you, and then acknowledged by him. And so enough of facts tonight.</p>
<p>Your second Letter<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1834-01-12">12 Jan.</date>, an extremely important letter in which Mill attempts to reveal clearly the stage of intellectual development which he had reached at the time and to point out significant differences between his thinking and that of Carlyle. See Mineka, XII, 204&#x2013;9.</note> flatters me, and does more: I feel you much closer to me after it. Truly my dear Mill, you are a most punctual, clear, authentic man. At several of your revelations, and computings whether you would stand lower with me or higher (but you rather thought lower), a smile came over me, in which lay a greater kindness than it were good to put in words. No, my Friend, you do not stand lower with me; and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> rather think you would stand higher still, were the whole known. As it is, I can say, the Creed you write down is singularly like my own in most points,&#x2014;with this single difference that you are yet consciously nothing of a Mystic; your very Mysticism (for there is enough of it in you) you have to translate into Logic before <pb id="pg-07-73" n="07-73"/>you give it place.

Nay if I were to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> only in the dialect of Argument (as I see is yet mostly your habit) what other could I say than you? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wer darf Ihn</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">nennen</hi></foreign> [Who dares <hi rend="small-caps">name</hi> Him]? &#x201C;The Highest is not to be spoken of in words.&#x201D; All that of Natural Theology, and a Demiourgos sitting <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> the world, and exhibiting &#x201C;marks of design&#x201D; is as deplorable to me as it is to you.

And so I live in a kind of Christian <hi rend="italic">Islam</hi> (which signifies &#x201C;submission to God&#x201D;), and say at all turns of Fortune, &#x201C;God is great&#x201D; and also &#x201C;God is good,&#x201D;and know not aught else that I could say.

<ps><p>Poor Cavaignac! there is a kind of gloomy Satanic strength in him; but he is possessed with &#x201C;revolution&#x201D;; the curse of Ezechiel has fallen upon him: he is &#x201C;made like unto a <hi rend="italic">wheel</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ezek. 1:15&#x2013;21; 10:10&#x2013;13. It is interesting to contrast Carlyle&#x2019;s interpretation of Ezekiel&#x2019;s wheels with that of Coleridge as he describes one of the functions of the Imagination: &#x201C;The histories and political economy of the present and preceding century partake in the general contagion of its mechanic philosophy, and are the <hi rend="italic">product</hi> of an unenlivened generalizing Understanding. In the Scriptures they are the living <hi rend="italic">educts</hi> of the Imagination; of that reconciling and mediatory power, which incorporating the Reason in Images of the Sense, and organizing (as it were) the flux of the Senses by the permanence and self-circling energies of the Reason, gives birth to a system of symbols, harmonious in themselves, and consubstantial with the truths, of which they are the <hi rend="italic">conductors</hi>. These are the Wheels which Ezekiel beheld, when the hand of the Lord was upon him, and he saw visions of God as he sate among the captives by the river of Chebar. <hi rend="italic">Whithersoever the Spirit was to go, the wheels went, and thither was their spirit to go: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels also.&#x201D; The Statesman&#x2019;s Manual, Lay Sermons,</hi> ed.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is exactly four weeks since I wrote to you; and three since I received your last Letter: perhaps it had been more in the order of time to wait till next Tuesday; but as I may be busier then, and had rather be too soon than too late, I set about it now while nothing hinders me. As I conjecture, there are few occurrences in your Roman Month that bring more pleasure than news from home: let me be careful then to furnish you as regularly as I can.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-75" n="07-75"/>On Wednesday gone a fortnight (two weeks since, all but a day) I drove down to Dumfries, by appointment, to fetch up our Mother, who had been waiting at Jean&#x2019;s there for several days: she had come up so far with Austin and Mary, who were at Carstammon with a Cart; and on that day of my journey had set out again for home, glad to seize a tolerable day amid such weather. Passing the Post-Office, I alighted, and found, among other things, your Letter! Our Mother was waiting for me, and Mary sat there warming her children&#x2019;s feet, Jean moving hither and thither, as Mistress; and so when they asked, &#x201C;Any word from the Doctor?&#x201D; I was enabled to answer cheerily, Yes; and to &#x201C;run it over&#x201D; for them, to universal satisfaction. My Mother and I got home betimes; found Archy Glen and William, the former of whom went off on the following Sunday, and left us a little more composure. My Mother was wonderfully cheerful and composed; seemingly in no worse health of body or of mind, but rather in better than when you parted with her. She read various things, <hi rend="italic">Campan&#x2019;s Memoirs,</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331028-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-10-28">28 Oct. 1833</date></ref>.</note> and such like, with great interest; sewed a little, smoked and talked, and on the whole was very tolerably off. Her calmness in the midst of so many vicissitudes, and now while her immediate future is still so problematical, was very gratifying to me; shewed the admirable spirit she is of. It is one of the saddest possibilities now that lies before me, the losing of such a parent. One thing with another, and altogether apart from natural affection, I have seen no woman in the whole world, whom I would have preferred as a Mother.&#x2014; On the following Sunday, Alick and Jamie both arrived; so that again we had a full house. They staid till Wednesday morning, when I accompanied them as far as Stroquhan: it had been arranged that Alick was to come next Saturday to Dumfries, and meet our Mother there, if the day was tolerable. She and I accordingly set off; met Alick there, who had his Cart (having preferred that to taking on the Gig), and stood ready to set off with our Mother and Jean (on a week&#x2019;s visit), when I reyoked poor Harry and turned back again to the solitude of my moors. Our Mother was wrapped to all lengths; and having the wind favourable I hope would not suffer much from cold. It is the dismallest weather with rain and wind any mortal ever saw; there has not been so much disaster from the elements for many long years: shipwrecks on all coasts (steamboats at Liverpool driven over the very piers), trees uprooted, streets covered with canns and blown slates; not two dry days together, almost since we can remember. <pb id="pg-07-76" n="07-76"/>Half of the big Tree at Sundaywell is rent down, and lies across the road the very image of <foreign><hi rend="italic">strages</hi></foreign> [slaughter (archaic)]. One of the cope-stones (a considerable flag) of our kitchen chimney was blown <hi rend="italic">up;</hi> yet not <hi rend="italic">off,</hi> and down thro&#x2019; the roof as it must have gone; but is turned very handsomely <hi rend="italic">over on the other,</hi> and lies there precarious-looking, and may lie till Spring come. This however is nearly all our damage.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Caledonian Mercury</hi> (<date when="1833-12-02">2 Dec.</date>) reported that on <date when="1833-11-28">28</date> and <date when="1833-11-29">29 Nov.</date> a high tide and gale at Liverpool brought &#x201C;water dashing over the pier-heads with alarming fury&#x201D; etc.</note></p>
<p>Alick looked well almost florid in health, as &#x201C;well-mounted,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, <hi rend="italic">Tam o&#x2019; Shanter,</hi> l. 79.</note> a sufficient-looking little fellow, but almost more grim and belligerent than ever. We must all take our Destiny, and let it mar us&#x2014;only as little as we can. [A line has been obliterated here.] Did I tell you that he had got another son, and named it after me? To Jamie and him I had again to &#x201C;run over&#x201D; your Letter. Jamie&#x2019;s marriage is still understood to be fixed upon; and no prayer for the present were more natural for us than that &#x201C;the swine might run thro&#x2019; it.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial, &#x201C;The Swine&#x2019;s gone through it,&#x201D; spoken when an intended marriage is called off, out of a superstitious conceit that if a swine come between a man and his mistress they will never be married (Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs,</hi> 330).</note> Perhaps for him it were an unfriendly prayer; so we do not openly utter it. But the Austins can get no place this year, have now very little chance or even hope of getting one. They offered for various farms, but in vain; are now again on treaty for <hi rend="italic">Howcleugh</hi>;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a farm, which no longer exists, probably in St. Mungo parish, Dumfriesshire.</note> but none expects that it will be successful. Tho&#x2019; this is one of the worst farming years, Cattle so dear, grain so hopelessly cheap, there never were so many candidates for farms. What the Austins will determine on, if not to continue another year at Scotsbrig, is still quite uncertain. Jamie presses my Mother to retain the two upper rooms at Scotsbrig, and live if not with him, yet under the same roof with him. An arrangement which none of us approve of, except perhaps as a <hi rend="italic">bad best</hi>. A month or two must now decide. Our Mother says, she knows <hi rend="italic">who</hi> will provide her a home while she shall need one; and so remains quite quiet and patient. I spoke of building her a house here; and she was gratified at the offer: but my own uncertainity of continuance, the foreign neighbourhood, and its loneliness and dulness, render this a hazardous speculation. We shall struggle to do the best possible.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-77" n="07-77"/>As for our own household, it is much as you can fancy it. Jane continues in a tolerable an<supplied>[d]</supplied> improving state of health, tho&#x2019; the last five weeks of bustle have done her no good: I when I take walking enough get along as I was wont in that particular. Continual sickness is a miserable thing; yet one learns to bear it: I could even fancy situations in which I might get rid of it; but such are not likely to fall in my way. Our new Servant is Grace Cavens, whom you remember at Alick&#x2019;s, a thoroughly honest woman, but with hardly any other quality; the slowest, most sensitive, most inexpert of women: nevertheless she struggles on, almost as well as the others used to do, and has that great quality over and above. Rob Austin brings our Letters; or, when the Macadams go, and Letters only are wanted, works in the outdoor premises on Wednesdays. Glen is just gone to Peter Austin&#x2019;s since I began this paragraph; Jane accompanying him. We were to have both gone down with him last night, and (with Tea) warmed the house for him: but it was a deluge of rain, and none of us stirred out. Archy Glen has sent down a Carpet and bed-mattress, with various <foreign>etceteras</foreign>; and now it is really quite a respectable little apartment; where the poor fellow may wait what Providence has decided for him. We can yet form no <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> prophecy about him; our experience of such things is so limited. He has the two states: one a most quiet, almost languid state, like a kind of collapse; with an appearance of consciousness that delusion is in him, an apprehension to commit himself by speaking; his answers are perfectly sane, even judicious and intelligent; but he originates nothing, or next to nothing; sits silent or reads in an inattentive wandering manner. His second state is one of much more energy, when his crotchets get the force of beliefs in him; and he will utter, and even maintain them, tho&#x2019; with a singular tolerance of contradiction, and with <hi rend="italic">arguments</hi> of such a sort for feebleness as you never heard man utter. Mostly however, with me, even in these states, he draws back again; says he cannot discuss such things at present till he &#x201C;get sentience.&#x201D; These varieties I have found depend altogether almost on the <hi rend="italic">state of the digestive organs</hi>. It is here that you could be of the best service; but I with my utmost care can do too little. He has some bad colocynth pills, and needs to be driven to take them: I am by no means sure that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> are the best kind, that they are not the very worst. On the whole nothing ever was gentler, more grateful, kindlier, one would say sounder, that the <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> of the poor man; it is only the intellect (one of the <hi rend="italic">worst trained</hi> ever seen) that ever his bodily disease can act on. Meanwhile he has <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> (and in the most irrefragable manner) the <pb id="pg-07-78" n="07-78"/>first twenty Propositions of Leslie<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir John Leslie, <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>): it was in the third edition (<date when="1817-00-00">1817</date>) that Leslie had referred to &#x201C;Mr. Thomas Carlyle, an ingenious young mathematician, formerly my pupil&#x201D; (p. 340).</note> with me; we are to begin Homer tomorrow night: Our hope as before is in his goodness, his youth, and the influence of Time. He speaks of writing to you, and perhaps will do it: we need not hinder him. He <hi rend="italic">walks</hi> much.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu&#x2019;s letter to Jane of <date when="1834-02-25">25 Feb.</date> warned her of the dangers of attempting to take care of a mental patient like William Glen: &#x201C;Do not I entreat you trust him too far. Think of Miss Lamb, the good and kind and gentle creature who would not harm the least insect, yet she stabbed her Mother without the least apparent provocation&#x2014; If the notion should ever possess him that Carlisle&#x2019;s death would set you at liberty to give him your hand, his life is not safe for an hour. Long before the calamity came Dr. Allen foresaw it and warned me of it&#x2014;be cautious dear friends. A physician was shot a few weeks since by a patient who appeared quite convalescent.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>But now, my dear Brother, I have a very mournful piece of news for you; tho&#x2019; hardly an unexpected one. On Saturday came a Letter from Tom Holcroft;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> wherein quite incidentally, as if speaking of a thing known, he mentions that poor Badams died in <date when="1833-09-00">September</date>! How this affected and affects me you may figure. A deep Tragedy, transacted before one&#x2019;s eyes, you might say in one&#x2019;s very household circle; for Badams was among the men I loved most in the world<supplied>[.]</supplied> Poor fellow! With such endowments too, with such worth; but the Spirit of the world, its distractions and its persecutions were too hard for him. The Montagues may now hold their rabid tongues, or give them full range: it is all one to him; his ear is forever shut, his heart is forever still. I reckon that his foolish marriage had a great hand in it too, tho&#x2019; the poor widow is not to blame, for being naturally a fool. It is all over now. I have written to Holcroft to tell me at least where he lies buried; whether his Father and Mother still live. Jane speaks of trying if a Letter will find Bessy Barnet<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> (whom we love for his sake and her own), and whether, if she stand desolate and destitute, she could not in some way be attached to us. I counsel writing at any rate. You shall hear what we learn. Holcroft it seems was seized with a brain-fever before you left town, and often called for you in his delirium, which lasted three weeks. What will become of poor Tom seems also very problematical.</p>
<p>Environed as I have been ever since you last heard of me, I could naturally do no work, only wait for a better time. The house within this half hour is clear for the first time these five weeks. Within the last <pb id="pg-07-79" n="07-79"/>few days, I have made a proposal for a Public Office, and been rejected! There is to be an Astronomical Professor and Observer in Edinburgh, and no man of the smallest likelihood to fill it:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1834-01-01">1 Jan. 1834</date>) reported that &#xa3;300 p.a. was to be given to the principal observer of the Calton Hill observatory, who was also to fill the vacancy in the University&#x2019;s chair of practical astronomy, the appointment to lie with the crown, which provided for the salary. This brought it within Jeffrey&#x2019;s sphere as Lord Advocate. Already the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-12-18">18 Dec.</date>) had pressed for &#x201C;an enthusiast in practical astronomy,&#x201D; with &#x201C;a perfect knowledge of the more recondite principles of astronomy, and skill and facility of calculation.&#x201D;</note> I thought what an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> kind of work it was; how honestly I could work at it for my bread, and harmonize it with what tended infinitely higher than bread; and so wrote to the poor Advocate with great heartiness telling him all this. He answers me by return of Post in a kind of polite Fishwoman-shriek; adds that my doctrines (in Literature) are &#x201C;arrogant, antinational, absurd,&#x201D; and to crown the whole &#x201C;inconclusive&#x201D;; that the place withal is for an old secretary of his<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Henderson (<date when="1798-00-00">1798</date>&#x2013;<date when="1844-00-00">1844</date>). He had been secretary to the Earl of Lauderdale and Lord Jeffrey (<date when="1819-00-00">1819</date>&#x2013;<date when="1831-00-00">31</date>); but he had not only been a knowledgeable amateur astronomer but also became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (<date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>) and Royal Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope (<date when="1832-04-00">April 1832</date> to <date when="1833-05-00">May 1833</date>). The <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> (<date when="1833-12-18">18 Dec.</date>) had already noted him as a likely candidate on his merits. Jeffrey told Carlyle that the appointment was to be left to the experts, but Carlyle was offended when it went to Henderson. His accusations of favoritism (in his letters and <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>) were unjustified, for though his interest in astronomy and his mathematical attainments would have been sufficient for the post, he would have received it only if Jeffrey had supported <hi rend="italic">him</hi> on personal grounds.</note> (who has not applied to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>), unless I can convince the Electors that I am fitter;&#x2014;which I have not the faintest disposition to do. I have written back to the poor body, suppressing all indignation, if there were any; diffusing over all, the balm of pity; and so in a handsome manner terminate the business. One has ever and anon a kind of desire to &#x201C;wash away&#x201D; this Correspondent of ours; yet really it were not right: I can see him, even in this Letter, to be very thoroughly miserable, and am bound to help him, not aggravate him. His censures too have something flattering even in their violence otherwise impertinent enough: he cannot tolerate me, but also he cannot despise me, and that is the sole misery. On the whole, dear Jack, I feel it very wholesome to have my vanity humbled from time to time: would it were rooted out forever and a day! My Mother said, when I showed her the purport of the Letter, &#x201C;He canna hinder thee of God&#x2019;s Providence,&#x201D;&#x2014;which also was a glorious truth.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 110.</note> Gordon writes me that old Rhetoric <pb id="pg-07-80" n="07-80"/>Andrew<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dr. Andrew Brown (<date when="1763-00-00">1763</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), minister of Old St. Giles (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>), appointed to chair of rhetoric and belles lettres (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>); he was to die on <date when="1834-02-19">19 February</date>.

<p>What you say of Periodicals is mournfully true;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his letter of <date when="1833-12-14">14 Dec.</date> John had said: &#x201C;A larger arena may be given when we are more prepared for it. Our foundation must be laid on the present&#x2014; One thing in regard to your circumstances might require serious consideration. Would it not be wiser to have nothing to do with Reviews &#x26; Magazines for some time to come? to collect yourself for something higher &#x26; better? Article writing leads to nothing except supplying the wants of the passing day. You can have no sympathy with the people that are engaged in the same occupation; they are all more or less corrupt hirelings whom honest men shun. It is not necessary for you to have any thing to do with them at least for some time to come. You are not in immediate want of money, &#x26; while I have any you shall not be without it. Do think of this and see whether it would not be better to devote your energies to something else. It is my most constant wish that you may soon be freed from such occupation.&#x201D;</note> yet it is true also that a man must provide food and clothes for himself as long as he honestly can. While you write down a Truth, you do an honest duty, were the Devil himself your Editor, and all fellow contributors mere &#x201C;Incubi and Foul Creatures.&#x201D;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> One loses repute by it, but nothing more; and must front that loss for a gain that is indispensable. Indeed, had I the best Book possible for me, I see not, such is the condition of things, when I could so much as get it printed. <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> money, my dear Boy, I will not take at this time, till you are settled with it, and making more. Come home, and let us settle in London together, and front the world together; and see whether it can beat us! Let it try it. And in the mean while never fear but I hold on; now as ever it lies with <hi rend="italic">myself</hi>.</p>
<p>Mill tells me that he and Buller and a number of Radicals with money capital, and what they reckon talent, have determined on a new Radical Review, which they want me to write in. Unitarian Fox<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >W. J. Fox. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321016-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-10-16">16 Oct. 1832</date></ref>. Mill himself became editor, though he would have liked Fox to have had the appointment (see Mineka, XII, 202).</note> is to be the Editor. I calculate that it may last three years at any rate, for money is found to that length:<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi> ran from <date when="1835-04-00">April 1835</date> to <date when="1836-01-00">Jan. 1836</date>, when it was merged with the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> under the title <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>.</note> if they pay me rightly, they shall have a Paper or two; if not, not. The Radicals, I say always, are barren <pb id="pg-07-81" n="07-81"/>as Sahara; but <hi rend="italic">not</hi> poisonous: in my Prophecy of the World, they are my <foreign><hi rend="italic">enfans perdus</hi></foreign> [lost children], whom I honestly wish well to.&#x2014; James Fraser writes me that Teufelsdreck meets with the most unqualified disapproval; which is all extremely proper. His payment arrives, which is still more proper. On the whole, dear Jack, it is contending world, and he that is born into it must fight for his place or lose it.

Pity that <supplied>[there]</supplied> are so few rational English! But speak to your Germans, to native Romans, to whosoever has a reasonable response to give. We hope your Books are now come, and your plans more fixed: so long as there is work among your hands, no fear of you; &#x26; a man in all places can <hi rend="italic">find</hi> work.&#x2014; Tell us more and more minutely how you get on.&#x2014; I did drink your health, tho&#x2019; not on Newyears-day (for that was the day I went for my Mother, and so <hi rend="italic">got</hi> no dinner); but next day here, mindful of my duty. Have you begun to any study of Artistics? Or do you find it a pursuit too unproductive for you? My own impression is that the Cant in it is great; but also that there is a Reality in it, tho&#x2019; of smaller magnitude. &#x201C;Keep your <hi rend="italic">eyes open</hi>, do <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi> whatsoever your hand findeth to do.&#x201D; Blessings with you my dear Brother!</p>

<p>Mrs Welsh is still in Liverpool; but now heartily tired of it, and urgent to get home. She has some kind of talk about going by Scotsbrig; in which case I must be there to meet her.</p>
<p>Jane sends this message, when I ask if she has aught to say: &#x201C;My kindest affection to him; that I have a headache, and that everything is said.&#x201D;&#x2014; What trust can you put in women?

<p><salute>Many thanks, my Dear Mrs Austin,</salute> for your kind messages and memorials: two Notes,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> thro&#x2019; the Advocate; then the dainty little Book,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Her translation of F. W. Carov&#xE9;, <hi rend="italic">The Story Without an End</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>).</note> with another Note; all of which have now arrived safe, the last only this day week. It is an <foreign><hi rend="italic">allerliebstes B&#xfc;chlein</hi></foreign> [a most delightful little book], graceful in spirit as in embodyment [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and decoration; and we all participate in Lucy&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Austin&#x2019;s daughter, to whom the book was dedicated, Lucy or Lucie (<date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">69</date>), who married Sir Alexander Cornewall Duff-Gordon in <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date> and who became a traveller, translator, author, and center of a literary circle. Her daughter Janet Anne Duff-Gordon Ross (<date when="1842-00-00">1842</date>&#x2013;<date when="1927-00-00">1927</date>), traveller, journalist, and author, was the original of Rose Jocelyn in Meredith&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Evan Harrington</hi>.</note> love of it; but fancy there will be children enough (of six feet high, and lower statures) in this &#x201C;envy of surrounding nations&#x201D; to ask: What does it prove, then? If I can do it any good, be sure I conscienciously shall: meanwhile my relation to Able Editors is of the loosest, my power and vote with any of them, I doubt, will go for little. The best is that it hardly makes any difference: I have learned lately, by various cheering symptoms, that British Reviewing had as good as died a natural death, and the Lie lied itself out; that the most harmonious diapason from the united throat of universal British Criticism would hardly pay its own expenses. Rejoice, my dear Friend, that you can now sit apart from that <pb id="pg-07-83" n="07-83"/>distracted gulph of abominations; and pray for those that must still swim for their life there.</p>
<p>We learned long ago thro Mill with the truest satisfaction what turn affairs had taken with you; that the Labourer, at length, was found worthy at least of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> hire.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 10:7. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330924-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-09-24">24 Sept. 1833</date></ref>: in fact, Austin was to resign from the Law Commission, and a course of lectures he had been asked to give for the society of the Inner Temple was a failure (see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330910-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-09-10">10 Sept. 1833</date></ref>).</note> The greater is now our regret and apprehension when Jeffrey informs us that Mr A&#x2019;s health again threatens to fail. Was ever anything so miserable! Let us hope far otherwise still: <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, I declare, were really too grievous.</p>
<p>Your own health too, it seems, is bad; you have to complain of dispiritment, now when you have still need of all your strength. &#x201C;Rise, noble Talbot; this is not a time to faint and sink: force faltering Nature by your strength of soul&#x201D; &#x26;c<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Lionel&#x2019;s speech in Schiller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Die Jungfrau von Orleans</hi>, III, vi.

John Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury (<date when="1388-00-00">1388</date>?&#x2013;<date when="1453-00-00">1453</date>), who also figures in Shakespeare&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">I Henry VI</hi>, fought bravely against the French in the Hundred Years&#x2019; War. His name was such a terror in France that mothers stilled their children with it.</note>&#x2014; Alas, it is so much easier said than done; and yet in Life one must often try to do it. For on the whole, my dear Heroine, there is no Rest for us in this world, which subsists by Toil. &#x201C;Rest?&#x201D; said the stern old Arnauld, &#x201C;shall I not have all Eternity to rest in?&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Antoine Arnauld (<date when="1612-00-00">1612</date>&#x2013;<date when="1694-00-00">94</date>), French philosopher and Jansenist theologian (the Port Royal School) made the famous reply when his friend Pierre Nicole complained of being tired of his life of controversy with Jesuits, Calvinists, and other opponents&#x201D; (Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor,</hi> p. 90).</note></p>
<p>You speak playfully of coming hither to see us. Would it were in earnest! I think there were few faces welcomer here to all parties interested. If the Sun were north again, and the days bright, what if you should actually put it in practice! I do not think you ever in your Life saw such a Solitude as this: the everlasting skies and the everlasting moors; the hum of the world all mute as Death, so distant is it,&#x2014;till Wednesday night arrive, and the Letters and Newspapers; and we find it is all going on as distractedly as ever. Come and see it and try it.</p>
<p>As for myself, I think I have arrived at a kind of pause in my History, so singular is the course of things without me and within me. I have written very little for a year; less than for any of the last seven. I stand as if earnestly looking out, in the most labyrinthic country, till I catch the right track again. A kind of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Enfant Perdu</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-07-84" n="07-84"/>[lost child], I believe, at any rate; yet who would so fain <hi rend="italic">not</hi> perish and leave the breach unwon! We shall do our best. Meanwhile (for that too is needful):</p>
<lg><l><foreign>Ehe wir nun weiter schreiten,</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Halte still und seh&#x2019; Dich um;</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Denn geschw&#xE4;tzig sind die Zeiten,</foreign></l>
<l><foreign>Und sie sind auch wieder Stumm</foreign>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">Goethes Werke</hi> (Weimar, <date when="1891-00-00">1891</date>), IV, 19. Carlyle quotes the first of three stanzas of no. 18 (&#x201C;Ottilien von Goethe&#x201D;) of Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Inschriften, Denkund Sende-Bl&#xE4;tter</hi>. The poem formed the dedication to <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre</hi>. A literal translation would run as follows: &#x201C;Before we go further, / Stop still and look round you; / For noisy are the times, / And they are quiet again.&#x201D; Goethe&#x2019;s only punctuation is a colon at the end of the second line and a period at the end of the stanza.</note></l></lg>
<p>And so if I live long, you may hear <supplied>[from me fur]</supplied>ther&#x2014;for better or worse. I have a kind of thought that <supplied>[I shall?]</supplied> come and see London again; but when? Perhaps the sooner the better. In the mean time I read, in the most omnivorous way; am a stranger to that wretchedest state, emptiness of head. I still believe too that it is only <hi rend="italic">want of Faith;</hi> our own wretched vanity, voracity, and general meanness of mind. One whose visage was more marred than that of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man; to whom <hi rend="italic">our</hi> worst state were a throne and couch of down,&#x2014;did not he say, &#x201C;I have <hi rend="italic">overcome</hi> the world&#x201D;?<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>The Advocate writes of you in the highest terms of commendation:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Austin is not mentioned in Jeffrey&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1834-01-14">14 Jan.</date> but, according to Wilson, is discussed in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1833-08-14">14 Aug. 1833</date> (<hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, II, 314).</note> pray be good to him; for I doubt he is but miserable, tho&#x2019; called lord, lord. My best hope of him is that he will quit that wretched cockpit (with its fighting for pure fightings sake) before it <hi rend="italic">kill</hi> him.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Did you get safe home that freezing night? I regretted more than once that Alick had not taken the Gig (tho&#x2019; it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> troublesome); and could not but fancy when I was in Glenessland that you might still be on the wrong side of Lochmaben. However, the wind was in your favour, and the weather dry: so I hope you managed tolerably, one way or other.</p>
<p>Glen and Jane were waiting for me; and all right. I thought it strange that I did not see you there too; and had to recollect that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was over for the present time. Nay for two or three days this feeling hung about me; especially when I happened to take to dozing after dinner: but I did not let it sadden me; I reflected rather what a happiness it was that you had actually been here, that you were still spared to me, and within reach of me. Turning to the &#x201C;bright side of my cloud,&#x201D; I took to reflecting that it might not be long till we met again. Your last visit, with strangers and so forth, was much marred: but we hope to do better another time.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Quoted by Carlyle as a saying of Frederick the Great. See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:288</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> If the days were once rightly lengthened we must have you up again: if I had a better horse, it were quite a simple matter at any time.</p>
<p>I wrote a long, minute Letter to Jack, for the following Wednesday; told him all about you; how uncertain you still were about your future arrangements; yet how quiet and composed; explained our various plans; assured him, what I hope he knew that we would leave no stone unturned to do the best possible&#x2014; I think he will write to you, perhaps within a three weeks or fortnight: he will have my Letter (the last one) sometime next week.</p>
<p>I also wrote to poor Jeffrey; but not till any anger I felt had gone off, and given place to a kind of pity. &#x201C;Poor fellow!&#x201D; I thought, &#x201C;what a miserable <hi rend="italic">fuff</hi> [huff] thou gettest into; poor old, exasperated Politician! I will positively have pity on thee, and do thee a little good, if <pb id="pg-07-86" n="07-86"/>I can!&#x201D; In this spirit was my Letter written; a short careless Letter, winding up the business handsomely, not ravelling it farther. He is off to London today, I fancy; to worry and be worried, in that Den of Discord and Dishonesty; actually, I doubt, to lose his last allottment [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of Health, almost his Life, if he be not soon delivered. &#x201C;He cannot hinder thee of God&#x2019;s Providence&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> is also a most precious truth: not he nor the whole world with the Devil to back it out! <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is a fact one ought to lay seriously to heart, and see into the meaning of. Did we see it rightly, what were there beneath the Moon that should throw us into commotion?</p>
<p>Except writing these and some other Letters, I have not put pen to paper yet. I sent word to Mill that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> write two Essays for his new Periodical; the second of which is perhaps to be on <hi rend="italic">John Knox:</hi> but I suppose there is no great hurry in the business, but various points to adjust yet; so perhaps I may not start after all till I hear again. But this depends on what supply of Books I get; for with Books I can as profitably employ myself as with anything, in the present state of trade. I have read very diligently since you left us; read on various subjects, in various tongues, even Greek&#x2014;with Glen. I feel myself busy, and am not discontented: any discontent I have turns generally (I have observed) to some new benefit, if I manage it wisely.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh has not written yet: we expect to hear tomorrow when she is coming. I think it very unlikely that she will come by sea in this weather; therefore Scotsbrig will lie quite out of her road. You shall hear <hi rend="italic">timeously</hi> [in good time] how it goes. Jane speaks of moving over to Templand to warm the house for her: in that case, I think I shall move still farther over to Annandale till they get matters settled; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> will probably be the way of my first visit. I am very anxious that <supplied>[there]</supplied> were some settlement about what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> are to do; and ere long the hope of Austin&#x2019;s getting a farm will be decided on for this year; so we shall then see it all before us. Fear nothing, my dear Mother; we are all here, and should and will all throw ourselves between you and any hardship. Children, it is said, are the Bank into which parents put their young industry, to be repaid in old age: shame on us if we prove a failure!</p>
<p>Glen&#x2019;s things all came on Wednesday as expected; but we did not let him go till the following Tuesday. He has now been there a week; and declares himself to be &#x201C;very comfortable.&#x201D; His room, with <pb id="pg-07-87" n="07-87"/>its carpet and all <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, really looks very snug and well; the Austins like him very well and he them. He comes up to us every night at seven o&#x2019;clock with a Lesson of Mathematics, which he has learned thro&#x2019; the <supplied>[torn: day]</supplied> and after going thro&#x2019; this we read some Greek together. This with walking far and wide, when the weather will allow, or reading and smoking when it will not,&#x2014;fills up his time. One can trace no difference in him from week to week; hardly from month to month. But I have still the strongest hope that he is to be delivered from that heavy burden.&#x2014; The Greek part of our Lesson is very useful to me: I have been purposing to read this Book we are upon (Homer&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi>) for the last thirteen years, and never could fairly set about it, <hi rend="italic">for want of company</hi>.</p>
<p>Of news there is only this one despicable particular that I think of: Nancy our unworthy sootdrop of a servant is married, or just about it, to an aged Butcher in Thornhill, a drunken man, with a grown up family. It is strongly surmised that she may <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> it ere long, by a kind of <hi rend="italic">Into-the-bargain</hi>. The wretched mass of Falsehood, Ugliness and Incontinence, to finish all by a double and threefold Falsehood of <hi rend="italic">this</hi> sort!&#x2014; Harry is in great heart, Grace says; &#x201C;can hardly be got to the water for fling up his heels&#x201D;! There is a far cleanlier piece of news.</p>
<p>But now, my Dear Mother, I must finish. I have told Rob to let Jean, if she like, open the Parcel, should she have any word of her own: but perhaps Rob will hardly understand me, for it is Grace that has to tell him. Jean&#x2019;s account of the money was all right; and the whole mistake was mine. I hope she will send me some tidings about Howcleugh;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The farm which Mary and James Austin were trying to get.

<p>I will send you some kind of token if I am coming soon. Probably to Alick also; for he will see me first, if the Thornhill way of it take effect.&#x2014; Jane has gone to bed: she complains of her head today, and has done for a week, ever since the house became clear.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>William himself wrote to you last week, with I know not what coherence or minuteness of detail: it was the last thing he did before entering on his new way of life. I intended to bid him say that you should hear from me by next opportunity, or even to mark as much on the outside of his Letter; but, by accident, both purposes failed; and so today I am perhaps <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than your expectation.</p>
<p>Tho&#x2019; your Glasgow packages all arrived, in best order, and perfect suitableness, on Wednesday night, and we were all down next day to see them laid out, it seemed fittest that W. should not remove till Monday Evening, as perhaps in his new quarters the Sunday might hang heavier than another day on his hands. We were all to walk down with him, and have tea there, and &#x201C;heat the house.&#x201D; An arrangement which seemed to gratify him; tho&#x2019; he had been getting himself in order for shifting even on the Thursday morning. However, Monday proved as wet as possible; so there was no stirring; till on Tuesday about the usual time for walking, Mrs C. set forth with him (I being busy), and took possession. He looked sad as he took leave of me, but strove to look cheerful: the <hi rend="italic">Pipe-box</hi> was not to be opened till night, when I was to come, and &#x201C;do it in a solemn manner.&#x201D; Which I did; and found him all adjusted, and really looking quite comfortable. Peter has put on &#x201C;the Door&#x201D; he talked of; there is a new cast-iron grate with all appurtenances; the Carpet, which fitted completely, was pronounced to be of the best possible pattern; the Bookshelves with Books were hung opposite the fire-place; a green cover on the table: all was right, and looked surprisingly snug. William and we had, as far as might be, arranged the order of his hours and proceedings at Carstammon; for he has a most happy tendency towards order in all things; he was to be called at eight o&#x2019;clock; to take a walk, on all fair mornings, before breakfast; to learn so many Propositions &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Since then we have seen him every night, precisely with the stroke of seven; which was the hour agreed on. He brings his Propositions in his head (much more accurately than he once did); demonstrates them, in spite of my impugning, which he bears always with the old <pb id="pg-07-89" n="07-89"/>patience: then we read duly a piece of Homer together; wherein I am less the Teacher than the Taught, for I find him distinctly deeper in Greek than I. Thro&#x2019; the day he walks; extensively when the weather will permit; has been at the top of Bogray Craig<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bogrie, hill and old baronial fortalice north of Dunscore parish; during the persecutions it frequently gave refuge to Covenanters.</note> &#x26;c: looks in Books, hardly <hi rend="italic">reading</hi> much; learns these lessons of his; and doubtless looks forward to seven o&#x2019;clock as the summit of the whole day. We have generally finished our lessons at nine: then the lady plays to him, some half hour; and he is home before ten. This is the course of one Day; and you may fancy it with only slight variations, as the pattern of all Days. Only on Sunday nights he is to come and have tea with us; and let us have, instead of Geometry, a little &#x201C;profitable talk.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Judging by this week&#x2019;s experience, all seems to get along quite tolerably. Mrs C. went down yesterday to ascertain as far as might be, whether household matters of bed and board were on a right footing; and had reason to report very favourably on that head. The Austins on their side speak very kindly of poor William: &#x201C;he gives them no trouble&#x201D;; &#x201C;is a real clever mannerly man, it is a great pity o&#x2019; him&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c<supplied>[.]</supplied> William himself at all times answers like one well satisfied with his accommodation every way &#x201C;for the present&#x201D;; tells us how snug his little room is; how he can wait better there than anywhere &#x201C;till his time come.&#x201D; One night, but that was before shifting, he told me with great earnestness, it was the most blessed month this, for quiet and peace, he had spent for long long.</p>
<p>With regard to his general state of intellect and prospects of cure, I think it were rash to say more than we used to do when you were here; neither on the other hand have I seen any cause to say less. His cure at best must be very gradual, I have always thought; if from month to month one can trace <hi rend="italic">any</hi> improvement, it will be much. I on the whole retain <hi rend="italic">all</hi> my old hopes. Certainly William is not worse than when you saw him; I flatter myself in general that he grows a little better; but his variations from day to day make one&#x2019;s persuasions vary, and one cannot <hi rend="italic">affirm</hi> it. In the evenings he often looks <hi rend="italic">much</hi> wiser with us; but then we believe that to be considerably the best of him. His Regalities and Conquests,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As Carlyle explained later (<ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July</date></ref>), Glen identified himself with Napoleon or Louis Philippe.</note> I think, have turned up only twice or so, since you left us; the last time on Sunday night: but even in these relapses I imagine I discern an improvement of character: they are briefer; the illusion hovers farther in the distance; he is less confident <pb id="pg-07-90" n="07-90"/>of it; feels you would say almost ashamed that he has spoken of it; and in a little while will talk in the most reasonable, even judicious way (so far an <hi rend="italic">answering</hi> goes), for the fit generally lasts but a few minutes. He feels too for most part, and often plaintively admits or asserts that &#x201C;sentience&#x201D; is not come yet: he said to me one night as I convoyed him home: <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;haeret lateri lethalis arundo&#x201D;</hi></foreign> (the arrow sticking in his side)<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, IV, 73.</note> &#x201C;twenty months of it, sir: O, it&#x2019;s too much for any one man.&#x201D; These are but moments, however; his general temper is good, indeed excellent; the same Patience and Firmness we used to see in him; of which also his looks are very expressive.</p>
<p>Finally I have long since discovered that his state of body is above all other things influential on him: so much so that one might almost say his Disorder was of a bodily sort. In this particular I have some difficulty with him; for he himself makes no <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi> of taking pills: however he will do whatever I desire him to do; and confess most truthfully if he have forgotten at any time. I think too he is perhaps becoming a little more sensible of the importance of that humble duty; which, at any rate, country air (if the weather were mended) and abundant exercise, one may hope, will more and more supersede&#x2014;</p>
<p>Such my dear Sir is the faithfullest picture I can give you, in this hurry. I hope earnestly you will find a distinct improvement, when you see us in <date when="1834-04-00">April</date>: at all events, I do not see where in the world poor William could have a better chance than [phrase cut away] &#x2026; <hi rend="italic">goodness</hi> of his disposition; on his youth, and the intrinsically <hi rend="italic">slight</hi> nature of all that is wrong with him.&#x2014; Throughout this Letter I have striven to write decidedly <hi rend="italic">below</hi> my persuasion, not above it. Still hope then that it will all be as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> wish it; believe in any case that it is <hi rend="italic">for the best</hi>.&#x2014; By and by I will send you another Despatch; I will write <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> if anything go wrong. We got your two Newspapers; welcome tokens of you: William seemed quite charmed with your Letter; he had watched the whole afternoon for our Postboy. He desired me yesternight to assure you he was very well. I think you had better write to him: all manner of news about yourself especially will interest him. Direct, care of me; or Carstammon near Craigenputtoch.</p>
<p>We fancy you getting briskly under way in your new line of Occupation; and prophecy all manner of good about you. My Mother went away a week ago; deeply interested in William; as were my two Brothers, who also saw him here for a day or two: all of them charged me to write about him. Let us know how you get on; and be not <pb id="pg-07-91" n="07-91"/>discouraged if you find the road a little roughist [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] at first; remember, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the nature of all <hi rend="italic">new roads</hi>, travelling smooths them.</p>
<p>The Lady sends her kindest regards. Remember us kindly to Mr Lamond, whose Household with the fair (<hi rend="italic">headmost</hi>) Head of it we hope to know one day. Also to my old Friend Burgh Councillor Hope,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >David Hope; see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220323-TC-DH-01"><sic>2:71</sic><corr>TC to DH, <date when="1822-03-23">23 March 1822</date></corr></ref>.</note> whose Letter gave me real pleasure, both for his sake and <hi rend="italic">its</hi>.&#x2014; Great need of some Mary Dallas! Neither Moon nor Sun has been <hi rend="italic">in</hi>, for the last fortnight. <closer><salute>[Closing and signature cut away]</salute></closer></p>
<ps><p>[Overleaf:] William is here while I <hi rend="italic">seal</hi>; bids me say that he &#x201C;feels quite comfortable at Carstammon&#x201D;; &#x201C;shag and pipes all right.&#x201D;</p></ps>

<p>I am very glad to see (by Bassompierre) that you have Petitot&#x2019;s Collection of <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires;</hi> in which are many excellent things.

I have read a great portion of them within the last two years: but there are still several that I wish to see.

<p>What I want from you chiefly in the Book way, at this hour, if your goodness be not yet exhausted, is a Copy of <hi rend="italic">Heyne&#x2019;s Homer</hi>; the large one, I mean; for there are two.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Christian Gottlob Heyne (<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>&#x2013;<date when="1812-00-00">1812</date>), German classical philologist. The large Homer is probably <hi rend="italic">Homeri Carmina cum brevi annotatione</hi>, 8 vols. (Leipzig, <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>), vol. IX, Graefenham&#x2019;s indexes (<date when="1822-00-00">1822</date>). The other edition, <hi rend="italic">Homeri Ilias</hi>, 2 vols. (London, <date when="1804-00-00">1804</date>).</note> I have actually begun to peruse and study the old Singer in his own dialect; and in spite of all industry find difficulties enough. There is also an English Essay on Homer by <hi rend="italic">Blackwell</hi>, a Book about 60 or 70 years old, which I should like to see. Payne Knight, Price &#x26;c all on the same subject are likewise unknown to me, or nearly so.

<p>We have heard no whisper of Hunt these many months. Your notice of Hunt junior was news; for it seemed too possible something had got wrong.

<p>Carfrae&#x2019;s Catalogue<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Carfrae &#x26; Son, bookseller and auctioneer of literary property, 3 Drummond St., Edinburgh.</note> indicates a wealth in rare Literature, enough to make him one&#x2019;s envy.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am not coming just yet, as you shall hear: but I send you, what is about as good, a Letter from our Roman Doctor. He is as well as <pb id="pg-07-95" n="07-95"/>ever, and doing well; expects to pass the summer on <hi rend="italic">this</hi> side the Alps again, in Switzerland; which besides being the finest country to look upon in the whole Earth, is some seven or eight hundred miles <hi rend="italic">nearer</hi> us than Rome, and has a good honest German people that I like far better than the Romans.</p>
<p>Jean told us with consummate brevity that you were no worse for the journey; this was so far good and best; but it is all I have heard. Some of them coming up next week to the Candlemas fair (is it not next week?)<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Candlemas is a Scottish quarter day, <date when="1834-02-02">2 Feb.</date>, and the fair was on the <date when="1834-02-19">19th</date>.</note> must bring me a Letter. I fear there is nothing in the farm way to be done this year; and I begin to feel very anxious about what should be resolved on. You may give Alick this Magazine (when you have read it), and say I shall very probably write him a Letter of some kind, next Wednesday: if he can throw any light on matters, in the meanwhile, let him write and do it.</p>
<p>Mrs Welsh <hi rend="italic">came</hi> home, by Coach, last Thursday;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1834-02-06">6 Feb.</date></note> so she will not be my excuse for coming down this time. We went over to Templand the night before to welcome her: she seemed most particularly glad to get home again, and sick, sick of the racket she had been living in. She had brought a marriage-present for Jean &#x26;c &#x26;c.</p>
<p>Nothing has happened here since I wrote; nothing but reading and rain. I got some new Books from Paris about the <hi rend="italic">Necklace:</hi> I find I have been wrong in some particulars, and must blot out and renew accordingly. This will occupy me more time than I wish: but there is nothing else pressing.&#x2014; Glen goes on quite handsomely; seldom or never troubles us with any <foreign><hi rend="italic">janners</hi></foreign> [foolish talk], indeed with very little <hi rend="italic">talk;</hi> but comes here with his Mathematics and his Greek, as if he were the wisest in the parish,&#x2014;which indeed in some respects, one might almost say he <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. He likes Carstammon perfectly well, and they profess themselves much attached to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. We confidently trust he will get well in time.</p>
<p>There have been new Letters from Jeffrey; but no increase of favour for him: indeed, no answer has been returned; and I see symptoms that there will be no hurry with one. He is no bad man, poor little fellow; and truly if one would think of it deserves pity and no harsher feeling.</p>
<p>When I will come? I cannot yet decide upon it; not, in any case, till I have got the weary <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi> a second time off my hands, a second and last time. Perhaps I shall be able to say something more definite when I write to Alick.&#x2014; Meanwhile, my dear Mother, keep <pb id="pg-07-96" n="07-96"/>yourself easy about me, as I strive to do about you. Fancy me as neither idle nor hurtfully busy; striving to do what I can of the Task given me, and with no deep personal care but for my Task. I am more content of late, I hope, than I was wont to be.&#x2014; Now, can you read this with the aid of your <hi rend="italic">Alphabet?</hi> I doubt it: but you will learn.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Good night! Good night, dear Mother! Be well when I come and till I come. Ever your affectionate Son,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>If you be at the Fair<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >At Dumfries.</note> tomorrow, you will get this Letter: if not, it will come upon you perhaps still more welcomely in the solitude of Catlinns. There is little in it save the assurance of my old brotherly regard; but that little I know is worth much. By my Mother&#x2019;s Letter, last week, you would hear of my purpose to write; also of my half-hope to hear from you tomorrow: if you have not written (which I think the more probable case), let this be a new inducement to do it with as little delay as possible. Mary told me our Mother was well: but beyond this, all seems to remain uncertain; and I want much to hear your report on it, your advice about it. We should have spoken far more about the business when you were here: but we had not the very best opportunity, and I thought for a good while you would <pb id="pg-07-97" n="07-97"/>stay longer. Something must be resolved upon, and before long; lest whitsunday find us unprepared.</p>
<p>Austin I fancy has now no chance for a farm this year; nor is it perhaps a thing to be regretted, considering how farms have usually gone. The project (failing this, which has now failed) that my Mother seemed most to hint at was occupying the two upper rooms at Scotsbrig, as her own and so living under the same roof with the new Couple. A scheme of which the many risks and certain disadvantages are very plain. But <hi rend="italic">something</hi> must be done; and the question is, what were the <hi rend="italic">least</hi> objectionable? One cannot fix on anything that were quite right; that were other than a <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi> measure. If our Mother have any plan, any wish of her own, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> would be the most advisable to help her in. But I doubt she cannot form a very decided plan at present; and it is very sad to have to ask her for one. Write me what you think about the whole matter: I am often thinking about it, but with very little effect. I could wish we had it in our power to fix it, next time I come down.&#x2014; At rare times one is tempted for a moment to say: &#x201C;If the swine would but run thro&#x2019; this marriage!&#x201D; Yet it were very cruel to poor James: he has a chance of &#x201C;happiness&#x201D; for one month in that way; and of great suffering if that month be denied him. There are men living that never in their life managed to get so much as a month. Yet as the Doctor says, &#x201C;It comes all to the same ultimately.&#x201D; On the whole, I want to hear your voice about all that business.</p>
<p>Poor Mrs Clow,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alexander&#x2019;s mother-in-law.</note> it seems, has been called away. She was not long left a <hi rend="italic">superfluity</hi> in the world; but has found a home, beside her old Partner, where there will be none to grudge her. O Time! Time! How it brings forth, and devours;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 127; Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, XV, 234.</note> and the roaring flood of Existence rushes on, forever similar, forever changing! Already of those that we looked up to as grown men, as towers of defence and authority, in our boyhood, the most are clean gone; we ourselves have stept into their position, where also we cannot linger. Unhappy they that have no footing in Eternity; for here, in Time, all is but Cloud and the baseless fabric of a vision!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 55, and <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi>, IV, i.</note></p>
<p>But to turn back to the Earth; for in the Earth too lies the pledge of a Higher world, namely a <hi rend="italic">Duty</hi> alloted us. Tell me, my dear Brother, how you fare on that wild know-head [knoll-head], what kind of cheer you are of. The little children, I imagine, must be your <pb id="pg-07-98" n="07-98"/>chief blessing; and surely you are thankful for them, and will struggle with your whole strength to instruct them and protect them, and fit them for the long journey (<hi rend="italic">long</hi>, for it is as long as Eternity) that lies before them. Little Jane will be beginning to have many notions of things now; train her to this, as the corner-stone of all morality: <hi rend="italic">To stand by the Truth; to abhor a Lie as she does Hell-fire</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Iliad</hi>, Book 9, II. 312&#x2013;13: &#x201C;For as I detest the doorways of Death, I detest that man, who / hides one thing in the depths of his heart, and speaks forth another&#x201D; (Lattimore trans.). Achilles thus speaks, referring to the treacherous conduct of Agamemnon, to the envoys Odysseus and Ajax sent by Agamemnon to persuade him to rejoin the Greek forces.</note> Actually the longer I live I see the greater cause to look on Falsehood with detestation, with terror, as the beginning of <hi rend="italic">all else</hi> that is of the Devil.&#x2014;My poor little namesake has no knowledge of good or evil yet: but I hope he will grow to be a strong fellow, and do his name credit.&#x2014; For yourself I am very glad indeed to see you make so manful a struggle, on that uncomfortable clay-footing; which however you must not quite quarrel with: in the darkest weather I always predict better days. The world is God&#x2019;s world, and wide and fair: if they hamper us too far, we will try another side of it. Meanwhile I will tell you a fault you have to guard against; and is not that the truest friendship I can shew you? Every position of man has its temptation, its evil tendency; now yours and mine I suspect to be this: a tendency to Imperiousness; to indignant self-help, and if nowise theoretical yet practical Forgetfulness and tyrannical Contempt of other men. This is wrong, this is <hi rend="italic">Tyranny</hi> I say; and we ought to guard against it. Be merciful, repress much indignation; too much of it will get vent after all. Evil Destiny is nothing, let it labour us and impoverish us as it will; if it only do not lame us and distort us. Alas, I feel well, one cannot wholly help even this: but one ought unweariedly to endeavour.</p>
<p>When I am coming down I cannot yet fix; it is most likely I will come by Catlinns: in any case you shall soon hear of me. Tell me your Lockerby Carrier&#x2019;s name for I have forgotten it.</p>
<p>Glen goes on wonderfully well; and I certainly hope is improving. We read Greek every night; a great improvement to me: he goes on with his Mathematics too, tho&#x2019; slowly; and seems perfectly satisfied at Peter&#x2019;s.&#x2014; I have had another Letter from Jeffrey, full of friendly professions, excuses, regrets &#x26;c; and have thoughts of letting the Correspondence lie there&#x2014;for a good while.&#x2014; My <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> is not done: I get along so miserably slowly.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Farewell my dear <pb id="pg-07-99" n="07-99"/>Brother! I hope to see you soon; to hear of you sooner. With all good progress for you and yours,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Jean&#x2014;</salute>
<p>I will with great pleasure lend you any Book I have; on one condition, which I doubt not you would prescribe to yourselves, that they be kept free from dirt and damage. Nothing is more gratifying than to afford so useful an accommodation so easily, to any one that will employ it; much more to a Brother and a Sister. On the other hand few things vex a methodical character more than thumb-marks when the volume returns: spot of grease, above all, seems to deserve death without benefit of clergy!</p>
<p>I have sent you to-day: <hi rend="italic">Holcroft&#x2019;s Memoirs</hi>, 3 vols.; Mackintosh&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, I vol.; <hi rend="italic">Marmaduke Maxwell</hi>, I vol.; <hi rend="italic">Young</hi> (for Sundays too), I vol.;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Late Thomas Holcroft, written by himself</hi>, ed.

On the whole I am very glad that you and James take to reading in leisure hours: leisure, of which every mortal has some, cannot in any other way that I know of be so profitably employed. If one <hi rend="italic">do</hi> not read, wherefore <hi rend="italic">can</hi> he read?</p>
<p>We are going on here in the common way; nothing new except the favourable change of the weather. I have many Books about me, many Thoughts in me: if not <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>, may hope to grow <hi rend="italic">happier</hi>.</p>
<p>If Alick come to-morrow, you can give him that Letterkin; if not, you can commit it to the Lockerbie Carrier (whose name I forget), or to any other conveyance you think better.</p>
<p>Mary tells me our Mother is well; but there seems to be no kind of settlement made yet, or capable of being made, which I regret, but do not yet see means of mending.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Writing to his mother from Rome on <date when="1834-02-13">13 Feb.</date>, John considered the idea of her going to live with her son Thomas but quickly rejected it: &#x201C;My own opinion is that you might be better if you were quite rid of the confusion of any large farm, and settled in some quiet cottage where you could get your own thoughts thought in peace. Here however at this distance it is not easy for me to advise. If Tom had not been in those wild solitudes you would have been best in his neighbourhood and might have done him much good as he needs some one like you to speak to. I should however disapprove much of your trying to live at Craigenputtoch, I am sure it would never do for you, it is so different from all you have been accustomed to. And then it is not as if Tom were settled there. I hope to see him come out of that wilderness ere long were it but to some cottage among civilized men.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-100" n="07-100"/>I know not exactly when I shall be down; but probably it will not be very long.&#x2014; Commend me to James.&#x2014; <closer><salute>I am, ever your Brother,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>Did you write last Monday, and again miss the Post? I had decided on hearing from you that day. It is true, you wrote, when I count it by the Almanac, not so long ago:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s last letter was dated <date when="1834-01-12">12 Jan.</date></note> but there is no sating of me in that matter. At the very lowest estimate of my demands (had one only to <hi rend="italic">demand</hi> in this world, and not to <hi rend="italic">give</hi> and <hi rend="italic">get</hi>), you should sit down every Sunday instead of going to sermon, and fill me say only three sheets with the cover; which I could read on Wednesday night again by way of Practical Sermon, having also failed to hear one at Church. But alas, as hinted, should not I then have to answer in the same ratio!</p>
<p>You are to learn at present two little pieces of news. The first is that your Books, all that I had here, were sent off some two weeks ago to Tait of Edinburgh, whom I had previously requested to forward them. I have yet got no notice of receipt or progress from him; but they must be in his hands since the time I mention, and may, we shall hope, reach you with his <date when="1834-03-00">March</date> Magazines. The Parcel was packed with my best skill, and directed in my clearest hand, &#x201C;John S. Mill, India House, London&#x201D;: it contained <hi rend="italic">Roland</hi> (3), <hi rend="italic">Morellet</hi> (2), <hi rend="italic">Paris Revolutionnaire, Bulwer, Coningsby;</hi> in short all that I had of yours, to my knowledge, except the <hi rend="italic">Repositories:</hi> there was an <hi rend="italic">invoice</hi> and no other writing. If I do not soon hear from Tait, or else that <pb id="pg-07-101" n="07-101"/>the Parcel is arrived, I will write to him: however there is little fear of such a confusion as we had in the Napier case; Tait is a punctual character, and used to such things.</p>
<p>Another piece of tidings is that Adolphe&#x2019;s Parcel arrived, and is already all read. The <hi rend="italic">H&#xE9;nault</hi> is a fine old Book, of the kind wanted; there was no Departmental Map, nor Dictionary; the two Quartos on the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> contained much that was or will be of service: the Portraits all but two, and about a fourth part of the <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires</hi> were quite new to me. You must next tell me How much money I owe for all these valuables? Thank Ado<supplied>[l]</supplied>phe very heartily for his great and ready assiduity. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> are not to be thanked, it would seem; or may &#x201C;thank yourself&#x201D;&#x2014;for getting so much trouble on your hands.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The various works listed here have all been noted fully before, and references to them may be found in the index.</note></p>
<p>Within these last weeks several things have passed with me. I have been not a Candidate, yet a kind of inquiring Applicant for a public Situation: what, you will never guess. No other than that of Astronomical Observer and Professor in the City of Edinburgh! It seemed to me a cold trade, yet a pure one; one at which I could honestly work, were the very God of Flies<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Beelzebub (meaning &#x201C;lord of the flies&#x201D;), Philistine god. See 2 Kings 1:2; Matt. 10:25.</note> to become dominant; and my need of some craft to make bread by, when I look at the present posture of Author-craft, seems not inconsiderable. However it was otherwise appointed. Lord Advocate Jeffrey answers in the shrillest negative: the place, not in his gift, is for some emeritus Clerk of his; and I gather thus much, which in my present posture is something, &#x201C;Lean no ounce of thy weight on <hi rend="italic">that</hi> side; there too thou art the most unpromotable of men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>But now comes properly my <hi rend="italic">second</hi> piece of news, which is greater than all the rest. Within the last three days we are actually talking in a quite practical way of a removal to London this Whitsuntide! My Dame is at this moment writing to Mrs Austin about houses: do you see her, and aid if you can. And so we are to meet then? Yes, I pray and hope so. It is but a cutting and tearing asunder once for all of a number of ties, a leaving of Brothers and a Mother; a <hi rend="italic">taking</hi> that considerable plunge, and swimming while you can hold out, sinking when you can no longer do it. Except in the little circle of my own kindred, I know of no soul out of London, whose society cheers or fortifies me: in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> circle free working is impossible; why <hi rend="italic">not</hi> London then? You know me as professing Antigigmanism in all <pb id="pg-07-102" n="07-102"/>senses, and openly proclaiming it: food and raiment of some kind shall not be denied me (or I will make a far tougher struggle yet); with these one can toil cheerfully <hi rend="italic">not</hi> for the Devil; and know the Love of Brother men, of a like heart: and a few y<supplied>[ears]</supplied> ends it; and the question, as I continually say, becomes not <supplied>[what]</supplied> Wages hadst Thou? but What work didst thou?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;Burns,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVI, 312.</note> So we will venture: <foreign><hi rend="italic">andar con Dios</hi></foreign> [go with God]!</p>
<p>Write to me soon, soon.&#x2014; On second thoughts, I fancy, perhaps <hi rend="italic">Knox</hi> might be the better of those papers to begin with. Or perhaps neither of them may look suitable: I shall understand it better by and by&#x2014; You will be amazed to hear of me reading a Greek Homer: such <supplied>[is]</supplied> my employment daily at the otherwise stupid hour of five. I like the old fellow real<supplied>[ly]</supplied> <hi rend="italic">amazingly</hi>; he does more good than I can express; creates a whole <foreign>Portici</foreign> [gallery of characters] [word obliterated] (so cheaply) under my Kilmarnock Bonnet. <closer><salute><foreign>Adieu</foreign>, dear Mill!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Begun on <date when="1834-01-18">18 Jan.</date>, but the last marginal note in it is dated <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></note> which as I compute must have been finished off on the very day my last was written on, got hither on the <date when="1834-02-07">7<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi></date>; a space not much above a fortnight. I mention this to give you a scale for computing by, which will be accurate if you know your own date accurately: I can report it only by memory, the Letter itself being at Scotsbrig. This writing <hi rend="italic">on the same day</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s letter had been written on <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></note> (which has so often happened to us), does it not indicate the great punctuality of both; almost, as an occult Philosopher might say, a kind of secret sympathy? Very pleasant, to think that at the very hour when I am specially thinking of you at Craigenputtoch, you at Rome are doing me the same brotherly service! But indeed the same thing happens, in a degree, every day; for I may say there are few days in which I do not specially enough remember you, and think of you. My strangely bewildered destiny has perhaps no <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi> element in it that is as full of hope as you are. Let us be thankful for all blessings!</p>
<p>Since I wrote last nothing outward has happened here, of the <pb id="pg-07-103" n="07-103"/>smallest moment; tho&#x2019;, as you shall hear, something inward has, which will become outward. Holcroft has never answered my Letter; so we have heard nothing more about poor Badams and his end, or Bessy Barnet and those he has left. On Saturday I wrote again to Holcroft; enclosing also a note for Bessy,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found. For Bessy Barnett (as she spelled her name), see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> which, if he could find no better address, he was to forward with the address it had: &#x201C;Lately with Mr Badams, Warwick.&#x201D; We had a new Letter from Jeffrey; and no other that I think of worth specifying. Jeffrey struggles to eat his asperity about the Astronomy Professorship; regrets, has hope, has sympathy, in any case &#x201C;heaves the wish&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech: &#x201C;as I once heard a Scotch preacher say&#x201D; (Carlyle to Sterling, A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi>, I, 226).</note> and on the whole makes it plain to me that in him of all men there is not the faintest shadow of help for me. I have not answered his Letter; and fancy that here our Correspondence may profitably close for indefinite periods. My last Letter was of the smoothest sort, and finished everything off as handsomely as was needful.</p>
<p>But now comes the <hi rend="italic">inward</hi> change, just on the point of expressing itself as an outward one. We learned incidentally last week that Grace our Servant, tho&#x2019; &#x201C;without fault to us,&#x201D; and whom we with all her inertness were nothing but purposing to keep, had resolved on &#x201C;going home next summer.&#x201D; The cup that had long been filling ran over with that smallest of drops. After meditating on it for a few minutes, we said to one another: &#x201C;Why not <hi rend="italic">bolt</hi>, out of all these rocky despicabilities, of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kerrags</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Hags</hi>], and lying draggle-tails of byre-women, and peat-moss, and isolation, and exasperation, and confusion, and go at once to London?&#x201D; <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gedacht, gethan</hi></foreign> [Contemplated&#x2014;done]! Two days after, we had a Letter on the road to Mrs Austin to look out among the &#x201C;Houses to Let&#x201D; for us, and an advertisement for M&#x2019;Diarmid to try for the letting of our own.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s advertisement duly appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Dumfries Courier</hi>, <date when="1834-03-05">5 March 1834</date>, p. 1, as follows: &#x201C;Country Residence. To be Let, Entry at Whitsuntide, The MANSION-HOUSE of Craigenputtock. It has Dining-room, Drawing-room, Library, 4 Bed-rooms, small Dressing-room, Servants&#x2019; apartment, Kitchen, with all appurtenances: and, for Offices, in an enclosed court, Fuel-house, Gig-house, Mangle-room, Stable of 4 stalls; the whole new, sufficient, and in perfect repair. With or without a Grass Park, fenced, watered, sheltered; a Garden, and the right of Shooting over the Grounds.
<p>&#x201C;To a suitable Tenant Rent very moderate. Enquire of the Editor. / <date when="1834-02-24">24th Feb., 1834</date>.&#x201D;</p></note> Since then, you may fancy, our heads and hearts have been full enough of this great enterprise; the greatest (small as it is) that I ever <hi rend="italic">knowingly</hi> engaged in. We bring anxiously together all the experience we have gathered or got reported; look <pb id="pg-07-104" n="07-104"/>back and look forward; make the bravest resolutions; and in fine seem to see a trembling hope that we may master the enterprise (of an honest life in London); at all events a certainty that we ought to try it. Yes, we must try it! Life here is but a kind of Life-in-Death, or rather one might say a Not Being Born; one sits as in the Belly of some Trojan Horse; weather-screened, but pining, inactive, neck and heels crushed together. Let us burst it, in the name of God! Let us take such an existence as He will give us; working, where work is to be found, while it is called today. A strange shiver runs thro&#x2019; every nerve of me when I think of taking that plunge; yet also a kind of sacred faith, sweet after the dreary vacuity of soul I have thro&#x2019; long seasons lived in, as under an eclipsing shadow. I purpose to be <hi rend="italic">prudent</hi>, watchful of my words; to look well about me, and with all the faculty I have pick my steps in that new arena. Thousands of sillier fellows than I flourish in it: the whole promotion I strive for is simplest food and shelter in exchange for the honestest work I can do.&#x2014; So you see, Jack, we hope you will find a home three hundred miles nearer you, next time! What effect this farther may have on your own final settlement we will not count at present, however much we may castle-build about it: many things will be clearer before the date of your return, which I more and more pray God may be safe and prosperous.&#x2014; But to give you a little particularity of insight. We purpose, for many reasons, to make this a whole measure, not a half one: thus the first thing will be to give up our Establishment here, to sell off all the furniture but what will equip a very modest house in the Suburbs of London; to let <hi rend="italic">the</hi> House if we can, if we cannot to let it stand there and not waste <hi rend="italic">more</hi> money. This Jane calls a &#x201C;burning of our Ships&#x201D;; which suits better with our present aim than anything else would. For indeed, I feel, this is as if the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> chance I shall ever have to redeem my existence from Pain and Imprisonment, and make something of the faculty I have, before it be forever hid from my eyes. No looking back, then! Forward! Advance or perish!&#x2014; We imagine some suburban house may be got for &#xa3;40: Leigh Hunt talked much about a quite delightful one he had (for &#x201C;ten children&#x201D; too) at Chelsea, all wainscotted &#x26;c for 30 guineas. With &#xa3;200 we fancy the <hi rend="italic">rigour of economy</hi> may enable us to meet the year. I must work, and seek work; before sinking utterly I will make an &#x201C;a&#x2019;fu&#x2019; struggle.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An expression of the carrier&#x2019;s: cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:173</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note> Thus it is, we will either, according to the Proverb, &#x201C;make a spoon or spoil a horn,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to JCA, [ca. <date when="1833-11-18">18 Nov. 1833</date>]</ref>.</note>&#x2014;in truth, nigh spoiled already. <hi rend="italic"><foreign>Andar con</foreign> <pb id="pg-07-105" n="07-105"/><foreign>Dios</foreign></hi> [Go with God]! this is the thing I say and feel; and on the whole address myself to the enterprise in a mood perhaps rather to be approved of.&#x2014; Now dear Jack what say you of all this? I know your good heart is fluttering with kindliest apprehension for us, yet also with approval, with a religious <hi rend="italic">thankfulness</hi> even. Write all that you think. Before my next Letter there will probably be tidings from Mrs Austin (who long ago invited us to set her on this task); more light also about the disposal of matters here: you shall get it all, as it comes to us. Hitherto you observe nothing <hi rend="italic">irrevocable</hi> is done; nor indeed will be, unless our House were let here of which there is next to no hope: however, we do not intend to take advantage of that posture of affairs; but are both determined enough, and Jane, I think, as much as myself. Our house-advertisement has perhaps appeared at Dumfries today; at all events, will appear this day week. The next will be a <foreign>roup</foreign> [auction sale of household goods]-advertisement!</p>
<p>Our dear Mother has not yet heard of this; for tho&#x2019; I wrote to Alick a week ago it was not then thought of. I will send her word of it tomorrow; and also that I shall see her in a day or two. It will be a heavy stroke, yet not quite unanticipated, and she will bear it. My Brothers and she are the only ties I have to Scotland. I will tell her that tho&#x2019; at a greater distance, we are not to be disunited: regular letters, frequent visits: I will say who knows but you and I may yet bring her up to London to pass her old days waited on by both of us! Go whither she may, she will have her Bible with her and her Faith in God. She is the truest Christian Believer I have ever met with; nay, I might almost say, the only true one.&#x2014; I heard from her last week; by a short Letter from Mary (no, it was the week before last): she professed to be <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than usual; had not taken any pills for three weeks; spoke in her old cheerful hopeful style<supplied>[.]</supplied> There is still a kind of tagrag tail of a negociation going on about that Howcleugh farm; but I do not think Austin will get it: so the whole destination thro&#x2019; even the Summer that is coming remains doubtful. I meant to go down at any rate, and try whether I could do nothing towards forwarding it; and now, with this new call, I think I shall set off without delay: probably (if the Wednesday Letters say nothing to the contrary) on Saturday first. I wrote to Alick about it, this day week (as was said); he was at Dumfries, at the &#x201C;Candlemas Fair&#x201D; that was there, and reported all well. Our Boy Rob Austin calls weekly at Jean&#x2019;s, and acts under her superintendance. He is engaged (like all else here) till whitsunday [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>].</p>
<p>Glen goes on in a kind of indifferent way, one cannot well say <pb id="pg-07-106" n="07-106"/>towards what issue. If I were obliged to declare whether I thought him improving or not it would puzzle me. In general I think him very slowly <hi rend="italic">mending</hi>; but he shifts in the suddenest fashion, and every new day has something new in the appearance he makes. Twice, I think, just after I had been declaring that he was evidently getting better, he came upon us next night with a fresh utterance of what we have all, he too, agreed to call <foreign><hi rend="italic">jinner-janner</hi></foreign>; about all manner of fooleries, in which generally military conquest acts a great part. When sanest he speaks little; if he begin to speak much great part of it is sure to be absurd. His insanity seems like a subtle poison flowing along his nerves; all on a sudden he will emit some utterance about his deeds of valour &#x201C;<date when="1815-00-00">before 1815</date>,&#x201D; when &#x201C;he was <hi rend="italic">not incubated&#x201D;;</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Perhaps we may speculate about whether Glen formed the expression from &#x201C;incubi&#x201D; or evil spirits: cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref>, &#x201C;incubi and foul creatures.&#x201D;</note> his features contract in uneasy fluctuation, his eye gets restless energetic, and so it lasts for a minute or two; then he ends it with a smile, gets himself again, and seems rather ashamed of the fit. But never at any time does he show the smallest <hi rend="italic">ferocity</hi>, or even <hi rend="italic">violence</hi>; indeed his whole temper is merciful, affectionate; after one of his splutters, I answer him &#x201C;&#x03A9;&#x03C2; &#x03B5;&#x03C6;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x0313; <hi rend="italic">jinner-janner</hi> &#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The rather inaccurate Greek means &#x201C;thus he spoke, speaking <foreign>jinner-janner</foreign> [Scottish for &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;].&#x201D;</note> and he quits it all with his submissive laugh. His <hi rend="italic">dietetics</hi>, of which he will take no charge himself, still act the most important part. We give him one of Jane&#x2019;s pills every night, or sometimes omit a night, when we judge (by his <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> alone) that he has had too much. He speaks quite favourably of his accommodation at Peter&#x2019;s; walks about (yet hardly enough, if the weather threaten); smokes a pipe; reads in some old Greek book, or rather turns over the leaves; prepares a couple of Propositions (and often only with difficulty can manage one of them); is here at seven o&#x2019;clock, and after finishing lessons gets a tune (<foreign><hi rend="italic">De tanti palpiti</hi></foreign><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Of such passion&#x201D;: a song from the opera <hi rend="italic">Tancredi</hi> (<date when="1813-00-00">1813</date>) by G. A. Rossini (<date when="1792-00-00">1792</date>&#x2013;<date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>).</note> is his constant favourite); and then returns to bed at half past nine. He begins of late to complain occasionally of his <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi> health (tho&#x2019; evidently improving in that respect), which I reckon perhaps a favourable symptom. As before, we must leave him in the hands of Time.&#x2014; He and I have gone on very regularly with our <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, tho&#x2019; more I think to my profit than to his. I begin it nightly at 5 o&#x2019;clock, otherwise a quite worthless hour for me, and have once or twice had 100 lines ready; but the most general number is about 50. We are nearly <pb id="pg-07-107" n="07-107"/>thro&#x2019; the second Book. Nothing I have read for long years so interests and nourishes me: I am quite surprised at the interest I take in it. All the <hi rend="italic">Antiquity</hi> I have ever known becomes <hi rend="italic">alive</hi> in my head: there is a whole Gallery of Apelleses and Phidiases that I not only look upon but <hi rend="italic">make</hi>. Never before had I any so distinct glimpse of antique Art: those Pompeii Engravings of yours, and all of the sort I have seen, first get their significance. By the by, can you tell me what the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> of that Picture is (which you brought), where a man seems speaking among other men and women, some of the latter weeping? Do you remember it by that description? The speaking man (I think) holds a roll as of writing; is seated, and naked down the back.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note>&#x2014; Also have they any other engravings of ancient <hi rend="italic">Pictures</hi>, cheap, about Rome? There is one of Medea killing her children, which is the sorriest copy (that English <hi rend="italic">Pompeii</hi>, copied from a French work), produced the deepest impression on me. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Still und einfach-gross</hi></foreign> [Still and simply great]!&#x2014; I have plenty of other Books from Barjarg (of small note, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> journey), and so keep always &#x201C;doing a little.&#x201D; The next leaf is <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Jack, we are very happy that you get on so smoothly; and doubt not you will turn these two otherwise so silent years to good account. You can always have Books, you see; even in Rome. Few young Physicians get any such opportunity of furnishing themselves in that way. I feel also a kind of satisfaction at having you in Switzerland thro&#x2019; the Summer; almost as if you were half home again. The Switzers are honest <foreign><hi rend="italic">Deutschen</hi></foreign> [Germans], among whom you will feel more like a Countryman. And then their Country, tho&#x2019; few men set less value on <hi rend="italic">views</hi>, yet that is a thing I too would give somewhat to see. If you go to Geneva you will again find English enough: there is on<supplied>[e]</supplied> Sir Egerton Brydges there, whom I fancy you might rather like to meet with. We have been reading in his <hi rend="italic">Censura Literaria</hi> lately, and find him a <hi rend="italic">good man</hi>, with more talent than one might conjecture at first, and an appearance of a true affectionate heart.<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18331029-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, <date when="1833-10-29">29 Oct. 1833</date></ref>.</note> Lady Clare I suppose must know about <supplied>[him]</supplied>: he was applicant for a Peerage many years ago; I think, the Barony of Chandos.&#x2014; Walter Savage Landor, I think you could not hear of at Florence, nor perhaps was it great matter.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></ref>.

<p>I will gladly forward you Teufelsdrockh if it be ready and a conveyance <pb id="pg-07-108" n="07-108"/>possible: in London there will be a better chance. I corrected the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> Paper of it lately; and found some pages of it <foreign><hi rend="italic">gelungen</hi></foreign> [well done]; a great comfort to me. Thy own faculty! God has given it, the Devil cannot take it away.&#x2014; One day perhaps I shall actually be able to write a Book.&#x2014; Nothing in the least determined yet about the <hi rend="italic">Necklace</hi>. Two Quartos from A. d&#x2019;Eichthal have been received and read: I shall have to alter one or two things; wonderfully little. The most probable issue of the business is that we shall make it a Magazine Article for the sake of &#xa3;45, which will prove wonderfully useful to us in those coming days. It is not good enough for a Book; at least for <hi rend="italic">losing</hi> money by. However, I wrote one Hayward (who had volunteered in the matter) that he might speak of it to Booksellers and let me know. Mill&#x2019;s Radical Review, to judge by his silence, rests on its oars.&#x2014; This then, dear Brother, is all I will say at present. I have striven to write <hi rend="italic">close;</hi> yet have made but a poor hand of it. You will figure the kind of unquiet, excited, not unhappy mood I am in: our Letters for some time will be more interesting than ever. All things among your friends here are in a transition state; yet all in some measure moving round the everlasting Pole! In our love of you there is also no change, nor will be&#x2014; But here at the right moment is Dinner!&#x2014; <closer><salute>Farewell, my dear Brother! Yours ever truly</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>[JWC&#x2019;s postscript:]</p>
<p><salute>My dear Brother&#x2014;</salute>Here is a new prospect opened up to us with a vengeance! Am I frightened? not a bit. I almost wish that I felt <hi rend="italic">more</hi> anxiety about our Future; for this composure is not <hi rend="italic">courage</hi> but <hi rend="italic">diseased indifference</hi>.

<salute>My Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>We got a keg of table-beer last week from some Brewer I believe in Irish Street; which liquor I like so well that I wish you to send our Mother a keg of the same dimensions tomorrow by Garthwaite. It <pb id="pg-07-110" n="07-110"/>costs 3 shillings; there are 24 bottles in it. If our Mother like it as well as I, it is pity she should ever want a stock of it. We shall see. Rob will give you the money; and, indeed, go and get the thing himself if you instruct him.</p>
<p>I have a piece of news that will surprise you, and not so agre<supplied>[e]</supplied>ably. Nay perhaps you have it already (if M&#x2019;Diarmid have put in the Advertisement, that our House is to Let), and are already surprised at it. We are speaking quite seriously and practically about setting off for London at Whitsunday! I did not mention it to Alick last Wednesday; because it was not till last Thursday<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1834-02-20">20 Feb.</date></note> that we started it ourselves. As yet none knows of it but our two selves;&#x2014;and M&#x2019;Diarmid, who has if not inserted got orders to insert the Advertisement. We have long had it in the wind<supplied>[;]</supplied> we are quite buried alive here, and must try to <supplied>[free?]</supplied> ourselves. Tell nobody of it (at least not Rob) unless the Newspaper have already made it public.&#x2014; Unless there come something in the Letter way tomorrow I think I must go down about friday or saturday and tell our Mother. You shall see me, by the road, and hear all about it. God bless you dear Sister! Commend me to the goodman.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever yours&#x2014;</salute></closer><name>T. C.</name></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The Liverpool Boxes, which we had heard of at Dumfries a week before, did at length extricate themselves from the claws of Tidewaiters, the delays of Carriers; and, safe after perils by land and perils by water, were welcomed here last Thursday. The Package of the Books seemed to have been expressly made for them, and had altogether answered its end; for, in spite of rains and perhaps rude tumbling enough, the whole <hi rend="italic">Registers</hi><note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330329-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-03-29">29 March 1833</date></ref>.</note> lie arranged here, not a leaf of them injured. I will look over the volumes, and pick out of them what I want; and hope to return them still without damage. The loan will be a great benefit to me: there is so much in the Work that you cannot find elsewhere; and many Libraries as I have been in, I never before could get my eye on a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> Annual Register all at once, <pb id="pg-07-111" n="07-111"/>but always some unhappy volume or other was sure to be &#x201C;lent out.&#x201D; Many thanks to you.</p>
<p>The Pipe-box must surely be regarded as a most considerate present: pipeclay lies bedded in Devonshire, yet is called for daily in the wilderness of Dunscore! Those Lancashire Pipes shall take rank with my Edinburgh ones, and alternate and in the kindest manner <hi rend="italic">fraternize</hi> with them; and so promoting Meditation and friendly Remembrances, do good in the world and not evil. For them, however, there is no return to their native country; but an honourable grave in our Peat-bogs. There let them slumber till the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Annus Magnus</hi></foreign> [Great Year]<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In astronomy the period of time required for the constellations to return to the same place. According to Ambrosius Theodosius Macrobius (<hi rend="italic">Somnium Scipionis</hi>, II, xi), it occurs every 15,000 years; other authorities speak of it as the &#x201C;Platonic Year&#x201D; and say that the complete revolution occurs every 26,000 years.</note> come round!</p>
<p>We rejoice to learn that you are all well, and moving along in the usual fashion. There are so many thousands, in these, and indeed in all times, of whom this cannot be said. Mrs Welsh, otherwise called &#x201C;Grizzie,&#x201D; otherwise &#x201C;Aunt,&#x201D; and &#x201C;My Mother,&#x201D; arrived here yesterday, still safe and sound, tho&#x2019; in muddy weather: we are striving by all manner of judicious cross-questions to make out for ourselves a picture of Liverpool as it is, or rather of that very small fraction of Liverpool that we take interest in. Nothing in this world will stand still for a single second: happy when you find it moving in the right course; or even not absolutely in the wrong one.</p>
<p>Here there has been the most somnolent, wind-rocked, bedeluged winter that I ever passed. We cowered close, and let it blow by. I remember little of it; once or twice I find myself galloping, much oftener walking in the teeth of furious tempests; the rest is an indistinct many-shaded mass, almost like a kind of dream. I wrote but little; read very generally; and <hi rend="italic">smoked</hi> most of all. However, it is now past; our old Planet has weathered her &#x201C;Cape of Hope&#x201D; again, and we shall have another Spring. Our poor little Birds are all chirping or singing out their thankfulness: I heard the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wheaps</hi></foreign> [curlews], last Sunday, on the moor, quite musical; taking counsel (I supposed) about matrimonial establishments.</p>
<p>We, for our part, are meanwhile meditating a great Enterprise: no less than removing with bag and baggage to London next Whitsunday! We have advertised our House here, and employed some friends to look out one for us yonder. It is a bold step; but I still <pb id="pg-07-112" n="07-112"/>rather think a necessary one. I have passed six of the strangest years here that ever fell to the lot of any mortal. I do not call them bad or worthless years; for all is good or is bad as you employ it: nevertheless, it is quite clear that such a course ought not to last always. Farther, as one has little chance, I fear, to grow younger or stronger by waiting, it were perhaps best to wait no longer. One of the consequences most clear to me at present is that I am likely to see you all at Liverpool ere long. We must do nothing rashly, yet also nothing sluggishly. My little Dame is fully as warm in the project as I.</p>
<p>Brother John writes to us regularly from Rome. He seems contented and successful in his position; but leads, for the rest, a rather lonely life, associating mostly with Germans and perhaps a native Roman or two. The English, of whom Rome is full, he describes as the most unproductive of men; hollow as blown eggs; men without basis or aim; driven from post to pillar by lifeweariness, and the wretchedest tho&#x2019; the absurdest of all wants, want of something to do. These we shall leave revolving, as the Prophet Ezekiel says, &#x201C;like unto a wheel.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ezek. 1:16 and 10:10.</note>&#x2014; It is one of my secret hopes that Jack too may finally settle in London, and be neighbour and brother to us there. He has had his own perversities, but promises more and more clearly to be a good Physician and a good Man: great rarities, wherever I have travelled, both the one and the other.</p>
<p>In the shape of external news I can naturally tell you nothing. This is the region of Heath and Whinstone and everlasting Solitude. Properly we are nearer Charing-cross than the Mid-steeple;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A squat building, in the center of Dumfries, formerly a town-office and dungeon, on the walls of which was shown the distance to various neighboring towns.</note> nay I might say, nearer the Dog-star and Orion&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ellwand</hi></foreign><note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The three stars called &#x201C;Orion&#x2019;s Belt.&#x201D;</note> than either the one or the other.</p>
<p>You must remember me very affectionately to Mrs Welsh, to Miss and Alick and all the others down to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Scots wha hae</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently a nickname, unexplained, for the youngest Welsh cousin.</note> &#x201C;Cousin&#x201D; in all this warmly joins me. Say to Mrs Welsh that she <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> have a copy of the first Book I realize; my only fear is she will find it a hard nut, an<supplied>[d]</supplied> alas too probably a deaf one.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >One without a kernel, thus worthless.</note> Helen, if a communicative fit came over her, might seize the pen, and write,&#x2014;with all the copiousness of &#x201C;Woman the Angel of Life (a Poem in Six Cantos).&#x201D; Why not?</p>

<salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Here are <hi rend="italic">two</hi> boxes of old Books, which still do not exhaust my stock: if you can change them for me into money they will be much more easily carried in that latter shape. Most of them are of very small value, and I have left you to dispose of these according to your own judgment and opportunity: a few I have marked as more notable, or hypothetically worth a Price, which is in general some thirty <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi>. less than I bought them at in the same secondhand condition. You must do the best you can: I shall see you again in a week or two.</p>
<p>An Invoice is inclosed, which (tho&#x2019; wrongly ordered in the copying) will if you attend to my <hi rend="italic">marginal directions</hi> give you the Books somewhat in their actual order and position from top to bottom of the Boxes. I keep the original of it here.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A copy of the invoice has not been found.</note></p>
<p>The little Box is not my own: as there are but a small number of Books in it, perhaps you could get <hi rend="italic">it</hi> emptied, and returned tomorrow by this same cart. But at any rate there will be other opportunities. Only do not lose that Box, for it suits a special purpose here.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Had it not been for some little accident or other, I should have written to you last Wednesday. It is better as it is; for now, in writing, I can also answer your Letter.</p>
<p>We will with great pleasure welcome you at the time you promise: the Gig shall be in waiting at Auldgirth Bridge<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s father helped to build this bridge, about eight miles NNW of Dumfries. See <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> I, 35&#x2013;37; and for a picture of the bridge, J. M. Sloan, <hi rend="italic">The Carlyle Country</hi> (London, <date when="1904-00-00">1904</date>), p. 213.</note> Inn on the <date when="1834-04-03">3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi> of April</date>; perhaps with myself in it, if I be not too busy. Should you see good to alter your day, give us timely warning (on the preceding Wednesday), and that too shall be well.</p>
<p>You will find William, if still in no clear state of recovery, yet in a tolerable state of progress towards such, or the hope of such. He continues perfectly quiet, one of the most peaceable and manageable of men; satisfied with all that is about him, with all that is done for him; waiting, with none but internal contentions, for &#x201C;delivery from obscuration,&#x201D; and the certain knowledge of who he is both &#x201C;prior to the year <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x201D; and after it. He has many fluctuations; and so, as I said last time, one can by no means accurately measure his progress: nay once or twice I have noted, at the very time I had been saying he was most decidedly getting better, he came up next night with a larger cargo of crotchets than we had seen in him for weeks. On the whole, however, I do certainly flatter myself his tissue of Delusions is, as it were over its whole texture, getting <hi rend="italic">thinner;</hi> a variety of threads and fragments of it he has as good as dropt. We scarcely ever hear of the French Royal Family now, or at worst much more faintly: the <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi> too was talked about a few nights ago, and as good as acknowledged to be a mere Shadow. I observe still that there is nothing or little of <hi rend="italic">fixedness</hi> in his chimeras; that he takes up one after the other, and (with astonishing ingenuity sometimes) gathers them out of whatsoever he is reading or doing. This, as betokening a certain degree of <hi rend="italic">freedom</hi> in the action of his mind, I reckon, in comparison of the other, a favourable symptom. In bodily health he is evidently much improved: nevertheless his whole complaint is now of bodily health; of headaches, pains in the head; which however when you press him <pb id="pg-07-115" n="07-115"/>about them turn out to be mere &#x201C;confusion,&#x201D; &#x201C;feeling of stupidity,&#x201D; and such like. He told me one night that he had for the first time these many months &#x201C;the satisfaction of feeling himself <hi rend="italic">cold</hi>&#x201D;; cold in such a way that a fire would warm him. All these too I reckon symptoms that the sound feeling of the body is returning.</p>
<p>We still see him nightly; and find him insatiable of one thing at least; of Music; which he hums to, with great interest; never, however, &#x201C;sounding the great note of France.&#x201D; Our Geometry still goes on, yet with great languour, especially since the good weather began: he evidently takes no interest whatever in it, and only learns a Proposition now and then to please me, excusing himself night after night with his insuperable &#x201C;obscuration,&#x201D; such that he &#x201C;could not learn it tho&#x2019; you had held a drawn sword over him.&#x201D; He likes the Homer a little better; but never <hi rend="italic">prepares</hi> that either, and hobbles thro&#x2019; our Lesson as he best can. He has much greater pleasure in what he calls &#x201C;reflecting,&#x201D; and wandering about in the spring air; which latter especially is a practice we by all means encourage. I observe he always of late speaks of &#x201C;Archy&#x201D; as his Brother; and a very clever Brother Archy is, who &#x201C;had given him hints&#x201D; about the wonderfullest things, for example, the other night, about &#x201C;Egyptian Hieroglyphics,&#x201D; the whole mystery of which he (William) had discovered, and was ready (instead of a Geometrical Proposition) to unfold to us. At other times I have heard him say, much more to the point, that you were succeeding well in your Enterprise, and had &#x201C;an hundred Looms going&#x201D;:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Farie, Glen &#x26; Co. were silk manufacturers.</note> as for him, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could do nothing till this obscuration passed off; as by Heaven&#x2019;s mercy it was fast doing.&#x2014; This then is my Bulletin. You can rhyme it together; and, as I think you are founded in doing, still gather new hope from it.</p>
<p>We rejoice honestly that your Adventure prospers; and continue to predict that there is every likelihood of its still going on to prosper. Diligent in Business, fervent in Spirit! Wise as the Serpent; gentle as the Dove!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 10:16.</note></p>
<p>You will not learn without interest that we are actually taking steps for a removal at Whitsunday to London. Our House here is advertised to be let; and Friends are looking out <hi rend="italic">there</hi> for another to take. All seems in motion towards departure; tho&#x2019; as yet there is no irrevocable step taken. Among the several changes to those we love, which this revolution of ours will occasion, I have not forgot poor <pb id="pg-07-116" n="07-116"/>William&#x2019;s change.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You are probably expecting some little word of tidings from me tonight; and I have no mind to disappoint you. There is little to say, except that I got well home, and we are all well;&#x2014;or rather of the many other things that I could wish to say and impart to you there are so few that will come readily into black-on-white! I have thought much about you, my dear Mother; and what can we make of it but that there is another revolution and shaking-asunder and joining-together going to take place among us; for which, with a patient trust that it will be all for Good, we ought to make courageously ready. Be not discouraged, my dear Mother: this also will be found to lead <pb id="pg-07-117" n="07-117"/>us towards the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> mark. You shall never see yourself forsaken on Earth while I live, while one of us lives; and happy were it for us if out of the Earth and beyond it, we had a City with foundations!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 11:10.</note> That a Faith of that dwells in you is my greatest comfort: what anchor have we otherwise in this tempestuous fluctuating world to front its storms with? Another year, I trust, will see us all more composed.</p>
<p>I parted with Alick, as he would tell you, on this side of Lochmaben; in a <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> and yet not unhappy mood: so many partings; Life <hi rend="italic">compelling</hi> each of us to go his separate road: and yet the serene image of a continued Union even in Time, and a higher Union thro&#x2019; Eternity looks in glimpses benignantly thro&#x2019; it.&#x2014; But I must cease my moralizing; for that is not the business here.</p>
<p>Jean got me all my things at Dumfries; I found her well and looking well: delivered her her packages and told her all the news. I saw M&#x2019;Diarmid and some others with him; all of whom were as kind and kinder than there was need for. I agreed with the Bookseller M&#x2019;Kie to send him down a whole mass of old Books which he was to sell for me: they have accordingly gone down, last Wednesday, in two large Boxes. I expect little for them; but they will be out of the way.</p>
<p>Here at home also all was well; and my two dames set heartily to grind coffee for me when I showed face. Mrs Welsh had not wearied nearly so much as I expected: in fact, she staid a week longer, till yesterday; and parted in the most kindly reluctant manner; a thing unexampled in the history of visiting; which we almost thought like <foreign><hi rend="italic">feedom</hi></foreign> [a portent, usually of death]. She sent back the Gig with her Boy, the same day; and a very multifarious collection of Presents; including even two hareskin soles for me!&#x2014; She is to send you her Pony down next Wednesday; not tomorrow, because the Boy only got home today, and there was no time to fetch it: she would not speak of selling it, but seemed to wish much it might suit you. I doubt, it will be very weak: she lamented that the Boys had taught it a trick of <hi rend="italic">flying across the road</hi> (I think); formerly it had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> trick, and still has no other. But Garthwaite will bring it down for you next week, and you will see it with your own eyes. If it do not suit, you shall have Harry, or one that will. Alick also will see after a saddle.</p>
<p>We have yet heard nothing more of London; but may perhaps this week or next. No applicant either for the House here; only Peter Austin very urgent for the Park (in case the House should not let), of which I promised him the first offer. Indeed I have <hi rend="italic">done</hi> almost <pb id="pg-07-118" n="07-118"/>nothing since my return: I was in a rather <hi rend="italic">bilious</hi> state, and went about in a restless uneasy pitiful state on that account till within these two days, when (by aid of regimen and <hi rend="italic">castor</hi>) I am got to my old condition again. I doubt, the weather, as beautiful as it looks, is not very healthy: therefore, I beg of <hi rend="italic">you</hi> specially to take care of yourself. This is the very time for colds and rheumatisms, and small feverish afflictions. Take to your pills again, if you have any need of them; and I entreat you, dear Mother, be <hi rend="italic">very careful</hi>.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Next week I think is the March Fair; when you get your pony. The question is: When you are to come up here, and get a fortnight of writing? I am quite serious in this; at all events, you must come here, and give us a fortnight&#x2019;s talking, whatever way things turn. I will come for you <hi rend="italic">any</hi> time: if your pony will carry you to Dumfries<supplied>[,]</supplied> as we were talking, my coming is the merest trifle, for I am not likely to do much except <hi rend="italic">read</hi> for some time. Now as to the time: Archy Glen is to be here for three days, he writes us, the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> being the <date when="1834-04-03">3<hi rend="italic">d</hi> of April</date>. Perhaps when he goes off will be the best time we can choose. I will write however before then, and we will try to fix it.</p>
<p>What has Austin made out at Annan? I fancied him there last thursday. Mary must take her pen, and write us all that has passed, especially <hi rend="italic">how</hi> you all are. Ben Nelson did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come on friday; which was no other than I expected.</p>
<p>The sheet is so near full! I too am confused and wearied; Glen has just been here, and I had various tasks thro&#x2019; the day. Good night, my dear Mother! Let us all be of good cheer, and good hope: has not God&#x2019;s Providence cared for us all hitherward; and will He now forsake us? We have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> reason to think so, except our Unbelief. <closer><salute>Good night my dear Mother; may Peace be with you all!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Son, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jane sends her best love to you all: you in particular I am to tell that the stockings are &#x201C;beautiful&#x201D; and most thankfully received.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>There is no bigger sheet in the house, except monstrosities of scrolling-sheets; and to procure another, as you know, will detain us <pb id="pg-07-119" n="07-119"/>some too [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] weeks. My hand shall be cabin&#x2019;d, crib&#x2019;d, confin&#x2019;d<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> III, iv.</note> to the very uttermost: you shall have my news, and my blessing with them, still. We had a kind of hope of hearing from you yesterday, which was Wednesday; but it yielded nothing; so, as we are for Thornhill tomorrow, I will not wait another week.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written on <date when="1834-03-13">13 March</date>.</note> My last despatch to you was dated some four, or more likely five weeks ago; either of which is far enough back. Your last to me bears &#x201C;<date when="1834-01-21">January 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi></date>,&#x201D; and one since to my Mother &#x201C;<date when="1834-02-13">Feb<hi rend="italic">y</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>&#x201D;: this is our lastest [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] account from you. To look at these two Letters, which are now on the table here, excites still stronger hopes for next Wednesday; you are in general so punctual; neither did I know, till this moment by actual inspection, that you were so far in arrear: Time passes here in so noiseless unproductive a way, one has no natural feeling of its course; each day being the express image of last (and most of them, like Macadam&#x2019;s Dutch crockery-image, &#x201C;clean <foreign><hi rend="italic">toom</hi></foreign> [altogether empty]&#x201D;), you are apt to lump large masses of them together, and wonder how they went.&#x2014; For me, if you received my last Letter, there will be nothing of great moment to add to it: wherefore, as I have been at Scotsbrig since, I will begin with that. It was yesterday gone three weeks that I yoked my <hi rend="italic">clatch</hi> again, after waiting out all the winter deluges, and looked abroad again into the living world, not without a kind of gladness and almost surprise to find that there still was a living world. At Dumfries whole bags of Letters lay waiting me: about our London Expedition from Mrs Austin and Mill, about the finer sensibilities of the heart from Mrs Montague; an inarticulate shriek from poor Mrs Badams, as late announcement of her loss, long rambling speculations on the same sad subject from Tom Holcroft, whereby <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> I think was learned except that the mortal body of our poor Friend<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Badams, who had died in <date when="1833-09-00">Sept. 1833</date>.</note> lay in Paddington Churchyard, and that while alive he had been wont to stop over from Bartlett&#x2019;s Buildings and drink in Fearon&#x2019;s shop some large measure of brandy every day: alas, the whole of it is a Tragedy all too heart-oppressing; such as has often been, such as we also were appointed to witness! Hastily glancing over these Documents and hastily despatching them home, I dined on &#x201C;three light-boiled eggs with salt&#x201D; (a favourite travelling dinner of mine) at Jean&#x2019;s, whom I found well and doing well; and again taking the road was at Alick&#x2019;s about sunset. He was mending a stone-dyke near <pb id="pg-07-120" n="07-120"/>yon old ruinous mill of his, and the &#x201C;Brig of Danger&#x201D;;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a term used just by the Carlyles; it may refer to the narrow bridge which had to be crossed in order to reach Alick&#x2019;s farm.</note> he joyfully answered my hail, led me over, and up the <foreign>brae</foreign>, to a clean house<supplied>[,]</supplied> two clean rosy children, and a blazing coal-fire. I learned from him the particulars of an occurrence I had been apprised of quite unexpectedly at Dumfries by a funeral-letter: the death of our poor old Aunt Fanny.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss">Carlyle&#x2019;s Aunt Fanny (<date value="1752-00-00">1752</date>&#x2013;<date value="1834-00-00">1834</date>) was the second wife of William Brown, stonemason in Peeblesshire, who taught the craft to Carlyle&#x2019;s father and uncles. James Carlyle&#x2019;s death in <date value="1832-00-00">1832</date> prompted Carlyle to obtain details of his family&#x2019;s history from his Aunt Fanny, which are incorporated in <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 32, and in the <hi rend="italic">Two Note Books,</hi> pp. 270&#x2013;71. The printed invitation to the funeral on <date value="1834-03-04">4 March</date> is pasted in Carlyle&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> where he adds the following comment: &#x201C;She was about 82; the last of her family; a woman of singular vehemence, inflexibility, and energy,&#x2014;all uncultivated, ill-directed. Her industry and parsimony were transcendent; not less her self-help, of which these were forms. She even died refusing help; unseen; just as if she had been falling asleep. &#x03A4;&#x1F73;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; [Death].&#x201D;</note> She had been buried the day before. The end of her Life was like the course of it; resolute, indomitable: and as soft almost as the falling asleep of a tired labourer, his day&#x2019;s-work being done. She was out (among the cows, overseeing something done to them), tho&#x2019; weak as weak could be, the very day before: that night (or rather next morning) about 2 o&#x2019;clock, she bade Will, who was watching with her, go to bed and leave her, for he was nothing but disturbing her; Will obeyed, but rose again about 4, and went to look: his Mother had been up, had lighted her pipe, had smoked it, and laid it with the candle first carefully extinguished on the back-bar of the bed; and fallen asleep&#x2014;to awake no more! She was the last of a race: one generation we have seen pass away; we ourselves are the next, also rapidly passing. There had been some absurd procedure on the part of Will, and dangers of squabbling between him and the rest, which Alick and Jamie had been helpful in suppressing. If I had no other topic I might tell you of them; but shall hardly find room here. Nell, whom I saw, astonished me much: the strangest semi-artificial, semi-sybilline oldish woman, clanging and twanging in loud metallic recitative, above the &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">loight from above</hi>,&#x201D; about being &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">sore hara</hi>ss<hi rend="small-caps">t</hi><hi rend="italic">ed</hi>&#x201D; and so forth, in a dialect I with all my philology could not quite at once make out. She is back again to Carluke; and will not sink while there is swimming, I imagine.&#x2014; Old Mrs Clow<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mother-in-law of Carlyle&#x2019;s brother Alexander.</note> is also gone: she died at last without much additional sickness; apparently of the old disease. Neither, alas, is my obituary yet complete: I read last night in the Newspaper the Mrs Nivison (of Middlebie), whom I saw at Jean&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-07-121" n="07-121"/>wedding seemingly the healthiest woman there, was suddenly no more. The minister of Lochmaben<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Thomas Gibson (<date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), born at Closeburn, educated at Glasgow University, and presented to Lochmaben in <date when="1809-00-00">1809</date>.</note> too, whom you have heard of, died the other morning at breakfast; and thus abruptly finished his fat career. These are things which it were meritorious not indeed to <hi rend="italic">see,</hi> yet to see and see <hi rend="italic">over:</hi> we have a Life that is ever wonderful; fearful yet also sublime.&#x2014; But to collect my scattered threads and go on knitting: You are to fancy that Alick has rolled me down, like Jehu,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Very fast; cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18170705-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:105</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1817-07-05">5 July 1817</date></corr></ref>.</note> with lamps burning, to the astonishment of the country, and the joyful surprise of Scotsbrig, part of which was even to bed. Our Mother came rushing out of Mary&#x2019;s: one thinks of all these things with joy yet with sadness. Of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things there are only <hi rend="italic">so many times;</hi> one time is the last.</p>
<p>Various plans were agitated for our Mother&#x2019;s Whitsunday settlement, with much vague speculation, out of which it was not easy to frame any practical result. All things that could be thought of offered objections: it was only a choice of the bad best. Our Mother herself was quiet, yet sad as was natural, and recoiled from the prospect of change, which nevertheless by the adventurousness of the younger ones had become inevitable. The scheme of Alick&#x2019;s Cottages, as suggested in the margin of your Letter, had already struck Alick, and seemed to most of us one of the likeliest: but then the state of the Cottages themselves, which was very bad, Alick&#x2019;s loose hold of the farm, and its general muddiness, blackness and discomfort threw a repulsive air over the whole. The Austins were privately not much inclined to enterprise, should any other offer; my Mother &#x201C;had never lived in any such <foreign>hullan</foreign> [heap],&#x201D; and seemed to think it questionable. Meanwhile, in the total hopelessness of all farming industry in Annandale a new project had been started for Austin: that of becoming a Carter or Carrier at Annan. Robert Brown was said to advise it rather decidedly. We went all down to Annan, Alick Jamie and I in the Gig, Austin riding on flank, to go and look at the matter with our own eyes. Brown, tho&#x2019; in a languid sickly condition himself, seemed sanguine about such a project: three Carters or Carriers had died of a late epidemic in the Burgh (among these, honest John Scott, whom you remember; and Will Johnston, or Peter&#x2019;s son, whom I once fought with); wages were good, there seemed decidedly room for such an enterprise: a house too with fit accommodation, seemed not difficult <pb id="pg-07-122" n="07-122"/>to attain. Ben Nelson, whom I consulted, was inclined to hope, but not decided: he would go and consult with Brown, and then meet me next day at Scotsbrig; which accordingly he did, with a vote distinctly in favour of the scheme. New talking at great length: however, Jamie and I went over finally to the Austins, to ask in plain words and ascertain, whether they, for their own separate part, were still bent on trying for a Farm next year, or would be content to go on at the Carrier business if they found it maintain them. Contrary to Jamie&#x2019;s prophecy, they answered clearly that there seemed no chance of farming now or henceforth, that if they could live in the other way they should be well content. Resolved, therefore, that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> should be off to Annan without delay. As for my Mother, so much being now settled, it was judged better, since both Jamie and she so objected to a change, that she for this year should continue under the Scotsbrig roof, occupying the two upstairs rooms as her own house, with Jenny, who however meant to pass most of the summer in Dumfries, improving herself in sewing and the like. If the Austins prospered at Annan, our Mother was then to remove thither; a scheme recommended both by the decided wish she had to be near Mary, by the conveniences, and opportunities for reading, for sermons, for acceptable company, which the place holds out; but still more conclusively by this consideration, That Alick too has it in view to remove thither, after another crop at Catlinns, and try to get on in the way of meal-dealing and grain-dealing and the like, for which now that the Steamboat has brought Liverpool so near there is a very tolerable field. I rather welcomed this scheme of Alick&#x2019;s; for I pity him at Catlinns, plunging amid <foreign><hi rend="italic">glar</hi></foreign> [mud], and doing nothing, or enjoying nothing, except providing for the day that passes. Were he too settled at Annan, I really think I could fancy our dear Mother better there than anywhere, and think of her there with more satisfaction. This then was the last state of matters. Austin, I hear, did, as he talked of doing, go down to Annan the week after I saw him to look after a house (in which, as in all things, Ben Nelson kindly undertook to aid him); but whether he has got one (there was one of Will Brown&#x2019;s, at the Battery, talked of), or what length the matter has gone, I know not, and Jean too had no word when she wrote yesterday. As for my Mother at Scotsbrig, tho&#x2019; I calculate that she will find a change which neither she nor still less the too vehement Jamie anticipate, yet we imagine she may get along tolerably for one year: we have got her a nice little Pony (of Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s), and if that do not answer she is to get <hi rend="italic">Harry;</hi> so that besides her own home, she will have Catlinns, Annan <pb id="pg-07-123" n="07-123"/>and Dumfries all within reach of her, and taking them in rotation, she need not feel much tedium. She will mount her wheel too, and have Books. It is one very g<supplied>[reat]</supplied> mercy that her health is fully better than usual rather than worse: her feelings also towards her prospecti<supplied>[ve]</supplied> daughter-in-law are wholly of a most proper sort. Poor Mother! I was very sad to see all the old scaffolding of her life falling asunder about her; and I doubt not, all of us very heartily vowed that nothing we could do should be wanting to repair what she loses. One has now and then a little grudge at James and the others, but that too is unfair, and neither Alick nor I will show it; for, as we said, it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> some time or other to be, and why not now, when our Mother is stronger and not weaker to bear it?&#x2014; I must not end this long story without saying how glad she expressed herself to have been and to be at your Letter and the good tidings it brought: I had to &#x201C;run it over&#x201D; aloud another time, tho&#x2019; it had been repeatedly spelled out before. Our departure for London naturally grieved her much, but she bears up as well as possible; admits willingly that we are doing no good here, and <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go. I drove her up to Catlinns that morning I returned; and left her there; Alick escorting me with his &#x201C;black mare&#x201D; thro&#x2019; Lochmaben, when again the &#x201C;must&#x201D; interfered, and we went thoughtfully each his way.</p>
<p>This then is the Scotsbrig business, which mainly concerned us at present. With our Craigenputtoch doings I must be much briefer. The house has been twice advertised to let; but no tenant offers, or indeed is rightly expected: Mrs Austin writes in the most cheerful way about undertaking to get us a house; nay last week there came a Letter that she had already got one (in Kensington, rent &#xa3;32, and seemingly <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> suitable for us); <hi rend="italic">only</hi> that we &#x201C;must decide before the <date when="1834-03-19">19<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date>,&#x201D; and, alas, the <date when="1834-03-19">19<hi rend="italic">th</hi></date> was within three hours or so of terminating when the Letter arrived! I walked over to Minnyhive, next day, with an Answer: &#x201C;Take it by all means&#x201D;; but I fancy it would be too late, and so we are still at sea in that respect. I got my walk however, as Glen did who went silently with me; over the wild grim moor, which as it lay there in its stony deadness and the bright white village afar off (a stone moor and a poor <hi rend="italic">petrified</hi> man) made, I find a very deep impression on me. I have farther despatched two Boxes of old useless Books to be sold in Dumfries; and put questions, but received no answers, about the expence of the various modes of carriage to London; and so lie waiting, till in a few weeks now, the time of departure come. We have farther determined now <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to &#x201C;burn our ships,&#x201D; in the way of sale by auction which would involve us in much trouble <pb id="pg-07-124" n="07-124"/>with uncertain issue, but to use them in the way at worst &#x201C;of firewood,&#x201D; laid up here, or sold as chance opportunities may occur. The disposal of the House and <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> lies still dubious; but perhaps something <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be made of it. Let me mention too that we heard last night, for the second time, from Bessy Barnet:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> she is with the old Badamses at Warwick; will go and serve us anywhere under the heavenly sun; &#x201C;wages are the last of her thoughts,&#x201D; kindness and to be with those she likes are the whole matter. Poor Bessy! So you see we are provided with a servant, on whose fidelity at least we can rely. As to London generally my thoughts are of the dimmest, earnest, huge character. To go thither seems inevitable, palpably necessary; yet contrasted with these six years of rockbound seclusion seems almost like a rising from the grave. Like an issuing from the Bastille at least: and then the question is, whether one shall not, like that old man, request with tears to be <hi rend="italic">taken back!</hi><note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to an incident recorded in some histories of the French Revolution.</note> On the whole, I hope; and my little Dame (whom I often call &#x2019;Spairkin, Despairkin) declares naively that &#x201C;she is not a coward for all that she is desperate.&#x201D; Forward then and try! As to &#x201C;fame&#x201D; and all that, I can honestly say I regard it <hi rend="italic">not:</hi> my wish and hope is that I may live not dishonestly, nor in vain; and it is my confidence too. Soon, soon does a high Eternity swallow up <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the littleness of Time, were it joyful, were it painful. Curiously enough, the Rhetoric Chair at Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, just about this time, has fallen vacant: but I make no whisper of pretention to it; Jeffrey as good as assured me <hi rend="italic">he</hi> could do nothing for me, beforehand, and we hear and shall likely hear nothing farther from him. They will give it to T. Campbell, or let it lie vacant: at bottom, I believe this better for me.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref> George Moir (see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280418-TC-G-01"><sic>4:365</sic><corr>TC to G, <date when="1828-04-18">18 April 1828</date></corr></ref>) held the chair from <date when="1835-00-00">1835</date> to <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>.</note> And so I go on reading and studying here, and for exercise digging up and trimming the garden flower-borders, tho&#x2019; I shall not see them blow.

Voss&#x2019;s is the best Translation I ever in my life looked into: it is poetical even, yet <hi rend="italic">closer</hi> than Clarke&#x2019;s school one.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Clarke (<date when="1675-00-00">1675</date>&#x2013;<date when="1729-00-00">1729</date>), <hi rend="italic">Homeri Ilias, Graece et Latine</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I need not detain you long with any words of mine today, for here is a Letter from Jack,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >That of <date when="1834-03-13">13 March</date>.</note> which we got only last night, and now forward to you. Let us be thankful again! The poor Doctor is very well in body and mind; and has nothing but friendly news for us. He is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going over the Alps, it would seem, but down to Naples for the summer; an arrangement which he seems to like better. We are well pleased to hear that Miss Elliott is to continue with them: on principle of &#x201C;Let well be.&#x201D; So hither, thank Heaven, it is all right.</p>
<p>As for us there is nothing new fallen out since I wrote last; or hardly anything. We have, indeed, got the promise of a servant for summer, either in London or anywhere else we may please to dwell in: she is one Bessy Barnet, poor Badams&#x2019;s servant, the daughter of his old Housemother, who was so orderly and good while I lived in <pb id="pg-07-127" n="07-127"/>Birmingham; Bessy was then a little wise orderly girl, and has since grown (we are assured) a very superior woman in her way. She consents to go with us with a singular alacrity; and I believe her fidelity, whatever other quality she may have or want, is to be entirely depended upon. This is rather a comfortable thing.</p>
<p>Mrs Austin also wrote to us about a House in London, which seemed expressly built for us: in Kensington (a western suburb, a pleasant place); the rent &#xa3;32; and everything right about it. But alas there was another Applicant, and our decision was to be sent &#x201C;by return of post,&#x201D; otherwise the question would be decided without us: and you know what our &#x201C;return of post&#x201D; means. I wrote with all the dispatch <hi rend="italic">possible;</hi> but I daresay it would be too late: we have heard nothing more, and know not whether we shall tomorrow. For our own House here no offerers; nor for anything connected with us. We sit quite still, waiting our time.</p>
<p>I wrote all these news and all that had been done in Annandale off to the Doctor, on friday last; unfortunately just two days before his Letter came: I thought it wrong to wait any longer. I purpose to write before very long again.</p>
<p>We were over at Templand, whither Jane had promised to go, from Friday afternoon till Monday last: Mrs Welsh was well enough, and all was very still there. I did little but read a Book I had taken with me, all the time. My going, however, was the cause of one mistake, which I lamented perhaps more than you yourself would: in the hurry of departure that squally day (for we <supplied>[were]</supplied> very uncertain about it), I forgot both the Newspapers; and so here they are lying yet, not to go away till tomorrow! I bethought me of them at Dunscore Kirk; but it was too late. Such a thing is to be avoided in future!</p>
<p>I desire much to hear word out of Annandale. Has Austin got a house yet at Annan; or how is that matter standing? I have got no more light than I had when I left you. But the great question is: When are you coming up to tell me everything by word of mouth? Archy Glen is appointed to be here the day after tomorrow, and will go again probably about Saturday: after that the Coast will be perfectly clear. Could not you come up next wednesday, and send me word by Rob that you are waiting? I would come down any day and bring you up: I have some business at any rate. Now, my dear Mother, what say you to this? I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> very heartily you would come, and <hi rend="italic">think</hi> you ought to do it? If your poor little Pony were roadworthy, it would be all easy: but I doubt that, and must ask one of the Boys to help you: <pb id="pg-07-128" n="07-128"/>either Jemmy or Sandy will do it for a word. As for the Pony in regard to your future riding, never mind <hi rend="italic">it;</hi> you shall have Harry, who is a known roadster, and he will be very glad of you. But come on Wednesday! At lowest, tell me when you are coming. But I think you will come.</p>
<p>Tell Alick that I wish very much to take counsel with him about a great many things here, and should like well to know when he is coming. The sooner the better news for me.</p>
<p>Jane bids me state the sad news that our meal is just about clean done! We shall need more, of course; a stock more: however about 2 stones would perhaps suit us best at present; and that I could bring up in the Gig when I went for you. Another reason for your coming!</p>
<p>Thus, my dear Mother, have I scribbled your sheet full&#x2014;of nothing. I know, nevertheless, that you will like it <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than nothing. I have a hundred questions to ask you already, and many things to say which writing is too slow for. I pray always that the Great Father may have you in his keeping; which I know you also do for me. <closer><salute>May He bless you all with His own blessing!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>I remain ever, / My Dear Mother&#x2014; Your affectionate /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jean has authority to break up this Letter, and read Jack&#x2019;s that is in it. Let her seal this again with wax, and seal it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>.&#x2014; Tell Mary to write, and as fully as she possibly can, if you are not coming.</p>
<p>[JWC&#x2019;s postscript:]</p>
<p>All well here mother not a moment to thank Mary for her letter or to tell you any thing I will likely write next week&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p><salute>Dear Mary,&#x2014;</salute> I was very much obliged by your little note of Wednesday last; glad to learn that my mother continued in her usual way; that James and you had determined on trying Annan, which I think far preferable to any farming speculation, in the present state of matters. I hope Alick and he have got well rid of the ill Horse, and that you will soon get a good one, and be fairly under way in the <pb id="pg-07-129" n="07-129"/>enterprise. No doubt both of you will do your very best: be prudent, diligent, and thrifty; minding only your own affairs, and your neighbour&#x2019;s only in so far as you can <hi rend="italic">do him some good:</hi> this is the rule for succeeding in all things; and, in the present thing, I really flatter myself you have a very fair chance. However, you must not be discouraged at first; bear steadfastly on, in the <hi rend="italic">determination</hi> to prevail: remember, as the proverb says, &#x201C;There is a <foreign>dub</foreign> [puddle] at every town-end, and a <foreign>loch</foreign> [lake] at <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. A. Henderson, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>), p. 94: &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a dub at ilka door.&#x201D;</note> There is none of us but will heartily rejoice to see you do well; and be ready to assist you if we can.&#x2014; So I hope it will all turn out for the best, and another year see us all settled more to our minds than at present.</p>
<p>As to my mother, of whom I again long for news, I am not without some hope of even seeing her tomorrow, if she fell in with my advice; for Jane and I are going to Dumfries ourselves to do various things; at least, I am; for as to her I fear she does not look very like going; a headache having sent her to bed tonight directly after tea. She is not better yet; but thinks she may perhaps be so before to-morrow. I expect a Letter at least, if not my mother in person, and to have the day named when she is coming.</p>
<p>My chief reason for writing to-night, however, is this. A woman came yesterday over from Penpont,<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Village and parish 9 miles NE of Craigenputtoch.</note> very earnest about buying Noolie our Cow. I chanced to be over at Barjarg Library, and she did not see me till after dark, and so had to stay all night. The answer I gave her was as follows. That a sister of mine was likely to be wanting precisely such a Cow at Whitsunday; that for no price, accordingly, could I sell the Animal till my sister had the refusal of her; that if she, the Penpont woman, however (who seemed a very decent body), would say what the cow was worth to her, I would mention it to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and have an answer on Wednesday next but one, which answer should be conveyed to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> next Post-day. The Penpont woman answered, with various hummings, about &#x201C;cows growing auld,&#x201D; and &#x201C;a&#x2019; kinds o&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">beess</hi> fa&#x2019;ing g&#x2019;ennow,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;All kinds of beasts falling in value just now.&#x201D;</note> and so forth, that she would give &#xa3;3 sterling money for Noolie, and the calf she was daily expected to have: to pay down the money and receive the two animals on Whitsunday morning. Whereupon I told Grace to give her some supper and put her to bed; and so it rests.</p>
<p>Now you are to consider, maturely, and take counsel with the rest, <pb id="pg-07-130" n="07-130"/>whether this Beast is worth as much to you, or is not worth so much. You know her age and all her ways far better than I do: they say her condition at present is what it used to be after wintering on rye grass, and that tho&#x2019; she never gave (to actual measure) her twenty-one daily quarts of milk last year, they thought it was not a falling off on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> part, but on some other thing&#x2019;s or person&#x2019;s, that occasioned it. So consider it, as I said: and let me know by some Letter or other means next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Perhaps Alick himself will be here then. I long much to see him; but suppose he is too busy at present in this fine <supplied>[&#x2026;]</supplied> weather. Tell him to come as soon as he possibly can.</p>
<p>We get word from Mrs Austin that the House I talked of was <supplied>[vir]</supplied>tually missed, and no longer &#x201C;for to let&#x201D;; but she spoke with great confidence and kindness about getting us another somewhat like it. We have heard some vague rumours of some kind of tenant for this house, but have never yet heard the sound of any actual offer. I hardly ever expected it would let.</p>
<p>Tell my mother (if she be not come to-morrow) that I got myself scolded last week for not making the smallest acknowledgment for those <foreign><hi rend="italic">chuckas</hi></foreign> [hens] (the fattest ever seen here): and really I think deserved it. I made abundant acknowledgments by <hi rend="italic">eating</hi> them in a proper manner.&#x2014; Jane is not here, and cannot send you her remembrances. <closer><salute>I salute you all with my best affection. And so Goodnight, with all good, to Scotsbrig and whatever is in it!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Your affectionate Brother, /</salute></closer>
<name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Train up your children, my dear Sister, above all things, never on any account to <hi rend="italic">lie</hi>. The longer I live the more clearly I see how that is the beginning of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> vice. &#x201C;God <hi rend="italic">hates</hi> a Liar.&#x201D;</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Letters are rare, too rare, in their outward quality of sequence thro&#x2019; the Post; but happily still rarer in their inward quality: the hope and kind trustful sympathy of new Eighteen dwelling unworn under hair, which you tell me is getting tinged with grey! It is actually true <pb id="pg-07-131" n="07-131"/>that we are coming to London; so far have Destiny and a little Resolution brought it. The kind Mrs Austin, after search enough, has now (we imagine) found us a House; which I hope and believe is not very far from yours: it shall be farther than my widest calculation, if I fail to meet your challenge, and walk and talk with you to all lengths. I know not well how Chelsea lies from the Parish Church of Kensington; but it is within sight of the latter that we are to be; and some &#x201C;trysting-tree&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A tree at which to meet.</note> (do you know so much Scotch?) is already getting into leaf, as yet unconscious of its future honour, between these two suburbs of Babylon. Some days too we will walk the whole day long, in wide excursion; you lecturing me on the phenomena of the region, which to you are native: my best amusement is walking; I like, as well as Hadrian himself, to mete out my world with steps of my own, and so take possession of it.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister, Works</hi>, XXIV, 414.</note> But if to this you add Speech! Is not Speech defined to be cheerfuller than Light, and the Eldest Daughter of Heaven?<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>I have seen nothing of you for a long time, except what of the &#x201C;Delicacies of Pigdriving&#x201D; my <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> once gave me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had read a review of Hunt&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Indicator and Companion</hi>, 2 vols.

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>You have heard nothing of me for more weeks than usual;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had written to Carlyle on <date when="1834-03-02">2 March</date> in another effort to establish the common ground and the difference between his mind and Carlyle&#x2019;s. See Mineka, XII, 216&#x2013;20.</note> and probably guess the reason. Having the near and nearer prospect of meeting you face to face, and discussing with boundless convenience the much that lies between us, I say to myself, Indolence eagerly assenting: Why write? These weighty matters, treated on little scraps of paper, were but mistreated: let them lie over till we can speak and answer! This little Note, then, comes chiefly as a memento of my continued being and goodwill; above all of my continued, unsated, insatiable appetite to hear from you. Thus prudent kitchenmaids, when the Pump will not act otherwise, pour in a little quart of water, and expect confidently to get gallons. May it prove so!</p>
<p>In fact, my Friend, I feel as if it were rather questionable to meddle at all with these Beliefs of yours; as if my influence, granting that I had much, might rather unsettle and perplex than forward and strengthen. You are already happily not closed in, which I trust you will never be, yet compacted and adjusted into vigorous healthful growth, and go on your way with firm footing and cheerful heart: this, as I take it, is all that any kind of world-theory can do for any man. As you grow farther, and the new want arises, then will the new light be in season; properly for the first time, at once desirable and <pb id="pg-07-134" n="07-134"/>possible. However, as there is no spiritual secret between us, I promise you while we live together the amplest insight into my whole way of thought; you shall look till you tire into my inward household, and see the strange farrago of broken pots and Achilles&#x2019; shields, of lumber-heaps and scattered pearl-grains I keep there; and shall wonder at it, I doubt not; and even profit by it, as one man always does by earnest sympathy with another; as I myself hope to do by you in return. You shall also instruct me about innumerable things in London which it deeply concerns me to be no longer ignorant of; and so I beg of you before hand to speak with all freedom of utterance, as I shall listen with the understanding heart; and let us stand by one another in mutual help, in thankfulness and tolerance, giving and forgiving, while the Fates will so allow it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Quod bonum faustum felixque fortunatum sit!</hi></foreign><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18151211-TC-RM-01"><sic>1:67</sic><corr>TC to RM, <date when="1815-12-11">11 Dec. 1815</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>I have not written a word these many months; I feel as if it were the impossiblest thing to put pen to paper in this mood. You will find me altered and altering; my world widens but grows also more unmanageable. Oh an altogether unfathomable world! Fearful and wonderful; that is all I can freely express of it. Nevertheless, one is never wretched with the feeling of growth in him; you feel as if some time or other the day of utterance <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come, and the world meanwhile might go which way soever it would not but go; the rather as its bounties, beyond food and clothes, were a thing you could more and more see into the meaning of. In some few years we shall be in Eternity; naked and bare before the Eternal: there is no fact in Heaven or Earth more indubitable than this! <hi rend="italic">Believe</hi> it then; and work patiently in welldoing.</p>
<p>I have read great quantities of Books; I fear, with more capacity of throat than power of digestion. In fact, there is so little worth attempting to digest. &#x201C;Froth and coagulated water,&#x201D; the hungry soul swallows them and is not fed.&#x2014; By the bye, have your Books lost their flavour of whisky yet? I hope and pray, the whisky was not spilled on them, but only imparted its odour not its substance!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his last letter Mill had said: &#x201C;The parcel of books came through Tait, a considerable time before they were announced; &#x26; came safe, but, by what misadventure I know not, saturated with whiskey: from the odour of which it will require considerable airing to free them, so thoroughly are they impregnated.&#x201D;</note> I remember I rather liked, not <hi rend="italic">Arthur Coningsby</hi>, yet the Author of it,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to John Sterling and his novel <hi rend="italic">Arthur Coningsby</hi>, 3 vols.

The astonishing thing is the contrast of the man and his enterprise:</p>
<p>Weightiest of harrows, what horse shall ply it?</p>
<p>Cheeriest of sparrows meanwhile will try it.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note></p>
<p>But the reading worth all other readings continues to be my <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>. Glorious old Book, which one would save, next after the Bible, from a universal conflagration of Books! I will talk to you about this till your head ring with it, as my own does.</p>
<p>Mrs Austin has probably told you of her heroic search after a house for us, and how we are to be her and your neighbours; in Kensington. It is well done. We grieve heartily at poor Mr A.&#x2019;s afflictions; a really sad case! &#x201C;Hope deferred maketh the heart sick.&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prov. 13:12.</note>&#x2014; Those <hi rend="italic">Notes on the Newspapers</hi> would be a dainty for me, could I get them.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill&#x2019;s &#x201C;Notes on the Newspapers,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Monthly Repository</hi>, VIII (<date when="1834-03-00">March</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-09-00">Sept. 1834</date>), the purpose of which according to Mill in his last letter was to give &#x201C;a picture of our &#x2018;statesmen&#x2019; &#x26; their doings, taken from the point of view of a radical to whom yet radicalism in itself is but a small thing.&#x201D;</note> I see you often of late in the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, at first, and at second hand; for I know everything of yours, as soon as I read the first line.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I must no longer delay to thank you for the welcome present of your <hi rend="italic">Faust;</hi> the more welcome from your kind manner of bestowing <pb id="pg-07-136" n="07-136"/>it. I have been so busy that time for a &#x201C;patient comparison with the original&#x201D; would never yet offer itself: meanwhile in looking over your work, many spirited passages have struck me; and as yet only one Error: that vague couplet, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Die Gegenwart von einem braven Knaben</hi></foreign> [The presence of a brave boy]; in which it is much easier to say that you and others are wrong than who or what is right. I advised Hayward<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Abraham Hayward (<date when="1801-00-00">1801</date>&#x2013;<date when="1884-00-00">84</date>), translator of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>). Carlyle refers to <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, I, l. 79 (<hi rend="italic">Vorspiel auf dem Theater</hi>). See TC&#x2019;s review of Hayward&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, appended to <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330501-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-05-01">1 May 1833</date></ref>.</note> to make it, in his second Edition: &#x201C;The present time by (in the hands of) a fellow of ability&#x201D;; but that also only satisfies me on the ground that with Goethe himself rhyme would sometimes have its way.</p>
<lg><l>For rhymes the rudder are of verses,</l>
<l>With which like ships they steer their courses.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Hudibras</hi>, I, i, 457&#x2013;58.</note></l></lg>
<p>The Newspapers, I perceive, acknowledge your merits and endeavours in a hearty style; which is all one can expect of Criticism at present. Let us hope your labours in the German vineyard, which has much lack of honest hands, are but beginning yet, and will lead you to richer and richer results.</p>
<p>Of your Preface and prose Notes I can speak deliberately; and in terms of great commendation. There is a spirit of openness, of free recognition and appropriation which I love much, which I reckon far more precious than any specialty of talent or acquired skill; inasmuch as that is the root of all talent and all skill. Keep an &#x201C;open sense&#x201D;; an eye for the &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">offne Geheimniss</hi></foreign> [open secret],&#x201D; which so few discern! With this much is possible; without it as good as nothing.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. &#x201C;open secret,&#x201D; &#x201C;open sense,&#x201D; and &#x201C;open loving heart&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXVIII, 57, 58, 70. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Offne Geheimniss</hi></foreign>&#x201D; comes from Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Maximen und Reflexionen</hi>, ed. M. Hecker (Weimar, <date when="1907-00-00">1907</date>), p. 35.</note></p>
<p>For the rest, that I must dissent from you somewhat both in regard to the First and the Second Part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, is but a small matter. We agree in spirit; this itself is an agreement to let each take his own way in details. Could you but have as much tolerance for me in this new heresy, which I, alas, feel growing upon me of late years: That <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> is intrinsically but a small <hi rend="italic">Poem</hi>, perhaps the smallest of Goethe&#x2019;s <pb id="pg-07-137" n="07-137"/>main works; recommending itself to the sorrow-struck sceptical feeling of these times, but for Time at large of very limited value! Such, I profess not without reluctance, is the sentiment that has long lurked in me: moreover of the two I find considerably <hi rend="italic">more</hi> meaning in the <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> Part. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Favete linguis</hi></foreign> [Attention please]. At the same time I can well enter into your enthusiasm, and again read Faust along with you like a new Apocalypse, for in that way I read it once already. Ten years hence you shall tell me how it is.</p>
<p>We are leaving this boggy Patmos, and getting under way for London. It will give me true pleasure to hear of you; to hear that you advance successfully in all kinds of welldoing. There is no young literary man about Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi>, from whom more is to be expected. When you come southward, you will see us? Do not fail, if you would please us.</p>
<closer><salute>With the heartiest good-wishes and thanks, / I remain always, / My Dear Sir, / Faithfully Yours,</salute></closer>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Your Books return to you today, which have lain here finished these two weeks, waiting for an opportunity that seemed safe. I hope you will receive them uninjured; you certainly receive them with many just thanks, for they were most kindly sent, as many others have been, and afforded me great entertainment, as well as a fair modicum of profit too. <hi rend="italic">Heyne</hi> is a huge quarry; in which, however, tho&#x2019; under chaotic quarrylike arrangement, all manner of needful materials lie: I have dug hither and thither thro&#x2019; him, and found several things. Blackwall one may call a <hi rend="italic">flare</hi> of trumpet-music, in the bravura style too common in his time and since; sweet enough but meaningless or nearly so. The best of all, to his bulk, is <hi rend="italic">Payne Knight</hi>; a sound, methodical, compact man, worthy of all acception. Let me add only of the brave <hi rend="italic">Voss</hi>, that if you at any time want a translation of <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi>, you will find Voss&#x2019;s not only the best of that old Singer, but perhaps <pb id="pg-07-138" n="07-138"/>the best ever excecuted of any Singer, under such circumstances: a really effectual work, which one rejoices to look into, true, genuine to the heart in every line. And so here ends for the present my intercourse with <hi rend="italic">Homer:</hi> I have read several Books of his Rhapsody as with spectacles, and diligently surveyed all the rest; and leave it with increased knowledge, and love it better than any other Book, I think, except the Bible alone. It is not the richest intrinsically perhaps, but the richest-oldest, and stands in such an environment as no other.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the authors mentioned here, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340130-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1834-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref> He refers to his reading of them in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> entry for <date when="1834-03-19">19 March</date>.</note></p>
<p>Here too, I believe, my kind Friend, ends your Book-dealings with Craigenputtoch, for all things have an end! Never more, it is like, will you send me Books hither; this scene of your activity terminates now, and truly in retiring you have a right to say <foreign><hi rend="italic">Plaudite</hi></foreign>,&#x2014;or rather <foreign><hi rend="italic">Plaude</hi></foreign>, (for it is I that am interested in it), which thinking of all your attentiveness I can well assure you that I heartily do.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Plaude</hi> (singular), <hi rend="italic">plaudite</hi> (plural, imperative of &#x201C;to applaud&#x201D;); in Carlyle&#x2019;s youth he would have known of it as a short expression of appreciation from the audience; and Francis Espinasse recalls that at Dickens&#x2019;s production of <hi rend="italic">The Merry Wives of Windsor</hi> in <date when="1848-00-00">1848</date> Carlyle said &#x201C;&#x2018;a poor play,&#x2019; but cried &#x2018;plaudite, plaudite!&#x2019;&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Literary Recollections</hi>, London, <date when="1893-00-00">1893</date>, p. 267).</note> Probably the Newspaper I sent might indicate to you that we were bound for London. It is even so: we go thither at Whitsunday; to what fates the Upper Powers have provided us, for hitherto it is as dark and vague as you could fancy. One must <hi rend="italic">take</hi> the flood, and swim in it with a stout heart and an open eye.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Julius Caesar</hi>, IV, iii.</note> The whole aspect of Existence has long ceased to give me any transcendent terror; I know it of old to be hollowness and foam and theatrical sham, yet with an Eternity lying beyond it, looking thro&#x2019; it, <hi rend="italic">which is true</hi>. Considering all this, what manner of man ought ye to be,&#x2014;whether your forks be of silver, or ye have no forks at all! The life of an Author, which is now mine without remedy, is externally, and too often internally, among the most difficult and painfullest given to man; nevertheless to this also, with all its heights and depths, one must address himself: pray for me only that I do not become a Scoundrel;&#x2014;in the highest garret I have no other prayer.</p>
<p>Our address, I imagine, will be 4. Holland Street, Kensington;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The house which Mrs. Austin had found for the Carlyles but in which they never lived.</note> but till after tomorrow this is not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> certain: however, I will take care to send you some token; some special <hi rend="italic">written</hi> notice if we are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to <pb id="pg-07-139" n="07-139"/>anchor there. A Dumfries Newspaper or some such thing may serve to affirm, if that is all that is wanted; for I am like to be very much hurried. We count too that we shall see you from time to time; oftener there than we could do here. I would not have you forget me: when I look up towards Edinburgh now, there is almost nothing else that it gives me much pain to part from. My much respected Motherland has given me much, much of priceless value; but of men that I love no great overplus.</p>
<p>And now, my Friend, quitting your end of the Island, my last and continual advice is, stand by the Truth, tho&#x2019; the Arch-Devil hindered you! A man has no other footing in this world, but what is mere pasteboard, which vanishing in <foreign>reek</foreign> [smoke], <hi rend="italic">he</hi> sinks to endless depths. Another precept, which perhaps I myself need more than you, is, Not to hate, only to pity and avoid, those that follow Lies. Patience! Patience! whosoever is not against us is for us.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle reverses the concept of Matt. 12:30: &#x201C;He that is not with me is against me.&#x201D;</note> The noisiest of Gigmen, is not his Gig-spring <hi rend="italic">already</hi> breaking? Alas, it inevitably breaks; and he&#x2014;whither goes <hi rend="italic">he!</hi> Out of thy way, at any rate. And so</p>
<lg><l>Jog on, jog on the footpathway,</l>
<l>And <hi rend="italic">merrily</hi> bend the stile-a:</l>
<l>A merry heart goes all the day,</l>
<l>A sad one tires in a mile-a.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">The Winter&#x2019;s Tale</hi>, IV, iii.</note></l></lg>
<p>You see in what a state my Pen is; otherwise I had much more of this sort to dilate on. Better as it is!</p>
<p>Did I tell you that your friend <hi rend="italic">Teufels</hi><hi rend="small-caps">dr&#xF6;ckh</hi> is publishing his lucubrations in a London Magazine? The Public seems to receive him with fixed ba<supplied>[yonets.]</supplied> Little wonder. I hope to forward you a complete copy so soon as the business is done; perhaps some two months hence.</p>
<p>Your letter gave both of us not a little amusement, and a better sort of satisfaction than that; as all your letters do. I pray you forget not to send us a word now and then when we are farther off. Moir never writes; and at best only shews himself as thro&#x2019; a keyhole, when he does. Nevertheless I have kindness for the good little man; and beg you again to tell him so&#x2014;in the politest speech you have.</p>
<p>With friendliest wishes and hopes, wherein your good Dame is not <pb id="pg-07-140" n="07-140"/>forgotten, and mine heartily joins, I bid you farewell. <closer><salute>May God bless you always!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
<p>In your last Letter you asked to be permitted to look us out a House in your neighbourhood. By a strange turn of the cards, it chances this day that we find ourselves in the very state to profit by your bounty. Our expected Kensington House has evaporated, and we are here, alone, with all the world before us where to choose.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, XII, 646.</note></p>
<p>In a fortnight, accordingly, I expect to see you, on that quest. Mrs Austin is still angling in Kensington for us. If you will fish Chelsea, I shall almost at once know what I am about. The more necessary as the time is rapidly expiring!</p>
<p>As you have not only two eyes of your own, but who knows how many other pairs of <hi rend="italic">younger</hi> ones (and as bright as any in England), perhaps you may discover something. <closer><salute>At all events, this commission may amuse your walks a little; you have here the announcement of a visit which I know will agreeably occupy your thoughts; and so with hopes of a speedy meeting and prayers that it may be a glad one, I remain,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Eckermann,</salute>
<p>At length, after the long tempestuous winter, your kind Message, of the <date when="1833-11-10">10<hi rend="italic">th</hi> November 1833</date>,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Published with a translation in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 334&#x2013;37.</note> reaches me, some days ago; a slow but most welcome arrival. It is grievous to think how our Correspondence seems to have misgone of late: your &#x201C;Letter of last summer&#x201D; never got hither; while of mine at least two seem to have been lost! My last notice from you was the Packet of winter gone a year; which, I well remember, <hi rend="italic">met</hi> me (in the hands of a country-man, on its way hither), one wild day, in the valley of Glenessland, among these mountains; and was rapidly uncased, and eagerly examined in spite of the winds. I found in it the articles you mention: a Letter from yourself;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eckermann&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1832-10-20">20 Oct. 1832</date>, published and translated in Norton, <hi rend="italic">GC</hi>, pp. 328&#x2013;32.</note> the last <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heft</hi></foreign> [Part] of <hi rend="italic">Kunst und Alterthum</hi>, Herr von M&#xfc;ller&#x2019;s interesting Pamphlet, both with a most friendly inscription from his own hand; lastly H. Schwerdtgeburth&#x2019;s Engraving,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321202-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1832-12-02">2 Dec. 1832</date></ref>.</note> and the Medal from Madam von Goethe. A grateful copious answer failed not from me, by the next Post; and this, it appears, was an answer spoken to the winds! Truly you have need of Faith, you my Friends in Weimar; in which too I rejoice to see you are actually not deficient. Will you now, my dear Eckermann, at this late hour, repeat to yourself and the rest all the thanks you can fancy I expressed: say to Madam von Goethe that her medal lies on our mantel-piece still in the envelope of her handwriting, in a little casket of Roman Porphyry (that once belonged to Kaiser Nero), and daily reminds us of her. Neither has her promise of a Letter been forgotten by us; nor, as we will now again hope, by her. Tell the <foreign>Geheime<supplied>[n]</supplied>rath</foreign> [Privy Councillor] that I read and again read, in more languages than one, his valuable Paper, with true satisfaction; and feel myself richer for his esteem. And now let us hope that no such rupture and dislocation may again occur in our intercourse, while earthly Distance alone divides us! Nay I am just coming <pb id="pg-07-142" n="07-142"/>nearer you; if not much in physical miles, yet in social conveniency much.</p>
<p>For this, my Friend, is the last Letter you are ever like to receive from Craigenputtoch: we remove to London next Whitsuntide; I in <hi rend="italic">two days</hi> hence, to make preparation on the spot; and there henceforth we have our residence. That it is a great outward change this, you will readily guess; yet scarcely how great it is: from the most quiescent solitude in this world to precisely the most tumultuous, never-slumbering, immeasurable Babylon that the Sun looks down on! The thought of it fills me with vague, <hi rend="italic">huge</hi> forebodings; but I feel the step to be inevitable, clearly necessary, and at lowest study to defy it. Often too I bethink me with comfort of our Goethe&#x2019;s saying, grounded on wise insight, and ever anew applicable and precious: &#x201C;We look upon our Scholars as so many <hi rend="italic">Swimmers</hi>, who, in the element that threatened to devour them, feel themselves unexpectedly buoyed up, and by its very obstruction borne along.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle&#x2019;s translation of <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Travels, Works</hi>, XXIV, 321; and <hi rend="italic">Past and Present, Works</hi>, X, 199.</note> True, how true! So <hi rend="italic">let</hi> us <hi rend="italic">swim</hi>, lustily while life is left, in this or the other water, with more way or with less; and, if only in the right direction, bless our Destiny. Phlegethon-Fleetditch<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A stream of Hell fire compounded with sewerage-polluted water.</note> is what I used to name the London Water-way; but once for all, Literature, I find, so mad is its state becoming and become, <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> be carried on elsewhere by an Englishman: thro&#x2019; Phlegethon-Fleetditch, therefore, our course does lie; and we will take it, by God&#x2019;s blessing, with as little criticism as possible. And so the &#x201C;whinstone castle of Craigenputtoch&#x201D; stands henceforth vacant, or tenanted only by double-barrelled grouse-destroying men, who know not Weimar; and you are to figure us in quite another environment.</p>
<p>If to all this external complication you add that for a long while I have felt myself in a kind of spiritual crisis also, wherein you doubtless know by experience how frightful it is to <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> till the issue have decided itself,&#x2014;it will seem natural enough that I have written less this year than for any of the last ten; and published of this year&#x2019;s writing absolutely nothing. By and by, if the Heavens smile on me, I shall have a thing or two to say. With German Literature especially I have had as good as no concern; the few new Books, that have reached me, are mere <hi rend="italic">Heynes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">B&#xF6;rnes</hi>,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >C. G. Heyne (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340130-TC-HI-01">TC to HI, <date when="1834-01-30">30 Jan.</date></ref>); and Ludwig B&#xF6;rne, pseud. of Lob Baruch (<date when="1786-00-00">1786</date>&#x2013;<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), German political writer and satirist.</note> and such like; of no value, or of less than none. My Goethe and all that belongs to him stands <pb id="pg-07-143" n="07-143"/>out ever the grander, the more genuine, as I myself increase; yet stands out, I might say, as an object <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>, to which there will be no <hi rend="italic">continuation</hi> made; like a granite Promontory, high and sheer, stretching far into the waste chaos; yet not <hi rend="italic">thro</hi>&#x2019; it; thro&#x2019; it, the world seems seeking itself <hi rend="italic">another</hi> road,&#x2014;or losing all aim of any. To me most significant, forever <foreign><hi rend="italic">bedeutungsvoll, verehrungsw&#xfc;rdig</hi></foreign> [momentous, venerable]! With him and his, however, it seems as if my labours in the German field might profitably terminate, at least make pause. As respects our own England again, my task in that direction, so far as it was my task, may be considered amply done: witness only this one fact, that within the last twelvemonths we have had no fewer than three new Translations of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, two of them published at Edinburgh on the same day.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The two translations published in Edinburgh were by D. Syme (Edinburgh, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>) and by J. S. Blackie (Edinburgh and London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>); the other new translation was by A. Hayward (London, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>, 2nd ed. <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>); there was also a fourth by [Warburton Davies] (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>).</note> In fact, the fire is kindled, and there is smoke enough and to spare. Here and there a little flame too; as in Mrs Austin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Goethe</hi>, which you have doubtless seen. All is in the course of nature; it will all be flame one day, and cheerful light; whereby for the present let the smoke itself be cheerfully welcomed:&#x2014;and thou, take thy bellows elsewhither! This is one face of the &#x201C;spiritual crisis&#x201D; I spoke of: how it will end and is ending I hope to give you some tokens, if I can collect in London any scraps of my late publishings from the vortex of Periodicals, which latter is like to be for a good while our <hi rend="italic">only</hi> method of publishing; at least mine, greatly as I dislike it.</p>
<p>In such a position towards my old favourites, judge whether I will welcome that <hi rend="italic">Correspondence of Goethe and Zelter</hi> announced in your last Packet. Zelter himself, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">t&#xfc;chtige Mann und Maurer</hi></foreign> [able man and mason], is a figure I look upon with almost filial love, from what I know of him; that Goethe should have so loved him is to me another beautiful proof of his own all-comprehending <hi rend="italic">T&#xfc;chtigkeit</hi> [ability]. The Book, I imagine, has already arrived in England; but I shall not know till I have seen London.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Zelter&#x2019;s book was <hi rend="italic">Briefwechsel zwischen Goethe und Zelter</hi>, ed. F. W. Reimer, 6 vols. (Berlin, <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>).

Thanks for your kind offer to send them to me. I will most gladly accept the Packet whatever its carriage may cost: the <foreign><hi rend="italic">Werke</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>] are all here, presented by <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and I would have the whole of a sort. But in any case the carriage, I fancy, <pb id="pg-07-144" n="07-144"/>will cost little. What our address in London will be is yet unfixed; in the meanwhile that of &#x201C;Messrs Black, Young and Young, Foreign Booksellers, Tavistock Street, Covent-Garden, London&#x201D; will always find me, and for aught but Postletters probably be the best. They have an Agent in Leipzig (one Herbig: I think, probably known to your Weimar Booksellers); once in his hands, any Parcel would reach me in few weeks.</p>
<p>When we have cast anchor in London you shall hear from me again. Let me pray that this Letter too be not lost. If you think of writing to me very soon, which I hope you will, the above address will serve, or this of &#x201C;Mrs Austin, 5. Orme-Square, Bayswater, London&#x201D; will serve still better.&#x2014; Tell me, I pray you, more and more specially what you are engaged in, what looking towards.

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I snatch a moment for you in the tumult of Packing, that I may not depart without a word. Tomorrow morning I must set off to London; <pb id="pg-07-145" n="07-145"/>our arrangements there are like to get into confusion unless I appear forthwith in person. You will excuse any degree of brevity.</p>
<p>William has not changed sensibly since you left us; he is quiet, mild, with an air frequently of sadness, and less rather than more of confusedness mingled in it; spends much of his time in walking to a short distance from home; has seen much less of us than usual, and appears to take well enough with that alteration. He comes up in general some once in the two days; but stays only a very little while, and has seldom any long conversation with me. I have little doubt he will continue to go on with Peter&#x2019;s<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Peter Austin&#x2019;s.

<p>[Portion of two sentences cut away. &#x2026;] more &#x201C;gigantic spirit,&#x201D; or indeed. &#x2026; was hardly anything wrong in his appearances here: but in these moments I believe he keeps himself on his guard; and so it is the best of him we see. The Austin&#x2019;s hear him frequently &#x201C;speaking to himself in two or three voices&#x201D;; going on, I suppose, with that old system of &#x201C;ventriloquism,&#x201D; the echoes of which have not yet left him at rest.</p>
<p>I was in his room last night; and, by dint of his cross-questionings, was forced to admit that I was to set off on Thursday morning, and there was little chance of our meeting here soon again. He seemed considerably affected, but composed himself very manfully, and I had some of the most rational discourse with him that has occurred between us. He is to be here this evening to tea; and then we take leave; not without sorrow on either side. However, I am of opinion that as matters stand my absence can be a very small evil to him, perhaps hardly any. His deliverance has to be worked out in the struggles and sufferings of his own soul; and with these, in very many cases, it is better that the stranger intermeddle not.</p>
<p>In fine, my dear Sir, it continues in spite of all contradictory prognostics to be my firm conviction, or faith, that your Brother is not born to be always a misery to himself and you, that if God spare him alive some years, it will be to make him a blessing to you both. So be it, in His name! For the rest, feel not impatient at delays, at disappointments: his cure, it appears to me, <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be slow, so much <pb id="pg-07-146" n="07-146"/>impure matter has he to work out of him; but on the other hand who can let himself believe that such force of endowment is lamed without recovery? My word still is: <foreign>Esperance!</foreign></p>
<p>I cannot yet give you our London Address; it is yet to try for whether we shall so much as get a house!</p>

<salute>Dearest Heart,</salute>
<p>Here am I once more seated on the sofa, by this old ricketty table, where you have so often sat looking over on me: I have had my Frank since yesterday, with Sister Jean&#x2019;s address on it, who will not let the sheet loiter in Dumfries; I give you the top of the morning, and will write down my whole confused experiences for you with as little confusion as I yet can. What a time it seems since we were parted, tho&#x2019; by the calendar, it counts only some nine days! Oh, my Love, if I were to write all the loving things I have thought of thee, whole quires would not hold it. Blessed be the Heavens, I have thee to wife; my own, while existence is granted us; we are not yet parted forever, but only, by God&#x2019;s grace, for some few days longer. As I have quantities of the most perplexed matters to write of, and all things yet stand at sixes and sevens with me, I will take the old-established order of time, and endeavour to sketch you the whole of it that seems sketchable.</p>
<p>You remember the Friday, what a bright day it was: Alick will have told you how he lay in wait for me at Shillahill Bridge<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Between Catlinns and Scotsbrig, in Middlebie parish. Carlyle recalled in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> how his meeting with Alick was &#x201C;one little thing I shall perhaps <hi rend="italic">never</hi> forget, slight as it looked and was.&#x2014; They are all good to me; how good, and over good!&#x201D;</note> the night before, a friendly apparition that I think will stick fast in my memory; how we parted from Scotsbrig, all with dry eyes as beseemed heroes and heroines; then of poor Mary&#x2019;s breakfast, and how I waved my hat to the two Boys watching me at Annan-foot, and turned away from the last true hearts I had in Scotland. Fancy that I spent the day, as one might in a Solway Steamboat of but moderate arrangements (for having declined Dinner at two o&#x2019;clock, there was <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> afterwards <pb id="pg-07-147" n="07-147"/>to be had but the miserablest Tea, at seven: this I mention for your own guidance); that as the Night sank, the gleam of Liverpool arose far over the waters, and the red Light of &#x201C;the Rock,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably Black Rock light, about three miles downstream in the Mersey channel from where Carlyle would have docked.</note> and other Lights floating and fixed, amid which steering with address, yet not without bellowings and swearings, we came rushing up to the Clarence Dock about two in the morning, and were informed we could not enter, but might land over planks. Such as had homes did so: I preferred a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> visit to my horse-manger of a Bed, where by aid of a biscuit and glass of diluted brandy, I succeeded a little better than before. From six to nine, was first long waiting, then quick walking; and then your good Uncle, at Maryland Street,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Where Jane&#x2019;s uncle John Welsh lived.</note> opened the door for me himself, and insisted on walking with me till I had deposited my two Stewartkins (Gillenbie&#x2019;s Sons,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sons of the tenant of Gillenbie Rig farm, near Catlinns, presumably named Stewart.</note> whom Alick would speak of) at their address. Figure Maryland Street in rather better than its common palmy state: all kindness, all copiousness, only no bedroom that you had not to share with a neighbour. However, in spite of Alick,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Son of John Welsh.</note> who indeed was very quiet, and even of bugs, who also behaved most mildly, I slept both nights, if not long yet well, and felt quite unexpectedly rested. Arbuckle<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311227-JWC-MWE-01">JWC to <sic>MW</sic><corr>MWE</corr>, <date when="1831-12-27">Dec. 1831</date></ref>.</note> you will see with pleasure: a most meekly composed, devout-minded, actively methodical, altogether friendly appearance, of whom you can predict nothing but good. His Sister also is with him: one long-drawn Sigh of Galloway Sentimentalism, whom you must tolerate as you can. With him especially I had long conferences, and was carried hither and thither in the despatch of various business. Gather now the result of what we did.</p>
<p>Pickford&#x2019;s<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Already a well-known removal firm.</note> rate of carriage is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> lower than six and sixpence a hundredweight for the average of Furniture (6 shillings for the cheapest sort, 7 for the dearest); there are various charges for conveyance from Dock to Dock in Liverpool; on the other hand no &#x201C;wharfage-dues&#x201D; at London, as by the Steamboats there is; which two things may nearly balance one another. By the &#x201C;St. George Steampacket Company&#x201D; again the lowest charge is 9 pence per square foot, accurately measured; they do not take above two days longer than Pickford, perhaps no longer at all. In the Steamboat (for it lies beside <pb id="pg-07-148" n="07-148"/>the Annan one) the goods have only to be lifted out on the Quay and laid in again, an operation both Arbuckle and your Uncle offered to superintend; after which there is no more shifting till London, and thus hardly any risk of farther breakage. By the Pickford method, we have, as I ascertained, at least <hi rend="italic">three</hi> unloadings and reloadings (instead of one) before reaching London; the people also &#x201C;will not be responsible&#x201D; for the complete safety of anything that is not &#x201C;packed in skeleton cases,&#x201D; that is in square boxes, or ghosts of boxes rather (made like hen-coops, as I understood); for us a thing clearly impossible. With good mat-packing, however, I seemed to see that the damage was not likely to be <hi rend="italic">great</hi>, so careful is the Pickfordian Establishment generally: but without doubt it is likely to be something, and I should believe considerably greater than by the Steamboat way. So far the latter method then is preferable; but now as to the respective <hi rend="italic">costs</hi> of the two I could not with all my inquiring get to any clear result, tho&#x2019; in this too my surmise inclined favourably to the Steam Company: for does not Alick think, for example, that a mass of 9 cubic feet will on the average weigh more than eight stone? By steam the cost of 9 feet is 81<hi rend="italic">d</hi>; by canal 1 cwt. is 78<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. However, I have got a plan whereby you can <hi rend="italic">ascertain</hi>,&#x2014;at least before the goods are shipped. Let the Carts as they come thro&#x2019; Dumfries be weighed empty, then as they return weigh loaded&#x2014;this <hi rend="italic">gives</hi> us the number of hundred-weights: before leaving Craigenputtoch, Alick can take the dimensions of the loadings as they lie piled together, and deducting for interstices, will thus have the measurement. Let him be very accurate; then the whole matter lies before us, and I will tell you in time how to do. In the mean while, has your Uncle sent you three dozen of second-hand mats, by either the Dumfries Steamboat, or one of Thomson&#x2019;s ships? It was the last thing we agreed on, and either Arbuckle or he was to write giving due notice: it seemed likely the mats could be got for half-price; if they could not, nothing was to be done. The readiness of both these men, and indeed of everybody, to help us, does it not deserve our gratitude?&#x2014; All this paragraph is for my brave Alick&#x2019;s special study; and I doubt not he will understand it: but perhaps, after all, as you will hear, a new arrangement, by the Whitehaven people, may p<supplied>[r]</supplied>ove to be the fittest for us.</p>
<p>But figure me now mounted at noontide of Monday, on your old <hi rend="italic">Umpire</hi> Coach (for it has changed its hour), and bowling off towards London at one stretch. Figure us rushing down the steep street of Lichfield, and along my old familiar ways in Warwickshire about midnight; and the dirtiest little chill drizzle beginning, from which on the <pb id="pg-07-149" n="07-149"/>Coachbox with the breeze on the right cheek I had no means of guarding myself; tho&#x2019; your Uncle, good man, had a bran new umbrella waiting for me at the Liverpool starting-place, having failed to get back my own from Porcus M&#x2019;Minn,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> who had staggered off with it the night before. Alas, the drizzle continued, and became a rain, and I sat nodding there, and starting awake again at the threshold of most comfortless sleep till about 8 in the morning three cups of scalding coffee brought some motion back into my fingers. Particulars to be <hi rend="italic">often</hi> recapitulated when we sit by the fire together! Not till two o&#x2019;clock did I see the huge monstrosity of a London, thro&#x2019; the Arch at Holloway, again amid rain, and enter it with a kind of defiance. In few minutes, from &#x201C;the Angel of Islington,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coaching-inn or terminus.</note> I was here, and the glad Mrs Page<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240624-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:89</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-06-24">24 June 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> recognising me, and the whole house welcoming me, safe so far from my perils. Our old rooms had been vacant for about a week; and strange to say, Charles Montague and his Wife, not now for Edinburgh, had made a permanent contract for them, to begin on Saturday; that is, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day; tho&#x2019; it is now postponed and altered, the people here having got a new better house in the next street, and being actually in a state of flitting towards it, and likely to be they say for about a fortnight yet. The good Eliza,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Miles. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320616-JWC-EMI-01">JWC to <sic>EM</sic><corr>EMI</corr>, <date when="1832-06-16">16 June 1832</date></ref>.</note> fugitive as a breath of air mostly waits on me, assisted by Mrs Page, and a sootdrop of a new Anne:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Another servant.</note> the two former and indeed all hands here express the truest joy at hope of seeing you again. I have Miles&#x2019;s foot-rule in my pocket, and often have used it; I sleep in the room above our old sleeping-room; in a bed some six inches narrower than the old &#x201C;Stocking-bed,&#x201D; but clean and quiet; I feel comparatively at home; and so, in respect of lodgings am as fortunate as you could wish.</p>
<p>That same Tuesday evening I strode off to Bayswater, and was welcomed (what think you of that?) with a most graceful little kiss.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Mrs. Sarah Austin.</note> Alas! in the course of five minutes&#x2019; speech, I learned that my whole hurry had been useless, that I might have staid with you perfectly as well, that our whole Scotch notion of London houseletting was erroneous from top to bottom! Heard poor man, heard poor wife ever anything so provoking? Whitsunday is no day at all in London:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had mistakenly thought that Whitsunday would be a recognized term-day, or quarter day, from which to rent a house, as in Scotland.</note> they <pb id="pg-07-150" n="07-150"/>have <hi rend="italic">four</hi> term-days in the year; of which the nearest is now the <date when="1834-06-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date>: thus every quarter there are numerous shiftings, and at all intermediate periods, and houses stand &#x201C;to Let,&#x201D; tomorrow as yesterday, as plentiful now as then; and plentifullest of all about the month of <date when="1834-08-00">August</date>, when so many people fly the Town. They are usually let &#x201C;on lease,&#x201D; but not always, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> always be got for a year by a little more money. They are numerous at present, and will continue to grow more so, for at least two weeks. The then subsequent three weeks there will be all manner of repairings going on. Alas, alas, had we but known all this, and I staid at home, and saved you from so much, and brought you with me, to do the matter deliberately!</p>
<p>Meanwhile the good Provideress (who had provided a bed too for me, which I refused) took me out fort<supplied>[h]</supplied> with to look at houses; I saw several; liked none of them; saw the old failure in Holland Street, and thought it decidedly an <hi rend="italic">escape</hi>.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The house in Kensington about which Mrs. Austin had written.</note> A dirty little crooked old street (but indeed the evening was dirty) inferior to the Vennels<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Narrow lanes: the &#x201C;Vennel&#x201D; was a poor part of Dumfries.</note> in Dumfries! Others of the same rent, new and in straight rows lay in the neighbourhood; one also in a much better part of Holland Street: but the whole district seemed to me confused, muddy, mournfully inferior to our ideas. The &#xa3;45 house I was to see next day, and determined to take it if it were so good: I first however purposed to see Chelsea and the Hunts; had thereafter the invitation to return to Bayswater and dine, the &#x201C;celebrated Mrs Jamieson&#x201D;<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Anna B. Jameson. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340506-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1834-05-06">6 May</date></ref>.</note> to be there. On Wednesday morning, having first corrected the Proofsheet of <hi rend="italic">Teufelk</hi> (which I found at Dumfries), and left it at Fraser&#x2019;s (whom I did not see, then or since), I got to Bayswater, and found the celebrated Mrs Jamieson on the point of arriving. Would she had never arrived! Did I lose my heart to her? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott</hi></foreign> [Oh Lord]! A little, hard, proud, redhaired, freckled, fierce-eyed, square-mouthed woman; shrewd, harsh, cockneyish-irrational: it was from the first moment apparent that, without mutual loss, we might &#x201C;<foreign>adieu</foreign> and wave our lily hands.&#x201D;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. John Gay, &#x201C;Sweet William&#x2019;s Farewell to Black-eyed Susan,&#x201D; last line.</note> These two after infinite delays got ready to go with me; broke shoe-ties, had delicate children to guard from damp feet, bustled and sidled and made no way: one of them at least I wished at the Devil. But now in Kensington Gardens (no delved garden, but the beautifullest immensity of a Park, with water-pieces, and grass-pieces, and skyhigh clumps of frondent beeches, where you shall often walk), there starts from a side-seat a <pb id="pg-07-151" n="07-151"/>black figure, and clutches my hand in both his: it is poor Edward Irving! O what a feeling! The poor friend looks like death rather than life; pale and yet flushed, a flaccid, boiled appearance; and one short peal of his old Annandale laugh went thro&#x2019; me with the wofullest tone. He is sent out thither to have two months of air; there seemed a little silkgowned Prophetess to have nursing charge of him for the time; but he was to get a house of his own in some days close by: we appointed to meet in his Newman Street abode, next night after evening service: but I was forced to plead off next day by a message at the door, and have not seen him since! But to get along: The Jamieson and her Hostess I contrived to get despatched, and to shake off their dinner too; walked off to Edwardes Square (1&#xBD; miles westward, where Cochrane<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. G. Cochrane, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>.</note> lives) till the &#x201C;my carpenter&#x201D; (steward apparently of the &#xa3;45 house) made a <hi rend="italic">third</hi> attempt to get the key; for that day there seemed nothing <hi rend="italic">but</hi> delays. Edward&#x2019;s Square (for so they pronounce it) has a beautiful grass-square in the centre; houses small but neat; on the whole more a Comely Bank character than anything I saw. One house was to be let, in the worst place of the square, rather dilapidated looking, but which would be thoroughly repaired; rent &#xa3;35 fixtures included; four stories of the smallest dimensions (which I have measured since): two kitchens, <hi rend="italic">six-feet three inches</hi> (!) in height; dining-room with folding-doors (like <hi rend="italic">this</hi> drawing-room) perhaps 14 feet by 22 (taken together) drawing-room above, 17 feet by eleven; back room (divided by a wall from this), where our big Bed might by possibility stand, for the height is 9 feet 7&#xBD;; upper story 8 feet 1 inch high, which seems the despicable universal height of such houses here. Will you (lest I forget it again) measure <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Bed, I mean <hi rend="italic">our own new Bed</hi>, and also one of the back-room ones, and see whether <hi rend="italic">they</hi> can stand in such a height. I hope, they can. Finally there is a &#x201C;garden&#x201D; (<foreign><hi rend="italic">ach Gott!</hi></foreign>) of perhaps 12 feet broad in front of the house, with iron railing, and a brickwalled one (like Comely Bank, only that is not green, but might be made so) of 21 yards long. Almost all houses have in the back kitchen a set-boiler (&#x201C;Copper&#x201D;) for washing, that room being the &#x201C;washing-house,&#x201D; an excellent kitchen-grate of the kind you talked of, and a dresser or dresserkin as we shall think it: these, with grates, and some other trifles (sometimes, they say, even with <hi rend="italic">bells!</hi>) constitute &#x201C;the fixtures.&#x201D; It is reckoned a great point to get them included in the rent; for tho&#x2019; they profess to be &#x201C;appraised&#x201D; in the way we <pb id="pg-07-152" n="07-152"/>conjectured, yet uniformly there is a great loss, and (if, for example, <hi rend="italic">no</hi> tenant follow you for years) risk of total loss. The other charges and taxes in Edward&#x2019;s Square including &#xa3;2..12 for the green enclosure, and lamplighting, are &#xa3;13..2 by accurate summation, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the House-tax, which is this year to be repealed. The distance from the westernmost point of London is two miles and a cat&#x2019;s leap; from Mrs Austin thro&#x2019; Kensington Gardens 3 quarters of a mile, from Mill about the same, from Hunt (which perhaps is no objection) about 1&#xBD; miles in quite the opposite direction; or rather <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the opposite direction, for to Chelsea you hold south-east, to Bayswater &#x26;c northeast. It is a street, with one little gap, all the way to London: You are close by Holland House.&#x2014; These were sorryish prospects: nevertheless I appointed to come again next night, and see Cochrane and the Landlord, neither of whom were on the spot.</p>
<p>And now back again to &#x201C;my carpenter,&#x201D; an innocent conceited kind of body, who (sorrow to him!) had not yet got the key. Delays again, and trottings hither and thither; hunger (for it was now between 5 and 6) and Shaw&#x2019;s<note n="20" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Shaw, cobbler, 65 Queensberry St., Dumfries.</note> new &#x201C;neat shoes&#x201D; (half an inch too short; for which doom <hi rend="italic">him</hi> also to a public rebuke) pinching me at heart and extremities: at length, all too late, appears the hateful Cockney Landlord with his double-<hi rend="italic">w</hi>&#x2019;s and aspirates, his purse-pride, cunning and bunch of keys, and shows me in: the &#xa3;45 house is not worth a rush for me; the upper story all divided into six or seven crib-bedrooms, in which nothing better than a litter of six or seven young whelps could have slept with comfort. I did not fell the Cockney landlord to the earth, but left him with civil speeches, and took my sorrowful way thro&#x2019; narrow hedge-lanes and cottages ornamental and cottages squalid, thro&#x2019; Brompton, towards the church-steeple of Chelsea. In Brompton (the Public houses there having nothing but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Beea</hi>&#x201D;) I dined with a most angelic young cowfeeder, close by the stall of six cows, on three-halfpence-worth of milk and a penny-loaf. At length came Chelsea, and Cheyne Row; a set of young bronze coloured gypsey faces were idly looking thro&#x2019; a window; I asked them with a half-presentiment where Hunt lived; they answered, Here, and that he was from home. I enter: O ask me not for a description till we meet! The Frau Hunt lay drowsing on cushions &#x201C;sick, sick&#x201D; with thousand temporary ailments, the young imps all agog to see me jumped hither and thither, one strange goblin-looking fellow, about 16, ran ministering about tea-kettles for us: it was all a mingled <pb id="pg-07-153" n="07-153"/>lazaretto and tinkers camp, yet with a certain joy and nobleness at heart of it; faintly resembling some of the maddest scenes in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister</hi>, only madder. They had looked at no houses, knew not what I meant by them; gave me to fancy that perhaps at that hour you might be reading a new Letter of Hunt&#x2019;s asking farther instructions of me.<note n="21" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter has not been found and was probably not written.</note> They gave me tea, would fain have given me the Husband&#x2019;s shoes (<foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Shelley, for <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was to be the new Shelley): finally the goblin, &#x201C;Percy Hunt,&#x201D; a very good sort of fellow, I think, inquired me out an omnibus to Temple Bar; and I came <foreign><hi rend="italic">hirpling</hi></foreign> [limping] home, with a determination at least to have my old shoes next day. A fraction of coarse oatmeal, left by the late Lodgers, yielded me porridge after a sort; and so sending you all the warmest prayer from the innermost of my heart, I tumbled into bed and sleep.</p>
<p>Next morning, or Thursday, to the Montagues, with the old phenomena little or not at all altered; to Irving&#x2019;s door (as above said) with glimpses into his Newman-street Pagoda,<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The building where Irving held services after his eviction from the church in Regent Square (<date when="1832-05-00">May 1832</date>).</note> and Note pencilled by me in the Lobby; to Piccadilly halfway-house, and thence to Chelsea by omnibus; where Hunt (who had already had a message here) sat to welcome me in his choicest mood.<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. Cf. <ref target="volume-04/lt-18281200-JWC-JCA-01"><sic>4:424</sic><corr>JWC to JCA, <date when="1828-12-01">1 Dec. 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> The Wife was away; Thornton a poor brown spectre of a creature (whom his Mother had nevertheless spoken of &#x201C;marrying and settling&#x201D;!) saluted me with a tremulous kindness; I soon got out with Hunt in wide quest of houses. Chelsea lies low close by the side of the river; has an ancient, here and there dilapidated look; the houses apparently a tenth cheaper; some market articles, especially coals said likewise to be cheaper. I liked it little; and, to say truth, cared not to be so near the poetic Tinkerdom. We went thro&#x2019; many houses, with little result; at length moved upwards to Brompton (a place I somehow, perhaps by repute only, have a liking for); and there also among many houses, found only one that attracted me. It is a pavilion-roofed new, strong, tight-looking house, in the middle of a not so hampered Gardenkin, a country-looking road with trees beyond, running by in front; other such cottages, yet not all alike, on this hand and on that. Nay, bethink thee of the Miss West Cottages at the end of Haddington: I think, it is likest these, only smaller I fancy, especially lower in the upper story which here again is only some eight feet. The House is shaped exactly like our Craigenputtoch one: two good rooms <pb id="pg-07-154" n="07-154"/>of good height, and say 16 feet square on each side of the lobby; the back-rooms entering also from the lobby (almost where <hi rend="italic">our</hi> doors are, the other inner doors being near the front one), and I should fancy some 4 or 5 feet <hi rend="italic">wider</hi> than ours are: in one of these (our library one), the red Bed would stand beautifully; the other (yet somehow without much air of offence) is the kitchen, and a nice clean one; backwards from this appeared boiler-house &#x26;c: upper story exactly like our own (except two feet lower) down even to dressingroom, and stair-head press! The rent &#x201C;on lease&#x201D; &#xa3;40, perhaps higher for one year, and some <hi rend="italic">un</hi>fixedness about fixtures and so forth. However this was by far the best looking thing I saw; and I took the landlady&#x2019;s address, with full purpose to see her soon, which new objects suspended, but have not at all suppressed. But for this day&#x2019;s task of Letter-writing I should have been there today.</p>
<p>Hunt gave me dinner, a pipe even and glass of ale; was the blithest, helpfullest, most loquacious of men; yet his talk only fatigued me mostly; there was much, much of it; full of airiness indeed yet with little but scepticising quibbles, crotchets, fancies, and even Cockney wit; which I was all too earnest to relish. He sent his kind regards to Craigenputtoch, and left me on my way to Edwardes Square.&#x2014; Tho&#x2019; late beyond my hour, I judged it better to see Cochrane first. His Wife (for he has an old wife) took me courteously in, till he should return from some &#x201C;trustee meeting,&#x201D; where both he and the landlord were. She shewed me over her house; which tho&#x2019; of precisely the same dimensions as the one I had seen looked really quite &#x201C;a gem,&#x201D; so clean was it, so still and clear, with size enough and to spare for two. Cochrane staid long, and had to be sent for. Really far from a bad man, or even an uncivil man; gave me a quite kind reception, a cup of tea, abundance of Scotch and English news; and, to my question, an affirmation that he was still disposed to part with <hi rend="italic">his</hi> house. No landlord for me, therefore! If I go to Edwardes Square, here is the spot for me. He kept me late, and I found no omnibus. Cheerful old Miles was sitting up for me, me the weariedest of men. I had appointed to see Cochrane next day; and finally settle with him. I steeped my feet in cold water, smoked a pipe, and went to bed.</p>
<p>Next morning, Friday, I set out westward, and took Buller by the way. Mill (who was waiting for me the second morning, as clear and friendlier than ever) had already given me his address; for he was sick, of some biliary surgical business, and was with his Father &#x26; Mother in a new place: I got promptest admittance on sending up my name; got my frank and much pleasant talk, and special right to have your Letters too se<supplied>[n]</supplied>t under cover to him (4. Parliament <pb id="pg-07-155" n="07-155"/>street, lest I <hi rend="italic">should</hi> forget),&#x2014;all in <supplied>[the kindli]</supplied>est way. I saw also <supplied>[Mrs Strach]</supplied>ey, who is close by for a time, in the way of removing to Bristol; she was <supplied>[ver]</supplied>y kind, and seemed mu<supplied>[ch bett]</supplied>er than formerly, as pure and devout as ever: you must now see her, and I think will readily contrive to like her. Finally I move off thro&#x2019; the Parks to Edwardes Square; with the full purpose, in spite of Brompton, distance, and probable delay, to close with Cochrane: behold, however, Cochrane has taken a new thought, and cannot do it! His excuse too was reasonable; he talked of expecting some kind of &#x201C;situation with a house attached,&#x201D; and so might have to shift twice over. What could I say? We got the old Landlord, and went intently over the vacant house (see, our results above); and so, quite disappointed again, walked eastward, turning in by Bayswater for a mutton-chop, and word of consolation, on the strength of which I walked home to meet Mill about tea at seven. Arthur Buller had been here; Hunt&#x2019;s boy with a Book; Mrs Badams too, about to leave town, and thinking <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were here, had called, and written&#x2014;one long sigh. Let me not forget for your comfort that I too wrote to Bessy Barnet, and expect her answer of Yes in a day or two: she was to be in readiness in some twelve days. Mill did not come till 9 o&#x2019;clock, and then with a strange gaunt-looking &#x201C;disciple,&#x201D; and so all three sat talking till near one o&#x2019;clock.</p>
<p>You have thus, dear Wife, my whole history since we parted. Was ever anything more confused? To confuse the matter still more, Mrs Austin made me this offer yesterday: her husband and she are for the sea-coast again in <date when="1834-08-00">August</date>, and would willingly surrender their House to us for three months, when we might look about at will! I did not refuse, but felt that I must. Having fairly begun, why should we pause? She advises still that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> come to some lodging of which there are several close by, and have a vote in the choice. What say you, <foreign><hi rend="italic">Liebchen?</hi></foreign> Would you feel it kinder, if I had a house ready, as one or the other <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be ready? I will keep looking out with all the <hi rend="italic">muscular force</hi> I have (for it depends on that mainly); inquire and examine this Brompton affair mainly; but fix on nothing till I hear from you again. By the time you could get hither, I should have a choice of houses to take you to directly, and then we could decide at leisure. But you say, No, no: don&#x2019;t you? The only thing to be added is that if you say, Yes, then Whitehaven will in all probability be the road for the furniture.</p>
<p>Thus, dear Goodykin, have I filled you two of the longest sheets you ever read. Dinner is just here, and I dare not begin another. O my <foreign>wee</foreign> Wifiekin, how art thou, in these tumults? Alick promised me <pb id="pg-07-156" n="07-156"/>that he would as far as man could take the burden off you, screen from all toils, of which in spite of him enough would reach you. Take care, take every care. Tell Alick that if he send thee well to me, I will never forget him,&#x2014;as indeed I never will any way. And now do you ever think of me? Not you, you little wretch! But oh me, I am too serious for jesting; yet not sad. I feel very fearless in this business; &#x201C;tho&#x2019; desperate not cowardly.&#x201D;<note n="24" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s words as quoted in <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340327-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-03-27">27 March</date></ref>.</note> Be of good cheer; it is for my Dearest&#x2019;s good too. <closer><salute>And so God bless and keep thee!</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Jean will send this by express, on Monday. You will read it to Alick if he is with you? And consult with him. If my Mother also could hear it! But I must write her a Note of her own. The Boy was to have a shilling: send a Newspaper to me by him next morning (early) in your own hand. Then a deliberate Letter on Wednesday: directed as you were used, under cover, not forgetting the M. P.! You know the address above.&#x2014; Jeffrey is no longer a Member, but a Lord of session.

<p>Explain me everything with the minuteness of a Goodykin; everything about thyself especially. I have not hinted to Holcroft that I am here: never mind the Newspapers, except to announce your wellbeing, I cannot read them at present&#x2014; Here are this moment a lot of Books (thro&#x2019; Fraser) for Jack: I bet from Miss M.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I am arrived safely here, and living in my old quarters. I got in on Tuesday, having suffered no damage; had good weather all the way, but the last twelve hours, when it rained, but could not wet me. I <pb id="pg-07-157" n="07-157"/>have great cause of thankfulness: friends are all kind to me; I seem to meet nothing but friends. Mrs Strachey too is here, and gave me a most kind reception; I told her I had bidden you not fear about my waygoing, for that my prayer was if I went not with God, He might not send me hither; under which guidance, no evil <hi rend="italic">could</hi> come of it. To which she answered, with the kindest emphasis, &#x201C;No, none.&#x201D; I often also repeat to myself: &#x201C;They cannot hinder thee of God&#x2019;s Providence&#x201D;;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother&#x2019;s words.

These few words, which I write in extreme haste, in momently expectation of the Postman, will be a great comfort to you.</p>
<p>As yet there is no house got; only abundance examined; and a certainty of getting one. We have been all wrong; there is no Whitsunday in London, the people <foreign>flit</foreign> [move] at any time! I might as well, had I known, have staid at home, till Jane too went.</p>
<p>There is the Postman&#x2019;s Bell, and then my frank will be lost! I have written at great length to Jane, who will read it all to you, when she comes.</p>
<p>Many times my dear Mother has your image come over me; but I let it not be with sadness.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Doubtless you are thinking long to hear from me, as I have done these two weeks to write to you. I pitied but could not help you. I hope you yourself have <foreign><hi rend="italic">Heiterkeit</hi></foreign> [cheerfulness], and do not torment your mind with vain fears on our account. Be of good cheer: all is well with us. Here also, at length, is another broad and long sheet of that &#x201C;foreign Post&#x201D; of theirs, with pen and ink, and the length of a whole still Sunday before me: to have a table that would <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> on its feet were another completion of comfort; which, however, for the present, I must dispense with. My brave true-hearted Jack shall hear to all lengths how it goes with us.</p>
<p>Your last Letter but one arrived only a day after my last was despatched. The last was found lying at Dumfries now nearly a fortnight ago;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to John&#x2019;s letters of <date when="1834-03-13">13 March</date> and <date when="1834-04-19">19 April</date>.</note> and in the very best time; for our dear Mother was beginning to call exceedingly often at the Post-Office, and no reasoning <pb id="pg-07-159" n="07-159"/>could have saved her from considerable anxiety, had it lasted long. She had been at Craigenputtoch, for a &#x201C;fortnight,&#x201D; on her &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">last</hi> visit&#x201D; there, I took her down on the Friday as far as Alick&#x2019;s, who would not let us go farther; then next day forward to Annan to shew her Mary who had actually removed thither into a temporary house a week before; from which, the same evening, up to Scotsbrig. Passing thro&#x2019; Ecclefechan we &#x201C;called,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >To inquire for mail.</note> as usual; but poor Postie had nothing for us. However, on the Monday following, as I returned thro&#x2019; Dumfries, there lay, in very deed, the long, most kind, most brotherly Letter; which I could read to Jean on the spot, and send our Mother hint of by a Newspaper, with hope of seeing <hi rend="italic">itself</hi> in the course of that week. Jean went on with me to Puttoch, and staid there talking and sewing shirts, till the Thursday when I was to bring her so far down on my road&#x2014;to London. For you must know, our Holland-Street, and all other Austinian house-speculations had, after the most provoking vicissitudes of hope and even of assurance, come suddenly to nought; whereby, as Whitsunday was so near, it became for us self-evident that I must off in person to do the work, lest it altogether miswent for year and day. Poor Jane was to be left with the Furniture herself; Alick undertook to come for a week and take the burden off her, which I believe he is now at Cra<supplied>[i]</supplied>genputtoch struggling with his best effort to do. And so I, wetted with poor Mrs Welsh&#x2019;s tears (whom Jane seemed anxious to see <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with her visit, as she then nearly was), lumbered off in my <hi rend="italic">Clatch</hi>, in rainy weather, to seek new habitations. Alas, five minutes after arriving here, I found that my whole hurry had been superfluous; that Whitsunday is no day at all in London, or this very <hi rend="italic">Sunday;</hi> and houses are to be had at any season, and most plentifully of all some two weeks hence! However, intrinsically there is little ill done: I shall have a House <hi rend="italic">ready</hi>, I hope, for the poor tired Wife, and as our Goods having a quick path all marked out for them will not linger, we shall all the sooner have it over. Let me first, meanwhile, wind up Scottish matters; then tell you, as far as I can, what London has brought forth.</p>
<p>With regard to our dear Mother, I bid you comfort yourself with the assurance, then, that she is really moderately well; better I can say than you are likely to fancy her. She has discontinued the Pills; finds, for many months, that she can do without them. She adjusts herself with the old heroism to new circumstances; agrees that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> come hither, parts from me with the stillest face, more touching than <pb id="pg-07-160" n="07-160"/>if it had been all beteared. I said to Alick, as we drove up the Purdamstown <foreign>brae</foreign> that morning that I thought if I had had all the Mothers I ever saw to choose from I would have chosen my own. She is to have Harry, and can ride very well on him; will go down a while to seabathing at Mary&#x2019;s; up to Dumfries; to Catlinns; and spend the summer tolerably enough. For winter I left her the task of spinning me a plaid dressing-gown, with which if she get too soon done, she may spin another for you. She has Books; above all, her <hi rend="italic">Book:</hi> she trusts in God, and &#x201C;shall not be put to shame.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 83:17.</note> I am to write once in the three weeks; you also are pressingly charged to keep writing; your Letters to me I shall get forwarded in Franks. I told her, there would be railways too (which is a fact) which, in few years, would bring us to Liverpool in 10 hours.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Liverpool-Manchester railway was opened on <date when="1830-09-15">15 Sept. 1830</date>, and it became possible to travel from London to Liverpool with the opening of the London to Birmingham line <date when="1838-09-17">17 Sept. 1838</date>.</note> If I once again saw you safe here, in <date when="1835-09-00">September</date> come a year, we could come home together, and once again provide her with some happy days.&#x2014; To shew you several things I will mention a fact: while at Craigenputtoch, I made her train me to two song-tunes, and we often sang them together, and tried them often again in coming down to Annandale; nay, one of them, I actually found myself humming with a strange cheerfully-pathetic feeling when I first came in sight (thro&#x2019; that Arch on the road) of huge smoky Babylon: &#x201C;For there&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">seven foresters in yon forest</hi>, and them <hi rend="italic">I want to see</hi>, see, and them&#x201D; &#x26;c!<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May</date></ref>.</note> I wrote her a little Note yesterday, and told her this.&#x2014; As for Jamie, you can fancy him providing for a love-marriage, which is to take place shortly. He is no ill-conditioned fellow; very far from it; and with a great natural talent, had he given it any culture. We will heartily wish him joy, and hope well of him.&#x2014; Jean seems also to be doing very well, to be happy in Dumfries, interested in it, and able to give a good account of what she sees there. I think she loves her husband, and will help him to be an honest man, which, with very good faculty in all ways, he is truly anxious to be. She wept at parting, when I had eaten my last Dumfries meal with them: I bade them ever remember that it was but a short, short time we had to be tumbled about here, and that all Eternity depended on our way of spending that. And so I left poor Jean; <foreign><hi rend="italic">guter Hoffnung</hi></foreign> [full of hope] (they say) in the German sense; and I with good hope of her in the universal sense.&#x2014; My good Alick stood waiting for me at <pb id="pg-07-161" n="07-161"/>the end of Shillahill Bridge with his black mare, thinking my horse would be weak. It is one of those apparitions I shall never forget. He whirled me, like an arrow, direct down to Highland, Breconhill, Ecclefechan and Scotsbrig, thro&#x2019; old scenes unvisited for years: we were within cry of Mainhill (for the new road now goes by the horse-loch almost); it stood there still, and we had never more aught to do with it. Alick still votes for Annan, and I fancy will probably accomplish it: he has gained hitherto at Catlinns; but has no assurance that in a wet year he will not greatly lose: the proprietors also will not afford him the palpably needfullest encouragement; he will do well to cast it from him.&#x2014; At Annan, I told you, Mary already was: her husband has had constantly some work from the very first day, and shapes fairly for doing well enough. He is a blithe man, strong, steady. They remove to a house of Wull Brown&#x2019;s (&#xa3;5 a year) at the Battery;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Battery Brae is a street in Annan off the High St., at the end leading to the river.</note> are living at present up a little &#x201C;<foreign>wynd</foreign>&#x201D; [narrow lane], behind &#x201C;Tom Wullieson&#x2019;s house,&#x201D; directly beyond [Carlyle writes &#x201C;eastward of&#x201D; above &#x201C;beyond&#x201D;] the Commercial Bank, if you remember it. Poor Mary had her two children as clean as new shillings and the whole little housekin swept and cleared, and the neatest breakfast laid out for us all that morning I went off. It had been appointed so: I went in the &#x201C;new Steamboat from Annan&#x201D; (which is also to carry our Furniture); Alick and Jamie, with Ben Nelson &#x26;c were down with me at the shore; and before noon, at the waterfoot I had waved my hat to my two Brothers, and gone on my way.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A steamboat service to Liverpool left from the port of Annan, or Annan Water, where the river joined the Solway estuary (see map, vol.

William Graham I had very shortly before seen: he is growing a large, grey, bushy very rustic-looking <foreign>Carle</foreign> [man]; with the same affectionate honestheartedness as ever: you would really do him a pleasure by writing, as I assured him he would you. Waugh has now whole clothes on his back, has quitted Marion,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Marion Waugh, his father. By <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date> the local directory lists John Waugh as practicing in the High St.</note> and got a bedroom of his own in Wellington Street, where he seems to be practicing, and writing some immortal Work or other on Medical Philosophy<supplied>[.]</supplied> He had shillings in his pocket (when I saw him, on my Mother&#x2019;s visit), and actually could, as he most heartily would, have given me a beef-steak to dine on with him. His age seemed renewed.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 103:5.</note> And now enough of Annan.&#x2014; In respect of Liverpool, I suppress all (much that in the way of civility interests yourself) except that George Johnstone, in his old place, is becoming decidedly and prosperously fixed into his character of Physician to the Poor; really a most helpful, clear, praiseworthy man; that Arbuckle in N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 4. Oxford Street (which mark, for you might well write to him) has brass-plated himself &#x201C;Surgeon,&#x201D; and sees that sufficiency is in store for him, &#x201C;without anxiety on that head&#x201D;; for the rest, I found him greatly improved and polished, compacted into kind dignity; his sufferings, in a word, have rendered him <hi rend="italic">devout</hi>, and lifted him above suffering; I predict nothing but good of him. He remembered, he said, with warm gratitude, you and me for the example we had shewn him.</p>
<p>With respect to London, where we are now arrived, I must spare you many details: understand in general that I walk myself daily into lameness and utter lassitude (taking all advantage of <hi rend="italic">omnibii</hi> too) in search of houses, but still find none, or hardly any; <supplied>[see]</supplied> only that I shall find some. My present view is fixed on two points: one in Edwardes Square, a little quiet green pl<supplied>[ace, fa]</supplied>r west in Kensington; the second, which as yet I like distinctly better, a detached new-bu<supplied>[ilt]</supplied> Cottage in Glo&#x2019;ster Terrace Brompton; built on the very <pb id="pg-07-163" n="07-163"/>model of Craigenputtoch, only wider, without adjoined kitchen <supplied>[(the]</supplied> servant&#x2019;s-room being kitchen), and lower in the upper story; a solid-looking clean-yellow house, in the middle of a gar<supplied>[den]</supplied> with an Omnibus road in front, and perhaps 1&#xBD; miles to Hyde Park: rent, I think, &#xa3;40. That is my outlook tomorrow. B<supplied>[a]</supplied>yswater I like best of all, especially for the glorious Kensington Gardens; Chelsea is cheapest of all, but I like it not, and also shall be better not too near the Hunts, who overwhelm me with kindness, but will never do good with me. In Kensington or Brompton you are to figure me, then; certainly almost, in some western suburb: Bessy Barnet is warned to be here in 12 days, when our Goods arrive; Jane follows instantly, and so with good heart we begin the world. As you must write to me <hi rend="italic">instantaneously</hi>, it will be better to direct to Fraser 215. Regent Street: but I expect to hear of you before that also, by Scotsbrig. Our Mother took lessons in writing from me; and really can write quite tolerably, tho&#x2019; slowly. In point of employment here I have yet made no accurate calculations: Literature seems <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, or nearly so; all enterprises languish<supplied>[:]</supplied> Tait has given up his Magazine (or joined it with a certain <hi rend="italic">Johnstone&#x2019;s</hi>);<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John Johnstone, Edinburgh editor and printer of <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, married to Christian Isobel (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">1857</date>), novelist.

Mrs Badams, preparing to go to France to her Brother, found me out at Fraser&#x2019;s; left a most dolorous Note here; I went and saw her last night in Hanover Place Regent&#x2019;s Park: wan, like a wet April morn when I entered, soon brightening into light spirits; now as formerly a Fool.

I saw the Noble Lady; heard the old jangled music-bells of N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 25 playing to the old tune, for some minutes: Charles Montague and Wife and Child are forthwith to occupy <hi rend="italic">these</hi> apartments (or others in a new house, hard by, the people are removing to); this seems a significant fact.

Mrs Strachey was lodging just over the way: she gave me a most kind reception, invites me to tea for monday; looks pure and clear and <pb id="pg-07-165" n="07-165"/>much happier; is so far on her way to a new home &#x201C;near Bristol.&#x201D; She did write to Miss Morris<note n="22" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311113-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1831-11-13">13 Nov. 1831</date></ref>.</note> (who never got the Letter?); she was much gratified to learn from me that probably Miss M. was even now near London, and might be searched out: perhaps I shall see that young <foreign><hi rend="italic">sch&#xF6;ne Seele</hi></foreign> [beautiful soul] with these eyes, and surely love her well.&#x2014; Finally the Whigs are thought to be in danger<note n="23" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Trouble within the Whig ministry arose mainly from disagreement over the settlement of Irish church property.

How were I worthy to give, if from the right man I knew not to receive? Far am I, my Boy, from refusing aid of yours (when it will not hurt yourself <hi rend="italic">more</hi>); I am proud to reckon you a man adequate for a relation of that kind. Your money is already taken; and in these new circumstances will do me essential service. Be a good man, help me to be one; and we shall as you say never be divided. So let that be fixed.</p>
<p>I have said nothing of Italy and you: all of Britain and myself. So you would have it<supplied>[.]</supplied> Continue to send us all sorts of details of your still existence, which is nerving you for one day enacting one of <hi rend="italic">another</hi> sort. I say Amen to all your convictions and aspirations: I know them; they are the beginning of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, of what can be called Life.

I have properly speaking no language as yet; the half dozen languages which I have a smattering of are not seperated [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and packed up for use in their right places, but huddled together and lying in the way of each other. &#x2026; I sometimes feel as if I were the most fragmentary of men, the farthest from being rounded off into any distinct shape or growth. &#x2026; In brief then, my dear brother, think of me as one not unoccupied or in a state of stagnation, not often miserable but rather fighting my battle generally with courage and good hopes. &#x2026; It grieved me to hear of your disappointment in regard to the Edinburgh Professorship, though it is perhaps after all better for you that you owe nothing to the present patrons of the University. You could not have worked along with them I fear even upon that neutral ground of Astronomy. They are in reality more intolerant &#x26; illiberal than even the Tories.&#x201D; And in his letter of <date when="1834-04-19">19 April</date>: &#x201C;I have long deeply felt the necessity of your quitting that untoward wilderness, and I welcome your spontaneous resolution as the earnest of better and worthier things to come. You are in many respects much more prepared and qualified for it than ever you were at any former period, your position is simpler and clearer you have fewer inward difficulties to struggle with and these I think are the only real difficulties. &#x2026; Has not Craigenputtock been the Haven of Despair all along? Is there any worse place for you in your present state anywhere within the compass of the British Isles? &#x2026; I am glad on the whole that you are to have Bessy Barnet for maid. Though proud and sharp-tempered she is affectionate &#x26; true as steel &#x26; very tidy and active &#x26; quiet. &#x2026; Bid Jane cease to despair henceforth. She has not taken falsehood up or built upon it at any time, and I see indications of her finding a sure foundation and rising freer and better for all the darkness and helplessness she has come through. Her little postscript pleased me much in your last letter but one. The genuine love of Truth and Goodness cannot but live and develope itself even in our dark and agitated times. Jane will come forth yet <foreign><hi rend="italic">eine sch&#xF6;ne Seele</hi></foreign> [a beautiful soul] fitted for her day and circumstances, only the stronger and purer for having undergone that living death.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>The other margins tomorrow: it is now time for walking; weather bright.</p>
<p>Monday morning.&#x2014;I walked yesternight (besides my midday walk) to Bayswater; had a long talk with the painful faithful, metallic fanatic, radical philosophic Austin; foun<supplied>[d]</supplied> there a Newspaper from Jane, which indicated that all was still well.

<p>I sleep less by fully an hour (all Spring) than I was wont: is this actually a sign of better health? 6&#xBD; hours, but very <hi rend="italic">deep</hi>, is my utmost allowance at present. G.

<salute>Dearest Wifekin,</salute>
<p>I have another Frank, and still an hour of daylight and leisure; of which who better than thou deserves the benefit? I have tomorrow also all before me; but may as well take Opportunity by the front.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Spenser, <hi rend="italic">Amoretti</hi>, 70; Milton, <hi rend="italic">Paradise Regained</hi>, III, 173.</note></p>
<p>The desart position of poor old Puttoch again fetters us: may it be for the last time! Two postdays in the week, and we at such a distance, and in such haste, are too small an allowance. It struck me, with a very poignant feeling, two days after my last Letter went, in which so much was left vague, that Friday <hi rend="italic">first</hi> (the day after tomorrow) was the day appointed for shipment of our goods, and an essential part of my directions on that head was omitted, was postponed to a time that would be too late for you! O forgive me, forgive me: you have no conception, how I am walked and worried, and kept in a perpetual waking dream. But, in the meanwhile, what has been <hi rend="italic">done</hi> by Alick and you in these confused circumstances? Did your Uncle&#x2019;s Letter with the mats convey guidance enough? Or did that too leave you dark; did it even never come to hand? This night, a Letter from you is already, I hope, past Penrith; and will cheer me on Friday: but till then I must remain ignorant of much.</p>
<p>Now that I <hi rend="italic">survey</hi> the matters my head on Saturday was so full of, and examine them from a fair visual distance, it seems <hi rend="italic">altogether un</hi>likely but you should have decided, as I then thought it likely you would: namely for instantaneous shipment of Furniture and Self; that the thing we have once had the pain of beginning may with all possible despatch be ended. Mrs Austin&#x2019;s kind offer of her house in <pb id="pg-07-168" n="07-168"/><date when="1834-08-00">August</date> is a clear nonentity; so likewise her project of your <hi rend="italic">continuing</hi> (beyond two days) in Lodgings after you arrive. On the whole, however, I seem to feel as if it <hi rend="italic">were</hi> worth while that you too should see our projected Home before we engage with it: the female head is not without a shrewdness of its own in these affairs; moreover, ought not my own little <hi rend="italic">Coagitor</hi> to have a vote herself in the choice of an abode which is to be <hi rend="italic">ours</hi>. The sweet word, <hi rend="italic">Ours!</hi> The blessed ordinance (let Hunt say as he will), by which all things are forever one between us, and separation an impossibility!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In his essay on Diderot which had appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi>, XI (<date when="1833-04-00">April 1833</date>), 261&#x2013;315, Carlyle had clearly sympathized with Diderot&#x2019;s wife Sophie when he betook himself to mistresses; she was, Carlyle declared, &#x201C;too good a wife for such a husband.&#x201D; Hunt&#x2019;s ideas about love and marriage were very much like those of his friend Shelley. When he wrote to Carlyle on <date when="1833-05-28">28 May 1833</date>, he objected to Carlyle&#x2019;s too-great respect for the institution of marriage as reflected in the essay on Diderot: &#x201C;And do you not beg the question (very subtilly as well as with dignity, I allow, and with just rebuke to some of the vagaries of &#x2018;Denis&#x2019; [Diderot]) in favour of that very odd &#x26; most on-all-hands-proposed &#x2018;sacrament&#x2019; of marriage?&#x201D; See also <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330718-TC-JHLH-01">TC to <sic>LH</sic><corr>JHLH</corr>, <date when="1833-07-18">18 July 1833</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; On this principle accordingly I proceed; at least till your Letter come: unless you expressly order it, no altogether final arrangement shall be made till we both make it. That we have it quite ready for making, I at the same time continue to use all diligence.</p>
<p>But now with regard to the Furniture; supposing (which I pray may <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be, but dare not offer or even hope) that it still remain to be shipped after this arrives: You are to address every package (after the art of packing has done its utmost) to me, &#x201C;London&#x201D;; marking the packages by Numbers (N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1, 2, &#x26;c), and adding any note such as &#x201C;Glass,&#x201D; &#x201C;China,&#x201D; &#x201C;This side uppermost&#x201D; &#x26;c; of course, in the legiblest hand. Glen might perhaps assist you. Then you make out a correct List of all the Packages: writing it (I should think) in a column, with plenty of room to the right: &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 1. A chest of Drawers&#x201D;; &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 2. Bedposts&#x201D; (which perhaps had better be <hi rend="italic">all</hi> tied together?); &#x201C;N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 3 Sundries&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c. This List Alick will take to Nicholson; who grants him (written on the first leaf of a sheet of paper), a Copy of it with an acknowledgement at the bottom that he <hi rend="italic">has received</hi> all these articles, and will deliver them to&#x2014;Dr Arbuckle, or your Uncle, who also cheerfully volunteered to do the service: choose thou between them, or take both. Finally on this receipted Copy of the List (got from Nicholson), or rather on the second leaf of the <hi rend="italic">sheet</hi> containing it, do you address a few words to Arbuckle (4. Oxford Street, Liverpool,&#x2014;or to your Uncle) explaining (what you cannot know <pb id="pg-07-169" n="07-169"/>till <hi rend="italic">after</hi> passing finally thro&#x2019; Dumfries) whether the Carriage from Liverpool to London will be cheaper by <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> or by <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> (as I set forth in last Letter), and requesting him to act accordingly. Mark, however, that as this Letter cannot be written till late on, say, the Thursday afternoon, and will not go off till Friday, and may find Arbuckle gone out, or otherwise too late, it will be best (indeed necessary) to write him a day or two before, and predict <hi rend="italic">positively</hi> on what day (morning at 10 o&#x2019;clock, having left Annan the evening before) a Letter will find him, or even be lying at the Post-Office if he go down for it, as he proposed doing&#x2014;the Steam people being in general very impatient to get rid of their cargo. And herewith ends my poor Sweetheart&#x2019;s cares about our goods: the rest of it falls to my share. Oh why did I forget that all this should have been written last time!&#x2014; But at worst I trust it will only delay the shipment a week; and in that case, you and the goods can <hi rend="italic">come together;</hi> which will simplify several things; and indeed perhaps, on the whole, answer as well almost as the other way,&#x2014;if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> wish to be here two days before fixing on a house.</p>
<p>As to thy own voyage, poor Goody, I have only to advise that thou take some finest ham sandwiches, or other the like ware, with a thimbleful of good brandy; and depend as little on the dirty little Highland Steward, or Cumberland Stewardess (a good body nevertheless) as may be; also that thou take <hi rend="italic">abundance</hi> of wrappages, and sit as much on deck as possible (there sickness can be in general escaped); and finally commend thyself with hopeful Patience to God&#x2019;s guidance, and think that every bound of the boat is bringing thee nearer to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, to thy home my heart. If there is any waiting at Liverpool, thou shalt have a Letter: and for Letters this way, Buller (as I explained) has cheerfully given us full liberty with him. Could not you <hi rend="italic">rest</hi> a little if you were with Mrs Martin? Could not you so order it? But, in any case, I trust you will do far better in Maryland Street than you tremulously anticipate: Mrs Moodie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The snoring &#x201C;Lady&#x201D; whose bedroom she shared at her uncle&#x2019;s: see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310927-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-09-27">27 Sept. 1831</date></ref>, where she is called &#x201C;Miss Moody,&#x201D; and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311006-TCJWC-MAC-01"><sic>JWC and TC</sic><corr>TCJWC</corr> to MAC, <date when="1831-10-06">6 Oct. 1831</date></ref>.</note> and her snoring-apparatus are no longer there, neither will the bugs hurt you (perhaps there are none at present); and, for the people, they were really a great deal quieter with me than formerly, and, except Porcus M&#x2019;Minn, some Carsonlets,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Offspring of Dr. James Carson; see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310811-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-08-11">11 Aug. 1831</date></ref>.</note> and other the like fixtures of no account, hardly troubled me with any stranger. Arbuckle will run for you to the <pb id="pg-07-170" n="07-170"/>world&#x2019;s end. Another four-and-twenty hours (I suppose) in the <hi rend="italic">Umpire</hi> or some such Coach must be endured; and then&#x2014;thou shalt sleep in thy husband<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s arms. Courage, Courage, my little Heartkin! We will be thro&#x2019; it all; and I will take thee safe to my bosom, and kiss away all sorrow from thy eye.</p>
<p>As to Houses, I continue wandering like the Shoemaker of Jerusalem,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The modern version of the legendary &#x201C;wandering Jew,&#x201D; of European literature as early as the sixteenth century and of medieval tradition. Carlyle&#x2019;s sources were probably German. See G. B.

This place is among the worst for me in point of position; but so comfortable otherwise I will not dream of changing it. Yesterday I examined all the East side of the Regent&#x2019;s Park, with Park Village, Camden Town &#x26;c, and came home sniftering and blubbering (with a cold I had, which tonight is nearly gone), as wearied as Hercules after his labours. I found nothing, or next to nothing. One smart little Cottage only, close by the Park itself, very compact, tidy, well-situated; but so small, so inconceivably small! Rent 45 guineas. A Garden which in my spleen I likened to something between a bedquilt and a pancake: unjustly; for it was bigger than either. In the course of my travel, however, I met with adventurekins: saw a pitched battle a-fighting; dined (for 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi> and had 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> more for drink) in a chophouse; talked a long time, and rested, in Regent Street with Fraser, &#x26;c &#x26;c. On the previous day (Monday) I went down to Brompton a second time, and made a most minute re-inspection of the cottage. I found myself mistaken in several things, particularly the size and the pavilion-roof; but on the whole, I still consider it nearly the likeliest thing we can expect to get; tho&#x2019; that same day as you shall hear there started up a kind of rival to it in Chelsea. I also waited on the Proprietress, a very decent woman, of prepossessing physiognomy (as I saw her in the dusk, in a Court of the Strand); a Wine-Merchant&#x2019;s Widow, who built the House himself, and resided in it for years, as she till these very weeks did after him. Both the front rooms are smaller than ours, the big Bed may stand in the back-room (Library) but will have little height to spare; the 4 upper rooms 8f 6 inches high; the dressing-room, alas, is but a box to ours; on the other hand the stairhead press is what you wanted ours to be, a kind of closet with shelves. There is a pump in the kitchen (with clear hard water, which I tasted); a <hi rend="italic">tank</hi> (worked by another handle of the same <pb id="pg-07-171" n="07-171"/>pump) under the kitchen for rain-water which &#x201C;never fails.&#x201D; There are Larders cellars &#x26;c adjoining; and you have access to the kitchen by a back-door also, or rather side-door (for coals &#x26;c; rather a rarer convenience than I expected): the whole house has an air of tightness, cleanliness, modesty and sufficiency, much according to our humour. As built for the owner&#x2019;s use I fancy it may be the <hi rend="italic">best</hi>-built house in Brompton, and have most of a <hi rend="italic">cosy</hi> character. The back-garden has gooseberries and apple-trees; a space is <hi rend="italic">flagged</hi> between the house and it, a door issues direct upon this from the lobby (if you should wish to avoid the kitchen in going out); a green painted nick-nacky kind of porch (with mat and two <hi rend="italic">seats</hi> in it) defends this: the front garden is in two section<hi rend="italic">lets</hi> divided by railing and a flagged passage; looks really, or might very easily look, modest and snug. A high wall, as I said surrounds us all; the gables of the House are <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of this wall. Now do you understand it? (There are Bells, in both stories, <hi rend="italic">only</hi> in the front rooms).&#x2014; Finally Brompton boasts of being a &#x201C;genteel neighbourhood,&#x201D; but except that it would look better on a card, I see no symptoms of superior gentility: there is a large Public House at small distance, yet invisible from the House; Baker, Butcher and all <foreign>Etceteras</foreign> are close enough at hand: the ground generally is laid out in nurseries, and looks tolerable enough, in good wholesome order, nowise affectedly neat. You are a good half mile from Mrs A. a little nearer Mill, about the same from Hunt: the Cunninghams are also within reach; but hardly on any of our routes. To Mrs A. you go thro&#x2019; Kensington Gardens.</p>
<p>After surveying all this on Monday I went down to Chelsea; found Hunt, avoided all Huntesses and Huntlets, indeed never asked after them, but smoked a pipe with Hunt, and then went out again for Houses,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; with comparatively little care about them. Not a gunshot from Hunt&#x2019;s I came upon another house, greatly the best in quality and quantity I had yet seen. I went down again today (by a new route from Buller&#x2019;s and Westminster bridge: Millbank, Vauxhall, and confused causeways of shot rubbish, a dusty, sultry, squalid, detestable road, but not <hi rend="italic">ours</hi> in general), and took the minutest survey. It is notable how at every new visit, your opinion gets a little hitch the <hi rend="italic">contrary</hi> way from its former tendency; imagination has outgone the reality. I nevertheless still feel a great liking for this excellent old House, and it almost balances the Brompton one. Chelsea is unfashionable; it was once the resort of the Court and great, however; hence numerous old houses in it, at once cheap and excellent.&#x2014; But behold the end of my sheet; the clocks all striking eleven, and Eliza <pb id="pg-07-172" n="07-172"/>coming up with a gruel for me!&#x2014; Good night my dearest own Jeannie! Sleep well, and dream of me. <closer><salute>God be with all of you!</salute></closer> <name>T. C.</name></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Thursday morning.&#x2014;<foreign>Sey mir gegr&#xfc;sst, mein Herzchen</foreign></hi> [Greetings to you, my dearest]! Hast thou slept, and breakfasted; art strong for the toils before thee? O that I were there to take thee on my knee, in my arms, and rest thee one five minutes;&#x2014;or even &#x201C;to be scolded&#x201D; a little! It would &#x201C;do me s<hi rend="italic">o</hi> much good.&#x201D; But it will not be long: by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, my little Dame will be here in few days; and Heaven already knows how precious she is to me; that I would not think of exchanging her with the Best in London,&#x2014;not even with &#x201C;the celebrated Mrs Jamieson&#x201D;! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Himmel und Erde</hi></foreign> [Heaven and earth]! In fact, Goody, it seems to me I have been especially lucky in marriage, and wedded simply the best Wife of this age (considering all things), which is a great comfort to me.</p>
<p>I proceed with a description of the Chelsea House. It is within a gunshot of Hunt&#x2019;s; but tho&#x2019; tinkerish-nomadic, I find the Hunts are not intrusive; the sick old woman would perhaps of her own accord steer clear of us. The street makes a right-angle with Hunt&#x2019;s, and runs down upon the River, which I suppose you might see, by stretching out your neck from our front windows, at a distance of 50 yards on the left. We are called &#x201C;Cheyne Row&#x201D; proper (pronounced, <hi rend="italic">Chainie Row</hi>), and are a &#x201C;genteel neighbourhood,&#x201D; two old Ladies on the one side, unknown character on the other but with &#x201C;pianos&#x201D; as Hunt said. The street is flag-pathed, sunk-storied, iron-railed, all old-fashioned and tightly done up; looks out on a rank of sturdy old <hi rend="italic">pollarded</hi> (that is <hi rend="italic">beheaded</hi>) Lime-trees, standing there like giants in <foreign><hi rend="italic">tawtie</hi></foreign> [matted, shaggy] wigs (for the new boughs are still young) beyond this a high brick-wall, on the inside of which, from our upper stories, appear a garden surrounded with rather dim houses and questionable miscellanea, among other things, clothes drying. Backwards, a Garden (the size of our back one at Comely Bank) with trees &#x26;c, in bad culture; beyond this green hayfields and tree-avenues (once a Bishop&#x2019;s pleasure-grounds) an unpicturesque, yet rather cheerful outlook. The House itself is eminent, antique; wainscotted to the very ceiling, and has been all new-painted and repaired; broadish stair, with massive balustrade (in the old style) corniced and as thick as one&#x2019;s thigh; floors firm as a rock, wood of them here and there worm-eaten, yet capable of cleanness, and still with thrice the strength of a modern floor. And then as to room, Goody! There is room for a Mrs Dr Maxwell.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently a very large, fat woman. For Dr. William Maxwell of Dumfries, see <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280402-TC-JWC-01"><sic>4:351</sic><corr>TC to JWC, <date when="1828-04-02">2 April 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note> Three stories besides the sunk story; in every one of them <hi rend="italic">three</hi> <pb id="pg-07-173" n="07-173"/>apartments in depth (something like 40 feet in all; for it was 13 of my steps!): Thus there is a front dining room (marble chimney-piece &#x26;c); then a back dining-room (or breakfast-room) a little narrower (by reason of the kitchen stair); then out from this, and narrower still (to allow a back-window, you consider), a china-room, or pantry, or I know not what, all shelved, and fit to hold crockery for the whole street. Such is the ground-area, which of course continues to the top, and furnishes <hi rend="italic">every</hi> Bedroom with a dressing room, or even with a <hi rend="italic">second</hi> bedroom. Red Bed will stand behind the drawing room; might have the shower-bath beyond it: the height of this story is 10 feet; of the ground floor 9 but some inches; of the topmost floor 8 feet 6; of the kitchen (where is a Pump and room forever) about the same. Neither this nor the Brompton house have a kitchen-<hi rend="italic">range</hi> (that is, Grate like the Miles&#x2019;s), but only a grate with moveable niggards &#x26;c. In Chelsea is, or lies ready for being, a kitchen-jack; from the boiler-house the boiler (&#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Coppa</hi>&#x201D;) is taken out, but &#x201C;would be replaced.&#x201D; No back-door (communicating with the street); bells in disorder but would be rectified; new locks, some of which threatened to act <hi rend="italic"><foreign>&#xE0; la</foreign> Puttoch,</hi> but seemed very oilless. On the whole a most massive, roomy, sufficient old house; with places, for example, to hang say three dozen hats or cloaks on; and as many crevices, and queer old presses, and shelved closets (all tight and new painted in their way) as would gratify the most covetous Goody. Rent &#xa3;35! I confess I am strongly tempted; yet again incline rather towards the Brompton place (for what <hi rend="italic">use</hi> have we for so much room?), and so go wavering between the two. Chelsea is a singular, heterogeneous kind of spot; very dirty and confused in some places, quite beautiful in others; abounding with antiquities and the traces of great men: Sir T. More, Steele, Smollett,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas More lived from about <date when="1524-00-00">1524</date> at Beaufort House. Smollett had lived in Lawrence St. near by (<date when="1749-00-00">1749</date>&#x2013;<date when="1765-00-00">65</date>), where he had written several of his books including the <hi rend="italic">Adventures of Ferdinand Count Fathom</hi> (<date when="1753-00-00">1753</date>). Sir Richard Steele also lived in Chelsea. See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> &#x26;c &#x26;c. Our Row (which for the last three doors or so is a <hi rend="italic">street</hi>, and none of the noblest) runs out upon a beautiful &#x201C;Parade&#x201D; (perhaps they call it) running along the shore of the River: shops &#x26;c, a broad highway, with huge shady trees; boats lying moored, and a smell of shipping and tar; Battersea Bridge (of wood) a few yards off; the broad River, with white-trowsered, white-shirted Cockneys dashing by like arrows in their long Canoes of Boats; beyond, the green beautiful knolls of Surr<supplied>[e]</supplied>y with their villages: on the whole a most artificial, green-painted, yet lively, fresh, almost opera-looking business, such as you can fancy. We are not a mile from the Cunninghams, <pb id="pg-07-174" n="07-174"/>above a mile from all the rest; and, alas, the Cunninghams I dread are hardly worth being near. I found them as I came up the first time from Chelsea; had a loud guffawing reception, was more struck then ever with the Wife&#x2019;s <foreign><hi rend="italic">unerfreuliches Wesen</hi></foreign> [disagreeable nature]! Allan himself is a good fellow on the whole. They said tea would be ready before long; but alas, I had to walk farther on some mile and half to seek a chop for <hi rend="italic">dinner</hi>.&#x2014; Finally, Chelsea abounds more than any place in <hi rend="italic">Omnibii</hi> (Bayswater least), and they take you to Coventry-street (within a mile of this) for sixpence. Revolve all this in thy fancy and judgement, my child; and see what thou canst make of it. Some amusement, on the journey, at worst.&#x2014;</p> 
<p>No Newspaper has come this morning. <hi rend="italic">Was</hi> there none at hand; or did you think it superfluous having already sent one; or has something gone wrong? I will not think <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.</p> 
<p>Let me now treat thee to a budget of small news. Mill I have not seen again; we could make no appointment, being so unfixed as yet. Mrs Austin had a tragical story of his having fallen <hi rend="italic">desperately in love</hi> with some young ill-<hi rend="italic">married</hi> philosophic Beauty (yet with the <hi rend="italic">innocence</hi> of two sucking doves), and being lost to all his friends and to himself, and what not; but I traced <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> of this in poor Mill; and even incline to think that what truth there is or was in his adventure may have done him <hi rend="italic">good</hi>.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to Mill&#x2019;s love for Harriet Taylor (<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1858-00-00">58</date>), wife of John Taylor, a prosperous wholesale druggist, and daughter of Thomas Hardy, an obstetrician. Mill met Mrs. Taylor in the <date when="1830-00-00">summer of 1830</date> at a dinner party given by the Taylors at their home at which W. J. Fox, J. A. Roebuck, and Harriet Martineau were also present. See F. A. Hayek, <hi rend="italic">John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor</hi> (London, <date when="1951-00-00">1951</date>).</note> Buller also spoke of it; but in the comic vein&#x2014; Irving I have not again seen, tho&#x2019; I have tried four times; yesterday twice (at Bayswater), and the second time with great disappointment. He seems to be under the care of a Scotch <hi rend="italic">sick-nurse</hi> there; was said to be &#x201C;asleep&#x201D; when I called first, then gone (contrary to my appointment) when I called the second time: he rides twice a day down to that Domdaniel<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Infernal cave.</note> in Newman-Street; rises at 5 in the morning, goes to bed at 9; is &#x201C;very weak.&#x201D; I felt extremely sad. I had refused <hi rend="italic">my dinner</hi> at the Austin&#x2019;s for his sake; it seemed to me as if I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have clutched him from perdition and death, and now we were to not meet again. My poor Edward; <foreign><hi rend="italic">heu quantum mutatus</hi></foreign> [alas, how greatly changed]! But I will make a new trial. Heraud said to me quite in the cursory style: &#x201C;Aaving (Irving) is dying, and&#x2014;a&#x2014;&#x201D;! Heraud himself (&#x201C;mad as a March hare,&#x201D; Fraser said) lives now close by here, <pb id="pg-07-175" n="07-175"/>and is exceedingly <foreign><hi rend="italic">kedge</hi></foreign> [eagerly friendly] about me; anxious beyond measure for golden opinions of his god-dedicated Epic<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Judgement of the Flood</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>); the preface begins, &#x201C;This poem is undedicated, save to the service of the Deity.&#x201D;</note> (of which I would not tell him any lie, greatly as he tempted me); talking in a <hi rend="italic">wealthy</hi> strain, yet with grim shadowings of cleanness of teeth; wants me much in some as yet unrevealed &#x201C;Literary Project&#x201D;; is threatened by Fraser with being &#x201C;thrown overboard&#x201D;; has the same old greasy grey complexion, which nitre and much soap will not whiten, the same empty-animated eyes; fears and reverences me much: the innocentest of <hi rend="italic">Duds</hi>. Not <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the air of an <foreign><hi rend="italic">endlich toll-werdenden</hi></foreign> [one who finally goes mad], really!&#x2014; Fraser did not open freely to me, yet was opening: Literature still all a mystery; nothing &#x201C;paying&#x201D;; <hi rend="italic">Teufelk</hi> beyond measure unpopular; an oldest subscriber came in and said, &#x201C;If there is any more of that d&#x2014;&#x2014;d stuff, I will &#x26;c&#x201D;; on the other hand, an order from America (Boston or Philadelphia) to send a copy of the Magazine <hi rend="italic">so long</hi> as there was anything of Carlyle&#x2019;s in it. &#x201C;One <hi rend="italic">spake</hi> up, and the other <hi rend="italic">spake down</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle used this expression as early as <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date> in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>. It is probably a modification of &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Lux Jovi, tenebrae Orco</hi></foreign>&#x201D; [&#x201C;Light unto Pluto is darkness unto Jupiter&#x201D;], which Carlyle found in his reading of Sir Thomas Browne&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Garden of Cyrus, or the Quincuncial Lozenge</hi> (<date when="1658-00-00">1658</date>) in <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>, which he translates in the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> in the precise words used in this letter. For the reception of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, see also <hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi>, pp. 74&#x2013;75.</note> On the whole, Goody, I have a great defiance of all that. A much &#x201C;more gigantic spirit of the two&#x201D; is a fellow with whom here in London I declare to thee with much indifference I have not yet fallen in: yet do not all these <hi rend="italic">live?</hi> As to &#x201C;fame&#x201D; and the like, in <hi rend="italic">very truth</hi>, in this state of the Public, it is a thing one is all ways better without: so I really saw and felt the other night, clearly for the first time. Miss Martineau, for example, is done again; going to America,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >She embarked on <date when="1834-08-04">4 Aug.</date></note> to try a new tack when she returns. So are they all, or <hi rend="italic">will</hi> they inevitably all be, <hi rend="italic">done</hi>; extinguished and abolished, for they are&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi>, and were only <hi rend="italic">called</hi> (and made to fancy themselves) Something.&#x2014; Mrs Austin herself seems to me in a kind of trial-state; risen or rising to where she cannot hope to <hi rend="italic">stand</hi>, where it will be well if she feel <hi rend="italic">no</hi> giddiness; as indeed I really trust she will. A most excellent creature; of <hi rend="italic">surveyable</hi> limits: her goodness I think will in all cases save her. I had a long talk with Austin on Sunday night: he is evidently very unhealthy, little likely to be healthy, a painful, faithful, pitiable man. Lucy is growing a large massive girl, with three-plaited hair, in two long tails, very strange-looking; <pb id="pg-07-176" n="07-176"/><hi rend="italic">strives</hi> (with incomplete success) not to be affected. I was there yesterday, as I said; she had sent a Letter for me to dine that day; but, alas, it had not come till I went off, and so I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> dined at Chelsea&#x2014;on a penny loaf. Eliza finally (after another hour&#x2019;s walking) got me two &#x201C;three-farthings eggs&#x201D; at home, and I took tea in that fashion, not without appetite. This morning, finding the eggs eatable I had the like for I am to dine with the Bullers tonight at six, and will fast till then. Buller is better, and went yesterday (I fancy) to &#x201C;the House,&#x201D; tho&#x2019; he has his <hi rend="italic">operation</hi> still before him. We have had two long talks, on occasion of the Franks; with great mutual delight. An intelligent, clear, honest, most kindly-vivacious creature: the genialest radical I have ever met. He throws light for me on many things, being very <hi rend="italic">ready</hi> to speak. Mrs Austin spoke ominously of his health; but to my seeing, without much ground. Charlie, I think, will be among my little comforts here. Mrs Buller&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> I saw, with a Letter in it held thro&#x2019; the door for me; but not yet her face.&#x2014; Mrs Strachey was waiting for me on Monday night; but I was so wearied and worn out (it was the Chelsea and Cunningham day) and with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">snifter</hi></foreign> [head cold] already beginning on me, I spoke much rather than well, and was not <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>.

<p>The Duke, now plain Mr Jeffrey, but soon to be Lord Jeffrey, is still here for a week: he had left his address for me with Mrs Austin; I determined to call some morning in passing, and did it on Monday. Reception anxiously cordial from all three; hurried insignificant talk from him still at the breakfast table; kindness playing over &#x201C;iron gravity&#x201D; from me. I felt it to be a farewell visit, and that it should be &#x201C;hallowed in our choicest mood.&#x201D; The poor Duke was so tremulous, he bade me &#x201C;good <hi rend="italic">evening</hi>&#x201D; at the door; immense <hi rend="italic">jerking</hi> from Mrs Jeffrey, yet many kind words, and invitations back; silent smiling <foreign><hi rend="italic">Unbedeutendheit</hi></foreign> [trifles] from Miss, who is grown no beauty, but a <pb id="pg-07-177" n="07-177"/>numb <foreign><hi rend="italic">blowse</hi></foreign> [fat-faced girl], with, I think, a large shelf-underlip. And so ends our dealing with bright Jeffreydom; once so sparkling cheerful, now gone out into darkness&#x2014;which has not become foul candlesnuff vapour, but darkness <hi rend="italic">only</hi>. Empson is still alive; but I surely will not seek him. Napier too is here or was; him too I will nowise make or meddle with; the hungry <hi rend="italic">Simulacrum</hi>.</p>
<p>Now Goody is not this enough of news? They are blessed things these Franks. But why has my Newspaper not come? I wish Friday were here. Or will it not be till Saturday? Patience! Patience!</p>
<p>This house is nearly all dismantled; I am driven in to the little Stocking-bed room, and sit there and write; sleeping above. They are all gone but Eliza and a new maid; but only into the next street; and keep up a continual ringing, and running to and fro. The Montagues I understand to be come, and already lodged there; but ask or see nothing of them. Why the people all do not move, except perhaps that they have painting in their new house, I do not know, and cannot give poor Eliza the trouble of running up to tell me. For us, they know, any place will do till we get a place of our own.</p>
<p>Do not forget my Pipes, my Tobacco from Mundell. Such Pipes, such Tobacco as is here! I positively have not had one right smoke since I came away.&#x2014; You have <hi rend="italic">brought</hi> the Lobby chairs? Bring them, Dearie, since you like them; whatever thing <hi rend="italic">you</hi> like, ought it not to come? They will find a place, and merit it, somewhere. Also forget not the Shower-bath; the upper part of it; we can make a tub do for the rest. Bring even <hi rend="italic">Chico</hi>, if you dare undertake it. Poor little Chico; my poor Dame&#x2019;s Pet, and dear to me for her sake too! Do you remember the West-Bow<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A street in Edinburgh running from the Grass Market up to the High St.</note> <hi rend="italic">Snuff-mull</hi>? My own poor Darling!</p>
<p>I go about here, in my new blue Coat, which does quite rarely; with my common grey trowsers, and in the old Puttoch shoes, now at last even without gaiters. Is not that a Beauty!&#x2014; The whirl of this monstrous place looks more and more poetic to me, now that we have made it our home. We will do the best in it, Lassie, and better than we have ever yet done. The Parks are the beautifullest thing you ever saw: all spotted with party-coloured bright children and promenaders on a ground of the purest green. The people have mown their first crop of hay! Hot sunshine, cold Eastwind; you know it: &#x201C;hi from the East doth blow so clear, that hi is felt both far and near.&#x201D;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note></p>

O what hosts of questions, <supplied>[wer]</supplied>e there any hope of answer.</p>
<p>Tell my brave Alick he shall have a Letter to himself, and the longest he ever read; and many of them, only he must answer. My Mother should have had a Note today again; but I reflect that you will be there probably as soon as any Note could be. You will read her these two Letters (except fractions of your <hi rend="italic">own</hi>); and bring her up to the present with me. The first Frank from our new House shall be hers. Give my heart&#x2019;s blessing to them all; my assurance that distance shall not divide us.&#x2014; I have written to Jack: his next Letter will probably be my Mother&#x2019;s.</p>
<p>How we are to order about my next Letter to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>? What you tell me tomorrow must settle it; I will endeavour in all things to conform. But as yet it is wholly vague with me. Above all things, when are you to be here? Tuesday come-a-week? Lose no time, my Own: I know thou wilt not.</p>
<p>My good Jean was to call on Saturday, and see this given to the Minnyhive Carrier.<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The carriers from Moniaive to Dumfries were James Hunter and James Rigg, operating on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

<p><salute>Well My Beloved,</salute> we are once more asunder&#x2014;and not one only, but both of us adrift&#x2014; This is sorry work! the only comfort is it need not last longer than we like, which I think will not be long. We have only to exercise a little more patience&#x2014;to put forth a little more endeavour and we are again united under a roof we can call our own&#x2014;with our own bed to sleep in, our own chairs to sit in, and our now broken divided existence gathered again into a whole. Let us be of good heart then&#x2014;we have nothing to be seriously troubled about&#x2014;we are without a home for the present (if we can ever be said to have had one) but we have each other still&#x2014;and we have <hi rend="italic">our senses</hi>&#x2014;and cannot be cut out of Gods providence<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note>&#x2014;even by &#x201C;the presen Government&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Humorous transcription of someone&#x2019;s pronunciation.</note>&#x2014; We are better off, than many who would pretend to pity us. My worst grief at present is having been constrained to disappoint you, my Ain Husband! so anxiously you would expect my letter&#x2014;so perplexed you would be when it come not! Alas I was loath to di<supplied>[s]</supplied>appoint you for I know how desolate you are feeling in that foolish City&#x2014;how much fretting you are enduring <hi rend="italic">all alone</hi>&#x2014;but it was unavoidable. To send a &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> letter&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle had asked for one (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May</date></ref>): &#x201C;Then a deliberate Letter. &#x2026;&#x201D;</note> on Wednesday was purely impossible as you shall presently see&#x2014;to have sent a hurried distracted line would have made confusion worse confounded.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi>, II, 996.</note> And now that I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> writing I could fill the whole paper with &#x201C;sorrows of Goody&#x201D; about your departure and so forth&#x2014;but this time we must not <hi rend="italic">indulge</hi> in pathetics even when we can get them&#x2014;but attend mainly to the practical which certainly never more required our undivided attention&#x2014; Heaven help me to be what you have so often advised me to, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">brief in narration</hi>&#x201D;&#x2014;otherwise I percieve [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] it were easy to drive you to utter distraction, so much I have to tell and of so perplexed a kind.</p>
<p>I begin with the concern of the house&#x2014;not the house to be got&#x2014;but the one to be disposed of&#x2014; I have been able to do no better than set [lease] it to the Macqueens&#x2014;that is, to set the park to John Macqueen <pb id="pg-07-180" n="07-180"/>at a rent of &#xa3;10 on condition of his Mother living in the house, and keeping it and all about in good order&#x2014;and giving admission to any respectable person whom we might hereafter find, to take it for shooting quarters&#x2014; The bargain to last till the end of Macadams lease. On the whole this arrangement is satisfactory to me and I think you also will be satisfied with it&#x2014; John Macqueen, whom I have now seen, is a fine, straightforward, fellow whom it is pleasant to think of having to do with; and his Mother is known for a woman of approved fidelity&#x2014; Moreover they will <hi rend="italic">pay</hi> the rent such as it is, and as they have a taste for good order, and even, I find, for something beyond, the place will be well kept&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Macadam would have given &#xa3;12 I believe for the convenience of having an inclosure for her cows and taken charge of the house; but then we should have felt no security that the premises would have had the smallest care taken of them by people of such slovenly habits&#x2014; There were two applicants on the very day you went: the first I was obliged to communicate with thro&#x2019; my Mother being in bed with a terrible head&#x2014;but it was no matter how he was communicated with; for it was neither more nor less than the Man Maxwel<supplied>[l]</supplied> who carted the potatoes from Templand&#x2014;and cheated me out of sixpence&#x2014;he had a wife, he stated, with a surprising faculty for keeping Gentlemens houses, provided plenty of firing was allowed her&#x2014;and having occasion for a grass park&#x2014;thought both parties would be accommodate<supplied>[d]</supplied> by making a bargain&#x2014;the plain question &#x201C;what rent he was minded to give,<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> put him to a nonplus (&#x201C;never having given <hi rend="italic">that</hi> a thought yet&#x201D;<supplied>[)]</supplied>, and sent him abruptly away&#x2014;to return on Tuesday when he had considered&#x2014;but as I anticipated we saw no more of him&#x2014; The next opened the business in a quite original style&#x2014;by sending me up a Certificate as to character and <hi rend="italic">privilege of church communion</hi>, written out long years back by the late minister of Keir<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Keyden (<date when="1764-00-00">1764</date>&#x2013;<date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>), minister from <date when="1795-00-00">1795</date> to <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>. Keir was a village and parish 10 miles NE of Craigenputtoch.</note> and signed by my grandfather as elder&#x2014;the &#x2018;John Welsh&#x2019; written in faded ink was an appeal that obtained him a special audience; being better by that time I came down to the strangest old mortal I ever beheld&#x2014;whom I shall entertain you with a detailed account of when the time for laughing is arrived&#x2014; He was a Farmer out of a farm&#x2014;more sinned against than sinning<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">King Lear</hi>, III, ii.</note>&#x2014;name John Twynham<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied>family consisting of a son and sons wife and their &#x201C;two male childer&#x201D;&#x2014; he wanted such a place as ours or a worse to keep a cow or two in the mean time and &#x201C;keep his plenishing together,&#x201D; but before going further required to know &#x201C;the performance expected <pb id="pg-07-181" n="07-181"/>from an occupant of the house, or in other words the labor to be expended thereon&#x201D;&#x2014; provided I &#x201C;fixed a low rent to <hi rend="italic">entice people to come</hi>&#x201D; he was ready to make a bargain. I judged him to be a very honest man&#x2014;hard as flint&#x2014;very sly at driving a bargain and scrupulous in adherehing [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] to terms&#x2014;one whom Alick could transact with better than I, and who failing the Macqueens might prove the next best resource. So I explained to him that I was not at liberty to conclude anything about the place that day; but engaged to meet him at Dumfries next Wednesday&#x2014;being resolved to go down and get that matter finally concluded. Your note which came by Hugh on Saturday night confirmed my purpose&#x2014;and also a visit from old Nanny on the Monday. I should there find Roberts answer, Irving, Twynham,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Evidently Jane had consulted both Robert Welsh (paternal uncle), an Edinburgh attorney, and George Welsh (also a paternal uncle) of Boreland about letting Craigenputtoch, with which both were familiar. The Irving referred to is possibly Irving of Gribton (see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310818-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1831-08-18">18 Aug. 1831</date></ref>); but Twynham is unidentified further.</note> Macqueen and Alick and have the whole matter at once before me. Roberts answer was that he thought the rent mentioned extremely moderate but that Craigenputtoch alone did not afford him scope enough for shooting&#x2014;besides he had taken ground in the next country for this year, he advised me to apply to Irving&#x2014; Irving was not at home when I sent first&#x2014;and the second time he was but had nothing to say&#x2014;he had not seen Babington&#x2014;was to see him that day at dinner&#x2014;and if Alick would call at some place he named at six he would let him know Babingtons mind&#x2014; I recommended both him and Babington to&#x2014;&#x2014;providence, and said <hi rend="italic">no!</hi> we should dance no more attendance on them. George whom I found in the Courier office told me by that time that it could not be the Priest who had any notion of taking shootquarters as he was no sportsman&#x2014;but the Brother of the priest, a great shooter and &#x201C;one of the most damnable <foreign>skytes</foreign> [rascals] with the manners of a gentleman that encumbered gods earth&#x201D; one whom we were better to have nothing to do with. Macqueen was seen next&#x2014;he was quite content to do either way we liked&#x2014;to take the park and furnish up his Mother in the house&#x2014;or to let it alone and keep her where she was. Twynham thro&#x2019; the kindness of Tom Smith had been provided in the interim with &#x201C;two apartments sufficient to contain his plenishing in <hi rend="italic">&#x2018;the still&#x2019;&#x201D;!</hi> (the Distillery)&#x2014; I sent for Macqueen to Bechs<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Babbington brothers were Rev. Charles, Episcopal minister of Dumfries, who lived with his brother John in Summerville House. For the Becks, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18310824-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, [<date when="1831-08-24">24 Aug. 1831</date>]</ref>, where Jane writes from &#x201C;Dumfries&#x2014;Mrs. Becks&#x201D;: a Thomas Beck had a grocery at 28 Queensberry St. Tom Smith is unidentified.</note>&#x2014;and <hi rend="italic">over a bottle of ale</hi> made the <pb id="pg-07-182" n="07-182"/>agreement above mentioned&#x2014;writing out a little contract <hi rend="italic">with my own hand</hi> to be mutually as gay to his and Alicks great amusement&#x2014; I further appointed him to come over on Tuesday morning (he could not come sooner) to tell me what articles he chose to buy for his Mother&#x2014; I might perhaps have got more rent from him but as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> said&#x2014;that he would give what ever I understood to be the value of the park I was bound to ask no more than its value. To finish off the business of Craigenputtoch I may add here that I asked George if he would take the farm when Macadams lease was out&#x2014;he answered that he was dying and I fear it is too true&#x2014;but that if he lived so long he would either take it himself or find us a Tenant capable of managing it&#x2014;and was still of opinion that it should bring two hundred pounds&#x2014; So far my Wednesday&#x2019;s business was easy compared with what had to go on &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">collaterally</hi>.&#x2019;</p>
<p>Alick&#x2019;s first information was astounding&#x2014;that all &#x201C;the plenishing&#x201D; for London was to be packed and <foreign>laded</foreign> [loaded] by Tuesday night (the first Tuesday) and put into the steam boat on Thursday&#x2014;so <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had appointed&#x2014;and accordingly William Austin was to be up with two carts on Saturday night&#x2014;Jamie of Scotsbrig on Sunday night on the little pony and Jamie Austin with one cart on Monday night&#x2014;yet not till Monday night was I to hear from you and be assured that there was a house to furnish&#x2014;and instructed what sort of furniture would be needed.&#x2014; I thought at the time I had never known you do anything so Irish&#x2014;it was like &#x201C;taking the stones of the old prison to build the new and keeping the prisoners in the old till the new should be built.<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied> Since I got your letter in which you do not once mention this appointment&#x2014;never once seem to calculate on its having been carried into effect&#x2014;and above all speak of mats being sent when you must have known that the whole packing would be over before I could possibly receive or hear tell of them&#x2014;I begin to believe in spite of their positive affirmations that you made no such <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> appointment. When were you ever inconsiderate? when did you ever <hi rend="italic">forget</hi> an appointment? when did you ever inflict on your Goody such a horrid press of work without consulting her wishes or convenience&#x2014; No! they <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have misunderstood you. My Darling never mind! it is all managed I think for the best. The packing had indeed to be transacted without other guidance than my knowledge of what was essential to <hi rend="italic">any</hi> house, and the value of our gear&#x2014;nay our goods had to be sent off without other address than a name and a number <hi rend="italic">1</hi> but it is all safe (I hope) in Nicholson&#x2019;s warerooms at Annan whither I shall go so soon as I know its destination and address it with my <pb id="pg-07-183" n="07-183"/>own hand. Unless you prefer my coming first to help you in your troublesome quest, when I shall entrust that part of the business to some careful hand. I should have infinitely preferred leaving it packed at Craigenputtoch. But the men looked all so grim that night of the letter&#x2014;as if I could help it or you either, and reflected about &#x201C;people being all thrown off their own work for no end&#x201D;&#x2014;and declared it was quite impossible to gather again and come back! and so when Alick asked what I meant to do I said resolutely finish in the dark as we have begun&#x2014;number the bales and take a receipt for them from Nicholson and let them lie at Annan till we heard further&#x2014; It would be better he thought to <foreign>laid</foreign> [load] them into the vessel at once, and send them off (without direction!) for &#x201C;to a certainty you would have got a house before they reached London&#x2014;and you could go and inquire for them,&#x201D; but I declared that if I should hawk all Dumfrieshire for hands to carry them into the sloop I would not do any so absurdly rash as that. I charged him further to get the carts weighed<supplied>[&#x2014;]</supplied>packed and afterwards empty&#x2014;but I incline to think the steam far the best conveyance as it saves so much shifting,&#x2014; Moreover our packer the best in Dumfries the best I believe in the whole world assured me the furniture was much more heavy than bulky and a conveyance where bulk was the criterion of expence should be prefer<supplied>[r]</supplied>ed: he is a most experienced hand&#x2014;found by Jamie Aitken and from what I saw of him I should have no hesitation in following his advice so Except this <foreign>burblement</foreign> of having to send off the things without a proper direction all has been well got thro. Tho I (and every body in the house) had to be up three successive mornings at three and did not get lain down till one at night&#x2014;my head has never been so bad but I could mind my business&#x2014; I am sure the things may travel to the worlds end without damage&#x2014;so well are they packed and so cunningly to save bulk. And their [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] was the finest dry weather for their journey to Annan; which was a natural point since they were to remain unpacked for nobody knows how long. But you are wondering <hi rend="italic">what</hi> things have been thus strangely <hi rend="italic">thrown out <foreign>sang froid</foreign> to charity</hi>. There are the two red beds (I judged it better to cut them down if need were than let them be wasted) the feather beds and wool mat<supplied>[t]</supplied>resses (these things would have been unsafest of any to buy there, for fear of bugs) the two chests of drawers packed with the best of the books, the plate, the napery, the looking glass and pictures &#x26;c &#x26;c. The two small mahogany tables and the two half circular ends&#x2014; The writing table&#x2014;winecooler packed with crystal&#x2014;the stone and china and glass&#x2014; The dining room chairs and Lobby chairs. The three brass fenders&#x2014; All <pb id="pg-07-184" n="07-184"/>the carpets except the old green one&#x2014; The clock packed in the up stairs hydrastiry (a device of my own) Some light new kitchen tin articles and a very few of the heavier utensils for which I had a particular favour. All the books and all the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> pipes (the box was nailed up before your letter came and there was no time for subtracting the little ones<supplied>[)]</supplied>. Oatmeal&#x2014;some hams (I sent one of the bacon ones to Macdiarmid) pots of marm<supplied>[a]</supplied>lade &#x26;c&#x2014; Two pounds of tobacco (which I ascertained from Mundel after it was bought<supplied>[)]</supplied> came from&#x2014;&#x2014;London! via Glasgow&#x2014; I shall take down the makers proper address&#x2014; Window hangings and brass furnishings (not the cornices which the packer declared not worth carriage) The Venetian blinds (in a package by themselves so that they can be returned from Annan to Jamie Aitken that he may try to dispose of them if they are found to be useless<supplied>[)]</supplied>. Blankets&#x2014;and doubtless some other small items which I cannot at this instant recall.

The same objection would apply to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> <foreign>roups</foreign> then, in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> time, and I wished if possible to leave no tag rag behind me. I sent for Nanny Macqueen on the Saturday to learn what there was a chance of her taking&#x2014; She <hi rend="italic">named</hi> the bare necessaries&#x2014;the Kitchen bed, a few of the worst chairs, and some pots and pans and milktackel&#x2014;but she also &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">squinted</hi>&#x201D; at several superfluities&#x2014;a four-posted bed the old green carpet &#x26;c&#x2014;but <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>wished to put John to no expense she could help&#x201D;&#x2014; I made out an inventory of every thing I was not for taking with me; including the drawing room chairs and large dining table which I had not made up my mind about&#x2014;(the former were so frail the latter so unwieldy and requiring so large a room&#x2014;) and affixed what I judged a reasonable price&#x2014;I also marked the articles Nanny wanted, and put a different mark to those she had merely heaved a wish for.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340225-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-02-25">25 Feb.</date></ref></note> And had

The mail from Craigenputtoch went out on Wednesdays, but Jane was preparing to leave Craigenputtoch for Templand on this Wednesday.</note> yesterday was as busy a day as any&#x2014;for after the last carts were gone&#x2014;I had my own duds to pack&#x2014;and the Macqueens&#x2019; things to collect into some sort of decent order&#x2014;and then I had to go in by Barjarg on the road hither and replace the books&#x2014; My mother staid with me to the last&#x2014;worked like a Turk&#x2014;was pettish enough and annoying with contradictory advice&#x2014;but on the whole helpful.

<p>And now what is to be said about <hi rend="italic">your</hi> house? First and foremost I vote for having nothing to do with M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Austin&#x2019;s&#x2014;these arrangements always give dissatisfaction and besides it is not till <date when="1834-08-00">August</date> that we could have access to it&#x2014;and in the mean time our goods are at Annan and Goody without <hi rend="italic">home</hi>. That Brompton one appears far the likeliest speculation&#x2014;my counsel is to take that if it can be had on reasonable terms&#x2014; But if there be any drawback which I am not aware of &#x26; if you have found no other to your mind, then I am of opinion I should come to you in Ampton Street or where else you may be, and help you with my judgement such as it is&#x2014; In case of a house being taken I shall sail in the same boat with the furniture and have the satisfaction of seeing with my own eyes what comes of it in Liverpool&#x2014; and be in London in time to receive it&#x2014;for no body is so necessary at the unpacking as some one that has been at the packing. In the other case I shall start when you bid me&#x2014;by the next boat but one shall I not? that is Tommorrow [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] fortnight&#x2014; I should prefer tomorrow week, only there would be little time to work on after receiving you<supplied>[r]</supplied> answer. And moreover the next<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane has written &#x201C;first&#x201D; above &#x201C;next.&#x201D;</note> is my <hi rend="italic">sick week</hi>, when it is probable I shall be more useless than ordinary, after so much fatigue&#x2014; How often I called to mind your kind injunctions to take things quietly and <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;save myself&#x201D;;</hi> and strove to obey you<supplied>[.]</supplied> But these inju<supplied>[n]</supplied>ctions were all rendered fruitless&#x2014;</p>
<p>That day in Dumfries was such a day as you never saw&#x2014;so much hithering and thithering about the house&#x2014;so much running after packers&#x2014;so much hunting for mats &#x26;c (I got two dozen and three which with a few at home were sufficient, for 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi> each nearly half <pb id="pg-07-188" n="07-188"/>price from Bryden Spirit Dealer good and large&#x2014;) then all &#x201C;the victualling&#x201D; to provide for such a number of people&#x2014;all the investigations about Drumpark&#x2014;it was one in the morning when we reached home&#x2014; O Good what I would give for a long long sleep in your arms. I have never however neglected nourishing myself with wholesome food and even a little Brandy and to my care in this particular I attribute it that I have continued so well.</p>
<p>There is a kind letter from my Uncle to my Mother this morning in which he says of our departure &#x201C;This change in the order of things would come suddenly on you and like all similar changes throw you into a meditating fit; but we will hope it is for the best; as without doubt they know what they are doing, and I shall be much deceived if we do not see &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Him</hi>&#x2019; something to astonish the world yet, he has it in him if he would only let it escape in a tangible shape.&#x201D;</p>
<p>I have heard nothing of the mats&#x2014;and hope they will not come&#x2014;in case they did I consulted the packer how I might get rid of them&#x2014;and he thought Thomson <supplied>[woul]</supplied>d readily buy them of me&#x2014;</p>
<p>And now darling I must conclude&#x2014;tho&#x2019; my paper is not exhausted, my strength and intellect are&#x2014;</p>
<p>Commend me to our &#x201C;celebrated&#x201D; friends and to the poor Miles&#x2014; with whom I am most thankful to know you lodged&#x2014; And so God bless you my Husband&#x2014; Be not &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Bloody</hi>&#x201D; but &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">bold</hi> and <hi rend="italic">resolute</hi>&#x201D;<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi>, IV, i.</note>&#x2014; and your Goody, &#x201C;tho&#x2019; desperate, no coward,&#x201D;<note n="19" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane is echoing her own words.

The Lord Advocate was quite as much surprised as I was, so that at least I was not the last to be told of what might be supposed to concern me.&#x201D;<lb/><lb/>
In the same letter she added a further word concerning Jeffrey and, incidentally, Carlyle: &#x201C;Jeffrey&#x2019;s eyes (though they have neither the depth of speculation or of feeling that I see in your Husband&#x2019;s) are singularly handsome and there is a very prepossessing sprightliness about him, that gives an air of youth and gaiety to every thing he says&#x2014;the airy elegance of some of our old Comedies, sparkling &#x26; witty withal&#x2014; A man to read Pope and Congreve with but not Milton and Shakespear&#x2014;still I find him capable of deeper sentiment than you are, for you have forgotten him as well as me, and he seems to think of you as kindly as ever.&#x201D; In an earlier letter to Jane (<date when="1834-02-25">25 Feb.</date>) Mrs. Montagu had protested vigorously against Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s treatment of Burns in a recent work: &#x201C;Allan Cunningham<supplied>[,]</supplied> who ought to have known better, has published (without leave from me) all the idle and disjointed chat, which he could pick up about Robert Burns, most of it misrepresented, confused, and lamentably purposeless, and as vulgar in the language as it is worthless in the matter&#x2014;and this he has put my name to, who have ever represented Burns as incapable of rudeness or vulgarity, on the contrary as gentle, modest in his manner to women, well bred and gentlemanly in all the courtesies of life, with a natural politeness, poorly imitated by the artificial polish of society, since his manner arose out of the chivalric respect and devotion he bore to the sex,&#x2014;a respect that modulated his voice, and veiled the flashing of his eyes, and gave a winning grace to the most trifling of his attentions,&#x2014;this, and a thousand other things, and all in commendation have I, from time to time endeavoured to infuse into the dense faculty of honest Allan, and above all, that during the Carnival of the Caledonean Hunt, &#x2018;when Universal Scotland all was drunk,&#x2019; I never saw Burns once intoxicated, though the worthy Member for Dumfries, &#x26; the good <foreign>Laird</foreign> of Arbigland and 20 more that might be named, were much more tipsy than Tam o Shanter, for he could see witches &#x26; warlocks, but they could neither see or stand, and were brought home in a state of inglorious insensibility&#x2014;. I have told him 20 times that Burns always left a dinner party if there were women, long before any other man joined it&#x2014;and this in his thick-skull has produced the following brilliant remark <hi rend="italic">from Mrs Montagu &#x2018;he drank as other men drank&#x2019;</hi>&#x2014; Charles when he had read the Book said he had serious thoughts of committing suicide that upon the Coroner&#x2019;s inquest it might appear that he had died of &#x2018;The Life of Burns,&#x2019; because a small vindication might then be offered to prove that his Mother was neither so foolish or so vulgar as the Book made her appear&#x2014; The <hi rend="italic">style</hi> is so little like what I could say that I never thought it worth my while to make a remark upon it&#x2014; Poor Burns. Misfortune pursues thee even in the grave.&#x2014; So it is with almost all great men, reverence keeps silent all who loved the Man, and Traders, take up the theme&#x2014; I am sorry for Allan; but after seeing him attempt a History of English Literature, and a History of Painting, when I would not buy a picture of his commending or consult him upon a matter of taste in literature&#x2014;I cannot be surprised at his failure&#x2014; he flies at all game, with the spirit of adventure, not with the inspiration of thought and reflection.&#x201D;</note></p></ps>

<p><salute>It is all right, Dearest;</salute> the letter is come! I had taken precaution for having it forwarded hither by the post, and but for the regulation about church hours might have had time to answer it last night. Thank Heaven it gives me a cheerier picture of you than the last did, which in truth saddened even more than it perplexed me: for I could <pb id="pg-07-191" n="07-191"/>not but reflect how great the pressure of misery must needs be that had been able to make <hi rend="italic">you</hi> other than clear and all-mindful.</p>
<p>No wonder <hi rend="italic">that</hi> appointment escaped your recollection made amidst the sadness and hurry of so many partings. and lost sight of in the wearisome disappointing quest which you had to engage in after! And it would not have been so very &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Irish</hi>&#x201D; had there been Tuesday Wednesday and till Thursday morning to work on <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the receipt of your letter, as undoubtedly you meant there should be (for I still have &#x201C;an internal evidence&#x201D; that the <foreign>lading</foreign> so soon as Tuesday was no part of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> arrangement) You could not have thought it possible (setting aside the instructions to be conveyed in the letter) that the <hi rend="italic">work</hi> could have been got thro in so short a time; as indeed it could not; had we not worked thro&#x2019; most of the last three nights as well as by day. But no matter about all that now It is comfortable that what you wished we might do in the circumstances, has been to a certain extent done<supplied>[.]</supplied> For I confess to you, when you spoke of <date when="1834-06-24">24<hi rend="italic">th</hi> of June</date> and offers of houses in <date when="1834-08-00">August</date> and all at such distance I thought it a step for which I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> get myself sever<supplied>[e]</supplied>ly reprimanded to send the things out of the house&#x2014;in such uncertainty at all&#x2014;and only to be risked in preference to causing so much inconvenience to so many people as were assembled to help us&#x2014; And now you wish the furniture and Goody off immediately&#x2014; Dearest &#x201C;it <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be done&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An expression of London shopkeepers.</note> There is no earthly objection to my sailing on Friday first<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The first Friday after the date of this letter, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May</date>.</note>&#x2014;[but on the contrary every motive to hasten to you at the soonest possible]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >JWC&#x2019;s brackets.</note> except one&#x2014;and that one is not of consequence enough to stand in the way of your wishes and my own&#x2014; It was only in case of there being no <foreign><hi rend="italic">outrake</hi></foreign> [expedition] for me if I joined you so soon that I spoke in my last of waiting till the Friday following&#x2014; I must lay my account with a little illness and it is not very material whether I transact it in a steamboat or coach or in my bed at Templand or Scotsbrig&#x2014;so keep yourself quite easy about me. I wrote to Alick last night (according to previous appointment) between the receiving of yours and the departure of the post&#x2014;and told him I would meet him at Dumfries on Wednesday (the day after tomorrow) where he was to be at any rate. My Mother talks of going to Dumfries along with me. She was for going all the way (to Annan that is) but I strongly objected&#x2014; One has enough to do at present without <hi rend="italic">scenes</hi>&#x2014; I fear there will not be time to get another letter from you before Friday&#x2014;but at all rates <pb id="pg-07-192" n="07-192"/>I shall expect to find one in Maryland Street&#x2014;&#x201C;they do me so much good&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech.</note>&#x2014;and I will write from Maryland Street when you are to expect me in London.</p>
<p>About two hours after my last was on its road, it came into my mind like liquid fire and ran over my whole face neck and arms that I had omitted to seal it! Had it been under cover to Jeffrey I think I should have died with vexation&#x2014;for I am doubtful whether <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would not have read it from beginning to end&#x2014; But Charles Buller is &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">an English Gentleman</hi>&#x201D; and would take no advantage of my stupidity&#x2014; The thing that annoyed me most was the unsatisfactory idea of my whole general disposition for the management of &#x201C;the great things to do&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The story was frequently told of the Comte de Saint-Simon (<date when="1760-00-00">1760</date>&#x2013;<date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>: see <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300809-TC-GE-01">TC to GE, <date when="1830-08-09">9 Aug. 1830</date></ref>) that his valet was instructed to call him each morning with &#x201C;<foreign>Levez-vous, Monsieur le Comte; vous avez de grandes choses &#xE0; faire</foreign>.&#x201D; See, for example, A.

<p>There was a letter from John to my Mother two days ago, and not a word about mats&#x2014; I sincerely hope none are come but, it is possible they may still be lying at Thomsons&#x2014;if so we shall get rid of them the best way we can.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>If you received the Newspaper, which I sent off two days ago, you would in all probability notice the covert announcement of this on it: I omitted the <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> to make you look for something else. And now here is the Frank; and a full sheet, and willing pen! Nothing but the heart is required, and that shall not be wanting.</p>
<p>Since yesterday afternoon, when Jane&#x2019;s new Letter came, I am in a much better position; I know rightly what I am doing, what I have to look for: the poor Goodwife is probably at this moment sitting with Mary in the Battery Mansion at Annan, waiting till the tide flow; Alick or some other with her to see the embarkation completed. By this time tomorrow, if all go well, she will be sitting (probably less at her ease) in Liverpool; and in a few days longer, I shall have her here, and this weary perplexed business of Flitting will like all other businesses come to an end. Among the many things she is to bring me, news from Scotsbrig, of which hitherto except by silence I am quite destitute, will not be the least welcome.</p>
<p>My dear Mother! How often have I thought of you since we were parted; in all varieties of solemn moods, only seldom or never in a purely sad and painful one! My most constant feeling is one not without a certain sacredness: I determine to live worthily of such a Mother; to know always, like her, that we are ever in our great Taskmaster&#x2019;s eye,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311225-TC-JCA-01">TC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCA</corr>, <date when="1831-12-25">25 Dec. 1831</date></ref>.</note> with whom are the issues not of Time only, which is but a short <hi rend="italic">vision</hi>, but of Eternity, which ends not, and is a reality. Oh that I could keep these things forever clear before me; my whole prayer with regard to Life were granted.&#x2014; But these things also should not make us gloomy or sorrowful: far from that. Have we not, as you often say, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">many</hi> mercies&#x201D;? Is not the light to see that they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> mercies, the heart to be thankful for them the first and greatest of <pb id="pg-07-195" n="07-195"/>these?&#x2014; Here is a Frank, for example, whereon to talk with you at my leisure: is not that a mercy for us both? I promise you, if I prosper, there shall be many such.</p>
<p>Since I wrote Jane&#x2019;s Letter, which I hope she read to you last night, there has nothing in the least memorable turned up. I have been wandering about in search of houses; yet with a feeling that I was doing little good; that till Jane arrived there could be almost nothing farther done. The more welcome was the news yesterday that she was actually under way. We have still the great Chelsea House before us, and the Brompton Cottage, and enow of others: there seems no doubt but we shall get a very tolerable place, fully as cheap as we expected. The <hi rend="italic">first Frank</hi>, I said, from our new house was to be for you: do not consider this hasty scrawl as any fulfilment of that promise; for I mean still to fulfil it to the letter. Probably before this day three weeks, I may have my firm old Table set up somewhere; and my kind Mother shall have news of me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile assure yourself, dear Mother, that all goes well. In regard to health, this incessant toil, and even irregular living seems to agree with me; I take no drugs, I really feel fresher and stronger than I used to do amid the moorlands. Moreover, I never was farther in my life from &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tining</hi></foreign> [losing] <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>,&#x201D; which I know well were to &#x201C;<hi rend="italic"><foreign>tine</foreign> all</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A favorite saying with Carlyle, used several times in letters to his mother at this time.</note> Not a bit of me! I walk along these tumultuous streets with nothing but a feeling of kindness, of brotherly pity towards all: no loudest boasting of man strikes any the smallest terror into me for the present: indeed, how should it, when no loudest boasting and threatening of the Devil himself would? He nor they &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> hinder thee of God&#x2019;s Providence.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> No, they cannot.&#x2014;&#x2014; In fact, the good people here are mournfully in want of teachers; readier too, I think, for listening to a teacher than most others are: I feel a persuasion that some kind and profitable relation will establish itself between us; above all, I have the clearest certainty that if work is appointed me here to do, it must and will be done, and means found for doing it. So fear nothing, my dear Mother! Tom will endeavour not to disgrace you in this new position more than in others.</p>
<p>I have seen some Book-publishing persons, some &#x201C;literary men&#x201D; also; of all whom my opinion continues much as it was. The great proportion are indubitablest <hi rend="italic">Duds;</hi> these too we must let pass, and <pb id="pg-07-196" n="07-196"/>even welcome when they meet us with kindliness. By far the sensiblest man I see is Mill, who seems almost fonder of me than ever. The class he belongs to has the farther merit of being genuine and honest so far as they go: I think it is rather with that class that I shall connect myself than with any other; but still in many important respects I have to expect to feel myself <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>. Charles Buller is grown a very promising man; likely to do good in the world, if his health were only better, which as yet hampers him much. He evidently likes me well, as do all his household; and will be a considerable pleasure to me. I was dining there, as hinted in Jane&#x2019;s Letter; it was this day week: I saw various notable persons, Radical Members, and such like; among whom a young very rich man named Sir W. Molesworth pleased me considerably:<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir William Molesworth (<date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1855-00-00">55</date>), educated at Edinburgh and at Cambridge, whence he was expelled for offering to fight his tutor in a duel. He then studied in Germany and travelled in Italy. At this time he was M.P. for East Cornwall; later, a prominent politician and cabinet minister. He also edited Hobbes, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, 10 vols. (London, <date when="1839-00-00">1839</date>&#x2013;<date when="1845-00-00">45</date>).</note> we have met since, and shall probably see much more of one another. He seems very honest; needs or will need guidance much; and with it, may do not a little good. I liked the frank manners of the young man, so beautiful in contrast with Scottish <hi rend="italic">Gigmanity</hi>; I pitied his darkness of mind, and heartily wished him well. He is, among other things, a vehement smoker of tobacco! This Molesworth is one of the main men that are to support (with hard cash, if no otherwise) that Radical Review of theirs; with which it seems likely that I may rather heartily connect myself, if it take a form I can do with. The rest of the Reviews are sick and lean; ready for nothing, so far as I can see, but a gentle death. I also mean to write a <hi rend="italic">new Book</hi>; and in a <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> enough style, you may depend on it: by the time we have got the flitting rightly over, I shall have settled what and how it is to be. Either on the French Revolution, or John Knox and our Scottish Kirk!</p>
<p>By dint of incessant industry I again got to see Edward Irving; and on Saturday last, spent two hours with him. He seemed to have wonderfully recovered his health, and I trust will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> perish in these delusions of his. He is still a good man; yet wofully given over to his idols; and enveloped, for the present, and nigh choked, in the despicablest coil of cobwebs ever man sat in the midst of. He is four miles from this place; removed into one of the suburbs (near where we <hi rend="italic">are</hi> to live) for two months: nevertheless I will insist on seeing him again ere long.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-197" n="07-197"/>Mrs Strachey I have seen some three times; but not in very advantageous circumstances: she is the same true woman she ever was; indignant at the oppressing of the poor, at the wrong and falsehood with which the Earth is filled; yet rather gently withdrawn from it, and hoping in what is beyond it, than actively at war with it. She has not yet found Miss Morris; whom I should like very well to see. In a word, my dear Mother, all persons are very kind to me; I am of good good heart and health: what more could I wish to tell you at present?</p>
<p>Turning my eyes now towards Annandale, there is already so much that I want to know, and can only guess at, till I see Jane. Is it rightly settled who is to take charge of writing to me here? Let them, as they value the good report of their conscience, lay that to heart! I fear now that Jean is away I shall be too indifferently served. The Newspaper (I mean the Courier) Jean may still read, and Alick too; but I must have it sent hither from Scotsbrig with some <hi rend="italic">mark</hi> on it, every week: if put in at Ecclefechan on the Thursday (or at Lockerby), it will be here on Saturday; and I can send it back again if any one farther wants it. But perhaps Jane has settled all that already. We shall hear when she comes. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, or something equivalent to it, I hope to continue to get; and send you sooner than you used to receive it. Have you heard yet that the Ministry is broken up; and a new one (more Radical than the other) getting itself together?<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Four ministers had resigned on <date when="1834-05-27">27 May</date> over a resolution in the Commons for the immediate dispossession of the Church of Ireland of part of its &#x201C;temporalities.&#x201D; Greville, <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>, ed. L. Strachey and Roger Fulford (London, <date when="1938-00-00">1938</date>), III, 40, speaks of &#x201C;a paltry patching up&#x201D; rather than a more radical new ministry.</note> Few men can be more indifferent to that matter than I. It is also said here that his Majesty (poor man) has gone out of his wits.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Greville, III, 36 (<date when="1834-05-23">23 May</date>) testifies to the rumor: &#x201C;There is a very strong impression abroad that the King is cracked.&#x201D;</note> As I came hither, I met in Staffordshire a long Trades&#x2019; Union in procession (and said &#x201C;Steady!&#x201D; to them, as the drill serjeants do): one little limb of a Business that is covering the whole Empire.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Staffordshire the Potters&#x2019; Union, for example, had 3,000 members, and Carlyle evidently saw one of the many processions, such as one reported in the <hi rend="italic">Staffordshire Mercury</hi>, <date when="1834-05-24">24 May</date>, protesting against the transportation of the Tolpuddle laborers, at Hanley. Tried on <date when="1834-03-18">18 March</date> for administering illegal oaths, the Tolpuddle &#x201C;martyrs&#x201D; were transported for seven years by <date when="1834-04-15">15 April</date>; their sentence provoked the marches, the biggest of which was in London on <date when="1834-04-21">21 April</date>, in which nineteen unions took part. Carlyle also refers to the wave of intense trade union activity, including strikes, which began in <date when="1833-11-00">Nov. 1833</date> but was effectively repressed by <date when="1834-08-00">Aug. 1834</date>, when the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union (founded <date when="1834-02-00">Feb. 1834</date>) was dissolved.</note> So that putting <pb id="pg-07-198" n="07-198"/>all together, there is a pretty kettle of fish! Happily it is not we that have to cook it.</p>
<p>But the thing I had to say was that the people here have been <hi rend="italic">flitting</hi> for a fortnight, and now tomorrow I must flit along with them, into the next street: &#x201C;47. Frederick Street, Grey&#x2019;s Inn Road&#x201D;; that continues to be the address till you hear farther. By the bye, I asked already for a Scotsbrig Newspaper, and got none: had you none? With my good Mother I am well sure, the fault, if fault there was, did <hi rend="italic">not</hi> lie.&#x2014; I wrote to Jack, and directed him how in the meanwhile to write to me. Your kind messages were all, as far as possible, faithfully sent.</p>
<p>Now, my dear Mother, can you read this Letter? Tho&#x2019; you cannot, let not that discourage you: <hi rend="italic">persevere</hi> rigidly, and it will grow as easy to you as print. I assure you, it will. Only read it over and over, the whole will get quite familiar to you. There is also nothing to hinder your writing to me with your own hand. You have only to begin and take time and patiently do your best, and you will positively <hi rend="italic">do</hi> it well enough.</p>
<p>Have you ever been on Harry yet? I hope the little Stool<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably a squat four-legged beast, like a stool.</note> will carry you well: if he do not, woe befal him. You must not stay much at home for some time: go about among them; the motion itself will do you good. Above all, I like well to think of you as enjoying Seabathing with poor Mary: the Sea is so strengthening always; Mary is so kind and warm-hearted. I think you should go there, as soon as the new House (where I figure them all as arranging and sorting at present) is in a state of readiness. From Alick you will get edifying conversation, free air, and kindheartedness enough, &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">capon</hi>&#x201D; tho&#x2019; he be. Tell him, tell them all, as they value my blessing to be good to you! Were I once settled, I will send you some Books and <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign>, if the Dumfries conveyance still hold good; Jean can take charge of them. Surely it will all <supplied>[be]</supplied> well! Jack and I, if it please merciful Providence, will return and find you all doing well. May God <supplied>[grant]</supplied> it!</p>
<p>Since I began this last Leaf, the Chelsea man has been here about his House we were talkin<supplied>[g of.]</supplied> He seems a very reasonable little body; it is not unlikely we may make a bargain with <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, for rea<supplied>[lly]</supplied> his house is by far the cheapest and best. But nothing is to be settled till Jane arrive.</p>
<p>I designed to write my good Alick a word today, but cannot now manage it, for I have Jane also to write to; and the Post-hour advances. <pb id="pg-07-199" n="07-199"/>Tell Alick so, and that he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> soon hear from me.&#x2014; Did you get all the things you wanted from Craigenputtoch? Jane mentions several; but not the <hi rend="italic">Kettle</hi>; on which last I fitted a wooden handle the day before I came off, expressly for your use!</p>
<p>This is a sad rambling Letter; but you &#x201C;must just excuse us.&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2018;You must excuse us the day (to-day), sir,&#x2019; as the coach guard once said to me; &#x2018;the weather&#x2019;s no what we could wish!&#x2019;&#x201D; (TC&#x2019;s note on a similar expression in one of Jane&#x2019;s letters, A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>, I, 109).</note> The next we hope will turn out better. Give my love to every one at Scotsbrig; the love of a Brother.

<p><salute>God be thanked, my own Dearest,</salute> here is word from you again! It is long since I have been so happy as when I found your Letter yesterday, as I came in to dinner. The last one, which I had longed and languished, four days, for, left me in the absurd predicament of neither accurately knowing your motions, nor even understanding how to address a Letter to you. I had prepared a Frank for my Mother at Scotsbrig, as the only thing possible; but now that is superfluous for your part of it: you have done as I hoped and calculated you would do if it lay in your power; like a dear Child you are hastening to me; in few days I shall hold you in this bosom, and now once more &#x201C;it is all right.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech. Cf. Huxley, <hi rend="italic">JWCLF</hi>, p. 334; A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NLM</hi>, II, 15.</note> Could I have spoken I would have said, Do not hasten if your health is to suffer, much as, on all accounts, I long to see you. However, you have heeded none of these hindrances: <pb id="pg-07-200" n="07-200"/>at this hour I fancy you on the Solway Brine, with one sure hope in your heart, all too overclouded otherwise: God bless you for it; and bring you safe to my heart! But O, my little Lassie, take care of yourself; rest, if rest be possible, when you get to land. I see not how I can forgive myself if you suffer mischief by haste to obey me. But we will hope and pray, it may still not be so.</p>
<p>There is little room in this sheet, and it is uncertain whether I may get a Frank; for poor Buller you must understand is undergoing his surgical operation, and not to be seen lightly if at all for some days; tho&#x2019; I will try nevertheless; and make arrangements which may answer <hi rend="italic">either</hi> way. Let us above all, therefore, get on with business.</p>
<p>And first as to Craigenputtoch, take my thanks for your cleverness, adroitness and despatch: I find all quite wonderfully well settled; there is hardly one thing I think of which I would have voted otherwise. The Shower-bath is far better where it is. <hi rend="italic">One</hi> of the backroom beds I had been calculating on; but that too seems particularly <hi rend="italic">well sold</hi>, and probably we shall get another here for no great increase of cost. In this also, therefore, we will be thankful. Is Chico actually with you? Thou little fool! Yet dear even in thy follies.</p>
<p>Now with regard to the Furniture, as I think you will have decided for the Steam method, which also agrees with my notions, the only thing needful is for your Uncle to send me precise instructions whom I am to call on here, and present my document to. A Frank to Charles Buller (give him the new address) will hold it all; if there indeed be any advantage in such haste, and you cannot bring it all up quietly in your pocket! Either way, I fancy it to be now quite simple.</p>
<p>Next as to your coming hither. I have only one counsel to give: Be careful of your health! If you are getting rest and strength in your Uncle&#x2019;s house, do not grudge another four-and-twenty hours: I will patiently give it thee, Dearest. But, alas, I fear there is little chance of rest: so the sooner you have it over the better. By the bye will they deliver this Letter on Saturday Night? They surely ought; and yet I know they disappointed you once before. Pray Heaven it be not so again. I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have written <hi rend="italic">a line</hi>, last night, still in time, and wish now I had done it. However, perhaps fortune again will favour us.</p>
<p>But observe now first that we (that is, I and all of us) are to shift out of this house tomorrow. The new address is, &#x201C;47. Frederick Street, Gray&#x2019;s Inn Road&#x201D; (close by): address your announcement to me that way: it will reach me thro&#x2019; Buller some four hours later than by the direct post, but to all appearance quite as certainly. We are to have the ground-floor in that new house (a better than this, they say), and, <pb id="pg-07-201" n="07-201"/>alas, only our old familiar stocking-bed;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Apparently a built-in bed, with only one rail or &#x201C;stock&#x201D; [beam].</note> in which nevertheless you shall contrive to sleep wonderfully well&#x2014;on my arm? The rest of the accommodation will <hi rend="italic">wholly</hi> content you: so good are the people, so really joyful will poor Eliza be to see you. She seems to feel a kind of wife-like charge of me in the interim, and is really a kind of cheering thing to see flitting out and in. I am more at home than I could anywhere else have been.&#x2014; Next I have a word to say about Bessy Barnet: she is at present in Birmingham with her Mother; says (10 days ago) she is ready whenever required: her address &#x201C;Mrs Badams&#x2019;s, Spring Hill, Birmingham.&#x201D; Now it is a question with me whether as Birmingham lies in the road of Coaches enough, it might not be for your advantage to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> Bessy as you passed thro&#x2019;? Perhaps you might like to rest yourself all night at Birmingham, and bring Bessy even along with you? The Mileses say they can give her accommodation. You best know <hi rend="italic">when</hi> the Furniture is to be here, and whether Bessy can be of any use in the interim to you. Would she be a kind of (imaginary) protection on the road? At least if you pass thro&#x2019; Birmingham at all, you might have her warned to be waiting for you at the Coach: but really had not my poor little Dame better try to get a little sleep there? In any case, I leave to you the task of appointing a day for Bessy, which perhaps you had better do forthwith; taking this only for your guidance that by the time the Furniture comes my Goody and I shall surely have got a house to put it in. If I get a Frank (which, alas, is utterly doubtful now) I will send you Bessy&#x2019;s Letter:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1834-05-19">19 May</date>.</note> however, except the best will and what I said above, it contains nothing.</p>
<p>And now as to Houses here, depend upon it, Dearie, I will take none till thou come; unless driven to it by dire necessity. I was at Chelsea and Brompton again yesterday: people I heard were in quest of both the houses; one of them, however, I have got engaged to continue <hi rend="italic">un</hi>let I think till you come, certainly till about Wednesday next. It is the Chelsea one, which on the whole looked distinctly the preferable to me <hi rend="italic">yesterday</hi> (for I told you they varied from day to day). The <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> was here in person about it two hours ago; a decent enough kind of body, with an honest look. Bugs I made two inquiries about; and seemed to get a true-looking answer that there were or had been <hi rend="italic">none</hi>. The wainscot is <hi rend="italic">all</hi> painted, a light colour, almost white (colour of our drawing-room doors); the two dining-rooms new-<hi rend="italic">papered</hi> above the wainscot [&#x201C;beautiful rooms!&#x201D; written by TC above <pb id="pg-07-202" n="07-202"/>the preceding three words]. He will introduce a right kitchen-grate (with boiler &#x26;c) on fair terms; on the whole a reasonable-speaking man. The Brompton House looked dreadfully little; I was also <hi rend="italic">hurt</hi> to discover that the room I intended for our poor red bed had been last used as an adjunct to the kitchen, and had bell not going from it, but entering into, and hanging in it! Figure a guest laid there to sleep. That however could and would be altered.&#x2014; I have seen many, many other houses; but these two continue far the best. I have been at Hampstead: one at &#xa3;36; tolerable, tho&#x2019; small; the beautifullest view in the world; but <supplied>[is]</supplied> 4 or 5 miles off; the omnibuses double-fare (or rather triple), water to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi>, and for door-neighbour&#x2014;Mrs Reeve! Her son is there too; perhaps one of the absurdest of our amiable young men.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A reference to Henry Reeve and his mother. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320727-TC-JPE-01">TC to JPE, <date when="1832-07-27">27 July 1832</date></ref>.</note> That will not do. At Paddington; all old and ugly; 20 percent dearer than elsewhere. The only ones I shall trouble <hi rend="italic">you</hi> with looking at, besides the two, are one in Kensington, one in Bayswater; unless I should find more; which certainly I shall look for now with redoubled energy.</p>
<p>But the question is, When is my Goody coming? <hi rend="italic">When!</hi> Warn me my little Darling. If you go by Birmingham (which except for Bessy, quite easily managed otherwise, there is not the slightest <hi rend="italic">need</hi> of your doing), your Uncle must choose you a good Coach thither; from B. to London I believe they are all good. Would you not like to sleep? Or do you feel as if you could not sleep? Decide thy own way, my pretty one. Only tell me pointedly which way you come, and at what hour: I would not miss you for a sovereign. You will jump out round my neck?&#x2014; For shame!&#x2014;</p>
<p>There is clearly no chance of a Frank now; for after all what is the good of running all the way to Westminster for one, <hi rend="italic">had</hi> I even time? All that I had to say on paper is said: innumerable multitudes of things lie over till&#x2014;! O Dearest, Best, when <hi rend="italic">wilt</hi> thou come?&#x2014;&#x2014; Jeffrey is gone two days ago: I saw him <hi rend="italic">again</hi>, at Mrs Austin&#x2019;s where he was taking leave. His manner to me tremulous &#x26; shy; mine kinder &#x26; graver than ever. Peace be with him!&#x2014; By the bye it is reported here that his Majesty is gone mad; and the &#x201C;present excellent ministry&#x201D; in this alarming state. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Eheu! Eheu!</hi></foreign>&#x2014;&#x2014; Heraud walked with me yesterday all the way (to Chelsea &#x26;c); he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the veriest Dud alive: his Wife and he have just been here again to <hi rend="italic">insist</hi> on my dining with them on Sunday (Hunt too being asked) which I could not <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> refuse. She seems a wiser person than he.&#x2014;&#x2014; I have seen Roebuck, no bad fellow, I hope; <pb id="pg-07-203" n="07-203"/>Molesworth apparently a very good one, &#x26;c &#x26;c. Molesworth is not Rennie&#x2019;s; it was his father:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >George Rennie of Phantassie, <ref target="volume-02/lt-18220100-JBW-EA-01"><sic>2:17</sic><corr>JBW to EA, <date when="1822-01-15">15 Jan. 1822</date></corr></ref>, and the elder Molesworth was Sir Arscott-Ourry Molesworth, Bart.

<salute>My Dear Madam,</salute>
<p>I did not come home last night till tea-time; an hour after the Post was gone. In the sitting-room I found a little Canary-bird, vehemently suspected to be the Craigenputtoch <hi rend="italic">Chico</hi>; and next moment, in the bedroom, I found my poor Traveller herself! She had stood her journey wonderfully well; complained of nothing; and this morning too, asserts that the headache she has will go off if breakfast were <pb id="pg-07-204" n="07-204"/>come. She charges me strictly to thank you all for your &#x201C;great friendliness and kindness,&#x201D; which she has often spoken about, which I can well believe in without speech.</p>
<p>We are to go off directly, in all manner of miscellaneous conveyances (omnibuses, cabs, and <hi rend="italic">shoe-soles;</hi> for it is a very miscellaneous route) to look at the Houses I think hopefullest: before night we shall probably have fixed on one or another; I still rather prophecy, on the old Chelsea one. It is a most solid spacious mansion for the money; and, so far as I can possibly ascertain, has no <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi>.</p>
<p>This, my dear Madam, is no Letter; and cannot become one, so hurried am I; and that little Bird yelling at my ear, like a hundred musical shrew-mice! Were we once settled, I will write to some of you again; and say more at large how the world serves us here. The only thing I have yet positively made out is the unabated <hi rend="italic">dirtiness</hi> of the place; soot and dust are portion of every breath we draw. However, at Chelsea or Battersea, the west-wind will blow all that away from us; and the good Friends, who make even dust and soot agreeable, can come to us in the teeth of the wind.</p>
<p>I have by no means forgot Maryland Street; as how should I ever! My kindest regards to Mr Welsh, to Helen and Alick, and all the rest downwards to Johnny. Tell them all to be <hi rend="italic">good</hi> till I write again.</p>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I promised you that the first frank I filled from our new House should be for you; and here I am, in the middle of a most miscellaneous collection of operative men and women, accomplishing that promise. It is not only the first Letter I have written, but the first time I have put pen to paper. However, I have for the present (while the Bell-hangers are absent) a room to myself; I have my old <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> writing-table, firm as a rock; my old inkbottle and penholder; and the quietest outlook, thro&#x2019; an open window, into green fields and trees; I have even my old Highland bonnet on: so I will tell you the completest story I can, with moderate composure after all.</p>
<p>Jane gave me, in a Letter from Liverpool,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> a sad tale of your parting at Annan, and how you stood waving your handkerchief to <pb id="pg-07-206" n="07-206"/>her, in front of a great crowd of people, to make amends for your tears, and keep up her heart. All <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is past, and too sad to dwell on. Carlyle of Waterbeck<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Carlyle, druggist and grocer, Waterbeck.</note> was abundantly civil to the poor Traveller; as indeed all people had been and continued to be helpful and civil: so finally, on I think the Wednesday afternoon, as I returned to Frederick Street from Mrs Austin&#x2019;s (where they had kept me to dinner), I was met by the <hi rend="italic">chirling</hi> of a little Canary-bird (the same as I hear even now, from the under-story), and in the next room safe in bed, and already well-rested, lay my little Wife, &#x201C;actually&#x201D; engaged in drinking tea! She was well, she assured me, and all was well. Let us be thankful; and trust that the rest too will be well!</p>
<p>With our renewed house-huntings, and how we dashed up and down for three or four days, in all manner of conveyances, where such were to be had cheap, and on our legs where not,&#x2014;I need not detain you here. We saw various Houses; but the Chelsea House (tho&#x2019; our Dame did not think so at first, but thought and thinks <hi rend="italic">doubly</hi> so afterwards) seemed nearly <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> as good as any other we could get at the money: so, on Saturday afternoon we finally fixed; and moved hither, according to appointment, on Tuesday forenoon, Bessy Barnett had joined us from Birmingham the night before; and we came all down in a Hackney Coach, loaded with luggage, and <hi rend="italic">Chico</hi> (the Canary-bird) singing on Bessy&#x2019;s knee. Jane says the little atom put great heart into her frequently thro&#x2019; the journey: <hi rend="italic">he</hi> sang aloud, wherever he might be; praising, in his way, the Maker that had given him Life and Food and fine weather. How much more should we!</p>
<p>About two hours after our arrival, one of Pickford&#x2019;s huge waggons came lumbering along, and half a dozen stout men began to haul in our Furniture. It had arrived the saturday night before; they had sent it by canal from Liverpool, as some pounds the cheaper way, and also the safer. Their charge was something under seventeen pounds (porterage and all <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> included); so that, on the whole, we have got the things brought all the way from Annan for at most &#xa3;20; which is below the lowest I ever calculated on. As for the <hi rend="italic">damage</hi>, it was not considerable; and had been done I rather conjecture mainly at Annan that night, when (as Waterbeck said) the sailors got weary and impatient, and tumbled in the packages too much in the head-foremost style. But, indeed, there is <hi rend="italic">wonderfully little</hi> ill done; the Canal people are exceedingly careful; the weather <pb id="pg-07-207" n="07-207"/>was wholly in our favour,&#x2014;and did not begin raining till five minutes after everything was fairly within doors. The &#x201C;six stout men&#x201D; lifted their very best and carefullest; but, as Jane said when she saw them perform, were not equal to the <hi rend="italic">four</hi> Craigenputtochers. Our dining-room Table (you remember it, the little oval favourite) had got one of the legs smitten out of it; but in the <hi rend="italic">handsomest</hi> way; so that it glued in again positively without any detriment. The Piano-press had its cornices all ruffled, and will require a new coat of paint: this too, however, is trifling. Four of the chairs had got their <hi rend="italic">lugs</hi> (you remember the broad upper belt on the back) knocked away: but glue and screw-nails will restore all that also at no great loss. The cornice of this writing-table and of one of the chests-of-drawers was ruffled and broken; but there again glue has helped us. Of the crockery <hi rend="italic">one</hi> tumbler and one dram-glass alone were injured; of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the other articles there was absolutely nothing either hurt or lost, but all lay in its place as if it had never stirred from Puttoch! The meal-pokes were both broken, and a bowl of meal lost: tell &#x201C;James of Scotsbrig&#x201D; that!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote this sentence in the margin and indicated that it should be inserted after &#x201C;hurt or lost.&#x201D;</note> We reckon that we have come very cheaply off. We owe much to all that had a charge and a hand in the Departure; and Jamie Aitken&#x2019;s Packer may, by universal consent, almost be called &#x201C;the best in the world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Alas, the Bell-hanger is come, and keeps <foreign><hi rend="italic">pudging</hi></foreign> [puttering about] and boring away, at my very ear! However, I will still strive to tell you a thing or two as I can. &#x201C;Ye maun just excuse us, this day.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340530-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-30">30 May</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; The House, which we have now inhabited (in the <hi rend="italic">Gillha</hi>&#x2019; style)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Annandale expression, meaning a house where working people live in common during some job.</note> for two days and nights, is certainly by many degrees the suitablest I could find far or near; so that in this also we may reckon Mrs Austin&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">disappointment</hi> a blessing in disguise. The rent of her House was about the very same (rather more, all things included); and I would not exchange with the old faithless Landlady for &#xa3;20 a year to boot,&#x2014;had I money to lay out on houses. Chelsea is an &#x201C;unfashionable place&#x201D;; that is the secret of it: a quality, as you may well imagine, rather in its favour with Anti-gigmen like us. We lie safe down in a little bend of the river, away from all the great roads; have air and quiet hardly inferior to Craigenputtoch, an outlook from the back windows into mere leafy regions, with here and there <pb id="pg-07-208" n="07-208"/>a red high-peaked old roof looking thro&#x2019;; and see nothing of London, except by day the summits of St Paul&#x2019;s Cathedral and Westminster Abbey, and by night the gleam of the great Babylon affronting the peaceful skies. Yet in <hi rend="italic">half an hour</hi> (for it is under two miles to Piccadilly) we can be, with a pair of stout legs, in the most crowded part of the whole habitable Earth; and, even without legs, every quarter of an hour from sun to sun, a Coach will take you for sixpence from your own threshold, and set you down there again for another. We are southwest <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the smoke; so during great part of the year we shall have no more to do with it than you. Nay even, in East winds, we are near <hi rend="italic">five</hi> miles from the old, manufacturing part of London, and the smoke is all but gone before it reaches us.&#x2014; As for the House itself, it is probably the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> we ever lived in: a right old strong roomy brick-house, built near 150 years ago, and likely to see <hi rend="italic">three</hi> races of their modern fashionables fall before it come down: it has all been put in perfect repair, and has closets and conveniences without end. Our furniture suits it too; being all of a strong <hi rend="italic">weighty</hi> sort. The big Bed is up (at my back here); there was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> bedroom I saw hereabouts would take it in: the other bed is right above it: bedrooms just about equal to the Puttoch ones; and each has a large dressing-closet behind it. There are two other bedrooms in front (or one and a dressing-room); one may be Bessy&#x2019;s; and the other hold a shower-bath,&#x2014;or another bed if we have visitors. I have a large drawing-room (up one pair of stairs) for my &#x201C;study&#x201D; (where if I don&#x2019;t write <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, it will not be the room&#x2019;s fault); there are two dining-rooms (which can be made one, by folding doors) below, with the &#x201C;most delightful china-closet&#x201D;; and under all (in the sunk story) a fore and a back kitchen, with cellars, &#x201C;copper&#x201D; (that is, washing <hi rend="italic">Boiler;</hi> which the Bricklayer is now <hi rend="italic">setting</hi> anew), a Pump of clear hard water within the house, and a water-barrel for soft without it. To conclude, they say this morning, the Carpets are likely to fit without much trouble; and our House-Agent (who serves us for Landlord) is a very innocent, polite-looking man, in whose little dealings with us there is not likely to be needless annoyance.&#x2014; Here is Dinner announced: so good b&#x2019;ye, dear Mother, for half an hour!&#x2014;&#x2014; 5 o&#x2019;clock. They are still running about me, tho&#x2019; I have been away two hours; I must just finish off <hi rend="italic">without</hi> much composure. In addition to the many properties of our House, I should have mentioned a little Garden behind; where all is as yet barren or weedy, except a cherry-tree with almost <hi rend="italic">ripe</hi> cherries on it, and two miserable rose-bushes: however, I have got a new set of Garden-tools (for six shillings), and <pb id="pg-07-209" n="07-209"/>will soon give it at least a clean face. It is of admirable comfort to me, in the <hi rend="italic">smoking</hi> way: I can wander about in dressing-gown and straw-hat in it, as of old, and take my pipe in peace.&#x2014; I think, were the Railways done, you must see it all with your own eyes, my dear Mother; that were the shortest way.</p>
<p>Of Bessy Barnett I dare not yet say much: we have seen so little of her; and that little seems so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> favourable. She is by far the orderliest, cleverest worker we ever had in the house (hardly even excepting Grace Macdonald), and has manners and an appearance of character totally beyond the servant class: if she go on as we hope, and as she has begun, it will be our duty and pleasure to treat her not as a servant but as a friend. On this side too, therefore, we have as yet <hi rend="italic">great</hi> reason to be thankful.</p>
<p>You see all things painted here in the colours of Hope: there is no doubt but by and by we shall have them (House, Place, servant and all) painted in the dingier colours of Reality: nevertheless I think and calculate there will still be much more than Tolerability to boast of; much which, with graceful hearts, we should thank the Giver for, and above all study to improve by welldoing, which is the acceptablest sort of thanks.&#x2014; I write all to you; because I know there is not <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing (down to our very water-barrel) that you do not feel a motherly interest in for our sake.</p>
<p>The Literary craft is bad, tho&#x2019; hardly <hi rend="italic">so</hi> bad, as I expected. I find I shall get my Book (on the French Revolution) <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> without cost; but probably nothing more. In the meantime I have some Magazine things in my eye, of a slight kind, to work at, and keep &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mall in shaft</hi>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310201-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-02-01">1 Feb. 1831</date></ref>.</note> by; and then if my Book were <hi rend="italic">well</hi> written, and out, I shall have a better name to start Lecturing &#x26;c with; and so, on the whole, we <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> make it out, by God&#x2019;s help, better or worse. If to &#x201C;His glory and my own eternal good,&#x201D; all else will be as dust on the balance, and an exceeding little thing. &#x201C;They cannot hinder thee of God&#x2019;s Providence&#x201D;:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340121-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-01-21">21 Jan.</date></ref></note> that is the beautiful part of it.</p>
<p>For the rest, my Friends here continues all very kind, and do more for me than I had any right to expect, or even to wish: I who profess to depend on no friend, but only on God and myself. Hunt who lives close by is not only the kindest but the politest of men; has never yet been near us (which we reckon very civil), but will always be delighted when I go and rouse <hi rend="italic">him</hi> for a walk; and indeed a sprightly sensible talker he is, and very pleasant company for a stroll. Jane <pb id="pg-07-210" n="07-210"/>greatly preferred his &#x201C;poetical Tinkerdom&#x201D; to any of the unpoetical Gigmandoms (even Mrs Austin&#x2019;s) which I showed her. The Hunts, I think, will not trouble us, and indeed be a pleasure so far as they go.</p>
<p>And now, my Dear Mother, here surely is enough about London and me for once. As for you and Scotsbrig, I begin to feel exceedingly disheartened about my prospects of news thence. Not one <hi rend="italic">scrape of a pen</hi> have I yet realized from any of you; not so much as a Newspaper: the very <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> has not come, I think, for three weeks. You really must not treat me so; nay I know it is not <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, dear Mother: but do you, if none else will, get the Courier Newspaper yourself, and in your own hand as you can write our address upon it: that, with <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Meaning &#x201C;All&#x2019;s well.&#x201D;</note> (if happily you can still send them) will be a great comfort to me. But, indeed, I do wrong to accuse the rest of negligence; for surely there is some mistake in it: they are too much occupied otherwise, or perhaps had not rightly understood how to direct to me. Give my love to them all; and not reproaches but entreaties.</p>
<p>That Jamie&#x2019;s marriage <hi rend="italic">had</hi> already taken place was new to me when Jane came.<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s brother James had married Isabella Calvert in <date when="1834-06-00">early June</date>.</note> I pray you wish him all happiness in our name; salute also our new Sister, and say that I hope she will learn to like me yet. To Alick I am soon going to write, and therefore shall send no message except my love. The same to Jean, and Mary, whom I picture now beside the Battery,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May</date></ref>.</note> and long <supplied>[to]</supplied> hear good news of.</p>
<p>You got no newspaper this week; and the reason <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, &#x201C;my Leddy,&#x201D; that Holcroft and I cannot go on at this distance, without some new arrangement, and none has been yet fallen upon. Perhaps you may get no Newspaper <hi rend="italic">next</hi> week either: so do not be disappointed at it, if it prove so. But I mean to write to Alick in about a fortnight; which will be better than many Newspapers. Suppose <hi rend="italic">you</hi> go up to Catlinns and hear sermon at Lockerby on Sabbath fortnight, and try the Post-Office when you come out! If there is not one <hi rend="italic">there</hi> then, there will be one soon: I cannot, or need not, engage for a day: franks are a little uncertain were there nothing else; and generally detain one at least another Post.</p>
<p>O my dear Mother! how much there was to say, which there is now no time for! May the Almighty Father of us all bless you, and guide all your footsteps! thro&#x2019; Time and thro&#x2019; Eternity.&#x2014; Blessings with you all!</p>

Chelsea<lb/>
London.</p>
<p>It is pronounced &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Chainie</hi> Row&#x201D;: a fine, quiet old street of about 20 houses, with huge old trees opposite us in front, and then a most silent&#x2014;&#x2014;brick-wall. The river is near, and very gay.</p>
<p>I meant to walk up with this to Buller&#x2019;s tonight, and get it franked; Mrs Buller gave me a general invitation to come <hi rend="italic">any</hi> night or all nights, and have tea with them. But now (about 7 o&#x2019;clock) it has come on the heartiest June rain, so that I am quite shut in for the evening, and must be content with tomorrow forenoon. It will &#x201C;fill our water-barrel,&#x201D; and do immense good otherwise. The people have all done with their <hi rend="italic">hay;</hi> they were in the heart of it when I came! The wheat has been shot for perhaps a fortnight: the &#x201C;new garden-peas&#x201D; are almost over.</p>
<p>I mean to write again to Jack in a few days; perhaps in two.</p>
<p>Give my kind compliments to W. Grahame: say, he shall have a Letter very soon.</p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have yet got no answer to my last Letter, and may be in reasonable daily expectation of such, I wait not for it, but take the earliest Postday after settlement to send you my news again. The other Letter left everything in so uncertain a state; and now in several fundamental particulars we are all fixed and at anchor.</p>
<p>You can fancy what weary lonesome wanderings I had, thro&#x2019; the dusty suburbs and along the burning streets, under a fierce May sun with East wind; &#x201C;seeking thro&#x2019; the nation for some habitation&#x201D;!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> At length Jane sent me comfortable tidings of innumerable difficulties overcome; and finally (in, I think, the fourth week) arrived herself; with the Furniture all close following her, in one of Pickford&#x2019;s Trackboats. I carried her to certain of the hopefullest-looking Houses I had fallen in with, and a toilsome time we anew had: however, it was not long; for, on the second inspection, this old Chelsea Mansion pleased very decidedly far better than any other we could see; and, the people also whom it belongs to proving reasonable, we soon struck a bargain, and in three days more (precisely this day week) a Hackney Coach, loaded to the roof and beyond it with luggage and live-passengers, tumbled us all down here about eleven in the morning. By &#x201C;all&#x201D; I mean my Dame and myself; Bessy Barnett, who had come the night before; and&#x2014;little <hi rend="italic">Chico</hi>, the Canary-bird, who, <foreign><hi rend="italic">multum jactatus</hi></foreign> [much tossed about], did nevertheless arrive living and well from Puttoch, and even sang violently all the way by sea or land, nay struck up his <hi rend="italic">lilt</hi> in the very London streets wherever he could see green leaves and feel the free air. There then we sat on three trunks; I, however, with a match-box, soon lit a cigar, as Bessy did a fire; and thus with a kind of cheerful solemnity we took possession by &#x201C;raising <foreign>reek</foreign> [smoke],&#x201D; and even dined in an <foreign><hi rend="italic">extempore</hi></foreign> fashion, on a box lid covered with some accidental towel. At two o&#x2019;clock the Pickfords did arrive; and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> began the hurlyburly; which even yet has but grown quieter, will not grow quiet, for a fortnight to come. However, two rooms and two bedrooms are now in a partially civilized state; <pb id="pg-07-213" n="07-213"/>the broken Furniture is mostly mended; I have my old writing-table again (here) <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> as Atlas; a large wainscotted drawing-room (which is to be my study) with the &#x201C;red carpet&#x201D; tightly spread on it; my Books all safe in Presses; the Belisarius Picture<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;A French print of Belisarius begging alms. The print was valued only because the face of a young Roman soldier in it reminded Mrs. Carlyle of her father, Dr. Welsh&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note, quoted by Norton). See also <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250103-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:239</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1825-01-03">3 Jan. 1825</date></corr></ref>.</note> right in front of me over the mantel-piece (most suitable to its new wainscot lodging), and my beloved <foreign><hi rend="italic">Segretario Ambulante</hi></foreign> [itinerant secretary]<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Brought by Dr. Carlyle from Italy. A little common coloured lithograph of a ragged old man, seated behind a board on trestles (a quill in his hand, another behind his ear and a third in his inkbottle), plying his trade, the writing of letters at dictation for illiterate passers-by. Carlyle says &#x2026; [<ref target="volume-07/lt-18331118-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1833-11-18">18 Nov. 1833</date></ref>], &#x2018;He is a delightful fellow; shows you Literature in its simplest quite steadfast condition, below which it <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> sink.&#x2019; Carlyle always liked the little picture, which to the last hung in his bedroom at Chelsea&#x201D; (Mary Aitken Carlyle&#x2019;s note, quoted by Norton).</note> right behind, with the two old Italian Engravings, and others that I value less, dispersed around; and so, opposite the middle of my three windows, with little but huge Scotch Elm-trees looking in on me, and in the distance an ivied House, and a sunshiny sky bursting out from genial rain, I sit here already very much at home, and impart to my dear and true Brother a thankfulness which he is sure to share in. We have indeed much reason to be thankful every way.</p>
<p>With the House we are all highly pleased, and, I think, the better, the longer we know it hitherto. I know not if you ever were at Chelsea, especially at old Chelsea, of which this is portion. It stretches from Battersea Bridge (a queer old wooden structure, where they charge you a halfpenny) along the bank of the River, westward a little way; and eastward (which is our side) some quarter of a mile, forming a &#x201C;Cheyne Walk&#x201D; (pronounced <hi rend="italic">Chainie</hi> Walk) of really grand old brick mansions, dating perhaps from Charles II&#x2019;s time (&#x201C;Don Saltero&#x2019;s Coffeehouse&#x201D; of the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> is still fresh and brisk among them),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >18 Cheyne Walk, pulled down <date when="1866-00-00">1866</date> after it had become a tavern; named after James Salter, who established it. See <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi>, 34, and the picture in Reginald Blunt, <hi rend="italic">In Cheyne Walk and Thereabout</hi> (London, <date when="1914-00-00">1914</date>), opp. p. 28.</note> with flagged pavement; carriage way between two rows of stubborn-looking high old pollarded trees; and then the River with its varied small-craft, fast-moving or safe-moored, and the wholesome smell (among the breezes) of sea <hi rend="italic">Tar</hi>. Cheyne Row (or Great Cheyne Row, when we wish to be grand) runs up at right angles from this; has some twenty Houses of the same fashion; Upper Cheyne Row (where Hunt lives) turning <hi rend="italic">again</hi> at right angles, some stone-cast <pb id="pg-07-214" n="07-214"/>from this door. Frontwards we have the outlook I have described already (or if we shove out our head, the River is disclosed some hundred paces to the left); backwards, from the ground floor, our own gardenkin (which I with new garden-tools am actually re-trimming every morning), and, from all the other floors, nothing but leafy clumps, and green fields and red high-peaked roofs glimmering thro&#x2019; them: a most clear, pleasant prospect, in these fresh westerly airs! Of London nothing visible but Westminster Abbey and the topmost dome of St Pauls; other faint ghosts of spires (one other at least) disclose themselves, as the smoke-cloud shifts; but I have not yet made out what they are. At night we are pure and silent, almost as at Puttoch; and the gas-light shimmer of the great Babylon hangs stretched from side to side of our horizon. To Buckingham Gate it is 32 minutes of my walking (Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s door about half way); nearly the very same to Hyde Park Corner, to which latter point we have Omnibuses every quarter of an hour (they say) that carry you to Whitehorse Cellar, or even to Coventry Street, for sixpence; calling for you at the very threshold. Nothing was ever so discrepant in my experience as the Craigenputtoch silence of this House and then the world-hubbub of London and its people into which a few minutes bring you: I feel as if a day spent between the two must be the epitome of a month. Within doors we have also every reason to be satisfied. There are three floors, besides the sunk kitchen-floor; three rooms on every floor, the backmost, narrow one, being a &#x201C;delightful&#x201D; china-closet on the ground-floor, and in each of the two other floors a delightful dressing-room. We sleep aloft, in our old Bed, which is all rehabilitated; only the toilet-tables are not yet come, and for toilet-table we have a box set on end. The big red bed, also quite safe and entire, stands behind this drawing-room, much in its place: I did not see another bedroom in London that would have taken it in. The other two Beds and the folding-bed were well sold at Puttoch; we have bought a new folding-bed for Bessy, which stands in the topmost floor (where, by the bye, are <hi rend="italic">four</hi> rooms or roomkins, the space of the drawing-room being parted into two); a vacant front bedroom there will hold a shower-bath, and another bed when we like. The whole House has been thoroughly repaired; new-painted, and, on the ground-floor, papered down to the chairbelts where the old wainscot again appears: all seems tight and right. The rent is &#xa3;35; which really seems &#xa3;10 cheaper than such a House could be had for in Dumfries or Annan. The secret is our old friend, &#x201C;Gigmanity:&#x201D; Chelsea is unfashionable; it is also reputed unhealthy. <pb id="pg-07-215" n="07-215"/>The former quality we rather like (for our neighbours still are all polite-living people); the latter we do not in the faintest degree believe in, remembering that Chelsea was once considered the &#x201C;London Montpelier,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Montpellier is a university city in southern France known for the classical architecture of its seventeenth- and eighteenth-century private residences, its graceful fountain, its gardens, and its promenades. Under the last French kings a brilliant&#x2014;and frivolous&#x2014;society led a life of luxury and pleasure there.</note> and knowing that in these matters now as formerly the Cockneys &#x201C;know nothing,&#x201D; only rush in masses blindly and sheepwise. Our worst fault is the want of a good free <hi rend="italic">rustic</hi> walk, like Kensington Gardens, which are above a mile off: however, we have the &#x201C;College&#x201D; or Hospital Grounds,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Chelsea Hospital, begun <date when="1682-00-00">1682</date>, and designed by Sir Christopher Wren for old and disabled soldiers; it occupied the site of a much older building, King James&#x2019;s Theological College, <date when="1618-00-00">1618</date>, and the term &#x201C;College&#x201D; was still widely used.</note> with their withered old Pensioners; we have open carriage-ways, and lanes, and really a very pretty route to Piccadilly (different from the Omnibus route) thro&#x2019; the new Grosvenor edifices, Eaton Square, Belgrave Place &#x26;c: I have also walked to Westminster Hall by Vauxhall Bridge-end, Millbank &#x26;c; but the road is squalid, confused, dusty and detestable, and happily <hi rend="italic">need</hi> not be returned to. To conclude, we are here on <hi rend="italic">literary</hi> classical ground, as Hunt is continually ready to declare and unfold:<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s mind was particularly susceptible to the charm of places. See his <hi rend="italic">The Old Court Suburb; or, Memorials of Kensington</hi> (London, <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>). He must have been a delightful guide to Carlyle on the many walks which they took together.</note> not a stone-cast from this House Smollet<supplied>[t]</supplied> wrote his <hi rend="italic">Count Fathom</hi> (the house is ruined and we happily do not see it);<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Monmouth House: see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May</date></ref>.</note> hardly another stone-cast off, old More<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sir Thomas More.</note> entertained Erasmus: to say nothing of Bolingbroke St. John,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke (<date when="1678-00-00">1678</date>&#x2013;<date when="1751-00-00">1751</date>), statesman, philosopher, friend of Pope and Swift, who, as Carlyle soon learned, never lived in Chelsea.</note> of Paradise Row<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Paradise Row is now Royal Hospital Road.</note> and the Count de Grammont,<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Philibert, Comte de Gramont (<date when="1621-00-00">1621</date>&#x2013;<date when="1707-00-00">1707</date>), who spent his exile from the French court, <date when="1662-00-00">1662</date>&#x2013;<date when="1664-00-00">64</date>, in London.</note> for in truth we care almost nothing for them. On the whole we are exceedingly content so far; &#x26; have reason to be so: I add only that our Furniture came with wonderfully <hi rend="italic">little</hi> breakage, and for less than &#xa3;20 Annan included; that Jane sold all her odd things to Nanny Macqueen on really fair terms; and that we find new furniture of all sorts exceedingly cheap here, and have already got what we need, or nearly so, for less than our own old good [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] brought <pb id="pg-07-216" n="07-216"/>on the spot. Poor old Puttoch is still to be taken care of by a woman reputed faithful to a degree, old Nanny herself, who came the day after Jane departed; is to pay us &#xa3;10 a year for House and Park, leaving the shooting to be otherwise disposed of it offer present itself, the former offerer being (in time) discovered to be a <foreign><hi rend="italic">skyte</hi></foreign> [rascal]. Thus, dear Jack, it is all better than we hoped.</p>
<p>I have spent much of my sheet in description; but this time you will not grudge me, and it will not need to be repeated. A few words are still due for our internal social arrangements. Bessy, as I said, had arrived: she quite <hi rend="italic">charmed</hi> her new mistress; and really seems a most sensible, affectionate, honourable girl; certainly far the orderliest, cleverest servant we have ever had; and with a character and manners which would be an improvement for most <hi rend="italic">ladies</hi> of our acquaintance. I think, by judicious management, she will really do well, and be a very great blessing to us. It is settled between Jane and me that she shall have tea with us every Sunday evening, and conversation, and perhaps a few chapters of good reading: were all servants <hi rend="italic">Bessies</hi>, I think it were a plan fit for universal adoption. Here, however, I must give you a new trait of Montaguedom and the Noble Lady. The night before Bessy was to arrive, Jane went to drink tea there; at her answer to the question, Have you got a servant? great eyes were made; and then the direfullest narration opened, of Bessy having been Badams&#x2019; kept mistress &#x201C;for years and years,&#x201D; and the artfullest, wretchedest, wickedest creature on Earth; as a whole sheaf of Letters in the hand of Montague and two others (agents in B&#x2019;s affairs) would prove to the blind; which Agents Mr Carlyle would of course instantly go to, and so put far from him the accursed thing: <hi rend="italic">otherwise</hi> consequences without end would ensue; for example, being <hi rend="italic">cut</hi> by all respectable women, especially by the respectable women of No 25! My good Dame was much shocked and staggered: for my own share, I confess I was struck with a kind of horror at the <hi rend="italic">infernal</hi> temper of these poor persons, persecuting beyond the very Grave; and decided not on going to Mr Sanson (or whatever his name is),<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Lewis Samson, stockbroker, 3 Bartholomew Lane, Bank.</note> but on <hi rend="italic">not</hi> going to Bedford Square again except on the most urgent call; if not again at all so much the better. Nothing is to be gained, much may be lost by contact with a temper of mind which, however decorated, is once for all damnable, and of the Devil devilish. We fancy that we understand the <hi rend="italic">truth</hi> of that scandal (and love poor Bessy rather the more for it); and, at any rate, not being minded to <pb id="pg-07-217" n="07-217"/><hi rend="italic">wed</hi> Bessy but only to <hi rend="italic">hire</hi> her, have almost <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> to do with it: respectable women take servants out of the Magdalen Asylum;<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Magdalen Hospital, St. George&#x2019;s Fields, for the relief and reformation of unfortunate women and penitent prostitutes.</note> and are still visited by respectable women,&#x2014;or even, with unspeakable composure, see them pass by <hi rend="italic">un</hi>visiting. But Oh, from that spirit of Hatred and horrid Cruelty good Lord deliver us!<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Bessie Barnett sometime later married Dr. Blakiston and continued to retain the confidence of the Carlyles. During Mrs. Carlyle&#x2019;s terrible illness at St. Leonard&#x2019;s in <date when="1864-00-00">1864</date>, she nursed her faithfully, and Dr. Blakiston was one of the physicians in attendance. In an undated letter to Jane of about this time Mrs. Montagu wrote: &#x201C;I already feel the distance you are placed at. I sent to day a Messenger to explore your new house and I have learnt, at last, where to find you&#x2014; Will you come to us this Evening, a <hi rend="italic">long Evening</hi>. &#x2026; My kind regards to your Husband, whom little Adelaide [Procter] thinks &#x2018;very pretty indeed&#x2019; much prettier than Mr Bothwell or indeed any body&#x2019; &#x2026; This look is perfectly translatable into a language that is universal, and which my little grand-daughter reads almost as well as Jane Welsh.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>There is now a word to be said on Economics, and the Commissariat Department. Bookselling is still at its lowest ebb; yet on the whole <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than I expected to find it. Fraser is the only Craftsman I have yet seen: he talks still of <hi rend="italic">loss</hi> by his Magazine; and I think will not willingly employ me much, were I never so ready, at the old rate of writing. He seems a well-intentioned creature; I can really pity him in the place he occupies. I went yesterday with a project of a series of Articles on French Revolution matters; chiefly to be translated from <hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires:</hi> but he could not take them, at my rate, or indeed at almost any rate; for he spoke of &#xa3;10 a sheet as quite a <hi rend="italic">ransom</hi>. He has got my name (such as it is), and can do better without me. However, he will cheerfully print (for &#x201C;half-profits,&#x201D; that is, <hi rend="italic">zero</hi>) a projected Book of mine on the French Revolution; to which accordingly, if no new thing occur, I shall probably very soon with all my heart address myself, in full purpose to do <hi rend="italic">my best</hi>, and put my name to it.<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Fraser did publish it in <date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>, the first of Carlyle&#x2019;s books that were not anonymous.</note> The <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> Paper his Boy got from me, by appointment, this morning; to be examined whether it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> make a Book: as an <hi rend="italic">Article</hi> I shall perhaps hardly think of giving it to him<supplied>[.]</supplied> For, you are to understand, that Radical Review of Mill&#x2019;s, after seeming to be quite abandoned, has now a far fairer chance of getting started: a Sir W. Molesworth, a young man whom I have seen at Buller&#x2019;s and liked, offers to furnish all the money himself (and can do it, being very rich), and to take no farther hand in it, once a Manager that will please Mill is found for it. Mill is to be here tomorrow <pb id="pg-07-218" n="07-218"/>evening: I think, I must appoint some meeting with Molesworth, and give him my whole views of it, and express my readiness to take a most hearty hold of it; having the prospect of right companions; none yet but Mill and Buller, and such as we may farther approve of and add. It seems likely something may come of this.<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle refers to the <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi>, of which the first number was published in <date when="1835-04-00">April 1835</date> and which with its fifth number, <date when="1836-04-00">April 1836</date>, became the <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi> when it merged with the older journal. Carlyle was disappointed in his personal hopes of it and did not contribute to it until his &#x201C;Mirabeau&#x201D; (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>).</note> In any other case, Periodical Authorship, like all other forms of it, seems <hi rend="italic">done</hi> in the economical sense: I think of abandoning it; of writing my Book; and then, with such name as it may give me, starting some new course, or courses, to make honest wages by. A poor Fanny Wright (whom we are to hear tonight in Freemason&#x2019;s Hall) goes lecturing over the whole world:<note n="18" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frances Wright (<date when="1795-00-00">1795</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>), radical reformer, born in Dundee, Scotland, who travelled in America in <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>&#x2013;<date when="1820-00-00">20</date> and in <date when="1824-00-00">1824</date> (in the company of Lafayette); she wrote <hi rend="italic">Views of Society and Manners in America</hi> (London, <date when="1821-00-00">1821</date>), and later became noted as a public lecturer, on both sides of the Atlantic, on such social questions as birth control, the marriage laws, existing systems of education, and the emancipation of slaves.</note> before sight, I will engage to lecture twice as well; being, as Glen once said, with great violence, to me, &#x201C;the <hi rend="italic">more</hi> gigantic spirit of the two.&#x201D; On the whole, I fear nothing. There are funds here already to keep us going above a year, independently of all incomings: before that we may have seen into much, tried much, and succeeded in somewhat. &#x201C;God&#x2019;s providence they cannot hinder thee of&#x201D;: that is the thing I always repeat to myself, or know without repeating.</p>
<p>The sheet is just done; and both Scotsbrig and Rome are yet to be treated of! With regard to Scotsbrig little includes my all: except Jane&#x2019;s general assurance that all was right when she left, I know nothing. My Mother came down to Mary&#x2019;s to meet her; slept with her at the Battery there; came down to the beach between three and four in the morning; was weeping do what she could to hinder it; but stood in front of a great crowd of people (for there were 150 Emigrants going too) waving her handkerchief to make amends and encourage her. Jamie must be married a fortnight ago. But not one of them has sent me the smallest stroke of a pen since I came off: the very Newspaper, which they get among them, has not been forwarded for 3 weeks. I impute it to some not real but imagined uncertainty about my receiving. I have written a Note and two long Letters <pb id="pg-07-219" n="07-219"/>to my Mother (the last from this house), and hope to have some token of their wellbeing before this week end. She was cheerful, Jane assured me; and looking forward to the new arrangement without fear or sorrow. I fancy her oftenest with Alick, or at seabathing with Mary. Her health seemed decidedly better than when you were here. You must write to her; but remember that I shall not now see your Letters.&#x2014; As to Rome, what can I say but that a Letter thence is necessary to make me feel as if I <hi rend="italic">were</hi> rightly settled. We shall have a better chance now; and may account ourselves at least fully a <hi rend="italic">week</hi> nearer. We shall meet too, by and by, if it be God&#x2019;s will; my Brother shall be in his Brother&#x2019;s house in this Babylon, there to inquire and take counsel and determine. So be it! <hi rend="italic">Amen!</hi>&#x2014; In any case, as you say, &#x201C;we are together.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I managed to see Irving again since I wrote; I dined one day with him at 1 o&#x2019;clock, and staid till four. He was looking greatly better, tho&#x2019; still feeble and agitated; was very friendly; and I steered clear of his Tongues. His Wife was there, which cramped us much. W. Hamilton (who kindly asked for you) tells me since that he has had a fall from his horse; but is still considered as recovering. I have not seen him again; he now lies so far out of all my courses: but I will soon see him.&#x2014; Mrs Strachey is gone (to the neighbourhood of Bristol); and tho&#x2019; I saw her twice or thrice, I got little comparatively from her, except her friendly looks. She seemed in a kind of awe of me; and on the whole more self-sustained and self-contained than of old. Whether she ever met Miss Morris I could not learn. Buller is getting well fast: his parents still with him. I have a general invitation for the evenings but seldom take advantage of it; being busy yet with flitting. Other friends are hardly interesting in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> dearth of available space. Jane in breathless haste (nailing carpets) sends her Sisterly love. She is wonderfully well. <foreign>Finis!</foreign></p>
<p>Now when will you write, dear Jack? I beg, unless you have already written as I bade you, that it be the <hi rend="italic">very day</hi> this comes. I am really getting impatient to hear of you: to hear even of your whereabout, for I can only guess that you are about Naples now. You have my address.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>The day has now arrived when I am to send you tidings about myself; our good Mother and you, as I guess, will be in waiting; and so as far as my part can go you shall not be disappointed. If Buller be not at hand with his frank, indeed, we shall go a little awry; but all precautions being taken, let us hope the best. I had Jean&#x2019;s Dumfries Letter yesterday, much to universal satisfaction; and can send back counter-news with better heart.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter of <date when="1834-06-23">23 June</date> Jean had written about the wedding of James and Isabella and its aftermath. &#x201C;We left them in great confusion at Scotsbrig &#x2018;Isabella&#x2019;s things&#x2019; having been all thrown down on the floors the saturday night before; our Mother and Jenny had made their elopement upstairs with such of their movables as they could carry Mr Carliel [James] as might be supposed was lost to all earthly considerations except his beloved Isbel. Our mother complains bitterly of Jamie&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">un</hi>helpfulness &#x26; not without reason. &#x2026; The young folk are going on in the most admirably smoothe manner hitherto &#x26; make no secret in saying they will manage better than any of us; but as the good Doctor said last year &#x2018;Poor fellows they have only to see the prose side of it&#x2014;only more misery awaiting them in the world.&#x2019;&#x201D; She adds a word for Jane: &#x201C;I hope your Misses [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is not overworking herself in London as she was in Dunscore for many days before she left it.&#x201D; And she comforts Carlyle with good news concerning his mother: &#x201C;Enter James [her husband] with good news from scotsbrig our mother he says is well &#x26; in good heart sends word to you that she is likely to be very comfortable &#x26; contented Isbel is very attentive to her she thinks they will do very well.&#x2014; she is going to Alicks to meet your letter on Sunday.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>You have heard of our progress and fortunes from the time when you embarked the Goods and goodwife at Annan; how after all risks and hardships they both arrived comparatively safe; how by searching we discovered a House exceedingly to our mind, and were with fair prospects struggling thro&#x2019; the process of installation. If I add now that this same tumultuous process is at length all but terminated, and we in rather good health and spirits, and all doing well, are beginning more and more to feel ourselves at home in our new <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> [holding, house], it is again good tidings, for which I surely know you will all be thankful. We have nothing to complain of, much to be piously grateful for; and thus with a kind of serious cheerfulness, far different <pb id="pg-07-221" n="07-221"/>from vague dreams of Hope or dark shadowings of dispiritment, may gird ourselves up for a new career. As it was entered into without dishonest purposes, the issue, unless <hi rend="italic">we</hi> change for the worse, is not to be <hi rend="italic">dreaded</hi>, prove as it may. It is to be met and welcomed, be it, as regards the present brief Time, for joy or for sorrow. One of the greatest moments of my life, I think, was that when I waved my hat to you and Jamie from on board the Steamboat: my two Brothers, the last of my kindred I had to leave, stood <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> and I stood <hi rend="italic">here</hi>, already fast flying from them! Something like a tear trembled in my eyes, but did not fall from them, for I would not desecrate so solemn an hour by childish weakness. I turned my thoughts Heavenward; for it is in Heaven only that I find <hi rend="italic">any</hi> basis for our poor Pilgrimage on this Earth. And so I could thank you all for your unwearied long-suffering love of me; could feel well that tho&#x2019; parted in place we could never be parted in affection; and go forth to meet my destiny in no improper mood. That dewy <date when="1834-05-00">May</date> morning when you drove me down to Annan; the night before, when your figure rose on me in helpful waiting, at Shillahill Bridge: these are scenes that certainly will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> quit my memory, but they do not dwell <hi rend="italic">sad</hi> there; rather pure and beautiful and almost holy. Courage, my brave Brothers all! Let us be found faithful, and we shall not fail. Surely, as the blue dome of Heaven encircles us all, so does the Providence of the Lord of Heaven. &#x201C;He will withhold <hi rend="italic">no</hi> good thing from those that love Him.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Ps. 84:11.</note> This, as it was the ancient Psalmist&#x2019;s Faith, let it likewise be ours: it is the Alpha and Omega, I reckon, of all Possessions that can belong to man.</p>
<p>Neither my Mother nor you will interpret these reflexions of mine as if they betokened gloom of temper; but indeed rather the reverse. I hope we have left great quantities of gloom safe behind us at Puttoch; and indeed hitherto have given little harbour to such a guest here. It is strange often to myself with what a kind of not only fearlessness, but meek contempt and even indifference I can walk thro&#x2019; the grinding press of these restless millions; listening, as &#x201C;Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh&#x201D; says, &#x201C;to its loudest threatenings with a still smile.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 106.</note> I mean to <hi rend="italic">work</hi> among the poor people according to my strength; and I know well that what strength God has given me no man nor no Devil <hi rend="italic">can</hi> take away. As to riches, fame, success, and so forth, I ask no questions. Were the work laid out for us but the kneading of a clay brick, let us in God&#x2019;s name <hi rend="italic">do it faithfully</hi>, and look for our reward <hi rend="italic">elsewhere;</hi> understanding <pb id="pg-07-222" n="07-222"/>from of old that <hi rend="italic">here</hi> (if indeed we deserve any reward) it does not await us. So, on the whole, to end moralizing, let us sing:</p>
<lg><l>Come fingers five, come now be live,</l>
<l>And stout heart fail me not, not!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the ballad &#x201C;Johnie Cock.&#x201D; See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May</date></ref>.</note></l></lg>
<p>Or, what is far before <hi rend="italic">singing</hi>, let us do it, and go on doing it.</p>
<p>The House here continues to satisfy us amazingly: it is spacious, well-aired, quiet, clean, every way sufficient. The two under-rooms (which by folding-doors are <hi rend="italic">one</hi>) have got the old Puttoch drawing-room Carpet on them, with certain stripes of the dyed Blankets most judiciously fitted in to help; and now, with their two windows looking out into the quiet street where little but green leaves and branches is visible, and their one window into the garden, and clean flagged Court,&#x2014;form, with their strong old-fashioned Scotch furniture, really one of the agreeablest apartments I ever sat in: unfashionable in the highest degree, but in the highest degree comfortable and serviceable. The green drawing-room Curtains are there; a pair of green venetian blinds are to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> there very soon, for the two front windows. The Piano, just about getting tuned, is in the front-room, with the round drawing-room table, and chairs and <foreign><hi rend="italic">etceteras</hi></foreign> enough: the little Clock is on his bracket in the back-room, with the dining-room oval table; it is here where we sit in dewy morning sunshine, and breakfast&#x2014;on hot coffee, and the best of bread and butter. I myself am up stairs (as now) in the front-room, at my old writing-table, with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the dining-room chairs for personal use, and some eight other ornamental London ones, of cherry-wood and cane-bottoms, bought for some 8/6 apiece, really very handsome. The cheapness of all that sort of things here surprised us agreeably: we bought very tolerable new rush-bottomed chairs all painted &#x26;c at 2/3 apiece (for kitchen and bedroom): they were to be had of good stained hardwood for 4/; not above <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the price they are at in Dumfries. Hardware too, of which we have again a right stock, is decidedly cheaper. I bought a large secondhand Press for my Books, fully larger than the Scotsbrig one now our Mother&#x2019;s, and <hi rend="italic">all</hi> of the best workmanship and beautifullest dark <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Onjuras May-ugany&#x201D;</hi> (Honduras Mahogany), for &#xa3;4: a most sturdy, sufficient thing, with not a whit of veneering (for the very shelves, all moveable too, are of <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;May-ugany,&#x201D;</hi> only &#x201C;Spanish&#x201D;); a great bargain. And now in this, and in two other strange wall-presses (with which the old House abounds), all my Books are safe stowed; and the red carpet and red curtains being fitted in, and <pb id="pg-07-223" n="07-223"/>every thing as dry as a bone,&#x2014;I sit quite snug, and &#x201C;far better than I deserve.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;As Coleridge said of his cold tea&#x201D; (<ref target="volume-24/lt-18491231-JWC-MR-01">JWC to MR, <date when="1849-12-31">31 Dec. 1849</date></ref>, Froude, <hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, II, 98).</note> We also find Chelsea exceedingly convenient for shops and the like, which is a thing nowise universal in the other suburbs: we have discovered a Scotch Baker equal to the Waterbeck one; can get a &#x201C;halfpenny farthing&#x2019;s worth&#x201D; of porter at any moment of the day, actually get a morsel of cream twice aday, and can even (which is the chief miracle) realise sour-milk! Our Annandale oatmeal makes us the nicest supper; for which only an ungrateful heart would not return thanks.</p>
<p>Out of doors, the world wags on as yet without much interference of ours. The Magazine and Review people, seemingly in the last stage of straitenedness, have no work to offer; and for the present I have no employment bringing money in. Greatly to my glad surprise, however, I found that Books actually could be got published; to the writing of a Book therefore I will first of all again address myself, and am indeed already addressing myself in some measure. If all go well, you will see a Book with my name on it, before you see <hi rend="italic">me:</hi> it shall be the best Book I can make it, and after that, the poor people can do with it and say of it and sing of it what is to themselves most comfortable. To the Magaziners I shall probably have little more to say: <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, once for all, seems to me a finished trade for an honest man; so we will look about for something else. First get the Book done; that is the duty nearest thee! Mill&#x2019;s Review, after great despondencies, is I believe to go on after all, a certain Sir W. Molesworth (whom I see sometimes) having offered &#xa3;2,000 out of his own pocket to set it agoing. With this it is very probable I shall have some rather effectual concern: but of this too I hold myself independent. &#x201C;<foreign>Blastit wonners</foreign>&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;To a Louse,&#x201D; second stanza, speaking of the louse: &#x201C;Ye ugly creepan, <foreign>blastet wonner</foreign>.&#x201D;</note> enough are living here: shall not I too live? On the whole, my literary position, if it have nothing whatever in it to encourage vainglory, has much to strengthen me in welldoing, and indeed is perhaps almost just <hi rend="italic">such</hi> as a wise friend might wish it for me. The mob of scribblers make no account of me, go <hi rend="italic">yowling</hi>, like huge packs of famishing hounds, after quite other objects; but every now and then, often from remote corners, some earnest voice reaches me, by some indirect way or other, to say: well done, Brother; hold on thy course, and let the hounds&#x2019;-<hi rend="italic">yowling</hi> hold <hi rend="italic">its!</hi> This, I fancy, is almost precisely as it should be.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-224" n="07-224"/>In respect of society, we have what perfectly suffices us; having indeed here the best chance. Mill comes sometimes, the Bullers were all here paying us their first visit; Mrs Austin &#x26;c: there is really <hi rend="italic">enough</hi>, and might easily be to spare. Things go in the strangest course in that respect here. A man becomes (for some reason, or for no reason, discoverable by the unassisted faculties) in some way or other <hi rend="italic">notable:</hi> straightway his door from dawn to dusk is beset with idlers and loungers and empty persons on foot and in carriages, who come to gather of his supposed fulness one five minutes of tolerable sensation; and so the poor man (most frequently it is a poor woman) sits, in studied attitude, all day, &#x201C;doing what he can do&#x201D;;&#x2014;which alas is all-too little; for gradually or suddenly the carriage-and-foot empty persons start some other scent, and crowd elsewhither; and so the poor notable man, now fallen into midnight obscurity, sits, in his studied attitude, within forsaken walls,&#x2014;either to rise and set about some <hi rend="italic">work</hi> (which were the best), or mournfully chaunt <hi rend="italic">Ichabod!</hi><note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Sam. 4:21.</note> according to his own convenience. I know people in various stages of this process at present; some nearly ruined by it; some beginning to be ruined: it is sad, but certain. A few persons, attached not to your repute but to yourself: <hi rend="italic">there</hi> lies the only companionship. But on the whole as I often say, what is society, what is the help of <hi rend="italic">others</hi>, in any shape? None but <hi rend="small-caps">thyself</hi> can effectually help thee, can effectually hinder thee!&#x2014; A man must have lived to little purpose six years in the wilderness of Puttoch, if he have not made this clear to himself. Let us hold fast by this, my dear Brother; for it applies to you also, as to me and all men.</p>
<p>Perhaps my chief favourite at present is Charles Buller. Really a fine sprightly friendly clear and genial young man; can tell you a most intelligible lively story about everything he mixes in; with the gracefullest ease of manners, a very look that bespeaks confidence and respect from you. If his health were good, which unfortunately it is not, I should prophecy of Buller that he would do more good in Parliament than any other man in it. Both he and the whole family like me very much: they are but some two miles and a half from me; so I sometimes, in an evening, step up to tea (only <hi rend="italic">once</hi> since we came here), and find the pleasantest welcome, and generally something profitable to talk of. Mrs Strachey is gone again, without my seeing much of her.</p>
<p>Hunt and the Hunts, as you have heard, lives only in the next <pb id="pg-07-225" n="07-225"/>street from us. Hunt is always ready to go and walk with me, or sit and talk with me, to all lengths, if I want him: he comes in some once a week (when invited, for he is very modest), takes a cup of tea, and sits discoursing, in his brisk fanciful way, till supper-time, and then cheerfully <hi rend="italic">eats</hi> a cup of porridge (to sugar only), which he praises to the skies, and vows he will make his supper of at home. He is a man of thoroughly London make, such as you could not find elsewhere, and I think about the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> possible to be made of his sort. An airy, crotchetty, most copious, clever Talker, with an honest undercurrent of <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> too, but unfortunately not the deepest, not the most practical; or rather it is the most <hi rend="italic">un</hi>practical ever man dealt in. His hair is grizzled, eyes black-hazel, complexion of the clearest dusky-brown; a thin glimmer of smile plays over a face of cast-iron gravity; giving him a singular, discrepant air. He never <hi rend="italic">laughs</hi>, can only <hi rend="italic">titter;</hi> which I think indicates his worst deficiency. In figure and complexion he somewhat reminds me of our late Uncle Sandy: there is the same honest cheerful look, tho&#x2019; so differently expressed. I reckon Hunt a thoroughly sincere man; and find him entertaining by a time. His House here excels all you have ever read of; a &#x201C;poetical Tinkerdom&#x201D; without parallel even in Literature. In his family-room, where are a sickly large Wife and a whole shoal of well-conditioned wild children, you will find half a dozen old rickety chairs gathered from half a dozen different hucksters, and all seemingly engaged, and just pausing, in a violent <hi rend="italic">hornpipe;</hi> on these, and around them, and over the dusty table and ragged carpet, lie all kinds of litter; books, papers, egg-shells, pil<supplied>[lows?]</supplied> and, last night when I was there, the <hi rend="italic">torn heart</hi> of a half quartern loaf! His own room above stairs, into which alone I strive to enter, he keeps cleaner; it has only two chairs, a book-case and a writing-table: yet the noble Hunt receives you in his Tinkerdom with the spirit of a King; apologizes for nothing; places you in the best seat; takes a window-sill himself, if there is no other, and then folding closer his loose-flowing &#x201C;muslin-cloud&#x201D; of a printed night-gown (in which he always writes), commences the liveliest dialogue on Philosophy and the Prospects of Man (who is to be beyond measure &#x201C;happy&#x201D; yet), which again he will courteously terminate the moment you are bound to go. A most interesting, pitiable, loveable man; to be used kindly, but with discretion. After all, it is perhaps rather a comfort to be near honest friendly people, at least an honest friendly man, of that sort: we stand &#x201C;sharp but mannerly&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coterie speech.

<p>Allan Cunningham is hardly a mile from us in the way towards Town: I have meant to go up several evenings, but not made it out yet. There is a good deal of worth in Allan, but unfortunately no firm basis: he talks hither and thither, not without gumption; far from that; yet with too much <hi rend="italic">nickering</hi> and <hi rend="italic">guffawing</hi>, in the rustic Nithsdale style. His Wife unfortunately has got <hi rend="italic">puffed up</hi> (in all senses), and become a woman &#x201C;altered by prosperity.&#x201D; Jeshurun waxed fat!<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Deut. 32:15.</note></p>
<p>But now, my dear Brother, I must certainly draw bridle! It is already probably the longest Letter you ever read, and all about myself. Now that the foundation is laid, and you have an idea of our <hi rend="italic">foundation</hi> here, I shall be able to make myself intelligible in briefer compass.</p>
<p>Had it not been Jean&#x2019;s Letter yesterday, which satisfied me about many things, I meant to require of you with all vehemence an answer <hi rend="italic">the moment</hi> this came to hand. As it is, you must not be long; take your largest sheet (even a <hi rend="italic">long</hi>-shaped one), and in your smallest hand give me nothing but news, news!</p>
<p>There have been great things at Scotsbrig, as I now authentically see: the Honey-moon is not yet exhausted; so that all will yet be rose-colour there. My hearty love to the new Pair; my wish (with Mr Croaker) &#x201C;that we may be all as well this time twelvemonth&#x201D;!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Goldsmith&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">The Good Natur&#x2019;d Man</hi>, Croaker&#x2019;s first speech in Act I and last speech in Act V.</note> Seriously, it is better the thing is over, and now we partly see what ground we are standing on. Our dear Mother will get on tolerably among you for this year; and then with the next Whitsunday, if we be all spared, new light may rise. I need not entreat you all to be good to her; for I think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a universal feeling in the family.</p>
<p>Jean mentioned Jenny and you as at Dumfries shortly before she wrote, and that her accounts out of Annandale were quite fresh, and all satisfactory. Let us be thankful!&#x2014; Tell me how you get on; as minutely as I here shew you the pattern. Are you still for giving up Catlinns? It is a project not to be objected to, in my opinion; yet doubtless requiring serious thought. Perhaps you have already decided it.</p>
<p>Give my love to Jenny; to little Jane and my poor wee Namesake, who must be grown a big fellow by the time of my return. Bring up <pb id="pg-07-227" n="07-227"/>your family &#x201C;in the nurture and admonition&#x201D;<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eph. 6:4.</note> prescribed by the Highest: I see daily mournful proofs how fatal is the want of that.

<ps><p>Jane is gone out, but charged me to send her love to you and every one. She is well, and <hi rend="italic">thanks</hi> you all for help.</p>
<p>You will get the Newspaper, if Jamie Aitken is regular, generally on Sabbath; or at worst pretty <hi rend="italic">certainly</hi> on Monday. It suffers no delay by Jamie; but profits much by the address in their hand.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; my time is perhaps <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than run, I will not send this<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><ref target="volume-07/lt-18340627-TC-AC-01">The letter to Alexander Carlyle immediately preceding</ref>.</note> off without a little word specially for you. Jean&#x2019;s Letter yesterday gave me a satisfaction I have not had the like of for long: I pray you thank her kindly from me, and say that in a week or two I will repay her by a London Letter. Probably my next Letter may be to her: but at any rate to some of you I will write in the appointed &#x201C;three weeks.&#x201D; She tells me you are well, and hopeful, which I feel to be the chief of my earthly mercies.</p>
<p>But when are you to write, and tell me so yourself? Jean describes your Lodging at Scotsbrig, and gives me a very fair idea of it; but it will not be <hi rend="italic">right</hi> till you have sat down in the little end-room, and <hi rend="italic">written me a Letter!</hi> Depend upon that.</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt is to give me an <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> on Tuesday or Wednesday, but will perhaps not be <hi rend="italic">very</hi> regular: the first day after, when I am <pb id="pg-07-228" n="07-228"/>up in town, I will carry it to the Post-office (we have a Post-office here, but it is some twopence, or some penny dearer); and you may generally calculate on it on Sabbath or at farthest on Monday. The <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> will always be worth something to you.</p>
<p>Alick has all my news, and will certainly read you the Letter; and I should think <hi rend="italic">sate</hi> you with that for once: yet I do not know.</p>
<p>I forgot to say that our Maid continued to go along in the finest way: she seems to me a very singular woman, quite <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the common run, but even <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> quite <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of it, and so exposed to new risks. We have the peacefullest most united household we ever had.&#x2014; Furthermore, I have bought me a white Hat, for twelve shillings; and walk about in it, quite a beauty! Down at Chelsea I can even wear my grey jacket about the streets: in the Garden, smoking I constantly wear my old girdle straw one. We have two vines and a walnut-tree; all with a kind of show of fruit.</p>
<p>Poor William Austin! I have read no truer Tragedy than Jean&#x2019;s account of his journey up. We felt a deep regret for him and wish it were in our power to say anything that would comfort those he has <supplied>[left.]</supplied> He was a sober innocent man; and seemed to have known nothing of Life or its vices and miseries, nothing except the honest toil that man is born to.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter of <date when="1834-06-23">23 June</date>, Jean had written about the illness and death of William Austin (brother of James, who had married Carlyle&#x2019;s sister Mary). See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340722-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-07-22">22 July</date></ref>.</note></p>
<p>You were to be at Mary&#x2019;s, Jean said. Tell me how they prosper there; or bid Mary herself write. I sent her an old Newspaper one day; which I hope she got.&#x2014; Tell me also if Harry carries you handsomely about.</p>
<p>Jack has not written to me, tho&#x2019; there is something like time now. My conjecture is that he may be travelling to Naples, or the Letter may be travelling, and hence the delay. Or it may be, he waits till I send him my fixed address; not caring to trust a Letter with Fraser, as I directed him to do. I wrote a second time some ten days ago; and in answer to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, shall certainly expect to hear. My last notice was a<supplied>[s]</supplied> Jane passed thro&#x2019; Liverpool, when Dr Arbuckle (his friend) had just received a Letter from him, and all was well. This indeed is not so long ago.</p>
<p>But, alas, here is Jane back again; and reproof that my time is <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> exhausted! I must run. Be careful of yourself my dear Mother; and may God ever care for you!</p>

<salute>My dear Mrs Austin,</salute>
<p>I am very unfortunate. I was taken ill yesterday: a very severe fit (of a liver concern); worse than any I can recollect for the last ten years.

<salute>My Dear Jean,</salute>
<p>Your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1834-06-23">23 June</date>.</note> which was the first I had received from any of my Friends in Scotland, proved one of the welcomest I ever got. The Postman&#x2019;s two knocks (for all Postmen give two smart thumps, which are known here and elsewhere as the &#x201C;Postman&#x2019;s Knock&#x201D;) brought me it and the Newspaper, and delivered me from a multitude of vague imaginations. Newspapers indeed had come the week before, and persuaded me that nothing material was wrong: however, it was still the best that could happen to have it all confirmed in <pb id="pg-07-230" n="07-230"/>black-on-white. Tell James that, in spite of his critical penetration, the Letter &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">could</hi> go,&#x201D; and did go, and was welcomed as few are.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jean had written near the end of her letter: &#x201C;James [her husband] has read part of this over &#x26; declares it cannot go but the trouble of writing it again is so considerable that it must go this time however incorrect.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Whatever you may think, it is not a &#x201C;ten minutes&#x201D; matter with me, the filling of a frank that will carry an ounce of thin writing paper: it is a decided <hi rend="italic">business</hi>, which breaks the head of a Day for me; which breakage, however, I am generally well disposed to execute. Do you also take a large, even a <hi rend="italic">long</hi>-shaped Sheet, a clear-pointed pen, and in the smallest hand you can master, repay it me. By no means must I want Dumfriesshire news, especially news about my Mother. The tax-loaded Post-Office is still the most invaluable of Establishments; and the ancient men, that invented <hi rend="italic">Writing</hi>, and made the voice of man triumphant over Space and Time, were deservedly accounted next to gods. I would have you in particular, do your endeavour by assiduous practice (there is <hi rend="italic">no</hi> other method) to perfect yourself in that divine art, the uses of which no man can calculate: in time, as I predict, you will acquire very considerable excellence. As for good composition, it is mainly the result of good thinking, and improves with that, if careful observation as you read attends it: the Penmanship is a secondary matter, and has only three points of perfection, or at most four, that I know of; in all of which one may advance indefinitely by exertions of one&#x2019;s own: that it be straight across the paper, that it be distinct, that it be rapid,&#x2014;to which, if you like, add that it be <hi rend="italic">close</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">much of it</hi> in a given space. &#x201C;These are good advices&#x201D;? They are not mine, but the Apostle Butterworth&#x2019;s!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >E. Butterworth &#x26; Son (George), noted &#x201C;writing masters&#x201D; of Edinburgh, who advise, in their <hi rend="italic">Elegant Extracts for Butterworth &#x26; Son&#x2019;s New Universal Penman</hi> (Edinburgh, <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>): &#x201C;Endeavour to write as fast as you can write well.&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>I did not design answering you so soon by a week or ten days; as I said in Alick&#x2019;s Letter: but there has come a sheet from Naples,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >This letter from John has not been found.</note> which I was beginning to be very impatient for, and I would not keep it back an instant from my Mother, whose impatience probably is still greater. She has already got hint of it in the last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, and also that it is coming by you on Wednesday: so I take occasion by the forelock, and hope I shall not miss the day again, as I fear was done in the Catlinns case, after all my exertions: as for you, make up the parcel again instantly for Jardine and Scotsbrig, or there will be no forgivenness [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] for you.</p>
<p>As you have doubtless seen or will see the copious despatches I <pb id="pg-07-231" n="07-231"/>have sent to Annandale about our Household Establishment here, wherein nothing from the very watering-pan and marygold flowers upwards is forgotten, I need not dilate farther on that topic. We have at length all but got the last stragglers of the Upholsterer squadron handsomely conducted out of doors, with far less damage than might have been apprehended; and sit quietly in a Dwelling-place really much beyond what could have been anticipated; where, if Providence but grant us grace not to be wanting <hi rend="italic">to ourselves</hi>, the rest may pass quite uncriticised. We have not yet ceased to admire the union of quietness, and freshness of air, and the outlook into green Trees (Plum-trees, walnuts; even mulberries, they say), with the close neighbourhood of the noisiest Babylon that ever raged and <hi rend="italic">fumed</hi> (with coal smoke) on the face of this Planet. I can alternate between the one and the other in half an hour! The London streets themselves are a quite peculiar object, and I dare say of almost <hi rend="italic">inexhaustible</hi> significance. There is such a torrent of vehicles and faces: the slow-rolling all-defying waggon, like a mountain in motion, the dejected Hackney-coach, that &#x201C;has seen better days,&#x201D; but goes along as with a tough uncomplaining patience, the gay equipage with its lightbounding air, and <hi rend="italic">flunkies</hi> of colour hanging behind it; the <hi rend="italic">distracted</hi> Cab (a thing like a Cradle set aslant on its foot-end, where you sit open in front but free from rain), which always some <hi rend="italic">blackguard</hi> drives, with the fury of <foreign>Jehu</foreign>; the huge Omnibus (a painted <hi rend="italic">Corn-</hi><foreign><hi rend="italic">kist</hi></foreign> [corn-bin], of 20 feet long, set on four wheels: no it cannot be <hi rend="italic">twenty</hi> feet!) which runs along all streets from all points of the compass, as a sixpenny or shilling stagecoach towards &#x201C;The Bank&#x201D; (of England); Butchers&#x2019; and Brewers&#x2019; and Bakers&#x2019; Drays: all these with wheelbarrows, trucks (<hi rend="italic">hurlies</hi>), dogcarts and a nameless flood of other <hi rend="italic">sma&#x2019; trash</hi>, hold on unweariedly their ever-vexed chaotic way. And then of foot-passengers! From the King to the Beggar; all in haste, all with a look of care and endeavour; and as if there <hi rend="italic">were</hi> really &#x201C;Deevil a thing but one man oppressing another.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech but not traced.</note> To wander along and read all this: it is reading one of the strangest everlasting <hi rend="italic">Newspaper Columns</hi> the eye ever opened on. A Newspaper Column of <hi rend="italic">living</hi> Letters (as I often say), that was printed in <hi rend="small-caps">Eternity</hi>, and is here published only for a little while in <hi rend="small-caps">Time</hi>, and will soon be recalled and taken out of circulation again!</p>
<p>For the rest, we live exceedingly quiet here; as yet visited by few, and happily by almost <hi rend="italic">none</hi> that is not worth being visited by. At <pb id="pg-07-232" n="07-232"/>any time, in half an hour, I can have company enough of the sort going; and scarcely above once or twice in the week is my Day aken from me by any intrusion. I am getting rather stiffly to work again; and once well at work, can defy the whole Powers of Darkness, and say in my heart (as Tom Ker the Mason did to Denby and &#x201C;the Marquis&#x201D; or some military minion of his): &#x201C;ye will go your lengths, Gentlemen; my name&#x2019;s Tom Ker.&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was a Denbie House in Ecclefechan, occupied (according to <hi rend="italic">Gentlemen&#x2019;s Seats</hi>, <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>) by Richard Hetherington; and Hugh and James Ker, masons, are recorded as living in Annan. Otherwise unidentified.</note>&#x2014; By and by, if all go right, you shall see some Book of mine with my name (not of &#x201C;Tom Ker&#x201D;) on it, and the best I can do. Pray that it be honestly done, let its reception be what it will.</p>
<p>Of &#x201C;amusements,&#x201D; beyond mere strolling I take little thought. By acquaintance with Newspaper people (such as Hunt), I fancy we might procure free admission to the Theatres, even to the Opera, almost every night: but, alas, what would it avail? I actually went, one idle night before Jane came, to Covent Garden; found it a very Mystery of Stupidity and Abomination; and so tiresome that I came away long before the end, and declare that the dullest sermon I ever heard was cheery in comparison. The night before last, looking out from our (back) Bedroom window, at midnight, I saw the many-coloured rockets rising from Vauxhall Gardens,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Pleasure-gardens, dating from the seventeenth century, still flourishing under the ownership of Bish, Gye &#x26; Hughes, conducted chiefly by Frederick Gye (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>). See J. G. Southworth, <hi rend="italic">Vauxhall Gardens, A. Chapter in the Social History of England</hi> (New York, <date when="1941-00-00">1941</date>).</note> and thought with myself: &#x201C;very well, Gentlemen, if you have &#x201C;guinea admission&#x201D; to spare for it; only, thank Heaven, I am not within a measured mile of you!&#x201D;&#x2014; There are a few good even noble people here too; there must be a few; if there were not, the whole concern would take fire: of these I even know some, and hope to know more.</p>
<p>But now, my dear Sister, you have enough of London: let me turn a little northward. I am much obliged by your descriptions of our Mother&#x2019;s settlement; I can form a very tolerable notion of her arrangement in the two well-known Rooms, and find it the most natural that could be made. I hope, however, the <hi rend="italic">Clock</hi> is now got safely hoisted up: surely, among so many stout hands, any task of that kind could not be difficult. However, where a Honeymoon is in progress one must <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign> [endure], one must <foreign><hi rend="italic">thole</hi></foreign>. I also like very well to hear of your Jamie&#x2019;s boarding with our Mother, while he is at his work in the neighbourhood; I follow him across the fresh <pb id="pg-07-233" n="07-233"/>fields, early in the morning, to the <hi rend="italic">Ha</hi>&#x2019;, and heartily wish him a <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> day.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hall, Kirkconnell, Ecclefechan, occupied by Dr. Archibald Arnott, which Jean&#x2019;s husband was glazing.</note> There is no other way of making a <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> day, that I could ever hear of. That he finds employment in his honest vocation is a great blessing, for which I trust you are thankful. Tell him to <hi rend="italic">follow</hi> his vocation honestly, not as a man-pleaser, or one working for the eye of man only, but as one forever under <hi rend="italic">another</hi> Eye, that never slumbers or sleeps, that <hi rend="italic">sees</hi> in secret, and will reward openly. I hope and believe that this <hi rend="italic">is</hi> his course, that he will persevere in it, let the wind of accident blow fair or foul; and so I can prophecy all manner of good for him.</p>
<p>Your description of poor William Austin was in the deepest degree tragical. Poor young man! I see him there, on his last journey; wending painfully homewards; alas, to his long home, for the shadows of Death are already fast darkening down on him! He sees Carstammon again, but it is only to die there. The depths of Eternity lie under those Moors as they do under the proudest dwelling-places; the poor Ploughman also shuffles off his mortal garment, and is, with Kings and Patriarchs, <hi rend="italic">naked</hi> before God!&#x2014; If you see any of the Austins tell them how deeply I sympathize with them; how fain I would comfort them if the power were given me.</p>
<p>There is much loud thunder today, and a copious deluge of rain; of all which we hope to reap the benefit tomorrow; for the air was growing foully uncomfortable and oppressive too; a sour east-wind, amid the sultriest brick-kiln heat, with dusts enough and vapours as we have them on these streets and ways. A day&#x2019;s rain washes everything above ground and beneath it; next morning we can &#x201C;snuff the <foreign><hi rend="italic">caller</hi></foreign> [fresh, cool] air,&#x201D;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Burns, &#x201C;Holy Fair,&#x201D; line 4.</note> for it is there to snuff.</p>
<p>M&#x2019;Diarmid&#x2019;s Note you can hand in as you pass the Courier Office. Glen&#x2019;s will go by M&#x2019;Knight* (if you see none of themselves), who puts up about the head of the sands (next inn eastward from one Pappel&#x2019;s),<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Pappel, Black Bull, Brewery St.</note> and leaves the Town about noon. [Carlyle&#x2019;s asterisk. He writes the next two sentences in the margin opposite it.] After all Friday is soon enough; and Thursday is no delay at all [torn] you must <hi rend="italic">cover</hi> Glen&#x2019;s anew, or I fear it will not go well by John.<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He has enclosed a note for Glen, which must be given a fresh &#x201C;cover&#x201D; in order not to confuse the carrier John M&#x2019;Knight.</note> Mind your two strokes while you can, put them below the &#x201C;London<supplied>[&#x201D;]</supplied>, as if they were your way of finishing off. Will you also make some <pb id="pg-07-234" n="07-234"/>inquiry about the poor fellow, from the Austins, and endeavour to learn from <supplied>[for]</supplied> me how he is. I anticipate hearing of little change in him.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met &#x201C;old Dalgonar&#x201D;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> at Allan Cunningham&#x2019;s. Singular, to meet a Dunscore door-neighbour, for the first time, in London! He seemed to me not half so bad an old fellow as he has been represented; he walked along with me (not in his own road) when we went out; testified a kind of almost <hi rend="italic">joy</hi> in me, and bade me &#x201C;a kind farewell.&#x201D;</p>
<p>This is a far longer Letter than your&#x2019;s, Dame; and deserves two in return f<supplied>[or it&#x2014;]</supplied> think of that, and of what you are to <hi rend="italic">do</hi> in consequence. Alick&#x2019;s Letter is the first due to me, but then come your <hi rend="italic">two</hi>. Or if Alick loiter (which he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not, and will not), leave him out of the question. Can you tell me anything of Mary, and how she gets on? I often figure her at the Battery, and hope it is all well with her. That Scotsbrig residence, I think with you and have always thought, can hardly be permanently comfortable for our Mother; if it serve well for one year, that is all I hope of it: then other outlooks may have opened.<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340627-TC-AC-01">TC to AC, <date when="1834-06-27">27 June</date></ref>, for Jean&#x2019;s comments about Jamie&#x2019;s unhelpfulness.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>This is some two weeks beyond bargain; but I know well, it will not be out of season. Jack&#x2019;s Letter arrived some three days ago; and I would not detain it from you a single post I could help. In the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> you might notice a hint held out of it against Wednesday; and so accordingly here it is.</p>
<p>By the blessing of the Supreme Powers, Jack is still well, and even better than formerly; full of zeal and pious disposition; and perhaps with a kind of hope to see us sooner than was expected, namely in <date when="1835-05-00">May</date>. I had already sent him off another Letter, which must be far on the way by this time: before long I will write to him again. You are to hear next, it seems; and that is a Letter I shall not see: however, some of them will copy me the marrow of it. The other Letter to you was the one, I suppose, which you had that last night I was at Scotsbrig; the Letter to W. Graham I had not before heard of.</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Letter informed me that you would probably be waiting at Catlinns for news of me: I had done all I could to keep the time; but unfortunately, on calling at Charles Buller&#x2019;s, found him from home, and even not likely to be in for the Post; and so had to leave my sheet with the strong probability that you would not get it till the day after promise. Two Newspapers would in some measure reassure you; and I hope, next day, all ending well, was well.</p>
<p>Of myself, dear Mother, I have nothing new to tell you; especially nothing that were bad news. I imagine I shall be in fully better health here, were I once used to my new aliments and way of life: but as yet I am experimenting a good deal, and cannot yet say what is best for me. We are worst off for milk: it is dear, as fine wine, and the merest <foreign><hi rend="italic">joot</hi></foreign> [sour milk] occasionally half drawn from the Pump. To give real money for imaginary milk is a thing I will not consent to; so we have given it up, and get &#x201C;two-penn&#x2019;orth&#x201D; of cream night and morning, which (when the weather is not &#x201C;thundery&#x201D;) really answers very well. To the Porridge we have excellent beer; which, however (strange as you will think it), will not agree with me as it should. <pb id="pg-07-236" n="07-236"/>I have some thoughts even of giving up the porridge altogether; but will try to do what is best, and nothing rashly. The beer seems to be a kind of physic for me, and acts too keenly: that is its fault. On the other hand we have excellent potatoes (old still, tho&#x2019; new are plentiful long since), excellent meat and bread: the quietest nights, amid the <foreign>freest</foreign> [purest] air, and no kind of foul thing to disturb us.</p>
<p>Since milk and puddings are gone quite out of fashion, we have taken to eat a little cheese, and often think one of your Scotsbrig ones would be more valued here. By the bye, I may as well mention in time that we are determined you shall send us by Whitehaven, in the hind-harvest, a huge barrel of all manner of provisions: butter, meal, a bacon ham, even potatoes; the Carriage (by the square foot) will be so low. But for all this there is a good time coming.&#x2014; What is more to the point, I have got a heap of Books about me and am actually employing myself daily in preparation of that Book of my own! It is on the French Revolution, which seems far the eligiblest for my first: there is an appetite for it; there are plenty of Documents and materials; Mill himself laid me out the other day a whole barrowful, and insisted on my getting them over all at once. They are not come yet, but are coming&#x2014;by the &#x201C;Carrier,&#x201D; for we have Carriers between district and district of this huge City, some with horses, some with asses, some for aught I know with <hi rend="italic">dogs</hi>&#x2014;the lightest draught-cattle in use here.&#x2014; I am determined to do my very best, and shall like Cowthwaite &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">mak&#x2019; an a&#x2019;f-f-f-u&#x2019; struggle</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18190329-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:173</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1819-03-29">29 March 1819</date></corr></ref>.</note> Do you prophecy well of me? I hope you do. Of your <hi rend="italic">wishes</hi> for me there could be no improvement.</p>
<p>I will send Jack all the description I can of your settlement at Scotsbrig; I hope soon to hear more of what you are engaged with, how you feel in your new <foreign><hi rend="italic">hadding</hi></foreign> [lodging]. It is very agreeable to hear that our new Sister takes to you, and you to her; on your side I can promise there will be no want of prudent tolerance so essential everywhere; and thus all may do very well for the present. Do you go about fearlessly? Have you been at Mary&#x2019;s, sea-bathing? Give my love to Mary: tell her to write to me when she can find time; especially, with or without time, if I can <hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything for her. My sympathies to poor Jamie;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Austin, Carlyle&#x2019;s brother-in-law, whose brother William had died.</note> whose loss of his honest innocent brother I can well pity.&#x2014; You must not let Alick neglect to write: but when are you going to write yourself? I will take no excuse. One day too, I still <pb id="pg-07-237" n="07-237"/>think we shall <hi rend="italic">see</hi> you here!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >He never did.</note> It would not be so strange as it looks.&#x2014; Have you ever seriously thought of your journey to Templand yet? I think you really should go.&#x2014; Alas, the Paper is done! May all blessings be about you always, dear Mother!&#x2014;<closer><salute>Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Our united regards to James and his Wife: long may the first love last; and be followed by a second like it! Alick will soon write.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>The hope of ever seeing you at Craigenputtoch has now vanished into the infinite limbo. We have broken up our old settlement, and, after tumult enough, formed a new one here, under the most opposite conditions. From the ever-silent whinstones of Nithsdale to the mud-rattling <pb id="pg-07-238" n="07-238"/>pavements of Piccadilly there is but a step. I feel it the strangest transition; but one uses himself to all.</p>
<p>Our upholsterers, with all their rubbish and clippings, are at length handsomely swept out of doors. I have got my little book-press set up, my table fixed firm in its place, and sit here awaiting what Time and I, in our questionable wrestle, shall make out between us. The house pleases us much; it is in the remnant of genuine <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Dutch-looking Chelsea;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cheyne Walk was thought to be a &#x201C;Dutch-like river terrace &#x2026;, mostly brick-built,&#x201D; J. Timbs, <hi rend="italic">Curiosities of London</hi> (London, <date when="1868-00-00">1868</date>), p. 91; perhaps Carlyle also has in mind the time when William III (&#x201C;Dutch William&#x201D;) (<date when="1689-00-00">1689</date>&#x2013;<date when="1702-00-00">1702</date>) reigned.</note> looks out mainly into trees. We might see at half a mile&#x2019;s distance Bolingbroke&#x2019;s Battersea; could shoot a gun into Smollett&#x2019;s old house (at this very time getting pulled down), where he wrote <hi rend="italic">Count Fathom</hi>, and was wont every Saturday to dine a company of hungry authors, and then set them fighting together. Don Saltero&#x2019;s coffee-house still looks as brisk as in Steele&#x2019;s time; Nell Gwynn&#x2019;s<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eleanor or Nell Gwyn (<date when="1650-00-00">1650</date>&#x2013;<date when="1687-00-00">87</date>), English actress and mistress of Charles II.</note> boudoir, still bearing her name, has become a gin-temple, not inappropriately; in fine, Erasmus lodged with More (they say) in a spot not five hundred yards from this. We are encompassed with a cloud of witnesses,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Heb. 12:1.</note> good, bad, indifferent.</p>
<p>Of London itself I must not begin to speak. I wish you would come and look at it with me. There is a spare bed here, ample room and verge enough;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311006-TCJWC-MAC-01"><sic>JWC and TC</sic><corr>TCJWC</corr> to MAC, [<date when="1831-10-06">6 Oct. 1831</date>]</ref>.</note> and, for welcome, I wish you would understand that to be for you infallible at all times.</p>
<p>Literature seems dying of thin diet and flatulence, but it is not quite so near dead as I had calculated. In all human things there is the strangest vitality. Who knows how long even bookselling may last? Ever, too, among these mad Ma&#xEB;lstroms swims some little casket that <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not sink. God mend it!</p>
<p>Mrs. <supplied>[Buller?]</supplied> often speaks of you, but seems to have no recent news. She has got much deeper into the vortex than when I saw her last; dines with Chancellors; seems to sit berattled all day with the sound of door-knockers and carriage-wheels, and the melody of drawing-room commonplace, perennial as that of the spheres: for the rest, a most lovable loving woman, to whom I could wish a better element.</p>
<p>There is some uncertain talk here about founding a new periodical,<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi>.</note> <pb id="pg-07-239" n="07-239"/>on another than the bibliopolic principle, with intent to show Liberalism under a better than its present rather sooty and ginshop aspect. I was asked whether your co-operation might be possible. I answered, Possible. If it go on, you will let me write to you farther about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I am actually going to write a book, and perhaps publish a booklet already written: the former is my enterprise till perhaps spring next. Wish me well through it.</p>
<p>Will you ever send me a sheet of Edinburgh news? It were <hi rend="italic">very</hi> welcome from your hand. Pray tell Moir also where I am, and give my hearty love to him. Think kindly of me; there are few in Scotland I wish it more from.</p>
<p><closer><salute>With kind regards to Lady Hamilton, in which my wife, were she here at the moment, would cordially unite,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Inglis,</salute>
<p>You heard above two months ago that we were bound for London; our then probable address has not proved the real one; which latter I now at last send you. Infinite has been and still is the hurlyburly. Quietness however is now visible in the distance.</p>
<p>There is a room here for you when you come to London: actually a &#x201C;spare bed,&#x201D; strange as that phenomenon in Coekneyland is. Stranger still, and actually true once more, there is an old Scottish welcome. Let us see your face some time; let us have your kind thoughts often.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi> Manuscript, be the Heavens thanked, is now all but finished: loud, earnest, universal has been the disapproval of it.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle wrote as follows in commenting on Althaus&#x2019;s account of the reception of <hi rend="italic">Sartor:</hi> &#x201C;Fraser&#x2019;s Public liked the <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> so much &#x2026; that he was willing to accept <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> in the slit condition; had it so (probably on cheaper terms), went on with it obstinately till done,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; from his Public, he had a sore time with it: &#x2018;What wretched unintelligible nonsense!&#x2019; &#x2018;Sir, if you publish any more of that d&#x2014;&#x2014;d <supplied>[<hi rend="italic">stuff?</hi>]</supplied>, I shall be obliged to give up my Magazine!&#x2019; and so forth,&#x2014;in the whole world (so far as could be learned) only two persons dissentient, 1&#xB0; a certain man called <hi rend="italic">Emerson</hi>, in Concord Massachusetts, and 2&#xB0; a certain Irish Catholic Priest, Father O&#x2019;Shea of Cork (whom I have seen since, and who yet lives) writing to him, each for himself, &#x2018;So long as anything by that man appears in your Magazine, punctually send it me.&#x2019; So that Fraser conceived a certain terror, if also a certain respect, of my writings &#x26; me; and knew not what to do,&#x2014;beyond standing by his bargain, with an effort. Poor Soul, he was in the hands of a set of Maginns, Father Prouts, J. A. Herauds &#x26;c &#x26;c, partly of the clever Irish-Blackguard type, partly of the pure English Vapid-Blockhead ditto; and was not a man of adventurous temper, or of deep judgement. In a year or two after <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> (for which I never received the colour of coin from him), he died;&#x2014;and I remember reading, in some Newspaper Obituary, what a &#x2018;generous patron he had been to Thomas Carlyle.&#x2019;&#x2014;thank you for nothing or for less!&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences</hi>, pp. 74&#x2013;75).</note> <foreign><hi rend="italic">A la</hi></foreign> <pb id="pg-07-240" n="07-240"/><foreign><hi rend="italic">bonne heure</hi></foreign> [Well and good]!

You shall have a copy of these things; of <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi> perhaps very soon.</p>
<p>When you cross the Mound will you give these Cards as addressed; to the Doctor<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Dr. David Irving.</note> and the college Porter.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>Considering how slowly Letters seem to travel between this and Naples, I judge it full time to send you farther news of me, tho&#x2019; only my first London Letter is yet answered, and the last still expecting an answer. Your Naples Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> appeared to have passed three weeks on the road. What day it arrived here I cannot exactly say, for it was sent off to Scotsbrig almost forthwith; but it must be above a fortnight ago; in any case, since <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wrote last, more than a month has gone. Our increased distance is one of the evils of that otherwise so desireable country; an evil, however, which will not continue, which while it does last we must strive by greater industry to help.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-241" n="07-241"/>Shortly after I wrote last there came a Letter from Dumfries, containing the much longed-for confirmation that all was well there. Jean, the writer of it, gives me a brief but clear description of several things; especially of our Mother&#x2019;s new position at Scotsbrig. She had been at Jamie&#x2019;s wedding, as the rest all were; had seen the glorious devotedness of a pair of Turtles tying themselves together by indissoluble bonds; &#x201C;neither of them seemed to have eyes or ears for any heavenly or earthly thing except the other.&#x201D; Whereupon she farther quotes a sentence of &#x201C;the Doctor&#x2019;s,&#x201D; to the effect that &#x201C;every dog has his day,&#x201D; and ought to have it. &#x201C;Our Mother and Jenny&#x201D; (I copy Jean&#x2019;s words<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In her letter of <date when="1834-06-23">23 June</date>.</note>) &#x201C;had made their elopement upstairs with such of their moveables as they could carry; Mr Carleil, as might have been expected, was lost to all earthly considerations but his beloved Isabel. However, with aid of James Austen and James Aitken, on monday, she got her big Bed removed into the big room, and her own close one<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Movable box-bed.</note> set in its place, with a little Closet left on the farther end to hold her kettle, water-cann &#x26;c: Jane&#x2019;s little painted meal-barrel and a beautiful beef-ham also grace this apartment. The close Bed is nicely papered, and the large Press that stood below now stands fronting the bedroom window, between the Bed and the Door. The Clock was to stand at the end of the Chest of Drawers, but has not yet been lifted, and is consequently keeping company down stairs with the new one Jamie bought.&#x201D; I daresay you can understand this description, and will picture it out in your head as I have done. Jean adds the comfortable assurance that our Mother is in fully average health, and has good hope of her new <hi rend="italic">upputting</hi>, and new neighbourhood, the Daughter-in-law seeming to be a very reasonable modest kind of person. Jenny was already in Dumfries at her sewing. Jamie Aitken had taken the painting and glazing of Dr Arnott&#x2019;s new House (at &#x201C;the Ha&#x2019;&#x201D;), and was to stay with our Mother while doing it. Mary and Alick at their respective places of abode were doing well. This is the latest detailed news. Since then I have written both to Alick and to Jean (and to my Mother on both occasions); I expected before this a Letter from Alick, but must not keep <hi rend="italic">you</hi> longer waiting for it. I have gathered from Directions of Newspapers and so forth that all is still well; that our Mother has been at Catlinns, at Annan and sea-bathing, and had come about a week ago to Dumfries,&#x2014;probably, as I myself surmise, to be with Jean on a very <hi rend="italic">important occasion</hi>, which cannot now be distant. <pb id="pg-07-242" n="07-242"/>Mrs Welsh writes to us that she saw her (Jean) &#x201C;very large and very anxious&#x201D;: may it all prove well! Such is my Scottish intelligence: I get the <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> weekly in Jean&#x2019;s or her Husband&#x2019;s hand, I send my Mother the <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> (which Hunt gives me here) every friday: by a certain pair of <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> unmeaning to the uninitiated we inform one another that all is well; and with this I find that I must mainly rest content, for none of them is very ready with the pen, and Jean the readiest is occupied otherwise a good deal, and at a distance from the principal scene. Did you remember <hi rend="italic">William</hi> Austin? I think hardly, for he did not come to Scotsbrig till his Brother was free and seeking farms. Poor Will was a tall stately young man; had made himself much liked; fell seriously sick about the time of our leaving Scotland; was anxious to get away about the wedding-season, and be home to his own moors: a younger brother got him mounted accordingly into our old gig; the poor fellow was stupified and partially delirious when they got to Jean&#x2019;s at Dumfries; a Doctor they sent for said it was fever and instantly recommended and arranged a removal of him to the Infirmary: the fresh air reawakened poor Will once more, he insisted and passionately commanded that he should be taken <hi rend="italic">home;</hi> but, alas, knew no one when he got there, and some few days after that while his Father was asking him some kind question with little or no hope of answer, fixed his eyes on him, and drew a long deep sigh,&#x2014;his last! This tragical item sheds a sombreness and pity over all our picture of the Scottish homeland; Fate and Eternity are in the wilderness as in the crowded city.&#x2014; I sent a little note to Glen, but have heard no kind of tidings about him: His condition when we left him was dubious as ever; our departure seemed not important to him, as indeed of all terrestrial things only his own identity with Napoleon or Louis Philippe <hi rend="italic">was:</hi> his look was dull-<hi rend="italic">glazed</hi>, turbid, unhappy: he is <hi rend="italic">calcining</hi> the horrid dross out of him; will he ever be purged of it? In any case he must be left, as I read him, for long months and perhaps years to <hi rend="italic">burn</hi> and suffer. May this also all prove a blessing in disguise!</p>
<p>From Dumfries to Naples is a long leap; which, were the foot as free as the thought, I should soon clear, and be with you. That beautiful sea often breathes over my imagination; those blushing Flora and Pomona lands with their azure sunlight, and all resting, as on a thin earthrind, over Hell and volcano-fire!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anticipating the <hi rend="italic">Latter-Day Pamphlets, Works</hi>, XX, 7: &#x201C;On what a bottomless volcano &#x2026; separated from us by a thin earthrind, Society &#x2026; in the present epoch, rests.&#x201D;</note> My Brother wanders <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> in <pb id="pg-07-243" n="07-243"/>the midst of them, his thoughts also often upon me. Your position, and conduct in it, seems all the best we could calculate on; you are, as you say, &#x201C;stranded on a Paradise&#x201D;: what is to be done, but enjoy it, improve it, till you get to sea again? That time too is coming. Your temper of mind is such as I rejoice to see you in; my only farther prayer is that it were possible to express it, more in the only true dialect, that of action. As we said, there is a time coming. Meanwhile, and even as you stand, my advice and caution were not to dwell <hi rend="italic">too much</hi> on theory and meditation: <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">damit</hi> <hi rend="italic">kannst du&#x2019;s nie zurecht machen</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">with that</hi> you will never be able to settle matters]; our mind is never in the healthy state when it is thinking of itself at all. True, it is in the <hi rend="italic">recovering</hi> state, in the state of <hi rend="italic">conversion</hi> (necessary for every modern man); for which be Providence forever thanked, as for the beginning of all good. Nay, on the whole, I find it is nothing but recoveries and relapses to the end of the chapter; &#x201C;walking is but a succession of <hi rend="italic">falls</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330613-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-06-13">13 June 1833</date></ref>.</note> and we must get along, as steadily, with as little criticism, as we can. That noble feeling of <foreign><hi rend="italic">Entsagen</hi></foreign> [renunciation], which as yet dwells fondly on itself, will, as you grow and live in it, inform every phasis of Existence with a noble heroic significance; you will not need to look within for it, but will see it everywhere written without. Tell me more what you do, even what you see; everywhere attempt to <hi rend="italic">act</hi> on the outward world, to study it, to delineate it; more and more to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it, for of its depth there is no end. Or rather let me say, go on as you can, as you are doing, my dear Brother, and may God prosper you on the way! I am too distant to judge accurately, and can only see, with heartfelt satisfaction, that the main result is as it were out of danger.&#x2014; The possibility of seeing you <date when="1834-05-00">next May</date> is more than flattering, but we must not trust in it. We will wait patiently; but if we had you once will not let you go again: there is work for us both here, and one way or other we will find workshops. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ruhig, kr&#xE4;ftig</hi></foreign> [quietly, powerfully]!&#x2014;&#x2014; Mrs Strachey, I imagine, never saw Miss Morris; having gone before your address arrived. I keep the copy of it here, and sometimes think of making Jane write her a Note, or of calling on her myself; but, on the whole, know not whether it were fit, and so do nothing. Her abode must be within few doors of the House where Irving lived; undoubtedly I have passed it often.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340518-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-05-18">18 May</date></ref>.</note>&#x2014; Do you ever bathe in that fine cerulean brine? I think if I were there I would swim about in it all summer. What a pity that your English are such &#x201C;hollow masks full of unclean beetles.&#x201D; They are wedded to their idols; let them <pb id="pg-07-244" n="07-244"/>alone.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201123-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:288</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1820-11-23">23 Nov. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> On the whole perhaps the <foreign>Lazzaroni</foreign> [beggars] are the best: does that worthy man still dive for <foreign><hi rend="italic">frutta di mare</hi></foreign> [sea-food]; and turn up his white heels towards the zenith? <foreign><hi rend="italic">Mein sey es dich zu r&#xfc;hren, Natur</hi></foreign> [Oh were it in my power to move you, nature]! Greater is he who <hi rend="italic">gets</hi> oysters and smallest shellfish than he who only eats and wears (and so <hi rend="italic">loses</hi>), were it millions in the year.</p>
<p>But now for the third head of method, namely London. We are getting along here as we can, without cause of complaint. Our house, and whole household inanimate and rational, continues to yield all contentment. Bessy is a clever, clear-minded girl; lives quietly not only as a servant, but can cheer her mistress as a companion and friend. Most favourable change. Jane keeps in decidedly better health and spirits: within doors I have all manner of scope. Out of doors unhappily the prospect is vague enough; yet I myself am not without fixed aim. The Bookselling world, I seem to see, is all but a hopeless one for me; Periodical Editors will employ me, as they have employed me, on this principle: for the sake of my name, and to help them to season a new enterprise. That once accomplished, they want little more to do with me: amateurs enough exist that will dirty paper <foreign>gratis</foreign>, and Puffery and so forth is expected to do the rest. Thus they kept a <hi rend="italic">gusting-bone</hi> in the Four-towns, and lent it out to give a flavour to weak soup; otherwise hung it in the nook.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A gusting-bone is a flavouring-bone. Carlyle writes in a note found near a letter to him from J. G. Cochrane, <date when="1833-02-27">27 Feb. [1833]</date> (NLS, 1773.214): &#x201C;The meaning of the Flavouring-bone is this: In these regions, the price of fleshmeat being high, and the people poor, such as are addicted to broth, cannot procure it except of the feeblest quality. Wherefore in each village there is purchased from the <supplied>[?]</supplied>-thern parts the remanent loin-bone, of what has once been a BeefHam the edible parts being all consumed: thus whoso has broth to boil borroweth (at a certain small rate per hour <supplied>[)]</supplied> from the E<supplied>[l]</supplied>der of the Village in whose keeping it is, and putteth the same in his Pot, to improve his broth. It is incredible what Flavour hereby is diffused over the whole weak mass.&#x201D; The Four-towns are the four burghs of Dumfriesshire: Dumfries, Lochmaben, Sanquhar, and Annan.</note> I am much dissatisfied with the arrangement, and little minded to continue it. Meanwhile, by Heaven&#x2019;s blessing, I find that I can get a Book printed with my name on it: I have fixed on my Book, and am labouring (<foreign><hi rend="italic">ohne Hast ohne Rast</hi></foreign> [without haste without rest]<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Goethe. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310610-TC-G-01">TC to G, <date when="1831-06-10">10 June 1831</date></ref>.</note>), as yet afar off, to get it ready. Did I not tell you the subject? The French Revolution. I mean to make an artistic <hi rend="italic">Picture</hi> of it: alas, the subject is high and huge, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ich zittre nur, ich stottre nur</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">und</hi> <hi rend="italic">kann es doch nicht</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">lassen</hi></foreign> [I only tremble, I only stammer, and yet I cannot leave it alone]. Mill has lent me about <pb id="pg-07-245" n="07-245"/>a hundred books; I read continually, and perhaps the matter is dimly shaping itself in me. Much is in the <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi> for me too in the shape of books and pamphlets: I was there a week ago seeking Pictures; found <hi rend="italic">none</hi>; but got a sight of Albert D&#xfc;rer,<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Albrecht D&#xfc;rer (<date when="1471-00-00">1471</date>&#x2013;<date when="1528-00-00">1528</date>), German painter and engraver.</note> and (I find) some shadow of his old-<foreign><hi rend="italic">teutschen</hi></foreign> [German], deep still soul, which was well worth the getting. This <hi rend="italic">being</hi> my task till the end of the year, why should I curiously inquire what is to become of me next? &#x201C;There is ay life for a living body,&#x201D; as my Mother&#x2019;s proverb has it: also, as she reminded me: &#x201C;if thou <foreign>tine</foreign> [lose] heart, thou <foreign>tines</foreign>&#x2019; a.&#x201D; I will do my <hi rend="italic">best</hi> and <hi rend="italic">calmest;</hi> then wait, and ask. As yet I find myself much cut off from <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> companions and instructors; my visitors and collocutors are all of the theoretic sort, and worth comparatively little to me; but I shall gradually approach the other sort, and try to profit by them. With able Editors I figure my course as terminated. Fraser cannot afford to pay me; besides seems more and more bent on Toryism, and Irish Reporterism<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to Toryism and Irishness of William Maginn and others such as Francis Sylvester Mahony (&#x201C;Father Prout&#x201D;), Percival Banks, T. C. Croker, and E. V. Kenealy.</note> (to me infinitely detestable): the last <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>is in next N<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and there I calculate we shall <hi rend="italic">stop</hi> finally short. He offers to risk my Book, and shall have it, simply if I cannot get a better. Moxon, I found two weeks ago, had a kind of eye on the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> (which Hayward-Faust had been telling him about); so thinking it might do to send out this as a kind of forerunner and herald to the other, or perhaps might not do, I went to see Moxon:<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Moxon. See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18321119-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1832-11-19">19 Nov. 1832</date></ref>.</note> an eager, ambitious, avaricious not quite dishonest man; inferior to Fraser in quality, superior in environment; he threw no light on the business; wanted to <hi rend="italic">see</hi> my <hi rend="italic">Ms.;</hi> which, when Mill has done with it, he shall. The <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> is a kind of attempted <hi rend="italic">True Fiction</hi>, but not the best I can give; perhaps it will be fitter <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to publish it first. We shall see and decide. Meanwhile, <foreign><hi rend="italic">non flocci facio</hi></foreign> [it is a trifling matter], whichever way it be.&#x2014; With regard to neighbourhood I might say we were very quiet, even solitary, yet not oppressively so. Of visitors that merely <hi rend="italic">call</hi> we have absolutely none; our day is our own; and those that do come are worth something to us. Our most interesting new friend is a Mrs Taylor (thro&#x2019; Mill, who is said to be in love with her,&#x2014;in platonic love, <foreign><hi rend="italic">versteht sich</hi></foreign> [understood]), who came here for the first time yesterday, and staid long: she is a living romance-heroine, of the clearest insight, of the royallest <pb id="pg-07-246" n="07-246"/>volition; very interesting, of questionable destiny, not above twenty-five: Jane is to go and pass a day with her soon (about the Regent&#x2019;s Park), being greatly taken with her. The Austins (whom we find unspeakably <foreign><hi rend="italic">wersh</hi></foreign> [watery, insipid] and wearisome occasionally) are gone to Jersey: the Bullers too are gone, all but Charles whom of late I cannot manage to find at home. Allan Cunningham with his Wife and Daughter made us out last night; we are to dine there some day. Hunt is always at hand, but as the modestest of men <hi rend="italic">never</hi> comes unless sent for: his theory of Life and mine have already declared themselves to be from top to bottom at <hi rend="italic">variance</hi>, which shocks him considerably: to me his talk is occasionally pleasant, is always clever and lively; but all-too <foreign><hi rend="italic">foisonless</hi></foreign> [weak], baseless and shallow. He has a theory that the world is or should and shall be a gingerbread Lubberland, where Evil (that is <hi rend="italic">Pain</hi>) shall never come, a theory in very considerable favour here; which to me is pleasant as streams of <hi rend="italic">un</hi>ambrosial dishwater; a thing I simply <hi rend="italic">shut my mouth</hi> against, as the shortest way. With Hunt<hi rend="italic">dom</hi> we find it quite possible and simple to manage altogether well; and keep nearly wholly <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> of it, except where we can help it which is seldom. I pity Hunt and love him. Irving I have not succeeded in seeing again, tho&#x2019; I went up to Bayswater once and left my card. I rather think his Wife will incline to <hi rend="italic">secrete</hi> him from me, and may even have been capable of suppressing my card: I will try again for his sake and my own. He is said to be better. Mill is on the whole our best figure; yet all-too <hi rend="italic">narrow</hi> in shape, tho&#x2019; of wide susceptibilities, and very fond of us. He hunts me out Books, does <hi rend="italic">all</hi> he can for me; he is busy about the new Radical Review, and doubtless will need me there, at least as &#x201C;gusting-bone.&#x201D; Ought he to get me? Not altogether for the asking perhaps, for I am wearied of that. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Voyons</hi></foreign> [we shall see].&#x2014; Thus dear Brother have you a most full and artless picture of our Existence here. You do not despair of us; your sympathies are blended with hopes for us. You will make out of all this food enough for musing. Muse plentifully about us; to me also you continue precious, with you I am <hi rend="italic">double</hi>-strong. <closer><salute>God be with you dear</salute></closer> Jack! Jane stipulated for a paragraph so I stop <hi rend="italic">here</hi>.</p>

<salute>My dear Sir,&#x2014;</salute>
<p>It is surely the duty of some of us to give special notice at George&#x2019;s Square that Craigenputtoch is desolate, and London sending up the smoke of a new hearth: no doubt, you know it already, but one so well-disposed towards us should know it from ourselves. Nevertheless, my wife, I perceive, is too lazy, so I take the duty in my own hand.</p>
<p>If you remember Battersea Bridge, and Don Saltero&#x2019;s Coffeehouse (celebrated in the <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi>),<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> with the ancient row of red-brick mansions clad with ivy and jasmine, shaded by high old lime-trees, along the bank of the River, you have Cheyne <hi rend="italic">Walk</hi>, and are within a cat&#x2019;s-leap <pb id="pg-07-249" n="07-249"/>of Cheyne <hi rend="italic">Row</hi> (at right-angles to the <hi rend="italic">Walk</hi>, and otherwise a miniature copy of it), where in my new workshop, still and clear almost as the Craigenputtoch one, I now write to you. We like our old House extremely; have got it all set in order, out even to the little garden and the vine and walnut-tree; have a servant of the best quality, and shall begin by and by to feel once more at home. We have both fair health too; Jane especially is much better than before: the change, so needful under every point of view, is happily <hi rend="italic">effected</hi>, turn out how it may.</p>
<p>As for Literature and Book-publishing, the more I look at it hitherto, the more confused it looks. Alas, of quite bottomless confusion! Meanwhile, it would seem, Booksellers can actually print Books now, the Author writing them <foreign>gratis</foreign>; which is a great improvement compared with former experiences of mine. Not seeking to decipher farther, what is indeed undecipherable, chaotic, fearful, hateful as a madman&#x2019;s dream, I stand by this so comfortable fact; and am actually busy, at all lawful hours, getting ready a new Book; of which (if I be spared alive some months) I hope to show you a copy, and ask your favourable judgement. It is about the French Revolution (but this is a <hi rend="italic">secret</hi>), and requires immense preparation. What is to follow after that, will follow.</p>
<p>There is nothing passing here but changes of Ministry and other such daily occurrences; of which the less one speaks it is perhaps the more charitable. Poor Coleridge, as you may have seen, died on Friday last:<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><date when="1834-07-25">25 July</date>.</note> he had been sick and decaying for years; was well waited on, and one may hope prepared to die. Carriages in long files, as I hear, were rushing all round Highgate when the old man lay near to die. Foolish carriages! Not one of them would roll near him (except to splash him with their mud) while he lived; had it not been for the noble-mindedness of Gilman<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Gillman, in whose house at Highgate Coleridge had lived, <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date>&#x2013;<date when="1834-00-00">34</date>.</note> the Highgate Apothecary, he might have died twenty years ago in a hospital or in a ditch. To complete the Farce-Tragedy, they have only to bury him in Westminster-Abbey.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Coleridge was buried in a vault located on the site of the old chapel of the Free Grammar School at Highgate. Among those present at the funeral on <date when="1834-08-02">2 August</date> was John Sterling, who came from Cambridge for the purpose. In <date when="1961-00-00">1961</date> he was re-interred in St. Michael&#x2019;s Church. For full details concerning Coleridge&#x2019;s death and burial, see E. I. Griggs, <hi rend="italic">Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge</hi> (Oxford, <date when="1956-00-00">1956</date>&#x2013;<date when="1971-00-00">71</date>), VI, 991&#x2013;97.</note></p>
<p>There is now no other Author here of a better than perfectly commonplace character; too many, one grieves to say, are of a worse, <pb id="pg-07-250" n="07-250"/>of a dishonest and even palpably blackguard character. &#x201C;My soul come not into <hi rend="italic">their</hi> secrets, mine honour be not united to <hi rend="italic">them!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gen. 49:6.</note></p>
<p>We have also seen several &#x201C;celebrated women&#x201D; of the literary sort; but felt small longing to see more of them. The world indeed is wide enough for all, and each can and shall wish heartily well to all, and faithfully act accordingly:&#x2014;meanwhile, if poor Mrs. Featherbrain Irrational All-for-glory and Company are walking in the western quarter, we shall do it all the better by keeping ourselves in the eastern.&#x2014; But, in fine, there is a fraction of worth and wisdom here in London such as I have found nowhere else: let us use this, enjoy it, and be right thankful for it.</p>
<p>I get hardly any news from Edinburgh, well as I love and shall always love that old stone Town. It is hard, but clear and strong, in spirit as in outward form; built on rocks, looking out upon the everlasting sea. May it flourish, and &#x2026;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Ritchie says that &#x201C;a &#x2018;fold&#x2019; of the paper has been lost.&#x201D;</note> gain dominion over it!</p>
<p>You, my dear Sir, I am afraid, hardly write. &#x2026; Bess<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Eliza Stodart, Bradfute&#x2019;s niece.</note> drives a most lively pen, and never sent us a Letter that <supplied>[was a dud;]</supplied> tell her this (a genuine <hi rend="italic">fact</hi>), and bid her write whether my lazy <supplied>[wife writes or not.]</supplied> Mrs. Welsh sends us intelligence that you are both as well as <supplied>[usual,]</supplied> cheerfully enjoying your summer there; and for one day at least I <supplied>[could desire]</supplied><note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >All the words in the four pairs of square brackets are conjectural.</note> us in the midst of your flowers. As for me, are not, in these very days, &#x201C;two cigars&#x201D; (of your giving) constantly in my coat-pocket, when I go out; how should I forget you?</p>
<p>Will you remember me very kindly to my good Mr. Aitken;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Samuel Aitken, Bradfute&#x2019;s business partner.</note> for whom I think I shall have a commission again by and by? And so all happiness and peacefulness be with you and those dear to you!</p>

But having let you into the secret I need not play it off upon you this time, only I let you see what I might do if I liked&#x2014;and I give you instead of a useless apology a useful hint which you may find your account in against enraged correspondents&#x2014;</p>

    <p>We have got an excellent lodgement; of most antique physiognomy, quite to our humour; all wainscoated carved and queer-looking; roomy substantial, commodious, with closets to satisfy any Bluebeard, a chinacloset in particular that would hold our whole wor<supplied>[l]</supplied>dly substance <pb id="pg-07-252" n="07-252" />converted into china!

This comes of our noble contempt for fashion&#x2014;Chelsea being highly unfashionable. The only practical disadvantage in this circumstance is that we are far from most of our acquaintance; a disadvantage which I endeavour to obviate by learning to walk; my success is already considerable I have several times walked ten miles without being laid up.

<salute>My Dear Friend,</salute>
<p>It is a shame to send you this miserable scrap of Paper, after all my good purposes: but the Frank, already burdened with a Naples letter, will hold no more. It is better to accomplish never so little than to resolve on never so much: &#x201C;Hell,&#x201D; they say truly, &#x201C;is paved with good resolutions.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330316-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1833-03-16">16 March 1833</date></ref>.</note> Now, as often heretofore, you must take the will for the deed.</p>
<p>All the circumstances of our settlement and position here I suppose you to have learned from my Mother and Brothers: if not, question them and they will speak. We are got to a kind of calmness at length; I can begin to ask myself seriously: What then canst thou <hi rend="italic">do?</hi> In the name of Heaven, bestir thyself and do it. Literature continues in the same mad state it has long been in; nevertheless even this mad state is the one allotted to us; <hi rend="italic">now</hi> is the time, or else never: other alternative is none at all. I have as good as bargained with a Bookseller to have a volume ready in Spring; I am to call it &#x201C;French Revolution,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-07-255" n="07-255"/>and put my name to it. Pray that I may quit me like a true Scottish man, in this matter; for it is really important to me. I am already busy enough with it, for the labour is great. Such is my task; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> else, as far as may be, I suffer to run by me, like the jingle of those chariot-wheels, which are to roll on without cooperation of mine; independent of me, as I of them. A singular rhapsody written long ago at Craigenputtock<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle usually spells the word with an <hi rend="italic">h</hi> after <date when="1828-00-00">1828</date>, but since the MS is inaccessible the available texts are being followed here.</note> has at length worked itself out piecemeal thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine:</hi> I hope to send it you stitched together and legible some six weeks hence: make of it what you can; at lowest, a friendly remembrance.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>, published in eight numbers of <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> from <date when="1833-11-00">Nov. 1833</date> to <date when="1834-08-00">Aug. 1834</date>, brought Carlyle &#xa3;82.1s. In addition Fraser gave him 58 copies made by binding pages from the magazine together, numbering them consecutively, and providing them with a new title-page. See Dyer, pp. 220&#x2013;21.</note></p>

Very sweet it is, out of this never-resting din, where the very country is a town, to think of your Burnswark home; of your emerald hillside, overspanned by azure skies, with its outlook of mountains and shining ocean-mirrors, with silence, and the visitation of the breezes! Alas, I know well, there too has labour and vexation of spirit found footing: &#x201C;Black care,&#x201D; as the old Roman says, &#x201C;leaps up behind the horseman,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Horace, <hi rend="italic">Odes</hi>, III, 40.</note> pursues the flying mast; you cannot ride from it or sail from it; <hi rend="italic">there</hi> where it is and you are, you must meet it and do battle with it. Sharp, then! strike, and spare not! Let your voices too encourage one another.</p>
<p>I saw our worthy Edward twice, a good while ago; not since, tho&#x2019; I have tried it, and it was his part to come and see me. They seem to have a kind of synagogue in Newman Street, and are a &#x201C;self-contained house&#x201D; in many senses. What is to become of it? one asks; but cannot answer. If Irving live, he will, as I still keep prophecying, kick it to the Devil (who is mostly the father of it), and, in new shape be himself again one day. But, alas, his life, so agitated and beaten on, is no sure possession; and that deepest tragedy too is among his possibilities, to sink choked into utter Darkness amid clouds of basest stupidity! God avert it. I often think I might do something for him, were we in free intercourse; but the &#x201C;four-and-twenty elders&#x201D; will it not, and must have their way.</p>
<p>My Paper is done, in spite of smallest writing. Take the will for the <pb id="pg-07-256" n="07-256"/>deed!

True is that word. Think of it, and act!&#x2014; John says he wrote to you: did you receive? He continues well; has some hope to be back in <date when="1835-05-00">May</date>.</p>
<p>The lady <hi rend="italic">straitly charges</hi> me to send her &#x201C;best regards&#x201D;: she is well.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Tho&#x2019; I have written twice to Scotland without any answer, and indeed have great reason to lament the want of epistolary diligence among my loved ones there, yet this third long Letter shall go off as cheerfully as if nothing had happened. Nay were I inclined to resent that really grievous silence of my Friends, it surely were not on you, dear Mother, that I could take amends for it: your blame it is not, I know full well; were the hand with you as ready as the heart I should have nothing to complain of. Meanwhile let me again entreat you, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> yourself, to take the Pen, and <hi rend="italic">do as you can:</hi> a <hi rend="italic">single line</hi> to assure me that you are well would be abundantly precious sometimes. Alas, it is now full three months (and looks almost three years, so much has intervened) since I left you, and in all that time, except one Letter from Jean, no &#x201C;scrape of a pen&#x201D; has darkened paper for me! Let any one of my lazy Correspondents ask himself how <hi rend="italic">he</hi> would feel in the like circumstance. The week before last no Newspaper, I <pb id="pg-07-257" n="07-257"/>mean no <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, came from Dumfries; and my apprehensions about Jean, and what she has to look for, gave rise to endless painful conjectures. It was not till a fresh Paper arrived, and I called to mind how a prior once had come to hand wrapped <hi rend="italic">in string</hi> (the wax having given way), that I got to any quiet solution of the mystery: I fancy now that <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> was wrong, except the sealing-wax in too cold a state, or too sparingly applied, and so the cover had utterly started, and the News remained as waste paper! Tell Jean or James of this, and how to avoid it: two wafers (if they have time to let the Paper lie an hour) will hold it as firmly as anything. And so here, hoping that all is better than I have any evidence of its being, I will conclude my murmuring. Alick&#x2019;s Letter I have been expecting daily for weeks. Tell him that I know his hurry in this season, and that his pens are not always in order; that I continue expecting with patience still, but that a willing patience should be <hi rend="italic">handsomely</hi> used.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick had begun a letter on <date when="1834-07-27">27 July</date> but after writing a little over a page had laid it aside and had not finished it until <date when="1834-08-03">3 Aug.</date> He had been terribly busy with farmwork complicated by floods. He gave full and reassuring news about various members of the family. He had seen his mother recently, and she was still faring well at Scotsbrig. James Carlyle&#x2019;s wife, he said, seemed to be &#x201C;an honest reasonable country-looking woman.&#x201D; James Austin, Mary&#x2019;s husband, was making a living by carrying goods to and from the steamboats at Annan.</note></p>
<p>This new Letter of Jack&#x2019;s came some few days ago, and as franks are still going, the Parliament not being over yet, I make speed to send it you. Rejoice over it, my dear Mother; it is one other of the mercies we have to be thankful for. Our good Doil is in health and fair prosperity; health of body and of mind. There is even a prospect that we shall see him sooner than we expected. I wish much he were home and fixed, for I think he has a capacity in him for doing well in his calling: meanwhile we must not get impatient, but feel glad at the progress he can already make. Without money there was no outlook for him; and most opportune it was that he attained this method of acquiring that outfit. He seems very serious always, yet not unhappy, not unoccupied; and I confess, seriousness, in a world so serious (with an Eternity all round it), seems to me an indispensable quality for a man. Cheerfulness will follow when it ought; and these good Thoughts he is continually uttering will sink down to the roots of his mind, and working blessedly there will less need special utterance. I like my good Jack well, and feel the world much more a home to me on his account.</p>
<p>Life here in Cheyne Row goes on in the steadiest manner; nothing to glory in; much to be glad of, and humbly thankful for. Our House <pb id="pg-07-258" n="07-258"/>is all settled and swept long ago, and proceeding at a fixed rate, our accounts all paid off; so we know in some measure what we have to look for. Living is really not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> much dearer than at Puttoch; one has a less plenteous supply in some things; but on the whole what it amounts to &#x201C;ultimately&#x201D; is no such grand matter, &#x201C;after all.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >An echo of one of John Carlyle&#x2019;s phrases. A document preserved in the Hornel Collection, Broughton House, shows that on <date when="1834-06-23">23 June</date> Carlyle was able to sign a draft for &#xa3;270.1.10.</note> We calculated that we could live here everything included for &#xa3;200, and seem as if we could for less. At all events there will be no more &#x201C;fifteen pounds for fodder,&#x201D; or other provoking items of that sort to pay; but for one&#x2019;s money there will be real <hi rend="italic">ware</hi> [stuff] of some kind. In all other respects, as you at once judge, I am much better off, and feel habitually that here or nowhere is the place for me.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly an echo from <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship: &#x201C;Here or nowhere is America!&#x201D;</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIV, 11).</note> Old Annandale itself seems lovelier than it ever did: often in the still sunset, when I am alone, it comes before me with its green <foreign><hi rend="italic">knowes</hi></foreign> [small hills] and clear-rushing <foreign><hi rend="italic">burns</hi></foreign>, and all the loved ones that I have there, above the ground and below it; and I feel a sweet unsullied affection for it all, and a holy faith that God is there as here, and in His merciful hand is the life and lot of every one of us for Eternity as for Time. Unspeakably wearisome, in such seasons, were the light cackle of the wordly-minded: but indeed I am not much troubled with that. Once for all one should &#x201C;set his face like a flint&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Isa. 50:7.</note> against the idolatries of men; and determine that <hi rend="italic">his</hi> little section of Existence shall not be a mad empty Dream, but as far as possible a Reality.</p>
<p>I have not written anything whatever for Reviews or Magazines since we came hither; and am not likely to write. In fact, it is rather my feeling that I should abandon that whole despicable business, and seek diligently out for some freer field to labour in. Nothing can exceed the hollow frothiness and even dishonest blackguardism of Literature generally at present: but what then? This is even the very thing thou art sent to <hi rend="italic">amend!</hi> Mill&#x2019;s Review is to go on, about Newyearsday next; there, it is possible, I may contribute something: but there too I wait till I see farther before taking any very <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> hold. My former Book, that came out thro&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, is happily at last all printed within these last days: I hope to send you, and some others of them, a full Copy of it about the beginning of next month by the Dumfries Bookseller. You will have leisure to peruse and consider it; and finding <pb id="pg-07-259" n="07-259"/>it very <hi rend="italic">queer</hi>, may not find it altogether empty and false. It has met with next to no recognition that I hear of in these parts; a circumstance not to be surprised at, not to be wept over. On the other hand, my American Friend (you remember hearing of him at Puttoch) sends me a week ago the most cheering Letter of thanks for it (with two <foreign><hi rend="italic">bra&#x2019;</hi></foreign> [fine] American Books, as a present), and bids me go on in God&#x2019;s name, for in remotest nooks, in distant ends of the Earth, men <hi rend="italic">are</hi> listening to me and loving me.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had sent Carlyle &#x201C;a volume&#x201D; of Daniel Webster (<date when="1782-00-00">1782</date>&#x2013;<date when="1852-00-00">1852</date>) containing his &#x201C;Second Speech on Foote&#x2019;s Resolution&#x201D; (<date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>), later known as the &#x201C;Reply to Hayne&#x201D;; and Sampson Reed (<date when="1800-00-00">1800</date>&#x2013;<date when="1880-00-00">80</date>), <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Growth of the Mind</hi> (Boston, <date when="1826-00-00">1826</date>). Reed was an influential American Swedenborgian.</note> This Letter which did me a real benefit, and will give you (the Philosopher&#x2019;s Mother) great pleasure, shall be sent to you: I would send it today, but that I fear the frank will be already too heavy. The vain clatter of fools, either for or against, is worth <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, for indeed it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> simply nothing: but the hearty response of earnest men, of one earnest man, is very precious.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written in his letter to Carlyle of <date when="1834-05-14">14 May</date>: &#x201C;In Liverpool I wrote to Mr Fraser to send me his Magazine &#x26; I have now received four numbers of the Sartor Resartus for whose light, thanks evermore. I am glad that one living scholar is self-centred &#x26; will be true to himself though none ever were before; who, as Montaigne says, &#x2018;puts his ear close by himself, &#x26; holds his breath, &#x26; listens&#x2019; And none can be offended with the self subsistency of one so catholic &#x26; jocund. And &#x2019;tis good to have a new eye inspect our mouldy social forms, our politics, &#x26; schools, &#x26; religion. I say <hi rend="italic">our</hi>, for it cannot have escaped you that a lecture upon these topics written for England may be read to America. Evermore thanks for the brave stand you have made for Spiritualism in these writings.&#x201D; He then added some words of criticism concerning the form and style of Carlyle&#x2019;s book. See Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, p. 98.</note> Meanwhile I employ all my days in getting ready for the new Book (on the French Revolution), and think, if I am spared with health, there is likelihood that it will be in print, with my name to it, early in spring. I will do my very best and truest; give me your prayers and hopes! This task of mine takes labour enough: I am up once or twice weekly at the British Museum for Books about it; these are almost my only occasions of visiting that fiercely tumultuous region of the City, which is at least four miles from me. I walk slowly up the shady side of the streets; and come slowly down again, about four o&#x2019;clock, often smoking a cigar, and feeling more or less independent of all men.</p>
<p>Several of our friends (the Bullers for instance) are gone out of town. We have made, at least Jane has made, a most promising new acquaintance, of a Mrs Taylor; a young beautiful reader of mine and &#x201C;dearest friend&#x201D; of Mill&#x2019;s, who for the present seems &#x201C;all that is noble&#x201D; <pb id="pg-07-260" n="07-260"/>and what not. We shall see how that wears. We are to dine there on Tuesday, and meet a new set of persons, said, among other qualities, to be interested in <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.

Yesterday I called on Irving; could not find him; was informed that he was again very ill, and at Bayswater which is nearer us: I mean to try there once more, ere long. Not a word is ever spoken of him, in any circle where I am. Allan Cunningham had us to dinner lately; a very <hi rend="italic">dirty</hi> creature (defaced with whisky <hi rend="italic">sparables</hi>, and what goes with these), one Dr Hislop,<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Presumably Dr. William Hislop, from Sanquhar, who had matriculated at Glasgow University in <date when="1806-00-00">1806</date>. Sparables are small, wedge-shaped, headless nails, probably indicating growths or pimples here.</note> from Dumfries originally, was the only disagreeable, the only notable thing there. Hunt, nor the Hunts, does not trouble us more than we wish: he comes in when we send for him; talks, listens to a little music, even sings and plays a little, <hi rend="italic">eats</hi> (without <hi rend="italic">kitchen</hi> [condiment] of any kind, or only with a little sugar) has [his] allotted plate of Porridge, and then goes his ways. His way of thought and mine are utterly at variance; a thing which grieves him much, not me. He accounts for it by my &#x201C;Presbyterian upbringing,&#x201D; which I tell him always I am everlastingly grateful for. He talks forever about &#x201C;happiness,&#x201D; and seems to me the very miserablest man I ever sat and talked with. Poor fellow! And one can do nothing for him, except <hi rend="italic">letting</hi> him eat his plate of porridge, and sit and talk there. He has a whole <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;scrow&#x201D;</hi></foreign> [swarm] of children, all coming up, without the slightest nurture, like wild asses&#x2019; colts; some of them one can see little outlook for except the Hulks or Treadmill; and yet <hi rend="italic">he</hi> talks about &#x201C;the world&#x201D; getting wiser, and one day all-wise! &#x201C;Bray a <hi rend="italic">fool</hi> in a mortar&#x201D;:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf.

<p>O my dear Mother, how gladly would I know as much of you! I often try to picture you out in your new Scotsbrig arrangements; but, except Jean&#x2019;s Letter, have not the smallest light for it. A slight hint informed me that you were at Dumfries lately, and I sent two Newspapers <pb id="pg-07-261" n="07-261"/>thither; but the last straight to Ecclefechan. Are you healthy? Are you in any measure comfortable? Complain to me if anything is wrong; even here I may do something to help it, at all events I will sympathize with it, as I well may. Have you been to sea-bathing? Now is the right season for it. Tell Mary, she should write to us: give her and her little thrifty household our kindest blessings.&#x2014; Alas! I am got upon the cover, and must not here start new topics! <hi rend="italic">Insist</hi> upon Alick&#x2019;s writing to me; in any case, write yourself. Tell me about Jean, whom the lost Newspaper frightened me for.

It is in vain, I suppose, to ask Maister Cairlill for a Letter; otherwise I were very glad of one. Does our new Sister not write? Suppose you make her your <hi rend="italic">clerk</hi>, and so sit independent of them! There is no other but yourself to be depended for punctuality.</p>

<p>Coleridge, a very noted Literary man here, of whom you may have heard me speak, died about a week ago, at the age of 62. An Apothecary had supported him for many years: his wife and children shifted elsewhere as they could. He could earn no money, could set himself steadfastly to no painful task; took to opium and poetic and philosophic dreaming. A better faculty has not been often worse wasted. Yet withal he was a devout man, and did something, both by writing and speech. Among the London Literaries he has not left his like or second. Peace be with him!</p>
<p>Here then is the end dear Mother!

In the correspondence between Alexander Ireland and Moncure D.

There is a very striking remark in his letter to me about Carlyle&#x2019;s religious views, which is not to be found in his printed account of the interview.&#x201D; Ireland refers here to the following passage in Emerson&#x2019;s letter to him of <date when="1833-08-30">30 August 1833</date> (MS: Mrs. Ward I.

He had heard of my purpose from his friend [Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal] who gave me my letter &#x26; insisted on dismissing my gig which went back to Dumfries to return for me the next day in time to secure my seat in the evening coach for the south. So I spent near 24 hours with him. He lives with his wife, a most agreeable accomplished woman, in perfect solitude There is not a person to speak to within 7 miles. He is the most simple frank amiable person&#x2014;I became acquainted with him at once, we walked over several miles of hills &#x26; talked upon all the great questions that interest us most. The comfort of meeting a man of genius is that he speaks sincerely that he feels himself to be so rich that he is above the meanness of pretending to knowledge which he h<supplied>[as]</supplied> not &#x26; Carlyle does not pretend to have solved the great problems but rather to be an observer of their solution as it goes forward in the world. I asked him at what religious development the concluding passage in his piece in the Edin.

But I cannot think of sketching even his opinions or repeating his conversation here. I will cheerfully do it when you visit me in America. He talks finely, seems to love the broad Scotch, &#x26; I loved him very much, at once. I am afraid he finds his entire solitude tedious, but I could not help congratulating him upon his treasure in his wife &#x26; I hope they will not leave the moors. tis so much better for a man of letters to nurse himself in seclusion than to be filed down to the common level by the compliances &#x26; imitations of city society.&#x201D; Emerson gave still another account of his first visit to Carlyle in his <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi>, III, 180&#x2013;82.</sourceNote><head>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Some two weeks ago I received your kind gift from Fraser.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The books by Webster and Reed: see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340805-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1834-08-05">5 Aug.</date></ref></note> To say that it was welcome would be saying little: is it not as a voice of affectionate remembrance, coming from beyond the Ocean waters, first decisively announcing for me that a whole New Continent <hi rend="italic">exists</hi>, <pb id="pg-07-263" n="07-263"/>that I too have part and lot there! &#x201C;Not till we can think that here and there one is thinking of us, one is loving us, does this waste Earth become a peopled Garden.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Identified by Slater as a free translation from Goethe. Carlyle&#x2019;s translation <hi rend="italic">William Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship, Works</hi>, XXIV, 23&#x2013;24.</note> Among the figures I can recollect as visiting our Nithsdale Hermitage, all like <hi rend="italic">Apparitions</hi> now, bringing with them airs from Heaven or else blasts from the other region, there is perhaps not one of a more undoubtedly <hi rend="italic">supernal</hi> character than yourself: so pure and still, with intents so charitable; and then vanishing too so soon into the azure Inane, as an Apparition should! Never has your Address in my Notebook met my eye but with a friendly influence. Judge if I am glad to know that there, in Infinite Space, you still hold by me.</p>
<p>I have read in both your Books, at leisure times; and now nearly finished the smaller one. He is a faithful thinker that Swedenborgian Druggist of yours, with really deep ideas, who makes me too pause and think, were it only to consider what manner of man <hi rend="italic">he</hi> must be, and what manner of thing, after all, Swedenborgianism must be.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Reed was a Harvard graduate (<date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>) who continued his studies in the Divinity School until converted to Swedenborgianism. He served in a druggist&#x2019;s store, but then had a store of his own and a large wholesale business.</note> &#x201C;Thro&#x2019; the smallest window, look well and you can look out into the Infinite.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 72.</note> Webster also I can recognise: a sufficient, effectual man; whom one must wish well to, and prophecy well of. The sound of him is nowise poetic-rhythmic; it is clear, one-toned, you might say metallic, yet distinct, significant not without melody. In his face above all I discern that &#x201C;indignation,&#x201D; which if it do not make &#x201C;verses,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Juvenal, <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi>, I, 79; <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240202-JBW-TC-01"><sic>3:26</sic><corr>JBW to TC, <date when="1824-02-02">2 Feb. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> makes <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> way in the world&#x2014;the higher such a man rises the better pleased I shall be. And so here, looking over the water, let me repeat once more what I believe is already dimly the sentiment of all Englishmen, Cisoceanic and Transoceanic, that we and you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> two countries, <pb id="pg-07-264" n="07-264"/>and cannot for the life of us be; but only two <hi rend="italic">parishes</hi> of one country, with such wholesome parish hospitalities, and dirty temporary parish feuds, as we see; both of which brave parishes <foreign><hi rend="italic">vivant! vivant!</hi></foreign> [let them live on!] And among the glories of <hi rend="italic">both</hi> be Yankee-doodle-doo, and the Felling of the Western Forest, proudly remembered; and for the rest, by way of parish-constable, let each cheerfully take such George Washington or George Guelph<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The Hanover kings were descended from the Guelphs.</note> as it can get, and bless Heaven! I am weary of hearing it said, &#x201C;we love the Americans,&#x201D; &#x201C;we wish well&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c: what in God&#x2019;s name should we do else?</p>
<p>You thank me for <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh:</hi> how much more ought I to thank you for your hearty, genuine tho&#x2019; extravagant acknowledgement of it! Blessed is the voice that amid dispiritment stupidity and contradiction proclaims to us: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [well done]! Nothing ever was more ungenial than the soil that poor Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckhish seedcorn has been thrown on here; none cries, Good speed to it; the sorriest nettle or hemlock seed, one would think, had been more welcome. For indeed our British periodical critics, and especially the public of Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine (which I believe I have now done with) exceed all speech; require not even contempt, only oblivion. Poor Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh! Creature of mischance, miscalculation, and thousandfold obstruction! Here nevertheless he is, as you see; has struggled across the Stygian marshes, and now, as a stitched Pamphlet &#x201C;for Friends,&#x201D; cannot be <hi rend="italic">burnt</hi>, or lost&#x2014;before his time. I send you one copy for your own behoof; three others you yourself can perhaps find fit readers for: as you spoke in the plural number, I thought there might be three; more would rather surprise me. From the British side of the water, I have met simply <hi rend="italic">one</hi> intelligent response; clear, true, tho&#x2019; almost enthusiastic as your own: my British Friend too is utterly a stranger, whose very name I know not, who did not print, but only write and to an <hi rend="italic">unknown</hi> third party. Shall I say then: &#x201C;In the mouth of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> witnesses&#x201D;?<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Matt. 18:16. The admirer of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> on the British side of the sea was an Irish priest, Father O&#x2019;Shea, whom Carlyle met at Cork on <date when="1849-07-16">16 July 1849</date>. Carlyle tells of the experience in his <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences of My Irish Journey in <date when="1849-00-00">1849</date></hi> (London, <date when="1882-00-00">1882</date>), pp. 116&#x2013;17: &#x201C;Rain slightly beginning now, I return [to his hotel]; take to writing: near 11 o&#x2019;clock,&#x2014;announces himself &#x2018;Father O&#x2019;Shea!&#x2019; (who I thought had been <hi rend="italic">dead;</hi>) to my astonishment enter a little greyhaired, intelligent-and-bred looking man, with much gesticulation, boundless loyal welcome, <hi rend="italic">red</hi> with dinner and some wine, engages that we are to meet to-morrow,&#x2014;and again with explosion of welcomes, goes his way. This Father O&#x2019;Shea, some 15 years ago, had been, with Emerson of America, one of the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> sons of Adam who encouraged poor bookseller Fraser, and didn&#x2019;t discourage him, to go <hi rend="italic">on</hi> with &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>.&#x2019; I had often remembered him since; had not long before <hi rend="italic">re</hi>-enquired his name, but understood somehow that he was dead;&#x2014;and now!&#x201D; Carlyle also gives an account of this meeting with O&#x2019;Shea and the one on the following day in letters written from Ireland at the time.</note> In any case, <pb id="pg-07-265" n="07-265"/>God be thanked, I am done with it; can wash my hands of it, and send it forth; sure that the Devil will get his full share of it, and not a whit <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, clutch as he may. But as for you, my Transoceanic Brothers, read this earnestly, for it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> earnestly meant and written, and contains no <hi rend="italic">voluntary</hi> falsehood of mine. For the rest if you dislike it, say that I wrote it four years ago, and could not now so write it, and on the whole (as Fritz the Only<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Frederick the Great. Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, p. 82; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XVI, 49.</note> said) &#x201C;will do better another time.&#x201D;&#x2014;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230218-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:288</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-02-18">18 Feb. 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> With regard to style and so forth, what you call your &#x201C;saucy&#x201D; objections are not only most intelligible to me, but welcome and instructive.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had written: &#x201C;If any word in my letter should provoke you to a reply I shall rejoice in my sauciness.&#x201D;</note> You say well that I take up that attitude because I have no known public, am <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> under the Heavens, speaking into friendly or unfriendly Space; add only that I will not defend such attitude, that I call it questionable, tentative, and only the best that I in these mad times could conveniently hit upon. For you are to know, my view is that now at last we have lived to see all manner of Poeties and Rhetorics and Sermonics, and one may say generally all manner of <hi rend="italic">Pulpits</hi> for addressing mankind from, as good as broken and abolished: alas, yes; if you have any earnest meaning, which demands to be not only listened to, but <hi rend="italic">believed</hi> and <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, you cannot (at least I cannot) utter it <hi rend="italic">there</hi>, but the sound sticks in my throat, as when a Solemnity were <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> to have become a Mummery; and so one leaves the pasteboard coulisses, and three Unities, and Blair<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s Lectures,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Hugh Blair, <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</hi> (London, <date when="1783-00-00">1783</date>), which Carlyle knew well.</note> quite behind; and feels only that there is <hi rend="italic">nothing sacred</hi>, then, but the <hi rend="italic">Speech of Man</hi> to believing Men! <hi rend="italic">This</hi>, come what will, was, is and forever must be <hi rend="italic">sacred;</hi> and will one day doubtless anew environ itself with fit Modes, with Solemnities that are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> Mummeries. Meanwhile, however, is it not pitiable? For tho&#x2019; Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh exclaims: &#x201C;Pulpit! Canst thou not <hi rend="italic">make</hi> a pulpit, by simply <hi rend="italic">inverting the nearest tub</hi>&#x201D;;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Harrold, <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi>, pp. 211&#x2013;12; Slater, <hi rend="italic">CEC</hi>, p. 104n.</note> yet alas he does not sufficiently reflect that it is still only a <hi rend="italic">tub</hi>, that the most inspired utterance will come from <hi rend="italic">it</hi>, inconceivable, misconceivable to the million; questionable (not of <hi rend="italic">ascertained</hi> significance) even to the few. Pity us therefore; and with your just shake of the <pb id="pg-07-266" n="07-266"/>head join a sympathetic even a hopeful smile. Since I saw you, I have been trying, am still trying, other methods, and shall surely get nearer the truth, as I honestly strive for it. Meanwhile I know no method of much consequence, except that of <hi rend="italic">believing</hi>, of being <hi rend="italic">sincere:</hi> from <hi rend="italic">Homer</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Bible</hi> down to the poorest Burns&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Song</hi> I find no other <hi rend="italic">Art</hi> that promises to be perennial.</p>
<p>But now quitting theoretics, let me explain, what you long to know, how it is that I date from London. Yes, my friend, it is even so: Craigenputtoch now stands solitary in the wilderness, with none but an old woman<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Old Nannie&#x201D; Macqueen.</note> and foolish grouse-destroyers in it; and we for the last ten weeks, after a fierce universal disruption, are here with our household-gods. Censure not; I came to London for the best of all reasons: To seek bread and work. So it literally stands; and so do I literally stand with the hugest gloomiest Future before me, which in all sane moments I goodhumouredly defy. A strange element this; and I as good as an Alien in it. I care not for Radicalism, for Toryism, for Church, Tithes or the &#x201C;Confusion&#x201D; of useful knowledge:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, founded <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>.</note> much as I can speak and hear, I am alone, alone. My brave Father, now victorious from his toil, was wont to pray in evening worship: &#x201C;Might we say, We are not alone, for God is with us!&#x201D; Amen! Amen!</p>
<p>I brought a <hi rend="italic">Ms.</hi> with me of another curious sort; entitled the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace:</hi> perhaps it will be printed soon, as an Article or even as a separate Booklet; a <hi rend="italic">queer</hi> production, which you shall see. Finally I am busy constantly studying with my whole might for a Book on the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>. It is part of my creed that the only Poetry is History, could we tell it right. This truth (if it prove one) I have not yet got to the limitations of; and shall in no way except by <hi rend="italic">trying</hi> it in practice. The story of the Necklace was the first attempt at an experiment.</p>
<p>My sheet is nearly done; and I have still to complain of you for telling me nothing of yourself except that you are in the Country. Believe that I want to know much and all. My Wife too remembers you with unmixed friendliness; bids me send you her kindest wishes. Understand too that your old Bed stands in a new room here, and the old welcome at the door. Surely we shall see you in London one day. Or who knows but Mahomet may go to the Mountain? It occasionally rises like a mad prophetic dream in me that I might end in the Western Woods!</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-267" n="07-267"/>From Germany I get Letters, Messages and even visits; but now no tidings, no influences, of moment. Goethe&#x2019;s Posthumous Works are all published; and Radicalism (poor hungry, yet inevitable Radicalism!) is the order of the day. The like, and even more, from France<supplied>[.]</supplied> Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal (did you hear?) has gone over to Greece, and become some kind of Manager under King Otho.<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Emerson had met Gustave d&#x2019;Eichthal in Rome on his journey to England and had been given introductory letters to Mill and Carlyle. After the dissolution of the Saint-Simonian order, d&#x2019;Eichthal went to Greece to be head of the Bureau of Political Economy, a kind of ministry of public works. Otto I (Otto Friedrich Ludwig [<date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>]), king of Greece, <date when="1832-00-00">1832</date>&#x2013;<date when="1862-00-00">62</date>.</note></p>
<p>Continue to love me, you and my other friends; and as Packets sail so swiftly let me know it frequently. All good be with you!</p>
<closer><salute>Most faithfully, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>Coleridge, as you doubtless hear, is gone. How great a Possibility, how small a realized Result! They are delivering Orations about him, and emitting other kinds of Froth, <foreign><hi rend="italic">ut mos est</hi></foreign> [as is customary]. What hurt can it do?</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>How long it is since I wrote last is not accurately in my memory; I know only that your last Letter<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Naples, <date when="1834-07-11">11 July</date>. &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Seelen-bekenntnisse</hi></foreign>&#x201D; below perhaps alludes to Mignon&#x2019;s &#x201C;Confessions of a Fair Saint&#x201D; in <hi rend="italic">Wilhelm Meister&#x2019;s Apprenticeship</hi>.</note> has been in my hands, and indeed in my Mother&#x2019;s (to whom it was forthwith sent) above a fortnight; and that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> last, which was all that remained due when you wrote, must be fairly digested by this time; so that now, on a day of leisure, another may be fitly despatched. The news of your welfare, your <foreign><hi rend="italic">Seelen-bekenntnisse</hi></foreign> [confessions of the soul], your trustful brotherly affection: all this is ever one of the most solacing items of my lot. To address you in return and impart my satisfactions and anxieties, with the assurance of having them heartily sympathized in, is also one of my agreeablest employments. Would you were here again! But <date when="1834-05-00">May</date> is coming, and with it flowers. By God&#x2019;s blessing you will be restored to us; not to wander, we will hope, any more.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-268" n="07-268"/>There came a letter from Alick very shortly after mine to you was sent away. All is in the usual way in Annandale; for we have heard again only yesterday from Mrs Welsh who had seen Jean and Jenny at Dumfries: nay this moment, since I began to write, the Dumfries Newspaper arrives with the mark of safety on it. Alick represents our Mother as moving about a good deal on Harry, and keeping her health very tolerably: she does not seem altogether <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [adjusted] yet, he says, at Scotsbrig: however, the new Daughter-in-law seems to be a reasonable young woman, well disposed to do the best for all parties there: till a new Whitsunday at least there can nothing go very wrong among them. Jamie and she, it would appear, are still fond as turtle-doves, and prolonging their honey-moon. James Aitken &#x201C;will be expecting an addition to his family one of these weeks&#x201D;: Jenny is living with them for these two last months, at her sewing, and Mrs Welsh represents her as the very picture of health. As for Alick himself, he writes in the middle of a wet abundant hay-harvest, and dates on two successive sundays: he has signified by Letter to his Catlinns Landlord that unless they abate him &#xa3;20 of the rent, he cannot keep the Farm longer than Whitsunday; and so waits, in a kind of confusing uncertainty, the slow issue; forecasting rather that he will <hi rend="italic">go</hi>. I am sorry for Alick: he has a heavy burden to bear, and toils at it rather impetuously than steadfastly. There is much wisely-suppressed energy in him too; but he feels, in general, that he is not in his sphere; and has internally only an artificial kind of composure. One fearfullest precipice I still shudder to see him too near the verge of: that of learning to drink. He is not <hi rend="italic">on</hi> the verge of it, but as I say too near it; or it may be, I have chanced to hear and see worse than the average of him, and he may not be even near it. But the thing even from afar is unspeakable, detestable! I will write to poor Alick very soon; and perhaps, in a distant way, if I have opportunity, hint at this: in any case, I know well, my sympathy will cheer him, invigorate him. Yours too would have the same effect: do you never think of writing to him? Perhaps at Annan, with better environment which may be possible there, he will do better.</p>
<p>As for myself, I go on here almost without adventure of any kind. All of us have tolerable health: Jane generally better than before; I certainly not worse, and now more in the ancient accustomed fashion. I am diligent with the Showerbath; my pilgrimages to the Museum and on other Town-errands keep me in walking enough; once or twice weekly, on an evening, Jane and I stroll out along the Bank of the River, or about &#x201C;the College,&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340617-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-06-17">17 June</date></ref>.</note> and see white shirted Cockneys in <pb id="pg-07-269" n="07-269"/>their green canoes, or old Pensioners pensively smoking tobacco. I long much for a <hi rend="italic">hill</hi>, but unhappily there is no such thing; only knolls, and these with difficulty, are attainable. The London Street tumult has become a kind of marching music to me: I walk along, following my own meditations, without thinking of it. Company comes in desirable quantity, not deficient, not excessive, and there is talk enough from time to time: I myself however, when I consider it, find the whole all-too <hi rend="italic">thin</hi>, unnutritive, unavailing, and that I am <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> still under the high vault. All London-born men without exception seem to me narrow-built, considerably perverted men, rather fractions of a man. Hunt, by nature a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> clever man, is one instance; Mill in quite another manner, is another. These and others continue to come about me, as with the cheering sound of temporary <hi rend="italic">music</hi>, and are right welcome so: a higher cooperation will perhaps somewhere else or sometime hence disclose itself. &#x201C;There was a Piper had a Cow / / And he had nought to give her; / / He took his pipes and play&#x2019;d a spring / And <hi rend="italic">bade the Cow consider!</hi>&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From the ballad &#x201C;The Tune the Old Cow Died of.&#x201D; Froude (<hi rend="italic">LM</hi>, I, 97) quotes a second verse, with a comment by Carlyle: &#x201C;The cow considered wi&#x2019; hersel&#x2019; / That <foreign>mirth</foreign> [sportful music] wad ne&#x2019;er fill her: / &#x2018;Gie me a pickle pease-strae, / And sell your wind for siller.&#x2019; Old Scotch rhyme, reckoned &#x2018;<foreign>pawky</foreign>&#x2019; [shrewd], clever and symbolical, in this house. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Gloire! donnez-moi du pain!</hi></foreign>&#x201D; The verses on the cow, or some of them, were frequently quoted and copied out for autograph seekers by Carlyle. For variant versions and discussion, see W. S. Walsh, <hi rend="italic">Handy-Book of Literary Curiosities</hi> (Philadelphia, <date when="1909-00-00">1909</date>), p. 1062; and Ronald E. McFarland, &#x201C;&#x2018;The Tune the Old Cow Died of&#x2019;: An Allusion in Housman,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Victorian Poetry</hi>, XI (<date when="1973-00-00">Spring, 1973</date>), 60&#x2013;61.</note> Allan Cunningham was here two nights ago; very friendly, very full of Nithsdale, a pleasant <foreign><hi rend="italic">Naturmensch</hi></foreign> [natural person]. Mill gives me logical developments of <hi rend="italic">how</hi> men act (chiefly in Politics); Hunt tricksy devices, and crotchetty whimsicalities on the same theme: <hi rend="italic">what</hi> they act is a thing neither of them much sympathizes in, much seems to know. I sometimes long greatly for Irving, for the old Irving of fifteen years ago: nay the poor actual gift-of-tongues Irving has seemed desirable to me; and I have actually as you shall hear made my way thro&#x2019; to him again. We dined with Mrs (Platonica) Taylor and the Unitarian Fox (of the <hi rend="italic">Repos</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">i</hi>]</supplied><hi rend="italic">tory</hi>, if you know it), one day: Mill also was of the party, and the Husband, an obtuse most joyous-natured man, the pink of social hospitality. Fox is a little thickset bushy-locked man of five-and-forty, with bright sympathetic-thoughtful eyes (the whole face reminded me of &#xc6;neas Rait&#x2019;s,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240101-TC-JAC-01"><sic>3:5</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1824-01-01">1 Jan. 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> compressed, and well buttressed out into broadness), with a tendency to pot-belly, and <hi rend="italic">snuffiness:</hi> from these hints you can construe him; the best <hi rend="italic">Socinian Philosophist</hi> going, <pb id="pg-07-270" n="07-270"/>but not a whit more. I shall like well enough to meet the man again; but I doubt he will not me: he professed to be unwell (as I too was), and rather &#x201C;sang small.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Adopted a humble tone.</note> Mrs Taylor herself did not yield unmixed satisfaction, I think, or receive it: she affects, with a kind of Sultana noblemindedness a certain girlish petulance, and felt that it did not wholly prosper. We walked home however, even Jane did, all the way from the Regent&#x2019;s Park, and felt that we had done a duty. For me, from the Socinians, as I take it, <foreign><hi rend="italic">wird Nichts</hi></foreign> [will come nothing]. Here too let me wind up the Radical Periodical Editorship,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi>.</note> which your last Letter naturally speculates on. Mill I seem to discern has given it to this same Fox (who has just quitted his Preachership, and will like myself be out on the world); partly I should fancy by Mrs Taylor&#x2019;s influence, partly as himself thinking him the safer man. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ebbene</hi></foreign> [oh well]! I can already picture to myself the Radical Periodical, and even prophecy its destiny: with myself it had not been so; the only thing certain would have been difficulty, pain and contradiction; which I should probably have undertaken; which I am far from breaking my heart that I have missed. I may mention too that Mill is so taken with the Diamond Necklace, he in a covert way offered the other night to print it at his own expense, if I would give it him, that he might have the pleasure and profit of reviewing it! Mill likes me well; and on his embarrassed face when Fox happened to be talked of, I read both that Editorship business, and also that Mill had <hi rend="italic">known</hi> my want of it; which latter was all I desired to read. As you well say, disappointment on disappointment only simplifies one&#x2019;s course; your possibilities become diminished, your choice is rendered easier. In general I bate no jot of confidence in myself and in my cause. Nay it often seems to me as if the old extremity of suffering, if such were appointed me, might bring out an extremity of energy as yet unknown to myself. God grant me faith; clearness and peaceableness of heart! I make no other prayer.&#x2014; As to Literary work there is still no offer made that promises to bring in a penny; tho&#x2019; I foresee that probably such will come, and, as they often do, all in a rush. Mill will want if his Fox concern go on; nay poor Heraud was here the other day endeavouring to bespeak me for a Periodical of his; for even he is to have a dud of a Periodical.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Although Heraud was editor or assistant editor of various publications during his career, his present prospects evidently came to nothing.</note> Cheeriest and emptiest of all the sons of men! Yet in his emptiness, as in that of 
<pb id="pg-07-271" n="07-271"/>a dried bladder, he keeps triumphantly jingling his Coleridgean long-gnawed metaphysical cherry-stones, and even &#x201C;makes a kind of martial music&#x201D; for himself thereby. I do not remember that I ever met a more ridiculous-harmless froth-lather of a creature in all my Travels. He lets you tumble him hither and thither, and cut him in two as you like; but in the cheerfullest way joins again, and is brisk froth-lather as before. One should surely learn by him.&#x2014;&#x2014; The Diamond Necklace I should have told you has been refused by Moxon: shall I <hi rend="italic">let</hi> Mill print it? I do not know, and really hardly care. As to Moxon I reckon that we are not only done with <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, but with <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, and need not for the present come into contact again. The man is civility itself, but the civility of a Turk in grain: he glances out on you with the eye of a famished hound crunching a stolen bone; an eye I do nowise like. Fraser, tho&#x2019; in an environment I utterly despise and even abhor, is so much a clearer, heartier, honester character that for the present I must decidedly prefer him. He has finished <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k, and paid me for it instantly (in all &#xa3;82"1); and got me 58 perfect-copies (really readable pamphlets of 107 pages, and all made up without break), which I was yesterday despatching far and wide from his shop. Some twenty copies yet remain, which I am in no haste to dispose of. There is of course one for my dear Doctor; but how to get it to Rome is now the question. Black sends off a parcel only once a quarter to Florence, and the last went only <supplied>[a]</supplied> few weeks ago. Fraser has <hi rend="italic">had</hi> opportunities; has now none. Panizzi<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Anthony Panizzi (<date when="1797-00-00">1797</date>&#x2013;<date when="1879-00-00">1879</date>), Italian exile, assistant librarian, British Museum (<date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>), keeper of printed books (<date when="1837-00-00">1837</date>), chief librarian (<date when="1856-00-00">1856</date>&#x2013;<date when="1866-00-00">66</date>), knighted (<date when="1869-00-00">1869</date>).</note> at the British Museum (who claims a personal acquaintance with both you and me) was to be consulted; but could not be found last day I was there. One Rennie, a Sculptor (an old friend of Jane&#x2019;s whom we have seen) who lives near this, and has relations with Rome, I will also apply to. Do you on your side endeavour, and between us we shall make it out. The Book is worth little, now that I see it; yet not worth nothing, and will perhaps amuse you. I rejoice heartily in having done with it.&#x2014; My grand task as you already know, is the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution;</hi> which, alas, perplexes me much. More <hi rend="italic">Books</hi> on it, I find, are but a repitition [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] of those before read; I learn nothing or almost nothing farther by Books: yet am I as far as possible from understanding it. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bedenklichkeiten</hi></foreign> [Doubts] of all kinds environ me. To be <hi rend="italic">true</hi> or not be true? There is the There is the risk. And then, To be <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> or not to be popular? that too is a question that plays most complexly into the <pb id="pg-07-272" n="07-272"/> other. We shall see, we shall try: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Par ma t&#xE8;te seule</hi></foreign> [By my head alone]!&#x2014; Before quitting this of Literature I must tell you, among numberless discouragements, of two most encouraging messages I have had. The first is from an unknown Irishman from Cork or rather in Cork:<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Father O&#x2019;Shea.</note> did I tell you of him before? The second is from that American Craigenputtoch friend of ours, from whom there came a Letter and Books lately. Both the two, in the most authentic and credible tho&#x2019; exaggerated manner, cry out <foreign><hi rend="italic">Euge</hi></foreign> [God speed]! for which I am heartily obliged to them. It is in regard to <hi rend="italic">Teufels</hi>k, and they both make their objections too. The day of small things!<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Zech. 4:10.</note> For which however one cannot but be thankful. And so enough of my endeavourings and my cares and little pleasures: my good Jack has now as clear a view of me all as in a single sheet he could expect. We may say in the words of the <foreign>Sansculotte</foreign> Deputy writing to the Convention, of the progress of right principles: <foreign><hi rend="italic">Tout va bien ici</hi>, <hi rend="small-caps">le pain manque</hi></foreign>! [All goes well here, <hi rend="italic">bread is lacking!</hi>]<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution, Works</hi>, III, 244.</note> Jane and I often repeat this with laughter. But in truth we live very cheap here (perhaps not much above &#xa3;50 a year dearer than at Puttoch), and so can hold out a long while independent of chance. Utter poverty itself (if I hold fast by the faith) has no terrors for me, should it even come.</p>
<p>I told you I had seen Irving. It was but yesterday, in Newman Street, after <hi rend="italic">four</hi> prior ineffectual attempts. William Hamilton who with his Wife was here on Saturday told me Irving was grown worse again, and Mrs Irving had been extremely ill: he too seemed to think my cards had been withheld. Much grieved at this news I called once more on Monday: a new failure. Yesterday I went again with an insuppressible indignation mixed with my pity: after some shying, I was admitted! Poor Irving! he lay there on a sofa, begged my pardon for not rising; his Wife, who also did not and probably could not well rise, sat at his feet, and watched all the time I was there, miserable haggard, like a watchful Hysperides [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] dragon. I was civil to her, but could not be more: I never in my time was concerned in another such despicability as I was forced to suspect her of. Irving once lovingly ordered her away; but she lovingly excused herself, and sat still. He complains of biliousness, of a pain at his right short-rib; has a short thick cough which comes on at the smallest irritation. Poor fellow! I brought a short gleam of old Scottish laughter into his face into his voice, and that too set him coughing. He said it was the <pb id="pg-07-273" n="07-273"/>Lord&#x2019;s will; looked weak, dispirited, partly embarrassed. He continues toiling daily, tho&#x2019; the Doctor (Darling) says, rest only can cure him. Is it not mournful, hyper-tragical? There are moments when I determine on sweeping in upon all Tongue-work and Martindoms and accursed choking Cobwebberies, and snatching away my old best Friend, to save him from Death and the Grave! It seems too likely he will die there. At lowest I will go again soon and often: I cannot think of it with patience.</p>
<p>Irving told me yesterday that &#x201C;Ben Nelson had been to Glasgow about his eyes&#x201D;: I had never heard of such a thing and knew not what to make of it. Alick even mentioned Ben in his Letter, but only as having been swindled out of &#xa3;16 by some scamp from Kirkcudbright. I shall be anxious to learn more.&#x2014; I wrote to W. Grahame by my Mother&#x2019;s Frank. Irving (the old Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Schoolmaster) of Swaughhead had died very suddenly: he was getting up a dinner, Alick says, for Menzies the new Minister of Hoddam, his old pupil. Mary &#x26; her husband were doing well enough at Annan; work rather scarce, yet some always to be had: they had come up to Alick&#x2019;s on their fast-day: I sent poor Mary a copy of the Pamphlet (Teufel<hi rend="italic">k</hi>). Andrew Anderson<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18291122-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, [<date when="1829-11-22">22 Nov. 1829</date>]</ref>.</note> is not only to lecture on Surgery, but has married an heiress, niece of Milligan the late Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Grinder,<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly Dr. E. Milligan, physician, of 2 Argyle St., with a lecture-room at 7 Brighton St.; a &#x201C;Grinder&#x201D; was a crammer.</note> who died in winter last. It may perhaps set Andrew on his legs. Mrs Welsh was up at Craigenputtoch; it looks all very wild and made her <foreign>greet</foreign> [weep] &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">not</hi> that we were gone&#x201D;: she had escorted thither a certain Indian friend who has (thro&#x2019; M&#x2019;Diarmid) taking the shooting, with right to <hi rend="italic">lodging</hi>, for &#xa3;10 a-year: old Nanny M&#x2019;Queen pays us other &#xa3;10 for the Park and right of living in the House, with charge of taking care of it, and admitting any decent &#x201C;gunner body&#x201D; of that kind. Both sums I believe will be faithfully paid; and old Nanny is said to be the carefullest of women. Mrs Welsh called and saw Glen: he was looking fat and rosy, his dressing-gown out at elbows, and with your old German hair-cap on him; spoke very politely and without blunder, but seemed no sounder intrinsically than before. In recognition of my Note he sent me a Newspaper; which he also mentioned to Mrs W.&#x2014; Alas the Paper is quite done. Attend me in the margins.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Ever your faithful Brother</salute></closer></p>

<p>Jane who is not very well this particular day sends you her sisterly love. She takes well with Chelsea, and seems to be cheerfuller than she was wont.

I made some reference to this similitude, and Carlyle rejoined &#x2018;Merchant! you figure well.&#x2019; On asking for some explanation of this enigmatic deliverance, Carlyle told me the story of an impecunious Dumfriesshire man, to whom, on entering a shop, a tradesman &#x2026; had tendered an account. The debtor had no money with which to settle the bill, but after carefully inspecting its caligraphy and arithmetic he said to his creditor in a mournfully complimentary tone: &#x2018;Merchant! you figure well.&#x2019; The bearing of this anecdote on Emerson&#x2019;s similitude, I leave it to the reader to discover.&#x201D;</note></p>

<salute>My Dear Mill,</salute>
<p>A not undeserving man, whom, I think, you have seen here, or heard me speak of by the name of Tom Holcroft, is setting out for Paris; and wishes to employ his few weeks of residence there in acquiring some knowledge of French things; especially things Political and Journalistic; having, as I gather, some views of corresponding with some English Newspaper or other during his absence. He is not one whose qualifications can reflect lustre on our side of the water; but also they will not reflect disgrace; for he means well, has strong lineaments of character, if not a character itself; on the whole, wants culture rather than faculty; and being a man I believe of manful <pb id="pg-07-276" n="07-276"/>demeanour, in rather a peculiar position, and to me in particular extremely obliging ever since I first saw him, he interests me a little.</p>
<p>I have given him a Note to Duveyrier,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340817-TC-CDU-01">previous letter</ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18320123-JWC-JCA-01">JWC to <sic>JC</sic><corr>JCA</corr>, [<date when="1832-01-23">23? Jan. 1832</date>]</ref>.</note> noting his claims as Holcroft the Dramatist&#x2019;s son, and Mercier the Conventionist&#x2019;s grandson;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Louis S&#xE9;bastien Mercier (<date when="1740-00-00">1740</date>&#x2013;<date when="1814-00-00">1814</date>), dramatist and member of the Convention, who had voted against the death-sentence for Louis XVI and who was imprisoned until after the death of Robespierre. Carlyle drew on his <hi rend="italic">Tableau de Paris</hi> (London, <date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>) for <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>. His daughter Louisa was the elder Holcroft&#x2019;s fourth and final wife.</note> not without misgivings lest it come to nothing; for I do not so much as know Duveyrier&#x2019;s address. This latter deficiency at least I imagine you can supply. Holcroft lives N<hi rend="italic">o</hi> 13 Clifford&#x2019;s Inn. If you pass along Fleet-street (which I am not sure of) tomorrow morning, perhaps you could leave a Note addressed to him with the requisite indication: I am to be there at 11 o&#x2019;clock, not after 11, and can complete Duveyrier&#x2019;s superscription as needful. The Porter of Clifford&#x2019;s Inn, close by St Dunstan&#x2019;s Church, will take the Note. If you do not pass that way, the Twopenny Postman will. Observe only that Tom goes off on Wednesday morning, and be not <hi rend="italic">too</hi> late. If you had any Parcel or message to carry, doubtless he would be happy to take charge of it. So much for this.</p>
<p>I despatch the Carrier only today for the Books. All last week I was if not idle too differently engaged: with mere English matters, with Burns, even with Hannah More! The French business grows darker and darker upon me: dark as was chaos. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign></p>
<p>A copy of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ck</hi>h was ma<supplied>[r]</supplied>ked for you; another for Mrs Taylor; I hope the man sent them.

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>It is many a long week since I had a word with you; it seemed immeasurably long till you answered my last Letter; and now I daresay <pb id="pg-07-277" n="07-277"/>it is long again before I have got pen in hand to make another step in the Dialogue. You must not be so dilatory another time; neither will I, if you meet me fairly. I know how you are driven about frequently, and what a business it is to get your Desk all <foreign>fettled</foreign> [put in order]: but you must ever make an effort, and do me that kindness: news from poor old Annandale, and the indissolubly united Friends I have there, the most precious to me of any I have in this world, are what I can in no wise do without. See if I have not taken my largest sheet, tho&#x2019; a most uncomfortable one; and what a hand I am writing in!<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s writing here is crowded and cramped.</note></p>
<p>You were busy, when you wrote last, snatching your Hay from the roaring burn-floods; and now, as I often figure, you are all strips on the Harvest-rig, gathering in a still more essential crop. God speed your honest toil! How innocent and free it looks, there on the hill-side, with the yellow vales and knolls of this fair Earth all spread around you, and the everlasting heavenly Vault arched kindly overhead! Yet I know well, it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> free, nor a pleasure; a task rather and sorrowful trouble, as all Labour is; not (for the present) joyous but greivous [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]. Nevertheless persevere, persevere. Among all the struggling Sons of Adam, who have arisen this day to struggle in their several battle-fields, there is simply <hi rend="italic">none</hi> more sure that he is in a <hi rend="italic">right cause</hi>, than you there on the stubble-field, binding up the indispensable sheaves. This is a great blessing, and indeed the greatest: that a man be in the right in what he fights for is all in all for him; his battle, his victory, taken by itself, if we weigh it in the true Eternal Balance, issues simply in &#x201C;round O,&#x201D; name itself as proudly as it may. For the rest, I hear, you may judge how gladly, that your Fields have again been kind to you, that there is an &#x201C;excellent crop on the ground&#x201D;: so testifies Grahame of Burnswark; who adds nevertheless that he detests Catlinns (for private reasons: I believe he lost a Brother there from cruel <hi rend="italic">hard</hi>ships) as he does the &#x201C;Plains of Pandemonium.&#x201D; He mentioned, what you had already told me, that you were threatening to quit that arena; a thing he seemed rather to call in question, &#x201C;provided you were making a little money in it.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Graham had written on <date when="1834-08-22">22 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Sandy &#x2026; speaks of giving up Catlinns. I think he will not yet a while: he has a great crop this year, and things are, upon the whole, prosperous. To be sure, I do hate the farm, as I would the plains of Pandemonium; but if he can make any money, I will hold my feelings in abeyance.&#x201D;</note> Alas, yes! With <hi rend="italic">that</hi> proviso I also should decidedly vote for your continuing in it. As it is, however, who can censure the step you have taken? I long greatly to hear what the fruit of that proposal of yours <pb id="pg-07-278" n="07-278"/>has been; and really, so uncertain is everything, and so unthrifty are all even indispensable changes, I think if they will abate you the &#xa3;20, I shall rather rejoice in your continuance than otherwise. New fields of exertion, it is very true, are possible for you; wider fields, but then also more dangerous ones, with more influences that lead down to utter ruin, and where apart from danger of that kind, peace of mind may be still more difficult for you. Tell me, I pray you, the moment anything is decided about it. If they will leave you so that you can pay your rent with any comfort, I can look on you at Catlinns without misgivings: you can trim up your household establishment there more and more; you can get a few Books round you for long winter nights; you have your little children by you as a lasting interest, whom to train up in the way that they should go will be a duty and a b<supplied>[l]</supplied>essedness. Above all, my dear Brother, whatsoever thing you lose, O do not lose <hi rend="italic">yourself!</hi> Were I assured against <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, I should see no danger for you. You are too <hi rend="italic">indignant</hi> against destiny: it is a fault of my own too, in which my example has perhaps harmed you; yet a sore fault it is, as I see more and more. Not Pride (from which that indignation, if we examine it, arises) but Humility, the <hi rend="italic">humbling</hi> and down-pulling of that same Pride, is the lesson <hi rend="italic">we are to be taught</hi>. Happy for us if we can learn it; and so with wise submissiveness &#x201C;bear our cross,&#x201D; whatever that may be, and <hi rend="italic">skirt</hi> many an obstacle which we cannot <hi rend="italic">mount</hi> over, which we would so fain <hi rend="italic">hurl</hi> from us (were the arms strong enough) and utterly destroy! Finally, my dear Brother, call, from the depths of your heart, on God to help you, to guide you in the way, for it is not in man to guide himself; and so, with your eye on fixed heavenly loadstars, walk forward fearing nothing&#x2014;for Time or for Eternity. Nothing! There is <hi rend="italic">work</hi> on God&#x2019;s wide Earth for all men that He has made with hands and hearts; and we, by his blessing, will seek it, and find it, should we go to the Transatlantic grass-plains for it. And so here will I end. You do not object to my advisings and moralizings; you know that the feeling they spring from is of the deepest: I know you ponder what I say beyond what it deserves; and, in any case, are cheered to consider that you have an elder Brother who in no chance or change can cease to sympathize with your weal or woe, and help you if it be in his ability. Forward then! Steady and strong!</p>
<p>The notices you give me about our Mother are what I especially desired, as I still desire more. She has at last written me part of a Letter with her own hand, in the cheerfullest serene spirit, even with a touch of jocoseness; which I think has been one of the gladdest <pb id="pg-07-279" n="07-279"/>things that has befallen me since I left you. I will write to her very soon, at Jean&#x2019;s; indeed, I had thoughts of writing to her today and not to you whose right it was; but I fancied you impatient, and so will do both ere long. That James has got his wedding over so greatly to his mind, and likes it still so well, is a thing I heartily rejoice at: tell him so, poor fellow; and that according as his wife and he are <hi rend="italic">wise</hi>, so will their happiness be: in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> proportion and no higher one; yet by God&#x2019;s blessing <hi rend="italic">in</hi> that proportion. Give him my brotherly love, and best wishes that all may be well with him and what belongs to him.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham had also seen James Carlyle, his wife, and his mother recently, and he sent Carlyle some words concerning them: &#x201C;At Scotsbrig James is carrying on with his usual vivacity. He has married a very comely girl. I met the young folks at the <date when="1834-06-00">June</date> Fair. When the harvest is over they will be within hail of the Fairy Craig, and I shall call there shortly. Your excellent Christian Mother (Cornelia [Roman matron, mother of the two Gracchi, her &#x201C;jewels&#x201D;]) is <hi rend="italic">wearing</hi> admirably; her appearance changes little; her motherly kindness of manner, still less. Do you recollect our argument in Leith Walk on disinterested love and affection, and that I triumphed? I&#x2019;ll do it again and again; and for my demonstration I&#x2019;ll take your devoted Mother. Were my own living, I would take both, for you can form no idea how much, how striking, the resemblance.&#x201D;</note> Jean confirms your report of the Austins at Annan; describes work as scarce, but Jamie as getting a share of it. She says they have still their eye on farms, and some kind of outlook towards Wull Brown&#x2019;s.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Their kinsman (d. <date when="1838-00-00">1838</date>). See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18270101-TC-AC-01"><sic>4:179</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1827-01-01">1 Jan. 1827</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-06/lt-18311225-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-12-25">25 Dec. 1831</date></ref>.</note> In this you are infinitely fitter than I to give them counsel. My wishes that they may be well counselled are all I can give. Remember me specially to poor Mary, who I think is like to be a <foreign>douce</foreign> Wifie; tell her that I hope to find her well and doing well, and to eat another breakfast with her yet from time to time.</p>
<p>I may as well finish off Scotch business before going farther. That Craigenputtoch shooting as you have perhaps learnt, is let; the parties are in it, I believe, with all their retinue; doing the best they can beside old Nannie. They are East Lothian people, whom Jane knows (one of them called Aitken, another Scott, both Indians); they will behave decently, and pay their &#xa3;10 of rent. So the thing is settled tolerably enough. We have heard, by Mrs Welsh, of the Shower-bath; but fear it had been delayed too long for M&#x2019;Diarmid, and was not sold: in that case, they must just do the next best with it. The old Clatch you say is disposed of; and in a week or two (in <date when="1834-10-00">October</date>, I believe) you will learn what you have got for it: I hope it will be useful to Brand, while he is weak, and not a losing bargain to him. There is finally that Craigenputtoch wood-cutter, whom you have to settle with. I believe him to be a decent man who will give you little <pb id="pg-07-280" n="07-280"/>trouble in it. He will meet you at Dumfries any day; and according to the Proverb, the nearest day you can get him and get yourself to fix will be the best. He borrowed &#xa3;10, for which his acknowledgement is here; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> own wages were to be 3/ a-day, and that of the other people strictly what they cost him: he was to have a written account of everything to show, and said &#x201C;it would be the queerest wood he ever saw if it did not clear itself and leave something over.&#x201D; I shall like to hear that you have settled, and what the amount is. That &#xa3;10 receipt should have been sent while there were franks (and can still be, if essential); but it is only on simple paper; and you in your final discharge of him can take notice of it. As was said, I believe the man to be honest; and hope to hear that you could settle cheerfully with him. J<supplied>[ane]</supplied> (by way of &#x201C;more last words&#x201D;) says there was 3/ you were to pay an Apothecary, and asks whether it be within the limits of possibility that you have forgotten it? And so that is the very last &#x201C;last word&#x201D; on this part of the subject.</p>
<p>As for London and myself, tho&#x2019; I think I could sit with you on some of your <foreign>brae</foreign>-sides for the length <supplied>[of]</supplied> a day, and talk to you about it, with comfort and profit, yet of news that can be written there is not more than this remnant may hold. Briefly, we are in the old way. Our household goes quickly on, all fairly fulfilling its promise. My work too does not stand still, tho&#x2019; nothing can yet get so far as black-on-white, but is toilsomely shaping itself in silence and secret. My day is spent in reading, in considering. I have had a pensive, sometimes a sad, yet a sweetly-tender summer; on the whole, a better one than I have known of late. Whatsoever be my destiny I feel in general that here is the place where I must work it out; that I am at my post here. Much exercise of spirit (as several people will name it) has gone thro&#x2019; me; I hope, not to no purpose; for I have much to settle and alter in that quarter. Tho&#x2019; I hardly learn anything from speech with any individual man here, yet in the long run the influences of the place are upon me, and I feel better what <hi rend="italic">it is</hi> I am working, and how to work it, and have a much more natural position than in the wilderness. Puttoch in particular who can regret? Many other places, all your Annandale regions, the windings about Milk Mill, the very Hags and Brownmoor, look softened and bright to me in the distance; but not so the Dunscore Desert; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is a place we never knew good in except what we gained as at the sword&#x2019;s point; a place doomed, even in my memory, to silence, obstruction, and the dispiritment of motionless desolation; a place I care not if I never see again! So far all is well. What London is to do for me remains <pb id="pg-07-281" n="07-281"/>with the Providence that guides us. A huge confused outlook, wherein, however, I think I am learning to look with more freedom, more profit. The intellect, the natural force of <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of the people is such as to strike me with the smallest fear for myself: generally even the literary men seem the incontrovertiblest <hi rend="italic">duds:</hi> yet do they not live? I too will live, and do much more than that! Meanwhile, as was said, my task lies on the work-board, and I have to work at <hi rend="italic">it;</hi> which is clear enough guidance. I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> to make a reasonable production of it; and shall verily do my best. It will be sore, sore; I shudder to look at it; but know, from old experience, that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> possible for me, and as the Cockneys say &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be done, Sir.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340526-JWC-TC-01">JWC to TC, <date when="1834-05-26">26 May</date></ref>.</note> Money for nearer wants I expect to earn some other way. Nay I had an offer the other day from Fraser to earn a &#xa3;20 by a new &#x201C;Article&#x201D; for him; but he wished it of a lower, froth-price, and cared not (as he seemed to tell me) tho&#x2019; <hi rend="italic">it</hi> were froth too: I, after consideration, declined, yet respectfully. He is a good creature, Fraser, tho&#x2019; surrounded with Irish-blackguardism; and, as seems likely will be the man for publishing my Book: he is <hi rend="italic">honest</hi>, punctual and cheerful to do business with; great qualities and not the commonest in his way. We have finished off <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi>, last month; he paid me for it honestly what he bargained for; he made me up 50<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Actually 58.</note> complete copies, most of which I have dispersed far and wide: there was a set for Dumfriesshire, which I hope are now very near you: they were to come by Edinburgh and M&#x2019;Kie, and to be sent all to Jean: one for her, one for Catlinns, one for Scotsbrig, one for Annan; that is to say, one for every household of you, so that whoever will or dare may read in it. The thing is not worthless; you will get something out of it, in the winter time, and at all events, a remembrance of your Brother and his old Life (for it was written the last summer we were together), which will be dear to you. I put your name on it in the Bookseller&#x2019;s shop, but could say nothing more there. There is another little thing,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;The Diamond Necklace.&#x201D;</note> which Mill is urging me to publish (and will even print at his own expence that he &#x201C;may write a review on it&#x201D;!) but whether to set it out, or keep it a while (and perhaps gain some pounds by it) I do not yet know. This is all my Book news.</p>
<p>We are particularly still at present, one might almost call it solitary, were it not that talk if you like to go out for it can at all times be <hi rend="italic">had</hi>. But this is the season when &#x201C;London goes out of Town&#x201D;; innumerable mortals fly in every direction to sea-coasts and mineral <pb id="pg-07-282" n="07-282"/>wells, by way of varying their dulness. I cannot say that any friend we valued much is gone; indeed there is only one or two to whom that character at all belongs; I myself too am very much isolated in my own thoughts, and find less pleasure in most persons than they seem to find in me: but I will leg about me by and by, and try to get among the practical people. If a man&#x2019;s opinion is worth never so little, his experience is always of value. Hunt is ever brisk, friendly and at hand; but has found me, I imagine, a most iron Presbyterian fellow, and hovers rather in the distance last fortnight. His talk is clever, among the cleverest; but far from the talk I want; unproductive, in earnest seasons worth nothing to me. Allan Cunningham has more stuff in him; he was here an evening lately: good scotch <hi rend="italic">guffawing</hi> talk, almost like a country Scotch &#x201C;fore-supper&#x201D;! He has presented me his <hi rend="italic">Life of Burns;</hi> a good thing, which I wish I could get lent to you.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Works of Robert Burns &#x2026; With His Life</hi>, 8 vols.

I was to see him soon; but had not time yesterday, when near his place, and so have perhaps missed him. I trust he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> recover; and if so, there seems certainly a likelihood that in mind too he will be himself again. May it be so!&#x2014;(Turn to the first page)</p>
<p>I will not write on this wretched paper, nor try to write so small, again, for really you are a loser by it, so <hi rend="italic">stiff</hi> do I get both in the fingers and the mind and nothing flows freely from me.&#x2014; When will you write? Do not, I beg of you, be long. If you cannot get a sheet filled, send it off half-filled. The Newspaper will come to you every Monday, I hope, with the regularity of the sun.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>It is long since I have been so much delighted with anything as I was with your affectionate, good humoured excellent little Letter:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Sent with Jean Aitken&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1834-08-16">16 Aug.</date></note> indeed, I think it was one of the blithest moments it gave me that I have had since I left you. Now at last I can fancy that I shall not want for Letters; you with the matter in your own hand will duly think of my necessities in that way, and may at all times be depended on for punctuality. For I calculate that &#x201C;having put your hand to the plough&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Luke 9:62.</note> you <hi rend="italic">will not</hi> in any wise draw back! No, no. Let them rule you a piece of paper, or what were better make you a set of permanently ruled <hi rend="italic">lines</hi>, and then, with a pen and an inkbottle, you can at any moment tell me your own story independent of any one: were it nothing but &#x201C;half a drop,&#x201D; it will be welcomer to me than any whole drop, or whole <hi rend="italic">flood</hi>, that can come from any other quarter. <pb id="pg-07-284" n="07-284"/>You speak with so much hope and kindliness about everything, and take with such a cheerful patience all the changes appointed you (of which in late years there have been enough and too many), and ever are found waiting to welcome the new time, and make the most of it, with glad submission to the will of Him that appointed it,&#x2014;I confess, my dear Mother, you might be a lesson and a wholesome reproof to the best of us. May the Father of all be thanked that it is so well with you! Nay, while He gives you that spirit, it can never be ill with you. Whatever can betide, for Time or for Eternity, is not He there, the All-powerful but also the All-loving, All-pitying!&#x2014;&#x2014; I have endeavoured from your description, and Jean&#x2019;s former one, to picture out your two Scotsbrig Rooms, with the red curtains and the new window, and fancy that in the pleasant season you will be very <foreign><hi rend="italic">braw</hi></foreign> [handsomely fixed] and not uncomfortable: when the winter comes, as it is fast doing, you must keep a good fire, and if the weather detain you from stirring out, yet I know your hand will not lie idle; and with work to do, one need not weary. Let me find you well, dear Mother, when I come back. And if I bring you a good <hi rend="italic">new Book</hi> in my hand, will not you have that <hi rend="italic">new plaid dressing-gown</hi> ready for me! Grahame of Burnswark tells me that you are looking &#x201C;admirably well&#x201D;: he adds that in your ways of speech and acting, you bring him, more than I could imagine, in mind of his own beloved Mother,&#x2014;which I do believe is the highest compliment he could pay you. His Letter is full of the most overflowing friendliness, and was very welcome to me.</p>
<p>We suppose you come to stay with Jean till a certain event be over, about which, poor thing, she is naturally anxious enough. We trust, it will all prove right and joyful, and disappoint her apprehension. Tell them to write to us directly; or do it yourself if you are not too slow. Give my thanks to Jean for her share of the Letter, and say that the only reason why she does not also receive a Note to-day, is that the Frank will not hold one; that American Letter<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >From Emerson.</note> being already a double one. The Newspaper comes regularly on Friday about noon; and on Saturday I as regularly forward it to Alick, who will thus find it waiting for him on Monday. Tell Jean, she must not again write on it <hi rend="italic">with so coarse a pen</hi>, lest they detect us, and come out with their fine of fifty pounds! A <hi rend="italic">small</hi> crow-quill stroke, which cannot be so cunning as to escape <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, and then a wafer introduced to <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> the cover from slipping: <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, in cases of extremity that justify a fraud <pb id="pg-07-285" n="07-285"/>on the ravenous Post-office, is the method for doing it. Jack&#x2019;s Letter unfortunately cannot be sent me, but I gather that he is well, and hope ere long to have a Letter of my own confirming it.&#x2014; Have you got the Books; I mean, a set of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckhs</hi>, which I despatched for you, all in a heap to Jean&#x2019;s care, thro&#x2019; M&#x2019;Kinnel the Bookseller,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310904-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1831-09-04">4 Sept. 1831</date></ref>.</note> by way of Edinburgh? Your Names are on them; but I could put nothing more, having to leave them open on Fraser&#x2019;s counter. This American Letter is on the same subject: I thought it would be worth your reading; for is not all the good that happens to me a possession of yours also? Read the Letter in this sense, and do not show it to any one else; that were but a wretched vanity, in which, as I have found long since there is little <hi rend="italic">thrif</hi><supplied>[<hi rend="italic">t</hi>]</supplied> for me or any one.</p>
<p>Of Chelsea news we have as good as none to send you; which indeed means intrinsically good enough news. We go on in the old fashion, adhering pretty steadily to our <hi rend="italic">work</hi>, and looking for our main happiness in that. This is the dull season in London, and several of our friends are fled to the country; however, we have still a fair allowance of company left us; and, what is best, the company we have is none of it <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> or merely &#x201C;a consuming of time,&#x201D; but rational, and leads to something. The <hi rend="italic">best</hi> news I have is that, this day, I mean to begin <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> my Book; nay, had it not been for the present sheet, would already have been at it! Wish me good speed: I have meditated the business as I could, and must surely strive to do my best. With a kind of trembling hope I calculate that the Enterprise may prosper with me, that the Book may be at least a true one, and tend to do God&#x2019;s service not the Devil&#x2019;s. It will keep me greatly on the stretch for these winter months; but I hope to have it printed and out early in spring: what is to be done next we shall then see. The world must be a tougher article than even I have ever found it, if it altogether beat me. I have defied it, and set my trust <hi rend="italic">elsewhere</hi>, and so it can do whatsoever is permitted and appointed it. As to our other doings and outlooks, I have written of them all at great length to Alick, the other day; so that, as you are likely to see his Letter very soon, I need not dwell on them here. I have seen Mill and various other agreeable persons since (for our company comes often in <hi rend="italic">rushes</hi>), but met with no farther adventure.</p>
<p>The sheet is fading very fast; Jane&#x2019;s little Note too is ready; and I have still some <hi rend="italic">business</hi> to do. We spoke long ago about a freight of eatable goods we wan<supplied>[t]</supplied>ed out of Annandale in the fall of the year. <pb id="pg-07-286" n="07-286"/>As you are the punctuallest of all, I will now specify the whole to you, that you may bestir yourself and stir up others in the proper quarter <supplied>[to]</supplied> be getting them ready: I suppose, it will be some five weeks before they can go off; but I shall have get minuter knowledge, and shall write again, before that. Here is the list of our wants, as I have extracted it by questions out of Jane. First sixty pounds of Butter in <hi rend="italic">two</hi> equal <hi rend="italic">pigs</hi> (the butter here is 16 pence a pound!); secondly a moderately-sized sweet-milk cheese; next two smallish Bacon-hams (your Beef-ham was just broken into last week and is in the best condition); next, about 15 stone of right Satur oatmeal<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Oatmeal from the Satur Mill.</note> (or even more, for we are to give Hunt some stones of it, and need almost a pound daily, there is not now above a stone left); and after that, as many hundredweights of Potatoes as you think will keep (for the rule of it is this: we take 2 pounds daily, and they sell here at 1&#xBD;<hi rend="italic">d</hi> or at lowest a penny a pound, and are seldom good): all this got ready and packed into a hogshead, or into two, will reach us by Whitehaven, and we will see how it answers. You may stir up Alick and James then; and say, The sooner the better<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>I have just had a Letter (from Henry Inglis) that the Books are got to Edinburgh: so you will likely see yours on Wednesday next. Mill has undertaken to get me this franked; which is more than I hoped, for the &#x201C;Members&#x201D; are nearly all off. Write to me soon, with your own hand &#x201C;Half a drop,&#x201D; if more may not be. Give my brotherly love to Jean and Jenny, and all of them, and their several households, wheresoever they struggle and toil<supplied>[.]</supplied> Tell them all to stand true and fear nothing<supplied>[.]</supplied> I shall hope soon to hear of you, and still that it may be good news. God grant it [obliterated] Take great care of yourself at this unhealthy season; keep well, and love us<supplied>[.]</supplied> <closer><salute>I am ever (My D<supplied>[ear Mo]</supplied>ther) your affectionate,&#x2014;&#x2014;</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p>Thomson (of Spital-riding-hill) and Macqueen, a strange sight here, came floundering in since I began to write this: it seemed as if they had just come &#x201C;thro&#x2019; the burn,&#x201D; and Hoddam and London were contiguous parishes! Macqueen paid some &#x201C;mistaken money&#x201D; (thirty shillings), and went, with good wishes.</p></ps>

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>Could I have supposed it possible that any Mortal was so stupid as not to feel disappointed in receiving a letter from <hi rend="italic">me</hi> instead of from my Husband, I should have written to you very long ago. But while this humility becomes me, it is also my duty (too long neglected) to send a little adjunct to my Husband&#x2019;s letter, just to assure you &#x201C;with my own hand&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Edward Irving&#x2019;s phrase: cf. <ref target="volume-01/lt-18210102-TC-AC-01"><sic>1:301</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1821-01-02">2 Jan. 1821</date></corr></ref>.</note> that I continue to love you amidst the hub-bub of this &#x201C;noble city&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Froude notes: &#x201C;&#x2018;Phrase of Basil Montagu&#x2019;s.&#x2014;T.C.&#x2019;&#x201D;</note> just the same as in the quiet of Craigenputtoch, and to cherish a grateful recollection of your many kindnesses to me, especially of that last magnanimous purpose to &#x201C;sit at my bedside&#x201D; thro&#x2019; the night preceeding [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] my departure &#x201C;that I might be sure to sleep&#x201D;! I certainly shall never forget that night and the several preceeding and following&#x2014;but for the kindness and helpfulness shown me on all hands I must have <foreign><hi rend="italic">traiked</hi></foreign> [collapsed] one would suppose. I had every reason to be thankful then to Providence and my friends; and have had the same reason since. All things, since we came here, have gone more smoothly with us than I at all anticipated. Our little household has been set up again, at a quite moderate expence of money and trouble (wherein I cannot help thinking with a <hi rend="italic">chastened vanity</hi>, that the superior shiftiness and thriftiness of the Scotch character has strikingly manifested itself). The English women turn up the whites of their eyes and call on the &#x201C;good Heavens<supplied><hi rend="superscript">[&#x201D;]</hi></supplied> at the bare idea of enterprises which seem to me in the most ordinary course of human affairs&#x2014; I told M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Hunt one day I had been very busy <hi rend="italic">painting:</hi> &#x201C;What?&#x201D; she asked is it a portrait? &#x201C;O No,&#x201D; I told her &#x201C;something of more importance; a large wardrobe&#x201D;&#x2014; She could not imagine she said &#x201C;how I could have patience for such things&#x201D;&#x2014; And so having no patience for them herself what is the result? she is every other day reduced to borrow my tumbler&#x2019;s, my teacups, even&#x2014;a cupful of porridge, a few spoonfuls of tea are begged of me, because &#x201C;Missus has got company and happens to be out of the article&#x201D;&#x2014;in plain unadorned English because &#x201C;Missus is the most wretched of <pb id="pg-07-288" n="07-288"/>Managers and is often at the point of having not a copper in her purse&#x201D;&#x2014; To see how they live and waste here it is a wonder the whole City does not bankrape and go out o sight&#x2014;flinging platefuls of what they are pleased to denominate <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;crusts&#x201D;</hi> (that is, what I consider all the best of the bread), into the ash-pits&#x2014; I often say with honest self congratulation in Scotland we have no such thing as <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;crusts.&#x201D;</hi> On the whole, tho&#x2019; the English Ladies seem to have their wits more at their finger ends, and have a great advantage over me in that respect I never cease to be glad that I was born on the other side the Tweed, and that those who are nearest and Dearest to me are Scotch.</p>
<p>I must tell you what Car<supplied>[lyle]</supplied> will not tell of himself&#x2014;that he is rapidly mending of his Craigenputtoch gloom and acerbity&#x2014; He is really at times a tolerably social cha<supplied>[r]</supplied>acter and seems to be regarded with a feeling of mingled terror and love in all companies, which I should expect the diffusion of Teufelsdreck will tend to increase.</p>
<p>I have just been called away to John Macqueen, who was followed by a Jock Thomson of Annan whom I received in the choicest mood, to make amends for Carlyles unreadiness who was positively going to let him leave the door without asking him in a neglect which he would have reproached himself with after&#x2014; My love to all&#x2014; Tell my kind Mary to write to me she is the only one that ever does&#x2014; <closer><salute>your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<ps><p><title>[<hi rend="small-caps">Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s Notes</hi>]</title></p>
<p>&#x2018;<date when="1834-06-10">Tuesday 10 june 1834</date>,&#x2019; it appears, was the date of our alighting, amid heaped furniture, in this House, where we were to continue for life. I well remember bits of the drive from Ampton-street; what dashing damp-clouded kind of sky it was; and how, in crossing Belgrave Square, <hi rend="italic">Chico,</hi> her little Canary-bird, whom she had bro<hi rend="italic">t</hi> from Craig<hi rend="italic">k</hi> in her lap, burst out into singing; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> we all (&#x201C;Bessy Barnet,&#x201D; our romantic maid sat with us in the old Hackney Coach) strove to accept as a prom<supplied>[is]</supplied>ing omen. The bus<hi rend="italic">ss</hi> of sorting &#x26; settling, with two or 3 good carpenters &#x26;c already on the ground, was at once gone into, with boundless alacrity; and (under such manage<hi rend="italic">t</hi> as Hers) went on at a mighty rate; even the 3 or 4 worst days of quasicamp life, or gypsy life, had a kind of gay charm to us; and hour by hour we saw the confusion abating, growing into victorious order. <pb id="pg-07-289" n="07-289"/>Leigh Hunt was continually sending us Notes; most probably w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> in person step across before bedtime, and give us an hour of the prettiest melodious discourse. In ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> a week (it seems to me) all was swept and garnished, fairly habitable, and continued incess<hi rend="italic">tly</hi> to get itself polished, civilized and beautified to a degree that surprised one. I have elsewhere alluded to all that, and to my little Jeannie&#x2019;s conduct of it: heroic, lovely, pathetic, mournfully beautiful as in the Light of Eternity, that little scene of Time now looks to me. From birth upw<hi rend="italic">ds</hi> she had lived in opulence; and now for my sake had become poor,&#x2014;so nobly poor. Truly her pretty little brag (in this <hi rend="italic">Letter</hi>) was well-founded. No such house, for beautiful thrift, quiet, spontaneous, nay as it were unconscious; minimum of money reconciled to human comfort and human dignity, have I anywhere looked upon where I have been.</p>
<p>From the first or nearly so, I had resolved upon the <hi rend="italic">French Revolut</hi>n; and was reading, studying, ransacking the museum (to little purpose), with all my might. Country health was still ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> me; heart and strength still fearless of any toil. The weather was very hot; <hi rend="italic">defying</hi> it (in hard almost brimless <hi rend="italic">hat,</hi> wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> was <foreign><hi rend="italic">obligato</hi></foreign> in that time of slavery) did sometimes throw me into colic; the museum collect<hi rend="italic">n</hi> of <hi rend="italic">French Pamph</hi>ts, the completest of its sort in the world, did after six weeks of baffling wrestle, prove <hi rend="italic">in</hi>accessible to me; and I had to leave them then,&#x2014;so strong were <hi rend="italic">Chaos</hi> and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi> in that direct<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. Happily John Mill had come to my aid, and the Paris <hi rend="italic">Histoire Parliamentaire</hi><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Histoire Parlementaire de la R&#xE9;volution fran&#x26;ccedil;aise, ou Journal des Assembl&#xE9;es nationales depuis <date when="1789-00-00">1789</date> jusqu&#x2019;en <date when="1815-00-00">1815</date>,</hi> by P. J. Buchez and P. C. Roux-Lavergne, 40 vols. (Paris, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1838-00-00">38</date>); the first 23 volumes were reviewed by Carlyle as &#x201C;Parliamentary History of the French Revolution,&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review</hi>, XXVII (<date when="1837-04-00">April 1837</date>), 233&#x2013;47; reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, XXIX, [1]&#x2013;21.</note> began to appear: Mill had himself great knowledge of the subject; he sent me down all his own Books on the subject (almost a cartload), and was generously profuse &#x26; unwearied in every kind of furtherance. He had taken a great attach<hi rend="italic">t</hi> to me (wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> lasted ab<hi rend="italic">t</hi> 10 years, and then suddenly ended I never knew how): an altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> clear, logical, honest, amiable, affect<hi rend="italic">e</hi> young man; and respected as such here, tho&#x2019; sometimes felt to be rather <hi rend="italic">colourless</hi>, even aqueous,&#x2014;no <hi rend="italic">relig</hi>n in almost any form traceable in him. He was among our chief visitors &#x26; social elements at that time. Came to us in the ev<hi rend="italic">gs</hi> once or twice a week; walked with me on Sundays &#x26;c; with a great deal of discourse not worthless to me in its kind. Still prettier were Leigh Hunt&#x2019;s little nights with us; figure and bearing of the man, of a <pb id="pg-07-290" n="07-290"/>perfectly graceful, spontaneously original, dignified and attractive kind. Considerable sense of humour in him; a very pretty little laugh, sincere &#x26; cordial always; many tricksy turns of intellect, of witty insight of phrase; countenance tone and eyes well seconding; his voice, in the finale of it, had a kind of musical warble (&#x201C;chirl&#x201D; we vernacularly called it) wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> reminded one of singing birds. He came always rather scrupulously tho&#x2019; most simply and modestly dressed. &#x201C;Kind of talking nightingale,&#x201D; we privately called him,&#x2014;name first due to Her. He enjoyed much, and with a kind of chivalrous silence &#x26; respect, her Scotch tunes on the Piano, most of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> he knew already, &#x26; their Burns or other accompaniment: this was commonly enough the wind-up of our ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi>; &#x201C;supper&#x201D; being ordered, (uniformly, &#x201C;porridge&#x201D; of Scotch oatmeal), most likely the Piano, on some hint, w<hi rend="italic">d</hi> be opened, and continue till the &#x201C;porridge&#x201D; came,&#x2014;a tiny basin of wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi> Hunt always took, and ate with a teaspoon, to sugar, and many praises of the excell<hi rend="italic">t</hi> frugal and noble article. It seems to me, in our long, dim-lighted, perfectly neat and quiet room, these &#x2018;ev<hi rend="italic">g</hi> parties&#x2019; of 3, were altog<hi rend="italic">r</hi> human and beautiful; <hi rend="italic">best</hi> I anywhere had before or since! Allan Cunningham occasionally walked down; pleas<hi rend="italic">t</hi> enough to talk with,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; the topic was sure to be Nithsdale (mainly Nithsdale <hi rend="italic">Fun</hi>), and nothing else.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I sent you a Frank, with an American Letter in it, and plenty of news from myself: this (as I have lately learned, from Mill, thro&#x2019; whose hands it went, that it was detained a whole week) you can only very lately have got hold of; perhaps only the other day. So unless you chanced to notice the little obscure annotation in the last <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, you are probably in some surprise as to what I can want with you again so <hi rend="italic">soon</hi>. Be not alarmed, dear Mother; it is nothing wrong; rather something <hi rend="italic">right;</hi> good news, and a small piece of business, which also comes with the <hi rend="italic">shovel</hi> and not with the <hi rend="italic">rake</hi>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;He comes oftener with the Rake, than the Sho&#x2019;el,&#x201D; i.e., he takes rather than he gives. James Kelly, <hi rend="italic">Scottish Proverbs</hi> (London, <date when="1721-00-00">1721</date>), p. 129.</note></p>
<p>John sends me a Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Naples, <date when="1834-08-26">26 Aug.</date></note> two days ago, with tidings in it that he is well, of which I shall say more by and by; and farther with notice that I am to go and receive for him, at a Banker&#x2019;s here, a sum of &#xa3;130, and dispose of the same afterwards in such a manner as I see best. This money I accordingly went and laid hands on today (6 or <pb id="pg-07-293" n="07-293"/>7 miles eastward from here, in what is called &#x201C;the City&#x201D;); and having considered of the matter beforehand, I went straightway, and paid it into another Bank here, that has dealings with the Commercial Bank of Dumfries, with orders that they were to pay it to you <hi rend="italic">there;</hi> after which you shall see soon how it is to be disposed of, What you have to do is this.</p>
<p>Go, on or after wednesday first, to the Commercial Bank, with James Aitken, or my Uncle John, or any one whose face is known there; and ask them if they have directions to pay &#x201C;Mrs Margaret Carlyle, Scotsbrig, One hundred and thirty Pounds on the part of Mr Thomas Carlyle&#x201D;? They will look in their papers, and (if the notice have come without delay, as I think it must) they will answer, Yes; and hand you a sheet with writings on it; at a particular part of which you are to &#x201C;sign your initials&#x201D; (&#x201C;M.C.&#x201D; no matter <hi rend="italic">how</hi> written), and thereupon they will make a movement to table you the cash: you will say, however, that you do not want <hi rend="italic">this;</hi> that you want a Deposit Receipt for it, in the name of &#x201C;Dr John Carlyle, Rome,&#x201D; and to have it marked on the back that the interest is payable to <hi rend="italic">you;</hi> exactly, you remember, as the former Receipt ran, which you have now,&#x2014;tho&#x2019; only at Scotsbrig, I suppose. If you had it quite ready at Dumfries, perhaps the simplest method would be to make them pay you up what interest is due on <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> and then give you one Receipt for both the new and the old stock: however, this is not worth waiting about; and, I suppose, you will be <hi rend="italic">terrified</hi> to have so much &#x201C;fixed capital&#x201D; lying for a day in your hands. In any case, one way or the other, you and James will settle the business in few minutes; and come out with your new Receipt, and new claim for &#x201C;annual, <hi rend="italic">f&#x2019;r a&#x2019; that</hi>,&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Referring to the annual interest. Cf. Burns, &#x201C;For a&#x2019; that and a&#x2019; that,&#x201D; in the poem beginning &#x201C;Is there, for honest Poverty.&#x201D;</note> which will be honoured whenever you like to present it. Do I make the whole matter plain? I think you see at least what you are to <hi rend="italic">do;</hi> and will, in the performance of it, experience no difficulty. The Banker I employed here (tho&#x2019; they will not ask you this, I fancy) is &#x201C;Jones, Loyd and C<hi rend="italic">o,</hi> 43. Lothbury&#x201D;; the Clerk said they would write to Edinburgh tonight, and from Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> to Dumfries there must be news down before Wednesday. Or <hi rend="italic">if</hi> they have even missed it for a week, we will not take alarm. Let James then, on Wednesday or even on Thursday (if you wait so long) put &#x201C;right&#x201D; on some part of the Newspaper, and I shall know that it is <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, and have it off my mind.</p>
<p>This is all the business, then; and now I will tell you a word or two <pb id="pg-07-294" n="07-294"/>of what the Doctor tells me; for unhappily there are no Franks going, whereby I might send you the Letter itself. Jack is very well himself, and daily goes bathing in the beautiful Mediterranean sea, and &#x201C;cools&#x201D; himself thereby, before breakfast, for the heat of the whole day. He enjoys strong enough health, he says; but <hi rend="italic">all</hi> his Ladies seem to be suffering more or less, from the great heat; and in consequence have determined to shift down to their old quarters by the shore at Castellamare, and there, or shifting about among similar spots already known to them, pass the <date when="1834-09-00">September</date> Month, before returning to Rome. He does not seem to make much of their ailments, or think that they will prove fatal; he hints also that their determinations, about change of place &#x26;c, are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> like the Law of the Medes and Persians; but withal directs me how to address Letters to him, and seems at ease whichever way things go. He asks me also, whether I do not think he ought to ask his Lady&#x2019;s permission to try for some Practice in Rome thro&#x2019; winter? A course I shall strenously advise him to follow.&#x2014; He thanks me abundantly for all my Scotsbrig and Annandale details, and solicits more: his good honest heart is full of affection for us: to me in particular he writes like the best of Brothers, and makes me feel rich and strong in the possession of such. May we be thankful for it; and employ it, not misemploy it!&#x2014; Grahame&#x2019;s Letter must be in his hand before this time, and also one from me: I will write again so soon as this Newspaper with &#x201C;right&#x201D; on it comes to hand. Jane is to go and see the good Miss Morris, who lives on this side of the town, one of these days: but I doubt, will hardly find her, at this season when everybody is off to the country fields.</p>
<p>As for ourselves, dear Mother, we are all right, and in the old way. I have actually begun scribbling at my Book, and have even got something <hi rend="italic">down;</hi> but find it difficult to get into the right key; my hand has been so long out; besides I want to write it <hi rend="italic">plainer,</hi> if I can. Nobody can wish more honestly to do the thing right; I could well indeed kneel down, and audibly ask help (as, in silence, I hope I do) of the great Helper; for &#x201C;it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Prov. 16:9.</note> Let us nevertheless go forward in His strength; and do the best that is in us. We will not &#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">tine</hi></foreign> [lose] heart,&#x201D; therefore, let the wind blow as it will; but toil on manfully while Time is left, knowing well that Eternity is soon to follow.&#x2014; But if now to this solemn view of the matter I add another gay one: namely that I am in use to cheer my steps along these tumultuous streets, many times, by humming a <pb id="pg-07-295" n="07-295"/><hi rend="italic">Scotch tune</hi>, you will better understand my mood. It is quite true: I often march to &#x201C;Johnnie o&#x2019; Cox&#x201D; or &#x201C;Fairest Phillis,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340517-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1834-05-17">17 May</date></ref>.</note> and get along all the better for it; caring (like Curly) &#x201C;not a <hi rend="italic">rush</hi>&#x201D; for innumerable things. Let me mention too that I take nearly <hi rend="italic">a third</hi> less of tobacco than I did, and this without restraint upon myself; which I reckon a considerable improvement. We still see a few friends, tho&#x2019; most of them are gone for some weeks. There is all the more time for working and considering. I this day took Jane (as I went towards &#x201C;the City&#x201D;) to see Allan Cunningham, and Chantry<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Sir Francis Legatt Chantrey (<date when="1781-00-00">1781</date>&#x2013;<date when="1841-00-00">1841</date>), see <ref target="volume-07/http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5113"><hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi></ref> Allan Cunningham was employed as his assistant and secretary from <date when="1814-00-00">1814</date> until Chantrey&#x2019;s death.</note> the Sculptor&#x2019;s works: a grand business; he is reckoned the best statuary here; but seems a fat little managing body, rather than a great man. A Frenchman talks of coming down to see me; one Carrel a &#x201C;headman&#x201D; among the Political Doctors: if he come, he shall be welcome; but I expect small comfort from him. We were at &#x201C;a Party&#x201D; the other night (East Lothian friends of Jane&#x2019;s) and saw &#x201C;ladies and gentlemen,&#x201D; and one or two <hi rend="italic">sensible</hi> persons whom we hope to meet again. Lastly, we have got a most beautiful Lamp (of the <hi rend="italic">Sinumbra</hi> kind,<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >A lamp which, if it does not destroy the shadow, renders the shadow imperceptible by the peculiar form of the circular oil vessel: the old English ring-lamp. See A. Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">NL</hi>, I, 34 n</note> which James knows of); and sit by it nightly over our needlework and papers, really most cheerfully illuminated, at no great cost: it is a device of Jane&#x2019;s who loves <hi rend="italic">light</hi> passionately,&#x2014;a most innocent passion. She is well (better than she used to be); sends you all her &#x201C;kind love, and hopes <hi rend="italic">you</hi> will answer her Letter.&#x201D;&#x2014; We had word from Mrs Welsh yesterday, who mentions your purpose <hi rend="italic">to have</hi> visited her, something of Jenny, and also that Jean has still her task to do. May it be well, well with all of you!&#x2014; Grahame of Burnswark wrote to me again today; about Edward Irving mainly, who I am happy to find has actually gone into the country, and given himself a chance for new health.</p>
<p>This dismal harvest weather for poor Dumfriesshire, tho&#x2019; I can neither help it nor hinder it, grieves me daily. Harvest is done here two months ago; we had the hottest summer, and now we have weather as damp as you, tho&#x2019; perhaps with less <hi rend="italic">fall</hi> of rain. Poor Alick and Jamie! Perhaps (judging by Grahame) their very Hay is out. But what can one do? Hope, and even believe, that the weather <hi rend="italic">will</hi> mend.&#x2014; Now, my dear Mother, do I not for this the third Letter deserve an Answer from some of you? I know you think I do; and what is more that you will in due time send me one. News that you <pb id="pg-07-296" n="07-296"/>are well! Take care of yourself: this surely is unwholesome weather for you; and I daresay you are longing for the country air again. Comfort and encourage poor Jean, tho&#x2019; I hope she has courage and does not need help much. Our love to all: to Mary, to Jenny; Alick owes me a Letter.&#x2014; <closer><salute>May God ever have you in His Keeping! Good night, dear Mother!</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Ever your affectionate, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>I have learned nothing yet about the Whitehaven Package: I reflect only that &#x201C;Bacon hams&#x201D; great or small will be an impossibility at that season! The only things essential are the Butter and the oatmeal: <hi rend="italic">these</hi>, at <hi rend="italic">least</hi>. The Parcel of Books ought to be in Jean&#x2019;s hand before now; tho&#x2019; none of our Dumfriesshire friends acknowledge their copies yet. Tait the Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Bookseller writes to me that he &#x201C;forwarded all&#x201D; to their destination; doubtless, therefore, M&#x2019;Kie&#x2019;s too.&#x2014; <closer><salute>Again, good night!&#x2014;</salute></closer></p></ps>

<p><salute>Many thanks, my dear Friend, for your two kind letters;</salute> they overflow with the best qualities of letters: affectionate sympathy, and copious news.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1834-08-22">22 Aug.</date> and <date when="1834-09-08">8 Sept.</date> Carlyle does not praise the letters too highly: they are unusually good.</note> Amid all your sufferings, of which I know too well you have your share, I cannot but reckon you happy in one thing, which properly is worth all the rest: in the blooming unworn interest you feel in all that exists around you; in your warm honest love, fresh as of green eighteen, for all that deserves any love. I could much envy you, were that the word or feeling for such a quality: alas, I am some twenty years older than you in this respect; a poor shrivelled old man, and can only with all my philosophy toilsomely strive towards what comes to you by bounty of Nature alone.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Actually, Graham, born in <date when="1770-00-00">1770</date>, was 25 years older.</note> Long may such a blessed temper abide with you! In all sorrows, it still makes this old rocky thorny Earth a glad home for us, wherein in sheltered interstices bloom flowers. Well it is also when the kind heart is a brave one. &#x201C;Courage, Brother! Times will mend.&#x201D;</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-297" n="07-297"/>I put off answering you till either a leisure hour (little likely, in truth to arrive) might fall out when I could write something worth its postage; or the season of franks return, and inanity be carried at something like its value. Your last letter urges me to wait no longer. Here, in this still night, with my Dame sitting silently reading opposite me, and the lamp between us making bright daylight, it will do my own heart good to talk half an hour with you. Let me fly over mountain and stream and many long English and Scotch miles, and settle in the little Burnswark Parlour, where a true welcome awaits me.</p>
<p>Your interest in our poor Edward, which I love to witness, is not deeper than my own.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham had discussed Irving in both letters. In that of <date when="1834-08-22">22 Aug.</date> he wrote: &#x201C;What you say of our worthy Edward fills me with anxiety; poor fellow, I wish you and he were both here for a week; you might then, with the help of Heaven, disenthral him. You still prophesy for this! So did I for Lord Byron after reading one of his Hebrew Melodies (the death of Sennacherib&#x2019;s army), but changes seldom take place late in life. &#x2026; You do not say how the Lady Jane <supplied>[is]</supplied>; how her health is &#x2026; I am with you both in spirit many times before the mail can reach you. Since we first met at D. Hope&#x2019;s table, with Edward, and discussed &#x2018;Entails,&#x2019; I am yours with sincere affection.&#x201D; In his letter of <date when="1834-09-08">8 Sept.</date> he said, after painting a gloomy picture of the harvest, greatly damaged by heavy rains: &#x201C;But my principal object in writing you at this time is to bring before you another picture, of its kind no less dark, lamentable and still more hopeless than the preceding,&#x2014;I mean Edward Irving. In your last you speak of four-and-twenty Elders as connected with him. I did not fully comprehend you, but I now do. There was a Mrs. Pillet and Daughter zealously devoted to him, but have now left him, in grief and despair. They were some days at Grange lately, being old and respected friends of Mrs. Johnstone; they give a melancholy account of his fallen state, of his bonds and slavish degradation. These daringly presumptuous men called Elders are become his imperious taskmasters; he is sunk under their proud control; he is now their &#x2018;thral&#x2019; instead of being the Angel of the Church, its Prophet, Lawgiver and director; he is the degraded slave of these bloated, inflated, deceiving, self-deceived, &#x26;c., &#x26;c. But you must know all this and much, very much more. And now for the object of my writing you. You have seen him twice; you have said much to him; you have been <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> with him; he knows the sincerity of your friendship, but he shrinks from the truth you press upon him. I fear there is still the pride of human nature lurking in his humility, and that he also is deceiving himself.
<p>I wish you therefore to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> on the perilous situation in which he stands as connected with these men&#x2014;hypocrites, I believe them to be, inflated with spiritual pride, ambitious of a name to live, but are dead. I wish you to set forth the genius, talent, learning, and honest warmheartedness, disinterestedness, and general worth of Edward, what he originally was, the good he was <supplied>[doing]</supplied> and is still qualified to do&#x2014;that were at once to break the chains and throw off the manacles these agents of Hell have imposed upon him (God forgive me if I do them wrong; it is not my intention, but I believe what I now aver). In short, I wish you to rouse the man within him, and at the same time to expose the character of these presumptuous men; to compare their paltry worthlessness to his master spirit, over which they have thrown the deadly, poisonous covering which is now &#x2018;entering into his soul,&#x2019; and will prove mortal.</p>
<p>I wish you to publish what you write, and that you find a way to place it in his hands; and God, I hope, will bless the means, and that thereby new light will arise upon his mind and disenthral it. Oh, your doing so will be such a friendly deed of charity and mercy!! I still love the man, nor can I cease to be grateful for his once noble, valuable friendship.&#x201D;</p></note> Poor, much-altered, heavily-encumbered friend! <pb id="pg-07-298" n="07-298"/>I never can forget the man he was; one of the largest-souled, truest, most genial men it was ever my blessedness to meet in this world. I say with Uncle Toby: He <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> not lie there and die; &#x201C;he shall march, he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> by&#x2014;&#x2014;!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;&#x2014;In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle <hi rend="italic">Toby</hi>, smiling,&#x2014;he might march.&#x2014;He will never march, an&#x2019; please your honour, in this world, said the corporal:&#x2014;He will march; said my uncle <hi rend="italic">Toby</hi>, rising up from the side of the bed, with one shoe off:&#x2014;An&#x2019; please your honour, said the corporal, he will never march, but to his grave:&#x2014;He shall march, cried my uncle <hi rend="italic">Toby</hi>, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch,&#x2014;he shall march to his regiment.&#x2014;He cannot stand it, said the corporal;&#x2014;He shall be supported, said my uncle <hi rend="italic">Toby;</hi>&#x2014;He&#x2019;ll drop at last, said the corporal, and what will become of his boy?&#x2014;He shall not drop, said uncle <hi rend="italic">Toby</hi>, firmly.&#x2014;A-well-o&#x2019;-day,&#x2014;do what we can for him, said <hi rend="italic">Trim</hi>, maintaining his point,&#x2014;the poor soul will die:&#x2014;He shall not die, by G&#x2014;, cried my uncle <hi rend="italic">Toby</hi>.
<p>&#x2014;The ACCUSING SPIRIT which flew up to heaven&#x2019;s chancery with the oath, blush&#x2019;d as he gave it in;&#x2014;and the RECORDING ANGEL as he wrote it down, dropp&#x2019;d a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.&#x201D; (<hi rend="italic">Tristram Shandy</hi>, VI, ch. 8.)</p></note></p>
<p>Since I wrote last I have, with some endeavour, succeeded in seeing him at his own house; a gloomy visit, in that strange Newman Street Pagoda, for he seemed weak and dispirited, and his wife sat by him, also sick, and I supposed suspicious. A few days after he even made out a visit hither; and staid a friendly hour with us. The old Annandale heartiness looked at intervals faintly out of him here; I could speak to him in the old tone. He is evidently very far from well; broken-looking, ten years older than when you saw him last; all <hi rend="italic">hoary</hi> around the cheeks and under the chin; has a short ugly cough and hardness of breathing that comes upon him at the smallest effort; is &#x201C;so weak that he cannot lift his little child to his head.&#x201D; The Doctor&#x2019;s account, I understand, is that his lungs <hi rend="italic">are</hi> affected, tho&#x2019; as yet only superficially; but that if he persist in the same course of excitement and agitation the affection <hi rend="italic">will</hi> get deep enough. For the rest, it rather seemed to us here that his faith in the Tongue-work, and <hi rend="italic">imprisonment</hi> in all that mournful business, was getting thinner: I told him that for all his wild errors, wide as the poles from my way of thinking, I prayed for no other medicine but <hi rend="italic">continuance of life</hi> to him; if he lived, my faith was he would clear his own way. But <hi rend="italic">life</hi>, as I affectionately urged, was a thing we <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not dispense with. I earnestly, even solemnly called on him to think of this; to <hi rend="italic">fly</hi>, whatever <pb id="pg-07-299" n="07-299"/>might befal, out of London, which was a Mill of Death for him. He admitted it was true; said, he was himself intending to &#x201C;ride off&#x201D; somewhither into quietness and rest till he saw how it proved. Calling at his house, about a week after, I was delighted to find that he had actually done so. The half-<foreign><hi rend="italic">daft</hi></foreign> [half-crazy] servant woman (one of the inspired) could or would tell me no kind of story about him; he was &#x201C;gone away,&#x201D; &#x201C;a good way off,&#x201D; and as for health &#x201C;his <hi rend="italic">bodily</hi> health was no better.&#x201D; Yesterday I learned that it was to Somersetshire he had gone; to a Clergyman&#x2019;s house; that he was taking daily horse-exercise, and minded to continue &#x201C;for weeks or months.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >So Carlyle was told by Irving&#x2019;s father-in-law, Mr. Martin. Irving had left (about <date when="1834-09-01">1 Sept.</date>) going north, via Staffordshire, Wales, and Liverpool, whence he sailed to Glasgow in <date when="1834-10-00">October</date>. The &#x201C;Clergyman&#x201D; he stayed with was Rev. H. E. Bridgeman, of Blymhill, Staffs.</note> This is all my news of the good Edward: I give them all to you <hi rend="italic">in confidence</hi> so far as that in your discretion and real friendship for the man may seem to bind you. I design to procure his address, and write to him: a letter not of controversy (for he already knows my whole mind), but of sympathy which he needs more. To <hi rend="italic">print</hi> anything about him were wholly lost labour; the whole Tongue-business has fallen out of the world&#x2019;s tread; you may go from end to end of London without meeting a man that speaks of it or him; or even knows what you mean (till he recollect himself) when you speak of it.&#x2014; I may add finally that your Grange friend rather appears to me to speak, as was natural for him,<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The typescript of Graham&#x2019;s letter gives &#x201C;Mrs.&#x201D; Pillet as the &#x201C;Grange friend.&#x201D; Either the typist or Carlyle misread the MS.</note> with the zeal and emphasis of Opposition, in regard to the poor Tongueities and their tyranny. I never saw but two of them personally, both rather goodish men; but from all I can gather or infer, I incline to suppose that, in morality, these people generally are of a <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> sort; decidedly <hi rend="italic">better</hi> than most &#x201C;Professors&#x201D; in this City; which, however, is no superhuman praise.&#x2014; So stands it. what will the issue be? God alone knows. May He turn it mercifully to good!</p>
<p>The sheet is so near full, all with one topic; and there were volumes more to say. I saw Allan Cunningham yesterday, and see him pretty frequently, for he is but a mile off: Broad, brawny and wholehearted as ever. He takes a good deal to me; and I like him as a &#x201C;great mass of a Scotchman,&#x201D;<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> in body and mind, beautiful to look upon amid cockney dwarfs. He has written a <hi rend="italic">Life of Burns</hi> (the first volume of an Edition of Burns) which I wish I could hand you: <pb id="pg-07-300" n="07-300"/>pray ask for it, at Carlisle, or till you get it; you will find it well worth reading.&#x2014; I also meet with William Hamilton<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hamilton, London merchant, formerly of Sanquhar.</note> occasionally: always the kindest of men; prosperous in business I should think; a little leaner, no older.</p>
<p>As for myself and small household we go on smoothly in the now customed way; rather solitary at present, &#x201C;everybody,&#x201D; as the fashion is, having gone out of town in these late weeks. The poor town nevertheless seems to be pleasanter than I have yet seen it, positively <hi rend="italic">pleasant</hi> compared with the Nebuchadnezzar&#x2019;s Furnace<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Dan. 3.</note> of our summer. I have begun to <hi rend="italic">write</hi> at my poor Book! A most fearful task. I go up occasionally to the Museum to search and ferret in the Library: it is four miles off, or nearly so; thro&#x2019; the palaces of Belgrave Square, thro&#x2019; the squalid dens of St. File&#x2019;s [Giles],&#x2014;the extremes of Life.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Walking from Chelsea to the British Museum, Carlyle would pass through Belgrave Square, built <date when="1825-00-00">1825</date>, and then the parish of St. Giles, notorious for its &#x201C;rookeries&#x201D; and extreme overcrowding until after the building of New Oxford Street, begun in <date when="1843-00-00">1843</date>.</note> The other week, in a Bookseller&#x2019;s shop, I happen for the first time these five years to open a N. American Review: the first article is a fine-flowing criticism on my unhappy <hi rend="italic">Life of Schiller</hi>, which a Boston Bookseller has reprinted: the first of a series of works, he says, <hi rend="italic">partly</hi> intended to &#x201C;give pecuniary encouragement to Literature in America&#x201D;;&#x2014;for <hi rend="italic">which</hi> object was not this poor Book quite specially suited? At the Book itself I could not but <foreign><hi rend="italic">scunner</hi></foreign> [feel disgust].<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">The Life of Friedrich Schiller &#x2026; From the London Edition</hi> was published by Carter, Hendee &#x26; Co. in <date when="1833-00-00">1833</date> and reviewed in the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi> [by Max Batt], XXXIX (<date when="1834-07-00">July 1834</date>), 1&#x2013;30.</note></p>
<p>Your Harvest news are frightful. I watch the weather every day, as if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> had it like ours. It is damp and ever drizzling; miserable for the purpose, were not yours even worse. On Friday it cleared again; to-day is positively dry: may it but have reached your length. At all events hope ever! Struggle ever!&#x2014; <closer><salute>So wishing you whole heart and better weather, I remain,</salute></closer></p>
<closer><salute>Always affectionately, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>My kind compliments at Burnswark, and my wife&#x2019;s to you all. Thanks for your news about Scotsbrig and Catlinns; whence usually I am rather scantily supplied. I reported your compliment to my mother; adding that I believed it the highest you could have paid her. <pb id="pg-07-301" n="07-301"/>There was a letter very lately from John; yours to him seemed not to have arrived, but could not be far behind. My blessing with you!<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle fails to comment on an interesting passage concerning his relation to Goethe in Graham&#x2019;s letter of <date when="1834-08-22">22 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;I sit down this wet day to own receipt of your little Gem of 5th inst., with pleasure to own its due receipt, with pain that I have no power to make fitting reply. &#x2026; I received it at Newfield on Sunday last. I was eating dinner there with our young Minister, Mr. Menzies. I put it into his hand, and he read it aloud: he was wild with delight and regret that he had not made your acquaintance at Craigenputtock, more especially as he could have told you so much about Goethe, to whom he was introduced by the young Baroness Goethe. He says the old man, in various evenings he spent in his house, would talk of little else than you and Madame Carlyle. The Baroness told him (Menzies), that there was a Platonic regard or love existing between her Father-in-law and Madame Carlyle and that many tokens thereof had been interchanged between them; that the old Baron talked more and oftener of you both than of any other of his young friends. I should fill the sheet on this subject were I to go on, but I will not. You shall see Mr. Menzies when you pay us a visit; and you will like him. He is full of information, modest, frank, honest, warmhearted, and a choice spirit. I am quite delighted with him, both in the pulpit and out of it; and he will soon win over every one of his opposers. &#x2026; I shall be proud of your &#x2018;Craigenputtock Rhapsody&#x2019; [<hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi>], a reading of which Mr. Menzies has bespoke. He modestly hinted that he was afraid of venturing upon you in the wilds of Nithsdale, lest he should have been <hi rend="italic">annihilated</hi>. I undeceived him: told him that without good cause you never showed the Medusa&#x2019;s head.&#x201D;</note></p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>We have had your Letter of the <date when="1834-08-26">26<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August</date> rather more than a week; but I would not answer till I could tell you that the money matter alluded to in it was settled:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written on <date when="1834-08-26">26 Aug.</date>: &#x201C;Lady Clare will direct her banker to pay you on my account one hundred and thirty pounds. You will dispose of it from your own more correct knowledge, better than I can direct you. It might be well to add it to what you have in hand of your own, or transmit it to Dumfries as you think best. I advise that we make common stock till we get out of difficulties both of us. You can have no objection to do this, as I did it so long with you. Dispose of it however as you see wisest, without consulting me farther.&#x201D;</note> at any rate a prior Letter of mine (I have forgotten of what date) must before now be in your hands, and keep your anxieties from getting excessive. One good if no other your return to Rome will do us: allow our Correspondence to proceed in the regular take-and-give fashion, and relieve us from the necessity of <hi rend="italic">overlapping</hi>.&#x2014; The day after your Letter came, which had been <pb id="pg-07-302" n="07-302"/>rather eagerly looked for, there arrived a &#x201C;Threepenny&#x201D; with one from certain Bankers in Lombard Street, announcing, as you indicated, that &#xa3;130 lay in their hands for me, from Lady Clare and you. I walked off accordingly next day; got the money from a discreet oldish man in a brown scratchwig, and directions from him how I was farther to proceed in what I intended. I crossed to Lothbury<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jones, Loyd &#x26; Co., 43 Lothbury.</note> with the bank-notes in my pocket; paid them in to the Commercial Bank Correspondent with proper specifications; and that same night wrote off to our Mother (who is in Dumfries these late weeks) to call at the Dumfries Office, receive the cash, take a Deposit Receipt for it in your name, with the interest payable to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> (exactly as the last was managed); and finally send me a token in the Courier Newspaper, that it had all happened as I projected, and was rightly <hi rend="italic">done</hi>. The token arrived yesterday; and tonight I am writing. No doubt you approve of my procedure? There was nothing to be made of the money here, and no use for it at present: it will buy our good Mother a gown before the time of need come; and will also lie safer than with me.&#x2014; In the City that day I met with Mr Martin of Kirkcaldy; visiting with his wife at Hamilton&#x2019;s<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Hamilton of Cheapside, merchant.</note> this Autumn: Hamilton was out for the moment; and Martin seeming to feel a more stinted kind of joy than I did at meeting, we did not let the interview last. In my perambulations too I had come upon a strange Anarchy of a place: the Stock Exchange.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Its new buildings, Capel Court, Bartholemew Lane, had been opened in <date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>, were extended in <date when="1854-00-00">1854</date> and at intervals thereafter.</note> About a hundred men were jumping and jigging about in a dingy contracted apartment, and yelping out all manner of sounds, which seemed to be Auctioneer-offers, not without much laughter and other miscellaneous tumult: I thought of the words &#x201C;Trade&#x2019;s contentious Hell,&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> but had no room for reflexions; a red-necked official coming up with the assurance that this place was &#x201C;private Sir,&#x201D; I departed with a &#x201C;thousand pardons,&#x201D; and satisfaction that I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> seen the Domdaniel.<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340521-TC-JWC-01">TC to JWC, <date when="1834-05-21">21 May</date></ref>.</note> These were my discoveries in the City.</p>
<p>Your kind Letter, my dear Jack, was read over with a feeling such as it merited: it went nearer my heart than anything addressed to me for long: I am not sure that there were not <hi rend="italic">tears</hi> in the business, but they were not sad ones. Your offers and purposes are worthy of a <pb id="pg-07-303" n="07-303"/>Brother, and I were but unworthy if I met them in any mean spirit: I believe there is no other man living from whom such offers as yours were other to me than a pleasant sound which I <hi rend="italic">must disregard;</hi> but it is not so with these; for I actually can (without damage to any good feeling in me), and will, if need be, make use of them: We will, as you say, stand by one another; and so each of us, were <hi rend="italic">all other men</hi> arrayed against us, have one Friend. Well that it is so! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Wohl ihm dem die Geburt den Bruder gab</hi></foreign> [Blessed is he whom birth gave a brother]!<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Schiller, <hi rend="italic">Die Braut von Messina</hi>, I, iv.</note> I will not speak any more about this; but keep it laid up in my mind as a thing to act by. I feel, as I once said, <hi rend="italic">double</hi>-strong in the possession of my poor Doil: and so I suppose we shall quarrel many times yet, and instantly agree again, and argue and sympathize, and, on the whole, <hi rend="italic">stand</hi> by one another thro&#x2019; good and evil, and turn two fronts to the world, while we are both spared in it. <hi rend="italic">Amen!</hi> There are many men wallowing in riches, splendent in dignities who have no such possession as this. Let us be thankful for it, and approve ourselves worthy of it.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As well as offering him financial help, John had written: &#x201C;I have no sufficient knowledge to qualify me for specially advising you. You will see much more clearly &#x26; widely than I can. The main thing I learnt during my stay in London regarding economical matters was in few words: &#x2018;<hi rend="italic">Whatever</hi> many have need of will be well rewarded. You have only to show <hi rend="italic">them</hi> that you have the thing to give which they stand in need of; to take their level and teach them something better from it&#x2014; By the way Is not Political Economy, in a right sense, the most important of all sciences in our times? and is it not like the Desert of Sahara as at present cultivated in England? I was forcibly struck with this on looking through some works on the subject before leaving Rome. Does not this also seem true to you? Look how the fractionary &#x2018;Illustrations of Miss Martineau<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied> have been received. Right knowledge on the subject I should presume could not fail to tell sooner or later.&#x201D;</note>&#x2014;</p>
<p>This small hand (and baddish pen) grievously cramps me; but my Paper is <hi rend="italic">small</hi> for the distance!&#x2014; Before entering on our London affairs, I must bring up the Annandale news; or rather Dumfriesshire ones, for we are not all in Annandale now. Some four weeks ago or more, our Mother went to Dumfries, to be near Jean on a certain interesting occasion; which, I think, has not yet arrived: I get a hieroglyphic notice weekly that they are all well; one week lately that there was a &#x201C;Letter from the Doctor.&#x201D; Nay, on the <date when="1834-08-16">16<hi rend="italic">th</hi> August</date>, there was a Letter in my Mother&#x2019;s own hand, which gratified me extremely: it is short, and in the heart of one from Jean; I think I will copy it for you: &#x201C;Dear Son&#x2014; After long and regretted silence, I may thank you for your kind attention. You ask how we go on at Scotsbrig: <pb id="pg-07-304" n="07-304"/>I am happy to say we do very well; they are very kind to me, and Jamie rejoices to see us agree so well. My health is better than when you saw me last. We have shifted the large bed, and dyed the curtains red; they are also up. We are putting a window in the little bedroom where I stay. Be easy in your mind as to me. Commit me to the care of the Great Shepherd, who careth for all that trust in him. May he enable us all to cast all our cares on him alone for time and for eternity, and seek his direction in all our undertakings. If so, I hope well of your french revolution [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and all other matters. May we therefore endeavour thro&#x2019; his strength alone to act.&#x2014; Peter Austin was in since I began to write: poor Glen is no otherwise. Peter has been down with bark, the last of it but one load: the wood is all gone long ago, as you will have heard, without sending for the neighbours&#x201D; (alluding to Peter&#x2019;s greed about the Craigenputtoch wood-weedings). &#x201C;What is Jane doing? I think she promised to write me. I think I see her on the deck waving her hand. I confess I was afraid. What reason of thankfulness have we that you got thro&#x2019; all so well! Give my best love to John when you write to him: he says much about faith; tell him to seek diligently after the author and finisher of it; and may we all have that faith that worketh by love and purifies the heart. Let us pray for each other; and tho&#x2019; separated for a time let us try to meet at God&#x2019;s throne of grace, where we are all welcome with our most enlarged petitions. I had a thousand such things to say; but let us both hope and quietly wait. I had a Letter from Mr Church, Kirkchrist, with the Magazines with many thanks: I was to tell the Dr but this you will do for me. You will see by Jean&#x2019;s I came direct from Mary&#x2019;s, and left them well. Pardon mistakes.&#x2014; Harry is plump and does well.&#x2014; &#x2018;Nothing more but half a drop.&#x2019;<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably coterie speech.</note>&#x2014; Your affectionate Mother.&#x201D;&#x2014; This is the whole Letter; written in a cramp but distinct hand, and with hardly any other difference than that of certain punctuations. The little piece, in its humble clearness, its genuine cheerful faith, and affection and simplicity will speak more to you than some volumes. May God long preserve to us such a Mother; and make her declining days bright with a light which passeth not away!&#x2014; There have been besides this two Letters from Grahame of Burnswark (one of them about Edward Irving); but no specialty of news; except this, That after the finest summer and growth of crops, they are getting the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> harvest (for heat and wet) within man&#x2019;s memory. Poor M&#x2019;Diarmid is eloquent on it every week; but &#x201C;last Thursday,&#x201D; <pb id="pg-07-305" n="07-305"/>there had been a favourable change:<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >There was a series of notices in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> on <date when="1834-09-03">3</date>, <date when="1834-09-10">10</date>, and <date when="1834-09-17">17 September</date>, first recording that &#x201C;the prospect is most gloomy for those who till the soil on the cheerful vale of Nith,&#x201D; but reviving as the weather finally brightened and the sheaves were &#x201C;carted to the barnyard by the light of the moon.&#x201D;</note> our weather here has been of the same damp <foreign><hi rend="italic">mooth</hi></foreign> [muggy] (<foreign><hi rend="italic">m&#xfc;de</hi></foreign>) [weary]<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle implies that the Scots and German terms were cognate as they probably were: <hi rend="italic">mooth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">muith</hi> applied to a person means &#x201C;oppressed or exhausted by heat.&#x201D;</note> kind, tho&#x2019; with less fall of rain, and changed too on that same day,&#x2014;that is, ten days ago now. I hope it is already much better-looking with their harvest there; I feel often what a dispiriting time they have of it. I wrote to Alick (as I perhaps told you); but have no answer yet, and know not whether his farm project is settled, or how. Old Ned Wield is dead at Ecclefechan (he was with my Father at Scotsbrig, the last day I saw either of them); also Irving the Schoolmaster (as I believe I did mention): and now the other day, our Newspapers announce that Blackwood the Bookseller in Edin<hi rend="italic">r</hi> is gone;<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Blackwood (see <ref target="volume-03/lt-18250108-TC-AC-01"><sic>3:242</sic><corr>TC to AC, <date when="1825-01-08">8 Jan. 1825</date></corr></ref>) died on <date when="1834-09-16">16 Sept.</date></note> alas poor Bailie! He was the likest man to my notion of Cagliostro, and I remember helped me to a feature or two.&#x2014; There is nothing else from Scotland worth dwelling on.</p>
<p>As to London and us there has little altered since I wrote. Our house is quiet, clean (above all, without <hi rend="italic">bugs!</hi>) and offers us a friendly shelter. We have got a Sinumbra Lamp too; opposite which, in the clearest glow, I am now writing; Jane reading at the other end of the table, and Goethe&#x2019;s Munich Picture looking down on us, over the China-jars &#x26;c, from above the mantel-piece; and a stillness (for it is Sunday night) equal to that of Puttoch. So many people are out of town at present, we are more solitary than usual; have not above a couple of visitors in the week: Hunt himself has ceased to <hi rend="italic">drop</hi> in, and only comes when sent for; which last arrangement is perhaps an improvement. On the whole, however, I am still too solitary; the companions I have are moreover wholly too unpractical, and I feel that they teach me almost nothing: <hi rend="italic">this</hi> evil, were people back again, I shall earnestly endeavour to mend. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">Bedenklichste</hi></foreign> [gravest thing] remains ever that I have not yet earned sixpence since I came hither; and see not that I am advancing towards such a thing: however, I do not &#x201C;<foreign>tine</foreign> [lose] heart&#x201D;; indeed, that money consideration gives me wonderfully little sorrow: we can hold out a <hi rend="italic">long time</hi> yet. It is very true also what you say that <hi rend="italic">soliciting</hi> among the Bibliopoles <pb id="pg-07-306" n="07-306"/>were the <hi rend="italic">worst</hi> policy. Indeed, I have no deeper wish than that bread for me, of the brownest sort, were providable elsewhere than with them. We shall not cease to try. One comfortable thing is the constant conviction I have that here or nowhere is the place for me: I must swim or sink <hi rend="italic">here</hi>. Withal too I feel the influences of the place on me; <hi rend="italic">rebuking</hi> much in my late ways of writing and speech; within my own heart I am led to overhaul many things, and alter or mourn for them: I might say generally that I am leading a rather painful but not unprofitable life. <foreign><hi rend="italic">At spes infracta</hi></foreign> [But hope unbroken]! I look up to the everlasting sky, and with the azure Infinitude all round me cannot think that I was made in vain. <hi rend="italic">These</hi> things, however, I do not well to speak of yet, or perhaps at all. The best news is that I have actually <hi rend="italic">begun</hi> that French Revolution; and after two weeks of blotching and <foreign>bloring</foreign> [blurring] have produced&#x2014;two clean pages! <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ach Gott!</hi></foreign> But my hand is out; and I am altering my style too, and troubled about many things; bilious too in these smothering windless days. It shall be such a Book! Quite an Epic Poem of the Revolution: an Apotheosis of Sansculottism! Seriously, when in good spirits, I feel as if there were the matter of a very considerable Work within me; but the task of shaping and uttering it will be frightful. Here, as in so many other respects, I am alone: without models, without <hi rend="italic">limits</hi> (this is a great want); and must&#x2014;just do the best I can. There is no danger of my <hi rend="italic">over</hi>-working myself, as you apprehend; but rather of the reverse. Mill votes strongly for having the <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> published as a Book; and half-jestingly even offered to print it at his own expense, that he might have the pleasure of reviewing it. This I could not consent to; but have again given Fraser the Book, who is actually reading it with intent to report on it: I expect little from publishing it, but wish it were off my hands.&#x2014; &#x2014; But the Supper is come (good Annandale porridge); and Jane insists that it is bedtime. The Letter I believe cannot go till Tuesday; so I may finish it tomorrow night. We are rather weary: I was at the Museum yesterday; and today we walked together to Parson&#x2019;s Green (close by Fulham). <closer><salute>Good Night, dear Brother!</salute></closer></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Monday Night</hi>, <date when="1834-09-22">22nd</date>.&#x2014; I have done a very little at my Book-scribblement, and now the night is again come, and I can finish out my say to you. In the course of the day a Letter has arrived from James Aitken, which brings us the good news that Jean has been happily delivered of a Boy, which with the mother is doing well. Poor Jean adds a line in her own hand (unsteadily written) that she is &#x201C;quite strong today&#x201D;; that they are to call the child Sandy. Our Mother was <pb id="pg-07-307" n="07-307"/>to have filled half the sheet; but Jamie had taken her to the Courthouse where the Circuit Judges were sitting; and she was too deeply interested in the procedure to quit, even for such a purpose, &#x201C;till she saw what became of the poor creature.&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As reported in the Dumfries <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi>, <date when="1834-09-24">24 September</date>, p. 3, there were seven cases, almost all for theft, with sentences ranging from the dismissal of the case to transportation for life&#x2014;the latter for robbery with violence of nineteen shillings, plus two previous convictions.</note> She and all the rest were well; Alick and Jamie well on with harvest, and the weather good since eight days. Wholly news we should be thankful for.&#x2014; &#x2014; To proceed now with my own London affairs. I said, we were rather solitary; yet except for practical purposes, we are not too solitary. People enough come about us, did they <hi rend="italic">bring</hi> much; if more of the like sort came, we might perhaps complain of time being wasted. Mill is ever a most theoretical man; yet well affected in a high degree; he is for the present out of town. Allan Cunningham we see pretty often; he is fully as good as when you knew him; a man that would be better if he saw rightly how. We have also fallen in with Rennie the Sculptor (an old friend of Jane&#x2019;s) and all his set; we dined last week with Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi> Manderson (of the Bridgewater:<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300806-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1830-08-06">6</date></ref>, and <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300821-TC-JAC-01"><date when="1830-08-21">21 Aug. 1830</date></ref>.</note> do you remember?) married to a Sister of his. Rennie is rather a sharp fellow, wholly <hi rend="italic">without</hi> poetic or plastic genius; full of Rome (whither by the way he holds out hope of getting you a <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdrockh</hi> conveyed soon); Manderston [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] is a good solid Sailor: the rest is all <hi rend="italic">gigmanitas gigmanitatum</hi> [of shallow respectability shallowly respectable], of no value whatever. Edward Irving I have actually seen twice; the last time he even came down hither, in one of his rides. Poor Fellow! With him <foreign><hi rend="italic">es nicht gar misslich aus</hi></foreign> [it is not at all promising]: his body and mind seem much broken; yet if he could but <hi rend="italic">live</hi>, we rather fancied he might shake off the Tongue-work. I earnestly indeed solemnly counselled him to retire and rest himself; which I am very glad to learn he has since done: Martin represented him as &#x201C;with a Clergyman in in [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] Somersetshire,&#x201D; and doing well. I partly design to get his address and write to him. The Pagoda in Newman St. goes on without him. My Lord Jeffrey, of whom we have heard nothing since <date when="1834-05-00">May</date>, sends indirectly inquiring our address: a sentimental Letter is to be anticipated; nothing more. I think kindly, gratefully of the man; but have nothing to say that would help him, wherein he could help me. The Austins are in Jersey; there is a Mrs Somerville here (in Chelsea) whom Mrs A. will introduce Jane to: a good woman, I believe. Oh <pb id="pg-07-308" n="07-308"/>the weary smallness of the Paper!&#x2014; You seem to be in a confused state of movement at present; or rather I hope you have already got anchorage again. Shall you try to practice in Rome during winter? By all means, my dear Brother, if there be the slightest feasibility in it. Judge when you are there: and perhaps <hi rend="italic">before</hi> that take some good moment and propose it to your Lady; considering how unoccupied you are, how isolated, and what you are looking forward to, she, as one would think, can hardly refuse. But you know the ground much better than I. The thing however that would give me most pleasure now about Rome were to hear that you actually had got begun in that way. Failing this, you have Books and a Pen; Senses and a Heart: struggle on till <date when="1835-05-00">May</date>, and then we shall resolve on something <hi rend="italic">courageous</hi>, and manfully in concert with each other prosecute it. Courage! The Devil <hi rend="italic">can</hi> get no more of man than was appointed him; we shall live yet and see good days.&#x2014; One patient I will promise you in <date when="1835-05-00">May</date>: myself. I really imagine you might do me service; there is evidently but little wrong with me, yet that little sadly important; I think, the liver: at all events, if you will undertake, I will, and faithfully adhere to your guidance till we try. Is not that an increase of faith, if not in Doctorship, yet in the Doctor? My health is certainly nowise <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than it was; yet it still continues different; and in any <hi rend="italic">free</hi> day, how light, joyful, skilful I am!&#x2014; On the whole, dear Jack, I wish you were here; and yet perhaps <date when="1835-05-00">May</date> is the best, and soon enough: I shall have seen into several things before that.&#x2014; Jane is well: she will write you a postscript about her attempted interview with Miss Morris. I have the margins left; but will here subscribe myself&#x2014; <closer><salute>Your Brother</salute></closer></p>
<name>T. Carlyle</name>
<ps><p>Jane is not ready with her Postscript, and I cannot rightly wait. She went on Saturday last to Bayswater; did not see Miss Morris, but only Mrs Smalley;<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Prim landlady to Miss Morris.</note> a Christian Gigwoman, who in measured style signified that the young lady was unwell, that &#x201C;perhaps she might see her some other day.&#x201D; To which a reply in like style being made (and Jane&#x2019;s card already in Miss M&#x2019;s hand), the interview terminated, the Ch<hi rend="italic">n:</hi>Gig<hi rend="italic">n:</hi>, much <hi rend="italic">relaxed</hi>, attending her to the door, &#x201C;as if by fascination.&#x201D; It was Jane&#x2019;s theory that she had shocked them all by <hi rend="italic">walking</hi> thither alone. If Miss M. see any prospect of doing good with us, she will call here; if not, we shall wish her well and love her in her own <pb id="pg-07-309" n="07-309"/>sphere. I fancy her as very lonely in the world, and necessarily much tied up by forms. For the rest, gigmanic Christianity is a thing I get little good of: such probably is that of Smalleydom, as indeed of Shovel-hat-dom at large.</p>
<p>[In JWC&#x2019;s hand:]</p>
<p><salute>&#x2014; My dear John</salute>  There is mighty little left for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to say. Even the affair of Morris which was by rig<supplied>[h]</supplied>ts <hi rend="italic">my own</hi> to make a kirk and mill of, he has compressed into a brief dry notice and so hindered me from making as I certainly might and should have done a highly interesting picture of it. <foreign>Console toi!</foreign> [Console yourself!] There is still place for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> love and that after all is the one thing needful<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>[In TC&#x2019;s hand again:]</p>
<p>I said something about Ben Nelson&#x2019;s eyes, on Irving&#x2019;s authority: I now find, it was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> an error of his, and Ben quite as of old&#x2014; Jock Thomson (once of Luce)<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340901-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, [<date when="1834-09-01">1 Sept.</date>]</ref>; Luce is a parish joined with Hoddam and Ecclefechan.</note> and M&#x2019;Queen (of Craigenputtoch)<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John M&#x2019;Queen.</note> called here one day in a cab! They were for Barnet fair.</p>
<p>Looking lately into the North American Review, their first article was a critique on my Life of Schiller, reprinted at Boston! They did not seem to know my name. The article was of the frothy grandiloquent commendatory Style; good enough for so frothy a Work. How things are tumbled to and fro!</p>
<p>Did you get Graham&#x2019;s Letter? He writes to me in the most overflowing manner: really a most excellent man; with generous affection enough to cover far more faults than his. He was clear for my taking Irving to task, and even <hi rend="italic">publishing</hi> about him! Did you ever see so small a hand? No more till tomorrow morning. I will try the <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> a little<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>
<p>I was on a Coroner&#x2019;s Inquest the other day as summoned juryman! It was very striking to me: &#x201C;Oyez! oyez! oyez! ye good men of this County&#x201D;!

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>Accept my thanks for your kind reception and distribution of the little Books: I am your debtor for not a few acts of the like sort before this; and, though I have your permission to repeat such applications, feel that I ought not to be troublesome. One reason of my writing again has still reference to that same Package. Six of those unhappy <hi rend="italic">Sartors</hi>, destined for Dumfries, were ordered to be included in your Parcel; and, if I remember, in the hurried Note addressed to you, the conveyance for them was pointed out: thro&#x2019; Oliver and Boyd, namely, to &#x201C;Mr M&#x2019;Kie, Bookseller, Dumfries.&#x201D; This Dumfries Package has never got thither, or been heard of there. I suspect, Fraser&#x2019;s people must have misdirected it: they are positive it went off, but can throw no farther light on it. I am thus under the necessity of again requesting help from you. Most probably it was only directed, &#x201C;Mrs Aitken, 24 English Street, Dumfries&#x201D;; and you are waiting for some cheap conveyance. If so, will you be so obliging as to inclose it in an additional cover addressed to M&#x2019;Kie as above, and send it to Messrs Oliver and Boyd: they send him a Parcel weekly, which I was made welcome to. Or if, as is possible, you have already done all this, will you take the new trouble of inquiring at Boyd&#x2019;s what the matter can be; and, on the whole, of somehow or other <hi rend="italic">getting</hi> this poor Packet put under way again,&#x2014;were it direct by the Mail, which will land it in few hours? I shall feel it obliging; and, as I said, study to give you a little respite henceforth.</p>
<p>You give me no Edinburgh news; which I regret, for my supply in that kind is very disproportionate to my demand, of late years. I see no Edinburgh men, few Edinburgh letters, hardly even any Edinburgh books. The last Number of <hi rend="italic">Tait</hi> (procured by special endeavour) is the only one for months. Will you <foreign>apropos</foreign> of this present my kind remembrances to Mr Dequincy, my respects and affectionate wishes for him: everything he writes I even while dissenting from it can eagerly read.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >De Quincey, as &#x201C;the English Opium Eater,&#x201D; had been writing regularly for <hi rend="italic">Tait&#x2019;s</hi> since <date when="1834-02-00">February</date>; his subjects (N.S., I [<date when="1834-08-00">Aug.</date> and <date when="1834-09-00">Sept.</date>], 482&#x2013;87, 509&#x2013;20) were one of the &#x201C;Sketches &#x2026; from the Autobiography of an English Opium Eater&#x201D; (<date when="1834-08-00">Aug.</date>) and Coleridge (<date when="1834-09-00">Sept.</date>).</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-311" n="07-311"/>You also appear to suppose that my connection with <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi> is Something and not Nothing. A total radical Error; which however is probably not of much moment.</p>
<p>The enclosed Essay is not by me, but by a very dear friend of mine.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The essay and its author have not been identified.</note> I think it rather good.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>All is right here at last; I have time now to send you news of myself, and also a Letter from the Doctor, which was more than bargain. I am afraid, you think me a very bad boy for putting off so long, especially when you had encouraged me by a Letter of your own: but I was in the thick of a Chapter of that <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, and wished particularly to finish it first; a result which proved unattainable for three or four days later than I expected. However, yesterday (having got it off my hands) I walked out eastward into the throng of the City, partly also to give myself the air; obtained the promise of a frank from Mill, which I hope to see today; then Jack&#x2019;s Letter, which arrived on Tuesday last, can go too, and tell you that he is still well. You will find that the Vesuvius Explosion was at a comfortable distance from him, and did not destroy any life, even of those that were nearest it:<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Carlyle had been alarmed by newspaper reports as in the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> of <date when="1834-09-27">27 Sept.</date>, quoting an alarming account of the destruction of 1,500 buildings; also reported in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, <date when="1834-09-22">22</date> and <date when="1834-09-24">24 Sept.</date></note> the Doctor and one of his ladies went up to see the ground after all danger was over, and looked at the lava &#x201C;forty feet deep.&#x201D; The thunderbolt which struck their house, and <pb id="pg-07-312" n="07-312"/>almost miraculously, harmed no one, was a much more perilous matter,&#x2014;to the like of which all of us are daily liable. How little thankful we are for escape, in comparison with what our sorrow would have been in the other case! We are car<supplied>[e]</supplied>less, thoughtless beings; and indeed as Jack says, it need not require a thunderbolt to make us consider how fearfully and wonderfully we hover in the midst of danger all our days, and are mercifully preserved nevertheless till our hour come.&#x2014; The good Doctor is well, which is a great blessing to us; and we can hope to see him, were the summer come again; and to keep him nearer home for the future.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I did not write directly after Mary&#x2019;s Letter<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1834-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, when their mother, after nursing Jean Aitken in Dumfries, was visiting her before returning to Scotsbrig. Mrs. Carlyle had added a paragraph to Mary&#x2019;s letter.</note> was my desire to ascertain first what was to be said about that Chelsea Provision-barrel, which you had set off to get ready for us. I wrote to Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For William Hamilton, merchant of Cheapside, formerly of Sanquhar, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note> (an old friend, from Sanquhar, who dwells near the shipping region here) asking what the circumstances, fare, time &#x26;c of that Whitehaven Shipping Company were: he did not answer me for above a week; and then only answered that the people could answer him <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>. We had, indeed, already determined or next to it that it would be better to have nothing to do with them; but to trust to Liverpool, where we already knew the conveyance was sure: at the rate of some six shillings a hundred-weight. Your plan therefore will be to give up the Potatoes altogether (for we can get them here, good enough, tho&#x2019; dear), and get us fifteen stone of Oatmeal, and pack this, with the sixty pounds of Scotsbrig butter (in two pigs), into a moderate barrel, and send it off by the Steamboat. The oatmeal I need but bid Mr Carlill procure at Satur Mill, and before all things exceedingly <hi rend="italic">dry</hi> (since it will have to stand so long); the butter, I fancy will stand very safe in it: Jane once spoke of bacon hams, but now despairs of there being any to be got at this season. I mention only farther that our house-doors (even the outer door) are not more than 3 feet wide, so the barrel must not be more; let the meal be well rammed into it, and we need not take it out except as we need it. Finally, direct it to us here: &#x201C;to be forwarded from Liverpool by Messrs Pickford and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, by Canal.&#x201D; If Jamie go down with it to Annan, Ben Nelson, or Nicholson, or any of them will write the direction as it ought to be written (plain, large, and on a Card); <pb id="pg-07-313" n="07-313"/>&#x201C;Pickford and C<hi rend="italic">o</hi>, and by Canal&#x201D; is all that he has to remember. The Pickfords are the most extensive and the most punctual Carriers in the world: in less than a fortnight after you give it to the Steampeople, the barrel (if nothing happen it) will be sitting safe here.&#x2014; It will seem absurd enough to tell you that we are in haste, now after waiting so long: but the truth is, our meal has been done for a fortnight, and we have had the strangest shifts for a supper (among others, flour-porridge; exactly, <hi rend="italic">Shoemaker&#x2019;s paste</hi>, only clean); and at last have been obliged to take to some of the &#x201C;Scotch oatmeal&#x201D; sold in the shops here,&#x2014;very dear (5<hi rend="italic">d</hi> for a quart by measure), very rough, and not always very <hi rend="italic">sound</hi>. However, we have got a small stock now (7 pounds for 18 pence), which tho&#x2019; rough <hi rend="italic">is</hi> quite sound; which therefore we can thankfully use. So you need not suppose us starving. The Butter too is almost always excellent (churned, I believe, out of milk); at the easy rate of 16 pence a pound! In regard to provision, I shall only add that the Beef-ham daily plays its part at breakfast, and proves thoroughly <hi rend="italic">genuine</hi>. The Butcher came here one day to saw the bone of it; and asked with amazement, whether it was <hi rend="italic">pork</hi> or not? He had never heard of any ham, but a bacon one; and departed from us with a <hi rend="italic">new idea</hi>.&#x2014; N.B. We get coffee to breakfast (at 8 or nearly so), have very often mutton-chops to dinner (at 3), then tea at 6; we have 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi> worth of cream, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi> worth of milk daily: this is our diet; which I know <hi rend="italic">you</hi> would rather know than not know.</p>
<p>But now quitting the Pantry and Buttery, let me tell you a little of the upstairs work; which you have got too little of lately. In regard to health, we have every reason to be thankful: Jane is evidently better than she used to be; I no worse at least: I had a pitiful fraction of a Cold some fortnight ago, but it has now left me, and even better than it found me. I am making no money, but can do without any for a long time (for we live very cheap), and wait till I see which of the many courses of making a little will be the best for me, that of Literature being now so confused and even dishonest a way. In the mean time, I sit busy at my Book, which is the only thing I have any business to think of at present: it goes along not so badly; I have three little Chapters of it fairly done, and so the <hi rend="italic">rusty wheel</hi> is in motion; and I ought to think that like &#x201C;a begun turn,&#x201D; it is half ended. When once I get fairly afloat in work, I do not care a farthing for all the obstructions of this Devil&#x2019;s den of a world, were it twice as bad. Thou too, as I say to myself, hast a small fraction of a gift: God has given it thee, the Devil shall not take it away! Unfortunately I cannot now run over to Scotsbrig, when I have got a little job done: but you <pb id="pg-07-314" n="07-314"/>see, I write; which is the next best; and by and by I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> run over too, and meet you again (if the good Providence permit), and tell you a whole bag of news. There is plenty of work here for me; and hundred thousands of more feckless characters than I make a living of it too: so I whistle up Johnny O&#x2019;Cox, and fear nothing. They may use my poor <hi rend="italic">Revolution</hi> well or ill, or not notice it at all if they like that better: it is a very indubitable fact that no service God meant me to do <hi rend="italic">can</hi> remain undone; and should one not &#x201C;learn therewith to be content&#x201D;?<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Phil. 4:11.</note> Jane rather fancies, however, that this will prove a more readable kind of Book: it shall be the best I, in these circumstances, can make it; and then if the people like to read it, we shall wish them great profit of it.&#x2014; I am afraid, you make nothing or very little of <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh;</hi> which however I am very glad to know that you have got: I wrote to Tait at Edinburgh about it, and that, I suppose, had set it under way again. Do the best you can with it! Take it any way as a token of my love. By and by you shall get this &#x201C;more readable&#x201D; one.</p>
<p>Our friends now are all coming back: we were at Mrs Austin&#x2019;s lately (who has been in Jersey, France &#x26;c, and returns as affectionate as ever); we had Mill long last night; have seen the Cunninghams &#x26;c &#x26;c. We spend the evenings very comfortably without company too; reading, for the morrow&#x2019;s writing; or even writing when the <hi rend="italic">task</hi> is behind hand. The <foreign><hi rend="italic">bield</hi></foreign> [sheltered] situation of Chelsea is in our favour now, the <date when="1834-10-00">October</date> gusts can get no painful hold of us; our weather too has been dry and pleasant (till these late days) better I fear than yours. We see comparatively little of the Hunts for some weeks; they have sickness in the house, and many sad cares: poor Hunt himself I think one of the most innocent men I ever saw in man&#x2019;s size; a very boy for clear innocence, tho&#x2019; his hair is grey, and his face ploughed with many sorrows. I have met some new people too, not without worth; meet with nothing but regard and kindness from every one.&#x2014; No other domestic news, except this, that our Servant Bessy is gone home to Birmingham again, after a month&#x2019;s warning, some days ago. She was a quiet useful creature in the house; but quite sorrow-stricken for Badams (and the strange questionable things she had suffered and witnessed with him), and felt that she could have &#x201C;no comfort anywhere,&#x201D; for the present, but would be better with her mother than elsewhere. We were very sorry for the poor girl; but, on the whole, rather glad to see her go than otherwise. <pb id="pg-07-315" n="07-315"/>Her violence of feeling, her strange diseased state of mind, were quite <hi rend="italic">foreign</hi>-looking things in our still bit of a household. By what seems great good fortune (for Servants here seem <hi rend="italic">worse</hi> than even with you) we have got another very decent-looking innocent kind of creature<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Ireland.</note> (of whose character there can be no doubt) who had been brought lately from Lancaster by some of Mrs Montague&#x2019;s people: she keeps everything again as tight as need be, and looks out far too red-cheeked, and glad that she has got a shelter, to be unhappy. Lastly we have <hi rend="italic">removed up-stairs</hi> this day; for I cannot write without fires any longer; and this is a larger room than either <hi rend="italic">half</hi> of the ground-floor one, where we are obliged to shut the folding-doors in winter time: so Jane sits here sewing, and I before her (at one of the three windows), and all is as comfortable as it ought. I stick by my diminished quantity of Tobacco; or even diminish it still more (for my Edinburgh Pipes are done, and the Liverpool ones far smaller): Mundell&#x2019;s<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Robert Mundell, tobacconist, High St., Dumfries.</note> man furnishes me with the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> kind of weed (at 3/10 a pound), which is a great <hi rend="italic">comfort</hi> to me. <hi rend="italic">Finally</hi> (which is later than <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;lastly&#x201D;!</hi>) I have got on my brown-grey <hi rend="italic">socks</hi>, which are as they before were the best foot-clothing I ever had.&#x2014; Is not this minute enough?</p>
<p>Jean&#x2019;s Newspaper has just arrived; and has <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the strokes on it: may I hope, it was only forgetfulness? I wish she had not forgotten! Tell Jamie (Aitken) I was much obliged by his Letter, and right glad of the news: my only fault to him was his <hi rend="italic">brevity</hi>. I will write to them soon, when franks get rifer. Mary&#x2019;s Letter was as welcome as Letter could be: Jane said &#x201C;none of them but poor Mary will write to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&#x201D;! I believe the Dame means to add some kind of Answer to this frank.&#x2014; Does not Alick think he should have written to me long ago? Tell him the harvest is now done; and he is standing greatly <hi rend="italic">in his own light</hi>.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note> If I have any time tomorrow, I will add a little scrap for him.</p>
<p>But how are you yourself, my dear Mother? I only wished your Note had been a yard long: the other one is sent off <foreign><hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi></foreign> to Rome,&#x2014;but this is a <hi rend="italic">secret</hi> between ourselves! I fancy you now in your two upper rooms, and beginning to get <foreign><hi rend="italic">hefted</hi></foreign> [adjusted]. I beg of you to keep a <hi rend="italic">rousing</hi> fire on; there is nothing else can withstand the weather and damp there. Is Jenny with you again? Tell her that she and you must make out a Letter hither without delay; at latest, when the Barrel goes off. Tell me what you have got to read? I mean <pb id="pg-07-316" n="07-316"/>some time to send you a few Books; but know not whether they were worth the direct carriage, 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi> a pound. You should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> be without Books. Tell me what you do: whether you have begun to spin that far-famed Dressing-gown? I think, you had better give it <hi rend="italic">out</hi> to be done. Keep within-doors, dear Mother, in the wild weather. The Spring will come; and the Summer, and, if it please God, your two Sons! In the dull winter, you shall not want for Letters. I wish I knew anything I could do for you! One thing I can always do is to love you, and pray from my heart of hearts that it may be well with you.&#x2014; I will add a word on the Cover when it comes.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The cover of this letter is missing.</note> <closer><salute>Good day till then, dear Mother!

<salute>My Dear Sister,</salute>
<p>A frank is going to our Mother, with a Letter from our good Doctor in it: this paper is so thin that I hope it may go too without <hi rend="italic">exceeding</hi> the weight. They can send it you by Notman, and give you the comfort of <hi rend="italic">calling</hi> it a Letter.</p>
<p>I was very greatly pleased by the news your goodman so punctually despatched me;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >James Aitken&#x2019;s letter, bringing news of the birth of a son the day before, had been dated <date when="1834-09-20">20 Sept.</date> See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340921-TC-JAC-01">TC to JAC, <date when="1834-09-21">21 Sept.</date></ref></note> pray thank him in my name, and say I wish he would write soon again,&#x2014;and improve in one particular only: in length. Other fault I have none to find with him. And now let me hope you are continuing to do well, and that poor little Sandy (poor little Newcomer!) complains of nothing hitherto in these strange new quarters he has got into. Poor little fellow! He is a Sandy the Second, or even Sandy the Third, of my acquaintance: may he prove no worse man than his foregoers, and a happier one! His Grandfather of the name<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s maternal uncle. See <ref target="volume-05/lt-18300129-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, [<date when="1830-01-29">29 Jan. 1830</date>]</ref>.</note> had a hard battle to fight, but fought it, too, like a man; and so left the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> inheritance for those he loved. I am often reminded of him here: there is a queer kind of <hi rend="italic">sub</hi>-likeness to him in our good neighbour Leigh Hunt,&#x2014;who also is one of the most elastic unconquerable innocent minded mortals I ever met with.&#x2014; But tell me how <pb id="pg-07-317" n="07-317"/>the little fellow gets on, and what he says to it. Very little yet I fancy; he is too busy considering what a singular concern it is.</p>
<p>The Doctor, whose Letter they may possibly send you, is well, and come back to the neighbourhood of Rome; he saw the great Eruption of Vesuvius from a safe distance; has been on the top of it since: their House was fearfully enough struck with lightning, some time after; but they all escaped without damage. A most providential mercy,&#x2014;for which it is singular to think how inadequately thankful we are. He spoke in a former Letter of trying to practice in Rome (where he is to be again from about the <date when="1834-11-00">beginning of November</date>); a thing I strongly encouraged him in: but whether that will turn to anything is not clear yet. He and we with him hope to see you all next summer.</p>
<p>Nothing is passing with us here that is of great singularity: nothing in any case that can make <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> news. I toil away at my Book, and hope it will not be so bad a Book; and ready before the Spring end. It is a <hi rend="italic">huge,</hi> hideous subject; and what I have got to say on it has not all been said elsewhere.&#x2014; I am glad the other Books have come: there is one off to Rome now too; and so that matter is ended, and we take up the <hi rend="italic">next</hi> head of method.</p>
<p>Your Newspaper came yesterday; but no <hi rend="italic">two strokes</hi> on it: was that obliviousness? I will try to hope and believe it was no more. I depend on you for writing to me, at any rate, if anything go wrong.&#x2014; Tell me how all is; what James is doing; where his work lies; how he holds out against the spirit of Quackery which is in all trades, in his as well as mine. I wish I were not too far for sending you Books: but 5 pence a pound, Carriage, is too dear for the most of them.&#x2014; We had a Letter from Mary, most welcome to us:<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1834-10-06">6 Oct.</date>, addressed to Jane. Jane&#x2019;s reply has not been found. Although Mary&#x2019;s letter was in the main cheerful, it brought the news of the death of James Johnston&#x2019;s wife at Haddington.</note> Jane has been writing a little ack<supplied>[now]</supplied>ledgement of it to go with this: we hope to hear good accounts of her and her household; you will not forget them when you write.&#x2014; The Parliament fire<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >It broke out just before 7:00 p.m. on <date when="1834-10-16">16 Oct.</date>, and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> reported next day: &#x201C;We scarcely ever recollect to have seen the large thoroughfare of the town so thronged before. &#x2026; The spectacle was one of surpassing though terrific splendour.&#x201D;</note> was noticed out of our back top-windows, and I went up to it for two hours. The people had done speaking of it, before next day was done: that is their way here. It was but a low confused mass of houses, and did not (the people complained) &#x201C;make a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> fire&#x201D;! &#x201C;Come now,&#x201D; they said at times when <pb id="pg-07-318" n="07-318"/>something flamed up, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s not so bad tho&#x2019;!&#x201D;&#x2014; Write to us, or make James write.

<salute>My Dear Alick,</salute>
<p>It is many a long day since you sent me the <hi rend="italic">scrape of a pen;</hi> you are in my debt too I believe for one very long Letter (or more?), and still persist in Silence. This is not right; tho&#x2019; I know writing is a great burden to you, and from day to day some new thing or other is turning up to frustrate the purpose you may form in my behalf that way. Well! I look for a Frank today; and will send you this thin memorial of me: whether you answer or not, I shall know that <hi rend="italic">it</hi> gives you pleasure, and never doubt that you send me (in heart at least) your thanks and best brotherly wishes.</p>
<p>We have a new winter at our door; all, as I fancy it, has been got under <hi rend="italic">thatch and rope</hi> about Catlinns; not without an effort, as I often fancied when thinking of you on the wet harvest days. But the thing I have no means even of guessing here is what arrangement you have formed, or whether any yet, with your poor needy and greedy Landlords. Are you to leave that <hi rend="italic">Knowe-head</hi> [knoll-head] at Whitsunday; or have they lowered your rent so as to make it tolerable and payable? This last is perhaps the way I ought to wish it, so wasteful are all <hi rend="italic">changes</hi>. However, I am very anxious to know.&#x2014; In any case, be of good heart, my dear Brother: let no difficulties darken your mind, or beat down the rigorous energy that is in you. &#x201C;To be <hi rend="italic">weak</hi> is miserable,&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost,</hi> I, 157.</note> says the Poet Milton: <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is the only misery for a man. I am a poor comforter for I preach up nothing but toil, toil; yet such is the <hi rend="italic">truth,</hi> if we saw it, for all men: and for all genuine men, <pb id="pg-07-319" n="07-319"/>is there not the sure hope of a <hi rend="italic">reward?</hi> Persevere, then: &#x201C;in due time ye shall reap if ye faint not.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Gal. 6:9.</note></p>
<p>What passes with myself here I have mainly described in Letters to my Mother, and others of them, which most probably you have seen. The world looks rough on me, but not hostile; I feel that I shall have labour enough, and what payment I ask from the world: meat and clothes. There is nothing like the <hi rend="italic">deep sulkiness</hi> of Craigenputtoch troubles me here: I see always that I am in the right workshop, had I but got acquainted with the <hi rend="italic">tools</hi> properly; here I must stand to it; here or nowhere!&#x2014; My Mother will tell you that I am getting on with my new French Book: it is calculated that I ought to have it out about <date when="1835-03-00">March</date> next (that being what they call &#x201C;a good time,&#x201D; the Parliament and Fashionables all on the spot): but whether I can keep my day or not, will depend somewhat on fortune. I strive to be as diligent as possible in all senses and do my best.&#x2014; You have got the old Puttoch <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> (I hear), the <hi rend="italic">last</hi> I wrote near you; and will prize it on that account, I believe: it is <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> there you see, and cannot now be burnt or lost; and so if there be any good in it, the world has it; if none there is little harm done. I find strictly <hi rend="italic">few</hi> to admire it, but then actually a few; and great multitudes to turn up their eyes in speechless amazement.</p>
<p>I saw the fire of the two Parliament Houses; and, what was curious enough, Matthew Allen (of York, you remember) found me out in the crowd there, whom I had not seen before for years.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Matthew Allen, see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200519-TC-MAL-01"><sic>1:250</sic><corr>TC to MAL, <date when="1820-05-19">19 May 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> The crowd was quiet, rather <supplied>[gratified]</supplied> than otherwise; <hi rend="italic">whew&#x2019;d</hi> and whistled when the breeze came as if to encourage it: &#x201C;there&#x2019;s a <hi rend="italic">flare-up</hi>&#x201D; (what we call <hi rend="italic">shine</hi>) &#x201C;for the House O&#x2019; Lords!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;A judgement for the Poor-Law Bill!&#x201D;&#x2014; &#x201C;There go their <hi rend="italic">hacts</hi>&#x201D; (acts)!&#x2014;such exclamations seemed to be the prevailing ones. A man <hi rend="italic">sorry</hi> I did not anywhere see.&#x2014; They will have to build a new house; and it may produce consequences not generally forseen yet.</p>
<p>Poor Edward Irving is at this moment I believe in Glasgow: the accounts I get of him (from Will<hi rend="italic">m</hi> Hamilton)<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The merchant of Cheapside, formerly of Sanquhar, who had married Edward Irving&#x2019;s sister.</note> fill me with pain. He is in the worst state of health, and will not rest; threatened with Consumption; it now at last begins to seem too likely to me, that the conclusion of all that wild work, will be <hi rend="italic">early death!</hi> Oh dear, what a tragedy is Life to most of us; often to those that seemed the luckiest! <pb id="pg-07-320" n="07-320"/>I know not what to do in this matter of poor Irving, and can for the present do nothing but grieve.</p>
<p>Alas, my dear Boy, here is the en<supplied>[d of my]</supplied> Paper! There will be more franks going soon, and I shall afford you better measure&#x2014; Give our love to Jenny;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Alick&#x2019;s wife.</note> lovingly guide and encourage her in all right ways, as is your duty and engagement. Little Jane I suppose is become a very &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">conversical</hi>&#x201D; little <foreign><hi rend="italic">Kimmer</hi></foreign> [gossip] by this time: even Tom must be beginning to make his observations. Be thankful for them, and yet earnestly anxious: regard them as a gift and a solemn obligation. Write soon. <closer><salute>May all good be with you and yours my dear Brother! I am ever Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<p><salute>My Dear Mother,&#x2014;</salute>The Frank came yesterday, but dated for today; so I finish it out, and take it up to Town with me, as I go to Fraser the Bookseller&#x2019;s to consult about scribbling matters; specially about a Manuscript, which a certain unknown well-wisher of mine in Liverpool has entrusted me with. Manuscripts indeed have been flowing in of late; so that at this time I have no fewer than <hi rend="italic">four</hi> in my hands.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not identified.</note> It may be an honour, but is no profit: however, one cannot refuse poor people that petition civilly.</p>
<p>Along with the Frank, Mill sent me a whole pile of new Books, some of them I think almost specially <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> for me: indeed nothing can exceed the obligingness of Mill; I had already as many Books of his as would load a considerable <hi rend="italic"><foreign>cuddy</foreign>-cart</hi> [donkey-cart]; all lent me for unlimited periods; a perfect outfit for this present enterprize of mine. So I hope, when I write next, it will be that I have got <hi rend="italic">done</hi> with that &#x201C;Taking of the Bastille,&#x201D; which is now my next task (or Chapter IV): yet it will not be without a hard <foreign><hi rend="italic">tuffle;</hi></foreign> for if the reading of a <hi rend="italic">Shaiptur</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;<foreign><hi rend="italic">Tuffle</hi></foreign>&#x201D; is a scuffle or rough-and-tumble, a variant of <foreign><hi rend="italic">taffle</hi></foreign> (probably of echoic or imitative origin), not connected with <hi rend="italic">tussle</hi> though the meaning is the same. &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">Shaiptur</hi>&#x201D; is interesting as an example of the sound <hi rend="italic">sh</hi>- for <hi rend="italic">ch</hi>-, which is attested for various parts of Scotland including Dumfriesshire in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and still exists in the Shetlands, Orkney, and parts of the eastern Borders. Carlyle is using, not an idiosyncratic mis-pronunciation, but the survival into the 1830s of a genuine dialect form.</note> be so easy, the writing of one is another matter.</p>
<p>There was no <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> this week; Hunt bids me tell you that whenever one is missed there will be <hi rend="italic">two</hi> next week: he is a much-harrassed <pb id="pg-07-321" n="07-321"/>confused poor man; sits in the middle of a distracted uproar that would make many a one mad. I borrowed an <hi rend="italic">old</hi> Paper from him, that you might not be altogether disappointed: he sent me one of <hi rend="italic">Jany last;</hi> ten months old; which I should think is among the <supplied>[ol]</supplied>dest ever went by post. However, I marked upon it that you were to have a Letter next day.&#x2014; Whenever the two <hi rend="italic">strokes</hi> are wanting, look strictly in the inside; you will usually find some word; tho&#x2019; it is a thing I study to avoid when possible. The Newspaper should be at Ecclefechan ready for you after <hi rend="italic">Preaching:</hi> but disappointments may occur too, for we are nearly two miles from the Post-Office (one close by charges an additional two-pence), and if it were a very wild afternoon, one might lurk within doors.&#x2014; The weather seems indeed to be far drier here; not <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the number of wet days thro&#x2019; summer; but then every wet day <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a wet one, a perfect splash. Within this week it has grown clear and <hi rend="italic">bitter,</hi> very agreeable to me, for the speediest walking will not heat <supplied>[one]</supplied> too much.&#x2014; I again beg of you, dear Mother, to <hi rend="italic">use</hi> fires and flannel! I shall not be easy till I hear how you take with the winter at Scotsbrig: take a sheet yourself, and <hi rend="italic">deliberately</hi> tell me everything; I know whoever disappoints me in Letters it will not be you,&#x2014;were you once fairly in the way to write. Give our love to James and our new Sister; tell us how they get on, and what way you all manage together: I think with your experience affection and patience, nothing material can go wrong for the time.&#x2014; We were very glad to hear you had been at Templand: when you go to Dumfries, especially in the fair-weather season, it is not so far out of your way. We have not heard from Mrs Welsh since.&#x2014; I have mentioned in Alick&#x2019;s Note something about Edward Irving, who I fear is in a very bad way: it seems all-too probable he will not live long!&#x2014; The Parliament Fires you will hear all about by and by in the Newspapers: I saw the conflagration; have since seen the sorting out of of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the rubbish: great quantities of half-burnt papers (petitions &#x26;c) flying about; nobody seemed to care a farthing about the accident, most were rather glad to see it going on. The present Ministry, I think, cannot last very long,<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >On the death of his father, <date when="1834-11-10">10 Nov.</date>, Lord Althorp became 3rd Earl Spencer and had to relinquish the leadership of the House of Commons to move to the Lords. This further weakened Melbourne&#x2019;s Whig ministry, and the king was glad to accept his resignation on <date when="1834-11-14">14 Nov.</date></note> and times of trouble still seem brewing <pb id="pg-07-322" n="07-322"/>in the distance. These things concern <hi rend="italic">us</hi> little. Our <hi rend="italic">home</hi> lies elsewhere, where we shall soon be; wise were it could we work patiently while here, and &#x201C;walk <hi rend="italic">humbly</hi> with our God&#x201D;!<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mic. 6:8.</note> There is much in that last consideration, the beginning of all peace; but the root of the old Adam is in us all from the beginning.&#x2014; I am doing nothing but tattle, dear Mother; I must end now. Do not forget to thank poor Mary in my name too for her Letter, and tell me punctually how James and she are getting on. I hope and trust there is no fear of them, You will give my kind regards to Grahame, and mention to him what Jack says about receiving his Letter.&#x2014; Jane has a little headache today, and sits reading here: she bids me send her kind affection to you all in the kindest words I can. She makes the breakfast herself (like the <hi rend="italic">Tod</hi> running his own errand<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial. A &#x201C;tod&#x201D; is a fox.</note>) of late months, as formerly; and has, as poor Irving said, &#x201C;always a little bower of elegance round her be where she will&#x201D;:<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences,</hi> II, 215&#x2013;16.</note> in truth, a <foreign>shifty</foreign> [resourceful], true, <foreign>gleg</foreign> [quickly perceptive] little creature, worth any twenty Cockney wives that I have yet met with.&#x2014; Now write soon my dear Mother: for <hi rend="italic">all</hi> sakes take care of yourself. <closer><salute>May the great Father ever bless and guard you!&#x2014;Your affectionate,</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Brother,</salute>
<p>About a week ago, your Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Of <date when="1834-10-04">4 Oct.</date></note> which had been rather longed for, arrived to make us a happy day; and even now, I daresay, it may be doing similar service at Scotsbrig; for I sent it off thither in a frank, with store of other news last Saturday. Our Mother was very anxious about you, by reason of that Eruption of Vesuvius, which I had striven, probably with no full success, to convince her, did not much concern you. As you say, if we were not stupid creatures there needed not thunderbolts and volcanic explosions to teach us by what tenure we hold our life! Dangers deep as the Infinite Abyss environ <pb id="pg-07-323" n="07-323"/>us at all moments; nevertheless till <hi rend="italic">our</hi> moment come, we are preserved, and work as if in safety. One other remark I cannot but make, in reference to that fearful death that has passed so near you: it is How unfair we are in estimating our own lot. What a small tho&#x2019; never so hearty joy we feel at this providential escape of yours, compared with what our endless sorrow would have been had the devouring lightning buried you in that ruin! It is thus everywhere: we <hi rend="italic">strike our average</hi> far too high, and at best even if we be &#x201C;very glad&#x201D; are seldom &#x201C;very thankful.&#x201D;&#x2014; On the whole, however, one feels satisfied to know you fairly out of that Neapolitan Elysium-Tartarus; again safe and lighter of heart in a scene that you are more at home with: let us hope that your next great movement will be northward, across the Alps and sea, hither to Cheyne Row and Annandale!<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had written:
&#x201C;The <date when="1834-08-00">end of August</date> and the <date when="1834-09-00">beginning of September</date> were unusually hot and sultry. There had been no rain for a long while, and Vesuvius was raging and disturbing the usual currents of sea-air which keep the bay of Naples so fresh in the hottest seasons. A day or two after I sent off my last letter to you the huge mass of rubbish which had been successively thrown up since the last great eruption of <date when="1822-00-00">1822</date> and stood like a second cone upon the broken top of the great cone which you see in all the drawings of Vesuvius, suddenly fell in breaking its support and disappearing altogether, causing an earthquake at Portici &#x26; Resina. The mountain then slumbered sullenly, and the atmosphere was unusually still and sultry, for two or three days, when all at once a cloud of smoke, vapour, ashes and stones burst forth to the height of several thousand feet. We could discern the current as it was issuing from the crater even at our villa on the Vomano, and the whole mass looked very much like one of our Italian pines spreading wider and wider as the impelling force was more and more exhausted. There were frequent loud noises like thunder continuing for more than twenty four hours, a number of large but insufficient streams of lava kept flowing from our side of the crater towards Resina, and there was also a hole low down the mountain through which lava was issuing forcibly. I wish you could have seen as we did what a splendid scene was made at night by these burning streams, the red hot stones and ashes, the tall column of smoke illuminated every few seconds by the glare of the crater itself as it was belching, and by frequent flashes of forked lightening which appeared to dart with the smoke and vapour from the clear atmosphere. The noise and raging did not cease till a large hole was suddenly opened low down on the other side of the mountain, &#x26; let out the internal lava, which flowed about eight or nine miles chiefly in the direction of Nocera, destroying many houses vineyards and trees in its course. We went to see the half cooled mass where it had stopped, and found it about three quarters of a mile broad and varying from twelve to forty feet deep. It was only six miles from Castellamare &#x26; I saw it twice while we were there. No lives were lost and indeed the lava is never dangerous if those exposed to it will take any warning at all.&#x201D;</note> Meanwhile I need not exhort you again to do whatever you possibly can (for I know you are doing it) towards getting some professional occupation for your spare hours at Rome: there is no way in which one would like so well to know you employed, both for your present <pb id="pg-07-324" n="07-324"/>satisfaction and future interests. Never (as I have long felt) till a man get into practical contact with the men round him, and learn to take and give influence there, does he enjoy the free consciousness of his existence. Alas I have long felt this, and felt it in vain. Nevertheless there is a kind of inextinguishable hope in me that it <hi rend="italic">shall not</hi> always be so; that once, for some short season, I shall live before I die. With you the prospect is much nearer and surer: if not at Rome, this winter, then here in England, say next winter, you shall actually try what force is in you to work in you vocation. The difficulties for us both, as we often admit, are great; but we will front them resolutely, and by God&#x2019;s grace they shall not conquer us. At lowest and worst, you have still reading, the power of study, reflexion and observation to fill your winter with. The great thing is to take care of the <hi rend="italic">hours,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">months</hi> will take care of themselves. If there is anything still in Rome that you have not mastered according to your wants, think that you may not have another opportunity there. All this of Art, Pictures Architecture and so forth, I feel, were most sapless provender for my poor soul at present: at the same time I see more and more that there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> something in all that; an indisputable element of our modern existence; which I could still wish (and some years ago could have much more passionately wished) to understand and make mine. On the whole, dear Doctor, I will give you up to your good genius; adding only my hopes, especially my wishes and prayers which you always have. I like to hear of your Journal: there is always a benefit in that; were it only that in writing down things we are forced to think of them more distinctly. Go on, in all true ways, and prosper!</p>
<p>With regard to our British affairs, take the comfort of knowing that all is much as it was; and nothing worse than that. We had a Letter from Mary at Annan, not long ago, in which again was a little section by our Mother herself. She was there on her way home from Dumfries, where she had just left Jean and her child doing very well: Jamie (of Scotsbrig) seemed to be with her, &#x201C;in the market,&#x201D; running about, and had just seen Ben Nelson, who had that day received his <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh,</hi> and read a chapter of it. Our good Mother spoke cheerfully; seemed to be well; was very desirous of news, which, as above said, she has now got. They said nothing of Waugh, to whom also I had sent a <hi rend="italic">Teufel</hi>k. Mary who never talks in the language of complaint represented her husband as getting a full share of what work was going; and all things with them as quite tolerably prosperous. I sometimes send her an old Newspaper, when I have one; Jane, <pb id="pg-07-325" n="07-325"/>to whom that Letter was addressed, wrote to her since by the late frank.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane&#x2019;s letter to Mary has not been found.</note> No word of Glen; whose state, I fear with you, is hopeless for the present. Alick will not write; nor do I hear what arrangement is made with his farm: Mary mentioned him as well, and &#x201C;talking about writing.&#x201D; Their harvest, I understand, was very wet at first, but grew dry enough in the end. We have sent for some Oatmeal and Butter out of Annandale, and shall probably hear again ere long. The money &#x26;c was all right; as indeed you might learn by my former Letter, which I fancy would reach you before yours got to me.&#x2014; As to London the only news with us is that the new <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> is fairly under way, and doing not so badly. The first three Chapters are finished; and now there is a kind of pause for a day or two before I start with the fourth, which may be headed <hi rend="italic">&#x201C;Taking of the Bastille&#x201D;!</hi><note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Now described in Book V, chapters 6 and 7.</note> One knows not well what to think of so singular an attempt as it is; for tho&#x2019; studying rather zealously to avoid cramp phrases and all needless cause of offence, I feel at every sentence that the work will be strange; that it either must be so, or be nothing but another of the thousand-and-one &#x201C;Histories,&#x201D; which are so many &#x201C;dead thistles for Pedant-chaffinches to peck at and fill their crops with&#x201D;;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Untraced.</note> a kind of thing I for one wish to have no hand in. Jane rather thinks &#x201C;it will do.&#x201D; So I struggle along with the best heart I may; and will, if possible, have the thing out in the course of spring. For the present I am busy reading all manner of Memoirs of Mirabeau; especially a late large work by a natural son of his <foreign><hi rend="italic">&#x201C;fils adoptif&#x201D;</hi></foreign> [&#x201C;adopted son&#x201D;].<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">M&#xE9;moires biographiques, litt&#xE9;raires et politiques de Mirabeau, &#xE9;crits par lui-m&#xEA;me, par son p&#xE8;re, son oncle et son fils adoptif,</hi> 8 vols. (Paris, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>), put together as &#x201C;a monstrous quarry&#x201D; by the son, Lucas de Montigny, and reviewed by Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">London and Westminster Review,</hi> XXVI (<date when="1837-01-00">Jan. 1837</date>), 382&#x2013;439; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 403&#x2013;80.</note> If they have it in Rome (4 volumes are already out), you too might find it interesting. Mill got it, I may almost say bought it, for me, the other day: he is, as always, the most helpful of Book-providers (I have some 150 volumes of his even now!), and really seems to take a pleasure in assisting me. The <hi rend="italic">Diamond Necklace</hi> Fraser, after reading it, thinks ought <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be published till after the other; a judgement I rather agree with; tho&#x2019; poor Mill, who had set his heart on &#x201C;reviewing it,&#x201D; is obliged to express the most tragi-comical regret. In regard to Books, I will only add that a <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh</hi> is on its way to Rome for you, perhaps some <pb id="pg-07-326" n="07-326"/>two weeks ago: a Dr Hamiche<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Unidentified.</note> (I think) took charge of it, by solicitation of one Eastlake a Painter here, whom I first met with among the Rennies;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Lock Eastlake (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1865-00-00">1865</date>), painter and art critic, had been resident in Italy between <date when="1816-00-00">1816</date> and <date when="1830-00-00">1830</date>; knighted and made President of the Royal Academy in <date when="1850-00-00">1850</date>.</note> of whom more by and by. Hamiche (if that is the name) has been in Rome before: whether he is to be one of your &#x201C;eight practicing Doctors&#x201D; this winter I know not, but you will see. As for Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh I think he rather meets with approbation and recognition in his bound up shape: had the thing come out as a Book, it might perhaps have done something; yet, after all, so questionable a production is probably &#x201C;just as well&#x201D; in its actual middle-state of published and unpublished; it cannot be <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> now, by fire or accident; afflicts nobody, and is ready if ever wanted.&#x2014; The business of Literature (which indeed while occupied writing, I think little about, and care almost nothing for) looks not as yet more motherly <hi rend="italic">nutritive</hi> upon me than it did. I think, if ever I am to live by it, I must have some vehicle of my own, and a public of my own: Poor Leigh Hunt, with a three-halfpenny Journal, gets (as I understand) &#x201C;8 guineas a week&#x201D;; which for me were Potosi<note n="9" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Renowned silver mine; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18201019-TC-WG-01"><sic>1:282</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1820-10-19">19 Oct. 1820</date></corr></ref>.</note> wages. The Chancellor is going to take off stamps.<note n="10" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The stamp tax on newspapers (first levied in <date when="1712-00-00">1712</date>) was not reduced to 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi> till <date when="1836-09-15">15 Sept. 1836</date> and not abolished until <date when="1855-00-00">1855</date>. It had offered a form of control over cheap, untaxed newspapers, which began to defeat its own ends about <date when="1831-00-00">1831</date>&#x2013;<date when="1835-00-00">35</date>, when the issue of unstamped sheets became worth risking.</note> We must see about it by and by. A most questionable enterprise! But if the Ishmael is cast forth into the Desart, with bow and quiver in his coat of wild skins,<note n="11" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Gen. 21:14&#x2013;20.</note> shall he not <hi rend="italic">shoot</hi> such game as there is? Depend upon it, he must and will! In the mean time his task (and let that suffice him) is this <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> of his: forward, and be done with that. <foreign><hi rend="italic">Das weitere wird sich zeigen, sich geben</hi></foreign> [Anything further will show, will develop].</p>
<p>We are not without society here, from time to time; but still it is not of the rightly profitable sort. The men I want to see are such as could give me some glimpse of practical insight into the road I have to travel; of all which there is yet too little going. Indeed, many with any sense, or insight into anything are singularly rare in this world: one ought ever to be thankful for &#x201C;the day of small things&#x201D;! Mill and one or two of his set are, on the whole, the reasonablest people we have: however we see them seldom (being so far off &#x26;c); and Mill, <pb id="pg-07-327" n="07-327"/>himself, who were far the best of them all, is greatly occupied of late times with a set of quite opposite character, which the Austins and other friends mourn much and fear much over. It is that fairest Mrs Taylor you have heard of; with whom, under her husband&#x2019;s very eyes, he is (Platonically) over head and ears in love! Round her come Fox the Socinian, and a flight of really wretched-looking &#x201C;friends of the species,&#x201D; who (in writing and deed) struggle not in favour of Duty being <hi rend="italic">done</hi>, but against Duty of any sort almost being <hi rend="italic">required</hi>. A singular creed this; but I can assure you a very observable one here in these days: by me &#x201C;deeply hated as the <foreign><hi rend="small-caps">glar</hi></foreign> [mud], which is its colour (<foreign><hi rend="italic">die seine Farbe ist</hi></foreign>),&#x201D; and substance likewise mainly. Jane and I often say: &#x201C;Before all mortals, beware of a friend of the species!&#x201D; Most of these people are very indignant at marriage and the like; and frequently indeed are obliged to divorce their own wives, or be divorced: for tho&#x2019; the <hi rend="italic">world</hi> is already blooming (or is one day to do it) in everlasting &#x201C;happiness of the greatest number,&#x201D; these people&#x2019;s own <hi rend="italic">houses</hi> (I always find) are little Hells of improvidence, discord, unreason<supplied>[.]</supplied> Mill is far above all that, and I think will not sink in it; however, I do wish him fairly far from it, and tho&#x2019; I cannot speak of it directly would <hi rend="italic">fain</hi> help him out: he is one of the best people I ever saw, and&#x2014;surprisingly attached to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, which is another merit. Hunt is also a &#x201C;friend of the species,&#x201D; but we make an exception of him; tho&#x2019; nowise of the Doctrine as held by him: indeed I find my Cameronian<note n="12" place="bottom" type="gloss" >As of Richard Cameron (died <date when="1680-00-00">1680</date>), founder of a sect of Reformed Presbyterians.</note> rigour, and denouncement of all paltering, poltroonery a<supplied>[nd &#x201C;cry?]</supplied>ing for the want of <hi rend="italic">taffy</hi>&#x201D; has quite scared him into seclusion; and he comes now only some once in the fortnig<supplied>[ht, and]</supplied> gives us really a most musical evening (for he is far the most ingenious creature I speak with here), concent<supplied>[rating]</supplied> many visits into one: I never in my whole life met with a more innocent childlike man; transparent, many-glancing, really beautiful, were this Lubberland or Elysium, and not Earth and England. His family also are innocent, tho&#x2019; wholly fools and donothings. We get no harm from them, and some little good: God help him and them! is our hearty prayer for them.&#x2014; Allan Cunningham and his Wife come down, at long intervals; were here lately in the Scotch &#x201C;foresupper&#x201D;<note n="13" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Foresupper&#x201D; in Scotland is the interval between the end of work and supper time.</note> style: good people in their kind, and friendly to us; incapable of close sympathy. I have mentioned Eastlake, and that I saw him at Rennie&#x2019;s. <pb id="pg-07-328" n="07-328"/>The man (very inquisitive about Goethe, and otherwise intelligent and courteous) had rather pleased me: some three weeks ago a Mr Cockerell (an Architect, Brother-in-law of Rennie) came down very unexpectedly to ask me to meet him again.<note n="14" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Charles Robert Cockerell (<date when="1788-00-00">1788</date>&#x2013;<date when="1863-00-00">1863</date>), who had studied architectural remains in Greece, Asia Minor, and Italy, <date when="1810-00-00">1810</date>&#x2013;<date when="1817-00-00">17</date>, and who had five sisters one of whom was evidently married to Rennie. Later he was well known as an architect and professor of the Royal Academy, <date when="1840-00-00">1840</date>&#x2013;<date when="1857-00-00">57</date>.</note> My rule being to meet all honest persons, I went; and so Cockereldom and Eastlake lay open to me for an evening. Fancy Heraud, condensed clean-washed into the look of a gentleman, into talking (tho&#x2019; with equal vanity) <hi rend="italic">not</hi> of himself, and living in Belgrave or Eaton sumptuosity, after long travels in Italy and the East: that is poor Cockerell; whom I really must feel kindly towards. Eastlake is a man turned of forty with bushy eyebrows and hazel eyes that have a glow in them: the rest of his face and figure is sympathetic-precise rather than better; a rational man, raised a little above commonplace, and yet not far above it: I mean to see more of him, but he cannot come to me just yet, being busy with something. The day I called on this Royal Academician with your Teufelsdrockh (for he lives near Fitzroy Square), I observe Macculloch<note n="15" place="bottom" type="gloss" >J. R. McCulloch.</note> gliding along thro&#x2019; a cross street. According to my rule, I determined to speak with him, and did it: gradually the poor Economist&#x2019;s apprehension subsided, and he gave me his card with invitation to come and leave mine (I having none about me then); on Saturday last I actually went and did this too, and again walked with the poor man thro&#x2019; Soho Square till our roads parted: I am not very sure whether it will be worth our while to go any farther together (for the man is of hemp [a rogue]); however, this is nothing to hinder us, if we have any <hi rend="italic">business</hi> together. Lastly the Austins are come home again and Hayward (the <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> translator, become <foreign><hi rend="italic">ein und etwas</hi></foreign> [something or other] rather suddenly): we saw them all in full blow lately; talk without end, happiness, admiration (of Mrs Jamieson; and the &#x201C;swarm that came out with the Annuals,&#x201D; as Mrs Cunningham called that sort); and had occasion again to envy the &#x201C;happiness of Commonplace&#x201D;; not to say <foreign><hi rend="italic">le bonheur des sots</hi></foreign> [the happiness of fools], for that were too strong here. These are all our associates I will hint at: are there not enough? I must add a word about poor Irving for another reason. Poor fellow! I begin to fear it is in sad truth almost over with him. He has been away for some two months in Wales and elsewhere; was much better W. Hamilton said; but had <pb id="pg-07-329" n="07-329"/>got cold again on the Menai Bridge;<note n="16" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Telford&#x2019;s suspension bridge across the Menai Straits, linking Anglesey and the mainland of N. Wales.</note> was worse than ever (&#x201C;pulse kept down to 100 by strong medicines&#x201D;), and in spite of all that, was off to Glasgow for some tongue-work, being <hi rend="italic">ordered</hi> to it. His wife is now with him: the Doctor imperatively recommends going to Madeira; without effect. My poor friend, how gladly would I help thee! But what is to be done? I have no means, no access no authority. There has lain a Letter written for Henry Drummond on the subject, these three days; but I think now I cannot send it: what could it do, but officiously tell him what he already knows? I am heartily distressed; but there is no use in that. What a <hi rend="italic">Tragedy</hi> is Life: <foreign><hi rend="italic">der Kerker der da heisset Leben</hi></foreign> [the prison which is called life]!<note n="17" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-04/lt-18280307-TC-JAC-01"><sic>4:337&#x2013;8</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1828-03-07">7 March 1828</date></corr></ref>.</note>&#x2014;&#x2014; Alas, dear Brother, the Paper you see is done, and there was still so much to say. Small writing (otherwise a great cramp to one, especially with &#x201C;such a pen&#x201D;) can do no more. By the bye, now that you are at Rome, what say you, if we set always the <hi rend="italic">very first</hi> post-day (I have missed one this time), and try to do without &#x201C;overlapping&#x201D;?

<ps><p>I had almost forgotten to mention a little revolution in our Household: Bessy is away about 10 days ago, and one <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> (from Lancaster) <pb id="pg-07-330" n="07-330"/>reigns in her stead. There was no quarrel, a deliberate feeling on all sides that it was not going to do. Bessy herself seemed to be in the most unhappy unwholesome state of mind; I sincerely pitied her, and also wished her with her Mother, or some one that could love and console her. She has suffered much from Badams, and for him: I spoke to her what I could in the way of advice and counsel; but am very dubious as to what will become of poor Bessy. If she <hi rend="italic">can</hi> save herself into a reasonable kind of life, it will argue the rarest faculties in her. Old Jan<supplied>[e]</supplied> her Mother is a good woman, and there is nothing else favourable. Poor Bessy is proud as Lucifer, she is woestruck, violent, and does not even speak the truth always.&#x2014; Oh when I look into poor Badams&#x2019;s existence, and Kennydom and all the rest of it, I could shudder&#x2014;and thank Heaven that from me all <hi rend="italic">such</hi> things lay far.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Our new girl was brought by Mrs Charles Montague from Lancaster as nurse or maid, to the Miles&#x2019;s in Ampton street; then violently entreated, then turned off, and so (after character &#x26;c) hired by us. She is a very innocent looking creature, and does perfectly well.</p>
<p>Poor James Johnston at Haddington has lost his good Jenny: this is all that I know; I figure him as very lonely there with the two children motherless. He is often in my head since&#x2014;</p>
<p>I saw the burning of the Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> Houses, having noticed it from a window here. A great <hi rend="italic">crowd:</hi> &#x201C;there&#x2019;s a <hi rend="italic">flare-up</hi> for &#x2019;Ouse o Lords,&#x201D; &#x201C;there go the <hi rend="italic">hacts</hi>&#x201D; &#x26;c &#x26;c Matthew Allen found me there: a man making much money, they say a man whom one can omit therefore now better than in his poverty.</p>

<p>A stray letter from Mrs Welsh to my Mother; wh<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, so kindly, good and characteristic is it, I cannot but preserve as elucidative of her and the scene then alive with us all.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>You are not to take this for a Letter; but for a mere <hi rend="italic">off-put:</hi> I am not getting the <hi rend="italic">Bastille taken</hi> so readily as I expected; so having seen Buller today I begged a frank from him merely to say that we were all well, and that I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> write. It will serve to keep your kind heart quiet about us, which may, not improbably, be disposed to misgivings in such bitter November weather.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Book</hi> continues to form my grand occupation: sometimes I incline to fancy that it will prove not so bad a Book; at other times, it looks poor enough: but in either case, I <hi rend="italic">persevere</hi>, and study to remember your old precept at the shearing: &#x201C;If it were never so little <hi rend="italic">it&#x2019;ll no loup in again</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-05/lt-18310329-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1831-03-29">29 March 1831</date></ref>.</note> I have a great deal of reading to go thro&#x2019;, and little arrangements to make about it, which consume time: but on the whole &#x201C;one must just do the best he <hi rend="italic">can</hi>.&#x201D;<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Saying of the Ecclefechan blacksmith: see <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230603-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:366</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-06-03">3 June 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
<p>Our new Servants [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] proves to be a very peaceable well-conditioned creature; and goes along, quite reasonably, and gives no <foreign><hi rend="italic">fash</hi></foreign> [trouble] to any one. Considering what sort of persons London Servants usually are, we have cause again in this instance to think ourselves kindly dealt with. In the inside of the House there is nothing new, except the <hi rend="italic">winter fires</hi>, and the great need we have of them. There is a fierce North East wind blowing, so dry that dust flies where the streets are not <hi rend="italic">watered;</hi> and everybody you meet has a blue nose and a drop at the end of it. How are you doing in windy Scotsbrig, when it is so cold in <foreign><hi rend="italic">lown</hi></foreign> [sheltered] Chelsea? Many a time I think, If you have a good fire, and are keeping yourself snug within doors? Had one but the little magical glass the Fairy Tales speak of, whereby one could at any moment <hi rend="italic">see</hi> those he loved, tho&#x2019; never so distant!<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Probably referring to &#x201C;The Four Clever Brothers&#x201D; in J. L. C. and W. C. Grimm, <hi rend="italic">Kinder-und HausM&#xE4;rchen</hi>, 3 vols.

<p>Our friends are all come back again, and there are meetings and <pb id="pg-07-334" n="07-334"/>conversings and cullings enough. Mrs Austin has introduced Jane to a very excellent-looking Scotch lady, who lives close by: a Mrs Sommerville, distinguished in the Literary World (very strangely for a woman) as a <hi rend="italic">Mathematician</hi>.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340800-JWC-EA-01">JWC to <sic>ES</sic><corr>EA</corr>, ca. <date when="1834-08-00">Aug.</date></ref></note> Far better than that, she seems to have a real fund of Mother-wit, good sense and good principle: her husband is surgeon to the Chelsea Hospital (comes from Kelso, she I believe from Fife); she is a woman turned of fifty, and has seen troubles, and seems to have learned from them. I hope she will be a small acquisition to Jane, who has little sympathy with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">flaffing</hi></foreign> [flighty] ways of the Cockney women, and does not esteem many of them much.</p>
<p>The other day we had a call from Miss Morris! Jane had waited upon her many weeks ago, but not found her visible (from ill health), and thought the people she lived with rather pitiful persons. We had supposed poor Miss Morris would not venture to return the visit: however she took a suitable chaise, and with her prim landlady (whom she left sitting in it at the door) actually came. An innocent-looking, overawed, much-compressed young creature; by no means ill-looking, with brown eyes, pale face (or rather brown-sallow, for she was not in good health), small mouth, and nose of fair proportions very slightly inclining to the turn-up sort. We made of her what was possible; and sent her away with honest good wishes.&#x2014; Have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> heard from Jack yet? I fancy if you have not, you now soon will. We were to send him &#x201C;kind remembrances&#x201D; from the lady;&#x2014;whom by and by Jane must go to see again.&#x2014; We had also two calls from Archy Glen, who has been and is still here vending his Glasgow Manufactures. He looks cheerfuller than he did last time; reports &#x201C;no change&#x201D; in his Brother, whom he purposes to see in returning Northward. He had gone to hear Edward Irving at Glasgow: saw him sitting in a chair (being unable to stand) in some kind of public room, and expounding his notions to an audience that seemed to have come mainly out of curiosity. Our other visits to and from were too long to report. Charles Buller is one of the sensiblest people I see: his Mother, from whom a very kind Letter<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated <date when="1834-10-23">23 Oct.</date></note> came to me not long ago, says they are all going to remove into London very shortly, to <hi rend="italic">settle</hi> there not far from us, and we are to be considered as <hi rend="italic">door neighbours</hi>. Charlie is going to make himself notable as the most decisive of Radicals; he has come forward with most abundant <hi rend="italic">promptitude</hi> on this new occasion; is to be President of a Public Meeting tomorrow night, to which I undertook to go as a dumb spectator (being curious to see such a thing) <pb id="pg-07-335" n="07-335"/>and probably shall go. You are likely to hear something of it in next <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>. This grand change of Ministry<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For the public meeting, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341121-JWC-MAC-01">JWC to MAC, <date when="1834-11-21">21 Nov.</date></ref>, with Carlyle&#x2019;s appended notes. It arose from radical concern at the resignation of the Whig ministry (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341025-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC, <date when="1834-10-25">25 Oct.</date></ref>) and the fact that Wellington had been sworn in on <date when="1834-11-17">17 Nov.</date> as Home Secretary and First Lord of the Treasury, giving him control of the government until Peel&#x2019;s return from Italy on <date when="1834-12-09">9 Dec.</date> When Parliament resumed on <date when="1835-02-19">19 Feb.</date> after the election in <date when="1835-01-00">January</date>, the Tories did not have an overall majority, although they continued in power until <date when="1835-04-08">8 April</date>.</note> appears to be taken very quietly here; rather with surprise as to what it means, or how it will go on, than with any other feeling. For myself I am sorry about it, as about most <hi rend="italic">changes:</hi> there will likely be a new Election of Parliament, the whole country thrown again into ferment; and as for the <hi rend="italic">ultimate</hi> issue, Providence alone can foresee it. That it may well end in mischief, nay in confusion worse than the Duke dreams of is but too probable. My work as heretofore lies quite out of it: I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> an onlooker merely. God guide it all for the best; and take pity of the poor blinded Sons of men&#x2014;whose ways the more I look on them the more surprise me.</p>
<p>Do you get the Examiner regularly on the Sabbath? Alick&#x2019;s Courier should in general be at Lockerby then too: Jean sends it off almost always on the very Tuesday, and has never again forgotten her two strokes. Thank her for them. We saw on one paper that Mary had got a Daughter and was doing well; a fact we were very glad indeed to be apprised <supplied>[of.]</supplied> Give my brotherly affection to poor Mary. I hope soon to hear more fully about both you <supplied>[and]</supplied> her.&#x2014; In fact, when I calculate, it is but a very small allowance of <supplied>[news?]</supplied> that my Annandale friends do allow me. Since the Month of <date when="1834-05-00">May</date>, as I reckon, si<supplied>[mply]</supplied> the number <hi rend="italic">Three!</hi> Again I say, my dear Mother, it is on you slow as your hand is that I depend. Oh I know well were your speed equal to your will I should <supplied>[want not?]</supplied> for that nor for any other good in this world&#x2014;or in a better world than this. I will continue writing to you regularly with or without answer; and endeavour to satisfy myself with the assurance that you are struggling on in some tolerable way, till I come and see it again with my own eyes. May the good God long keep it so, and enable us all so to struggle on, while our task here continues! But on the whole, take a pen yourself, and tell me faithfully how you are; what you suffer, what you get the victory over, how you get on: any words, any writing will be so welcome to me.<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >His mother had written on <date when="1834-11-13">13 Nov.</date> to give the news of the birth of Mary&#x2019;s new daughter, but the letter was sent in one of the boxes containing oatmeal, butter, and other provisions from Scotsbrig which Carlyle had not yet received.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-336" n="07-336"/>I must finish off here; and leave you with the promise of not being <hi rend="italic">long</hi> in writing again. Jane partly speaks about putting in a little Note tomorrow to you or some of you: I will leave it open for her at least. Give our love to Jamie and his Wife; to Alick and his with his household: repeat to him my request for a Letter; I am very anxious to know what he has decided on; and think he cannot be so busy now.&#x2014; We are struggling away with the coarsest Scotch oatmeal (finding nothing that suits better) but hope soon to have some of a right sort. Allan Cunningham sent us over (or his Wife did) a little poke of excellent quality; but, alas, it was soon done. Poor Allan has lost a Brother here lately, which grieves him much. He is a worthy kind of man: &#x201C;a Dumfries mason,&#x201D; which among poor shards of Cockney wits is something not so inconsiderable. Last night (for a certain Dr Beattie<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Almost certainly Dr. William Beattie (<date when="1793-00-00">1793</date>&#x2013;<date when="1875-00-00">1875</date>), born at Dalton in Annandale, M.D. University of Edinburgh <date when="1818-00-00">1818</date>, licentiate of Royal College of Physicians <date when="1827-00-00">1827</date>, and physician in Hampstead.

The owner of it had been on Mount Sinai, and had some of the very granite rock of it, which if I have time some day I will go and see. He imagined he had seen the very fountains struck out by the rod of Moses! He seemed a most devout, honest man, but had come thro&#x2019; much, and his <hi rend="italic">head</hi> seemed a little heated.&#x2014; And now good night dear Mother!

<salute>My dear Mother</salute>
<p>Now that Franks are come back into the world, one need not wait for an inspired moment to write, if one&#x2019;s letter is worth nothing, it costs nothing&#x2014;nor will any letter that tells you of our wellfare [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] and assures you of our continual affection be worth nothing in your eyes, however destitute of news or any else that might make it entertaining.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-337" n="07-337"/>The weather is grown horridly cold, and I am chiefly intent at present on getting my winter wardrobe into order&#x2014; I have made up the old black gown which was died [dyed] peuce [puce] for me in Dumfries (<hi rend="italic">with my own hands</hi>&#x2014;it looks twenty per cent better than when it was new &#x26; I shall get no other this winter<supplied>[)]</supplied>: I am now turning my pelisse. I went yesterday to a milliner to buy a bonnet&#x2014; An old very ugly Lady upwards of seventy I am sure was bargaining about a cloak at the same place&#x2014;it was a fine affair of satin and velvet&#x2014;but she declared repeatedly that &#x201C;it had <hi rend="italic">no</hi> <hi rend="small-caps">air</hi>&#x201D; and for her part she could not put on such a thing&#x2014; <hi rend="italic">My</hi> bonnet I flatter myself <hi rend="italic">has</hi> an <hi rend="italic">air</hi>&#x2014;a little brown feather nods over the front of it, and the crown points like a sugar loaf. The diametre of the fashionable Ladies at present is about threeyards; their <hi rend="italic">bustles</hi> (false bottoms) are the size of an ordinary sheep&#x2019;s fleece&#x2014; The very servant girls wear bustles&#x2014; Eliza Miles told me a maid of theirs went out one Sunday with <hi rend="italic">three</hi> kitchen dusters pinned on as a substitute&#x2014; The poor Miles, are in great affliction&#x2014; M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Miles about the time we came to London got into a excellent situation, and they were just beginning to feel independent and look forward to a comfortable future&#x2014;when one morning about a week ago M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Miles in walking thro his warerooms was noticed to stagger and one of the men ran and caught him as he was falling. he was carried to a publichouse close by; his own house beeing [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] miles off&#x2014;and his wife and daughter sent for&#x2014; he never spoke to them&#x2014;could never be removed&#x2014;but there in the midst of confusion and riot they sat watching by him for two days when he expired. I went up to see them so soon as I heard of their misfortune the wife was confined to bed with inflamation in her head&#x2014; Poor Eliza was up and resigned looking&#x2014;but the picture of misery. &#x201C;A gentleman from M<hi rend="italic">r</hi> Irving<supplied>[&#x2019;]</supplied>s church&#x201D; was with her, saying what he could.</p>
<p>M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Montagu has quite given us up but we still find it possible to carry on existence. I offended her by taking in Bessy Barnet in the teeth of her vehement admonitions&#x2014;and now I suppose she is again offended that I should receive a discharged servant of her daughter in law&#x2019;s&#x2014; I am sorry she should be so whimsical for as she was my first friend in London I continue to feel a sort of tenderness for her in spite of many faults which cleave to her. But her society can quite readily be dispensed with nevertheless<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mrs. Montagu in her letter to Jane of <date when="1834-09-29">29 Sept.</date> had at least made an effort to preserve the friendship: &#x201C;If you knew how I have been occupied and all the perplexity I have been in you would not have looked for either a visit or a note.&#x2014; [Paragraph] We have outstayed our Term in this House, and were liable to be turned out on Monday last. &#x2026; [Paragraph] Methinks my sentences have a disjointed look, and seem as unhinged as every other thing about me, but my next move I believe, will be tomorrow to St. Albans.&#x2014; Of this dear Jane be assured, that the first day I can call my own, I will come and see you, and satisfy the scrupulous Etiquette of M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>. Thomas Carlyle, which I thought Jane Welsh would have laughed at, and since, &#x201C;visit for visit&#x201D; is to be the measure of our future intercourse I will open a porter&#x2019;s book for that purpose&#x2014; You are the first person I have ever known that expected me to leave my home for the purpose of calling&#x2014;and more I cannot do, if I try ever so hard.&#x2014; My Husband is utterly dependent upon me, and I am known, never to leave him, and my opposite neighbour &#x26; old friend Lady Bayley has never seen me but twice in her House during the last 20 years&#x2014; [Paragraph] Jane, Jane, there is some under current of feeling that occasions all this petty misunderstanding&#x2014; Your Husband fancies I pass him without speaking, and you that I neglect and no longer love you! [Paragraph] Let us take a new lease, and give these <supplied>[&#x201C;]</supplied>thick-coming fancies&#x201D; notice to quit&#x2014; &#x2026; [Paragraph]. &#x2026; I cannot promise you a clean house, but you shall then have a warm welcome and I will <hi rend="italic">dust</hi> a chair for you, (cottage fashion)&#x2014; provided always, that the formal M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi>.

<p>It makes me very indignant to see all the waste that goes on around me when I am needing so much care and calculation to make ends meet&#x2014; When we dine out we see as much money expended on a des<supplied>[s]</supplied>ert of fruit (for no use but to give people a cholic) as would keep us in necessaries for two or three weeks&#x2014; My present Maid<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Jane Ireland.</note> has a Grand Uncle in town with upwards of a hundred thousand pounds&#x2014;who drives his carriage and all that<supplied>[.]</supplied> At a great dinner he had he gave five pounds for a couple of pineapples when scarce&#x2014;and here is <pb id="pg-07-339" n="07-339"/>his niece working all the year thro&#x2019; for <hi rend="italic">eight</hi>&#x2014;and he has not given her a brass farthing since she came to London&#x2014;</p>
<p>My Mother gave a good account of your looks&#x2014; I hope you will go and see her again for a longer time<supplied>[.]</supplied> She was so gratified by your visit.</p>
<p>I have just had a letter from her most satisfactory&#x2014;telling me all she knows about any of you&#x2014; She gives a most wonderful account of some transcendentally beautiful shawl which Jane has made her a present of&#x2014; I am sure never present gave more contentment<supplied>[.]</supplied></p>

<p>Mournfully beautiful is this Letter to me; a clear little household light shining, pure and brill<hi rend="italic">t</hi>, in the dark obstruct-places of the Past!&#x2014;</p>
<p>The &#x2018;two East Loth<hi rend="italic">n</hi> friends&#x2019; are George Rennie then Sculptor here, and his pretty Sister Mrs Manderston, wife of an Ex-Indian Ship-Capt<hi rend="italic">n</hi>. &#x2026;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Capt.

<p>&#x2018;Buller&#x2019;s Radical Meeting,&#x2019;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The public meeting was held on <date when="1834-11-21">Friday, 21 Nov.</date>, in the City of London Tavern. Buller was not in the chair, as Carlyle had supposed he would be in his letter of <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341120-TC-MAC-01">TC to MAC of <date when="1834-11-20">20 Nov.</date></ref>, but there had been a previous meeting, mainly private, to organize the public one, on <date when="1834-11-16">Sunday, 16 Nov.</date>, in which Buller had taken the chair, and a more select committee meeting on <date when="1834-11-18">Tuesday, 18 Nov.</date> At the public meeting the chairman was Sir Francis Knowles (<date when="1802-00-00">1802</date>&#x2013;<date when="1892-00-00">92</date>), and the first motion expressed anxiety at the dismissal of the late Whig ministry, an act meant to &#x201C;stop the progress of all reform.&#x201D; Another spoke of Wellington as &#x201C;the enemy of retrenchment and reform,&#x201D; and another was in favor of triennial Parliaments, household suffrage, and the ballot. The <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> for <date when="1834-11-23">23 Nov.</date> (p. 746) reported that &#x201C;The numbers were very great, their conduct temperate and admirable, and the speeches were excellent&#x201D;; and that &#x201C;Mr. C.

I duly attended the Meeting (never another in my life); and remembered it well. Had some interest, not much. The 2,000 human figures, wedged in the huge room into one dark mass, were singular to look down upon, singular to hear their united voice, coming clearly as from one heart, their fiery &#x201C;Yes,&#x201D; their sternly bellowing &#x201C;No&#x201D;&#x2014;(Camille Desmoulins in the Palais-R<hi rend="italic">l</hi> Garden, not long aft<hi rend="italic">ds!</hi>)<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See Carlyle, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> II, 175ff., Book V, ch. iv, <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi> (<date when="1789-07-12">12 July 1789</date>); for Desmoulins, see <ref target="volume-06/lt-18330222-TC-JSM-01">TC to JSM, <date when="1833-02-22">22 Feb. 1833</date></ref>.

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>Three hours ago came this Letter from our good Doctor;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> which I know will give you pleasure, the rather as you have been anxiously waiting for it. I will not detain it a moment; but go to Buller, and (if he be at home) perhaps get a frank for it this very night. Jack you will find is all right; and settled for the winter at Rome.</p>
<p>As to myself I have not a moment&#x2019;s time to write; and do not mean to pay my debt today. That tough <hi rend="italic">Bastille</hi> (which I have had work enough with) still holds out; but will be done in two days. There, is after that, another small <hi rend="italic">Sherre&#x2019; muir,</hi><note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Row (as Norton notes) &#x201C;like the battle of Sheriffmuir (fought between Mar and Argyll <date when="1715-11-13">13th November 1715</date>), at which no one was killed, and both parties thought they had gained the victory.&#x201D; Carlyle presumably refers to the last two chapters of Book V of <hi rend="italic">The French Revolution</hi>.</note> and were I over with that, I will treat myself&#x2014;and you.</p>
<p>For the present, dear Mother, take my assurance that I am well, no less than busy. Let not your Motherly heart be anxious about my health, or anything that concerns me. Depend upon it, I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> overwork myself, but study to take it moderately like one that had a <hi rend="italic">long</hi>ish spell of it to do: I am always happiest and best when in the middle of work; provided it will go on with me! Which, indeed, it will not always do.</p>
<p>Sandy&#x2019;s Letter came on Saturday gone a week; and that very evening the Boxes; they had been just nine days from Annan. All was as it should be, but one thing&#x2014;the bottom of James Austin&#x2019;s Box. It had given way, and the meal was running out; the precious meal! &#x201C;Down ran the meal upon the road; most piteous to be seen.&#x201D;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. William Cowper, &#x201C;The Diverting History of John Gilpin,&#x201D; st. 32.</note> I think there was not above a stone and a half of it lost; and we were thankful for the remainder; being really in great want of it. We must take a <pb id="pg-07-342" n="07-342"/>Barrel next time and no Box: little do our Annan friends know the knocking and smashing a thing has to undergo between them and us.&#x2014; The rest, I have said, was all in perfect order,&#x2014;except one <supplied>[of]</supplied> the butter-canns cracked (the one on your right hand, as you opened); which however Jane soon mended with a little putty; and did not stir the butter, but began eating it. Excellent it is: and as for the meal, we rejoice over it nightly (like Hebrews over Manna, almost),<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Exod. 16:10&#x2013;36.</note> so dry, clean genuine is it; so different from the wretched Mill-sweepings they sell here. Alick&#x2019;s ham with your Letter (and one just begun by Mary) was in its place. Many, many thanks to all of you that have taken such charge and care of us!</p>
<p>My dear Mother, you are growing a <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> writer; positively you need nothing but just to go on, and make me quite independent of all of them. I will tell Jean, by the next frank, to get you a quire of <hi rend="italic">ruled</hi> paper at Dumfries, and send it out: you may take a whole week over your Letter; fill at your leisure, <hi rend="italic">to the very brim</hi>; and let it be right sure of a welcome! I owe you some long sheets for your last kind little one; which I have still in my breast pocket, and make much of. What a blessing that there is such a thing as writing; that you have learned to write!</p>
<p>I went to Buller&#x2019;s Radical Meeting, and was greatly amused by it. The people were in deep earnest: some two thousand of them, mostly industrious-looking men, the better kind of operatives; many of them under thirty. The murmur of their assent or dissent, above all the kind of <hi rend="italic">bark</hi> (what we Annandale people call a <foreign><hi rend="italic">goust</hi></foreign> or <foreign><hi rend="italic">gollie</hi></foreign>) coming from two thousand voices, at any sound or mention of Toryism and its insults, was grand to hear. It was bitter earnest with them; not so with me, who came thither as a mere onlooker, and did not care much which way it went. Toryism or Radicalism, it seems to me all things are going <hi rend="italic">to the <foreign>howe pot</foreign></hi> [<hi rend="italic">bottomless pit</hi>]; whether tomorrow or the day after is small concern. God is above all, and will work his own wise Purpose with it;&#x2014;and support and save those who are worthy. I only hope, they will not get to absolute <hi rend="italic">breaking of crowns;</hi> which indeed seems a thing no one apprehends.&#x2014; In Wellington&#x2019;s shoes I would not willingly be: he thinks to rule Britain like a drill-serjeant; but will find it not answer. As <foreign>bonny</foreign> a man I have seen before now lose his head in such a business. God pity him, and all!</p>
<p>Plenty of company is here now; and in the cool weather (which is wonderfully clear and dry) I can take long walks. Mill speaks of <pb id="pg-07-343" n="07-343"/>som<supplied>[e arrange]</supplied>ment for sending me a daily Paper he gets:<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Mill had offered to send the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> to Carlyle.</note> in that case, when <supplied>[something]</supplied> special occurs, I can send you a Number. I fear you are short of good reading, when you take to poor <hi rend="italic">Schiller</hi> a second time: tell me if you are. It were easy to make a better effort to get more for you, even from this distance. I could write to Ben Nelson to give you <hi rend="italic">share of his share</hi> in the Annan Library: I believe he would do it at once with pleasure. Tell me, if it would be useful. There are stores of good reading there.</p>
<p>My own poor <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi> struggles on as you see. It will keep me all winter: but if the people &#x201C;read it when it is <hi rend="italic">irwitten</hi>&#x201D; [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], or if it be worth reading, we will not complain. Mill&#x2019;s new Periodical is to go on; and I shall get work there if I want it: but for the present I rather <hi rend="italic">hold back</hi>, till I see what sort of fellows they prove; what sort of terms they will offer me. I have much to learn here (for it is a most confused singular world this); but it is good that I have come to learn it: I feel no doubt but I shall <hi rend="italic">swim</hi> in the water, did I once know the currents of it. <hi rend="italic">None</hi>, when I see what <hi rend="italic">wights</hi> are swimming! Fear nothing.</p>
<p>I have almost filled my sheet; for I could not send it away vacant: I fear I shall thereby lose the Post for this night: but Buller at any rate had little chance to be in. I will have tea, and then try him. It is four miles off; but I did not walk today on purpose for that.&#x2014;Good night dear Mother! I see you in the Scotsbrig two rooms, with the <foreign><hi rend="italic">gurly</hi></foreign> [blustery] winds about you; but, I hope too, a little comfortable <hi rend="italic">black tea-pot</hi> (a <hi rend="italic">witch</hi> one) on the hob; and kind thoughts to your children that are far or near, and assurance that they send you the like. When will you write to me? I myself will not be long. Our kind love to Jamie and his Dame, to Mary, Jean and them all. <closer><salute>Ever your affectionate</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>I am in your debt for two very interesting letters;<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> welcome and interesting, tho&#x2019; the last was on a most mournful subject. Thanks for <pb id="pg-07-344" n="07-344"/>your remembrance. In a world so full of change, it is something to know that a face which has known one&#x2019;s some five-and-twenty years (you have not forgotten the <hi rend="italic">gig</hi> day) still smiles on us; still says, this Earth is not wholly a Golgotha, but a kind of Home, at least a friendly Inn.</p>
<p>Poor Irving&#x2019;s death<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Irving had died on <date when="1834-12-07">7 Dec.</date> See Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Death of the Rev. Edward Irving (No. II),&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, XI (<date when="1835-01-00">Jan. 1835</date>), 101&#x2013;3; <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> XXVIII, 319&#x2013;23.</note> I had anticipated like yourself; especially since I saw him last in autumn. Nevertheless, the news of it shocked me, as only a few such occurrences now can. Poor fellow! he was here the week before leaving this huge Confusion of a Place: it was most touching to see the feeling of old years feebly struggling thro&#x2019; the distractions that had now closed thick over it; I once or twice even raised in him a faint laugh of the true old Annandale time&#x2014;most melancholy to remember. This mad City (for it is mad as Bedlam, nine-tenths of it) killed him; he might have lived prosperous and strong in Scotland, but there was in him a quality which the influences here took fatal hold of; and now&#x2014;Alas! alas!</p>
<p>As to writing some word or other about an event so impressive to me, you shall hear how it stands, and I let you hear without loss of time. A Bookseller here applied to me a week ago to do something of the sort you mention for his magazine. I consented, thinking the man meant to give a Portrait of the deceased, and that if I did not, some other friendly and qualified hand would; whereupon three days ago the man came down to me with the piece in type; but introduced into such an <hi rend="italic">Irish stew</hi> of circumambient matter, that I decided forthwith in having the thing either printed separately, or suppressed. The Bookseller, much surprised at my squeamishness, could not so readily decide; not even to-day, when after your letter I again applied to him. He is in communication with Henry Drummond, has schemes and irons in the fire (a good, well-meaning man, too) and begs to be allowed <hi rend="italic">till Wednesday</hi>.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The &#x201C;Irish stew&#x201D; appears to have been disposed of, and Fraser&#x2019;s for <date when="1835-01-00">January 1835</date> contains an article &#x201C;Death of Edward Irving (No. I)&#x201D; pp. 99&#x2013;101. Carlyle seems to have thought that this was by Henry Drummond (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341224-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1834-12-24">24 Dec.</date></ref>), but according to Andrew L. Drummond, <hi rend="italic">Edward Irving and His Circle</hi> (London, [<date when="1937-00-00">1937</date>]), p. 84, and accepted by the <hi rend="italic">Wellesley Index,</hi> vol. II, it was by B. W. Procter.</note></p>
<p>On Wednesday, then (or more probably Monday), I expect to be able to dispatch you a printed copy of the thing (it is only two pages), and (decide as the man may) liberty to publish it anywhere <pb id="pg-07-345" n="07-345"/>you think fit. I say, decide as he may: for so you will find it, and understand it better than now. I had good mind of Adam Hope, Rector of Annan Academy, and also of old Mr. Johnstone, to both of whom Irving like myself owed much.<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Adam Hope and the Rev. John Johnstone, see <hi rend="italic">Reminiscences</hi>, I, 40&#x2013;41; II, 6&#x2013;14.</note> I had even introduced the latter; but fancying myself writing under <hi rend="italic">such</hi> magazine conditions, found it would not answer.</p>
<p>I often speak of both these men; declare again and again that Adam&#x2019;s history is legible to this day in the population of Annan: the venerable John Johnstone is my model of an Apostolic Priest; more Priestlike in his humble simplicity than Archbishops to me; and more <hi rend="italic">honoured</hi> too, for I have seen the Cuddylane Population (most brutal of the creatures of God) suspend their quarrelling and cursing till <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had passed thro&#x2019; them, and touch their hat reverently to him. So potent is goodness; the idea even in coarsest souls, that here is a good man! Had it been the Archbishop of Canterbury with all his gilt coach-pannels, they would have thrown dead cats at him. I have often told this, to the amazement of the shovel-hatted; and mean to write it somewhere. Will you remember me kindly to Mr. Johnstone the Younger. Say that I still recollect vividly and with gratitude how the first grounds of the Latin tongue began to dawn on me, under his care; for my poor schoolmaster had sunk me into shoreless confusion. I rejoice to hear and see occasionally by the papers that such a man is prosperous and respected.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Wylie (pp. 37&#x2013;38) says that Carlyle &#x201C;had acquired the elements of Latin before going to Annan, having been assisted in the task by a student son of the Secession minister of Ecclefechan, who taught a class in his father&#x2019;s manse when he was at home during the University recess. There is a local tradition that it was the mother who insisted on her eldest boy having the advantage of this classical training. Old James wished little Thomas to &#x2018;<foreign>gang</foreign> and work,&#x2019; which set the child book-worm a-crying bitterly. He told his mother that he wanted to keep to his &#x2018;buiks&#x2019;; and her gentle influence prevailed, against the paternal decision. &#x2026; Young Johnston<supplied>[e]</supplied>, the minister&#x2019;s son, was wont to tell in after years how he discovered that the boy (not yet eight years old) had been privately studying his Latin Rudiments with great industry, but that his grammar and construction were in a chaotic state. After three months drill, however, little Thomas had succeeded in grasping the intricacies of both, and could translate Virgil and Horace with an ease that astonished his tutor.&#x201D; Wylie in a note quotes from &#x201C;a surviving friend&#x201D; of the younger Johnstone: &#x201C;Carlyle continued to retain a warm affection for Mr. Johnston<supplied>[e]</supplied>, who, for a considerable time, occupied a Presbyterian pulpit in Jersey City, New York. They frequently corresponded, and Mr. Johnston<supplied>[e]</supplied> received a copy of every work Carlyle produced. He watched the tendencies of Carlyle&#x2019;s religious views, sometimes with regret, and sometimes with pleasure. When he forwarded his &#x2018;Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell,&#x2019; Mr. Johnston<supplied>[e]</supplied> wrote, thanking him, and complimenting him for his thorough appreciation of the soundness of Calvinistic principles; but following this great work came his biography of John Sterling, which completely demolished Mr. Johnston<supplied>[e]</supplied>&#x2019;s hopes concerning the soundness of his old pupil&#x2019;s religious views.&#x201D; (Doubtless &#x201C;New York&#x201D; in this note is an error for &#x201C;New Jersey.&#x201D;) The earlier tutor who made chaos of Carlyle&#x2019;s Latin studies was &#x201C;Sandy&#x201D; Beattie, the eldest son of &#x201C;Wull&#x201D; Beattie, a young man who had gone through college and was a licentiate of the church but who knew very little Latin. See Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Carlyle</hi>, I, 24&#x2013;25.<lb/><lb/>
Carlyle himself wrote in commenting on Althaus&#x2019; statement that he had received his first instruction in the village school of Ecclefechan: &#x201C;This is hardly correct. My Mother had taught me reading, I never remembered when. &#x2018;Tom Donaldson&#x2019;s School&#x2019; at Ecclefechan,&#x2014;a severely correct young man, Tom; from Edinburgh College, one session probably; went afterwards to Manchester &#x26;c, &#x26; I never saw his face again, tho&#x2019; I still remember it well, as always merry &#x26; kind to me, tho&#x2019; harsh &#x26; to the ill-deserving severe. Hoddam School afterwards; which then stood at the Kirk. &#x2018;Sandy Beattie&#x2019; (subsequently a Burgher Minister in Glasgow; I well remember his &#x2018;examining&#x2019; us that day) reported me &#x2018;complete in English,&#x2019; age then about 7; that I must &#x2018;go into Latin,&#x2019; or waste my time: Latin accordingly; with what enthusiasm! But the poor Schoolmaster did not himself know Latin; I gradually got altogether swamped and bewildered under him; reverend Mr Johnstone of Ecclefechan (or <hi rend="italic">first</hi>, his son, home from College, and already teaching a young Nephew or Cousin, in a careless but intelligent manner) had to take me in hand; and, once pulled afloat again, I made rapid &#x26; sure way: a most exact &#x26; faithful man Mr Johnstone Senior; my Father &#x26; Mother&#x2019;s Minister (Burgher), both of whom he esteemed. The venerablest &#x26; most venerated Clerical Person I have ever seen. White full bottom Wig; income &#xa3;75 to &#xa3;100 a year.&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences,</hi> pp. 29&#x2013;30.</note></p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-346" n="07-346"/>You ask what I am doing? The short answer is: writing Books! The long, plain one would lead us far, too far. I may say in general that I am here to try conclusions with Destiny, and expect the toughest of tough disheartening battles; with which, nevertheless, by God&#x2019;s blessing I am minded to fight, while life is in me. Puffery, Quackery, Delusion, and Confusion of all conceivable sorts prevail to the very heart of literature; so that whosoever <hi rend="italic">declines</hi> serving the Devil in that matter, it is like to go hard with him. &#x201C;Thou shalt die!&#x201D; threatens the Prince of the Power of the Air (for Puffery). &#x201C;Be it so,&#x201D; the antagonist must answer. But the prose truth of the matter is I am daily and nightly putting together a kind of book on the <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, which if I live, will be out by and by. we shall then see what is to be done next. There are a few good men here too; a few, or the place would take fire. One has much to learn; much there is to encourage, if much to obstruct: we must do the best we can.</p>
<p>My wife returns her kind regards; will be greatly pleased to make your acquaintance. Now that I know your Brother&#x2019;s address (Rev. W. J. Hope), I will certainly make him out: he is an old friend of mine; I remember him one winter in Edin<hi rend="italic">h</hi>, very kind to me. Pray tell him so next time you write.</p>
<p><pb id="pg-07-347" n="07-347"/>Your letters were both put into the Post office&#x2014;if the Parliament be dissolved before Wednesday?</p>
<p>I believe I can still get a frank: will try at least. <closer><salute>And now, my dear sir, good night!</salute></closer></p>

<salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
<p>Here is the little piece of writing<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Carlyle&#x2019;s &#x201C;Death of the Rev. Edward Irving.&#x201D;</note> I told you of; which I have had some difficulty in getting a copy of for you at the set time.</p> 
<p>It is to appear in <hi rend="italic">Fraser&#x2019;s Magazine</hi>, as you will see; there is to be some of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] other kind of thing on the same subject printed near it or beside it, from the pen of Henry Drummond.<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341219-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1834-12-19">19 Dec.</date></ref></note> You are at perfect liberty to print <hi rend="italic">this</hi> anywhere and every<hi rend="italic">where;</hi> or (if you judge <hi rend="italic">such</hi> to be the fitter way) to let it stand unprinted: &#x201C;able editors&#x201D; will decide, if you yourself do not. My name had better not be mentioned (tho&#x2019; that is a small matter) in connexion with it: I mean the Editor had better not allude to me; for I suppose you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> tell <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. And so I leave the matter with you.</p> 
<p>Your account of poor Edward&#x2019;s last hours differs very considerably from that current here among his followers. They report speeches of his, etc., etc. I assure every one concerned, that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> authority is one of the most punctual veracious men living, and that I will believe <hi rend="italic">him</hi>. It were perhaps well, however, if you took a little pains to verify all that while it is still time: there may possibly enough some printed Narrative appear, when the contraction is not so ready, and so falsehoods will get themselves perpetuated. It is a very mournful thing for me to find how <hi rend="italic">universally</hi>, except among his own sect, the noble Edward is regarded here, even by tolerant, reasonable men, as little better than an empty quack! Such is the nature of popularity: today in the clouds; to-morrow down in the gutter, and even there not low enough.</p>
<p>The Parl<hi rend="italic">t</hi> not being dissolved, I am still in time for a frank. Woe to you Town-Councillors that <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be Politicians! Whither do you <pb id="pg-07-348" n="07-348"/>think the world is tending? To the <foreign>HOWE POT</foreign> [Bottomless Pit]? That is the Annandale version of it.</p>
<p>If you see M<hi rend="italic">r</hi>. A. Glen (Farie, Glen &#x26; Co., I think they call themselves), pray tell him I received his letters, and was much obliged by them.</p>
<p>My wife joins me in wishing all good to be with you. Surely you will be London some day, or I in Glasgow. Forget me not.</p>

<salute>My Dear Sir;&#x2014;</salute>
<p>Will you again be content with the day of small things? It is late, and my head and hand are weary; yet as a frank is going to Scotsbrig, I must not leave you without a word.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your letter.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Much of William Graham&#x2019;s letter to Carlyle of <date when="1834-12-17">17 Dec.</date> is worth quoting here: &#x201C;I lately saw your <hi rend="italic">handwriting</hi> on the envelope of a Newspaper; it reminded me of what was due to friendship, and I had set me down on Thursday last to make grateful, but too long deferred reply to your justly valued letter of <date when="1834-09-14">14 September</date>, when before I had begun, Mr. Johnstone of Grange called to invite me over to spend a day with him. Almost the first words he uttered were&#x2014;&#x2018;your friend Edward Irving is no more!!&#x2019; I cannot tell you how I felt. Your letter lay on the table. I took it up and read to him all you had wrote of the noble Edward; he was very struck with it, and requested I would bring it in my pocket.&#x2014;Indeed your eulogy of Edward, wrote in tears of <hi rend="italic">honest, tried</hi> friendship, may now serve for his epitaph. He is gone&#x2014;to heaven, I do believe in my <hi rend="italic">inmost soul</hi>. I honour you for all you have said of him, and felt for him; my heart responded to your every sentiment.&#x2014;&#x2018;I was in prison, and he ministered unto me,&#x2019; daily, the ministrations of a Christian friend and counsellor. Could I ever forget him, I were the most ungrateful, the worst of men. His friendship was worth a king&#x2019;s ransom; his aberrations were of the head, not of the heart; his star has disappeared from the galaxy of mighty minds. It is a mournful pleasure to dwell upon what he was. It will ever be a consolation to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that your friendship remained to the last, and that he <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> it <hi rend="italic">well</hi>. Your last meeting and parting will be fixed in the vista of years, in character like a &#x2018;fairy shower,&#x2019; but in permanence like a star!<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;&#x2026; Mr. Menzies got hold of your <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> and retained it for a second reading. &#x2026; Menzies says that no other man but just your <hi rend="italic">very sel&#x2019;</hi> could have wrote the <hi rend="italic">Sartor;</hi> that it abounds with original, profound ideas, with Attic salt of your own manufacture; that in common times it were enough to transmit your name like a bright Galley, on the stream that it is at last to mingle with, and to be swallowed up of, the shoreless Ocean. To review it would require all the talent and learning of its author. My Sister got hold of it and read a whole day most vigorously. Hear her criticism: &#x2018;I <foreign>kent</foreign> it was Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s, for it just <foreign>gangs</foreign> on like a &#x201C;mill shillin&#x201D;&#x2019;!! [A &#x201C;mill shillin&#x201D; is the stream of husked grain flowing continuously from the mill.] Mr. Clow of Land was in raptures with it; but Currie says, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s ta use on&#x2019;t? nobody can tell what he would be at.&#x2019; His son James, however, understood it so well and admires it so much, that it seems to have new-modelled his style of letter-writing. &#x2026; For myself, I think the said Book has done me some harm, for anything else I take up appears altogether <hi rend="italic">wishey washey</hi>. This I do consider a great evil, just as a long dark winter is setting in!<lb/><lb/>
&#x201C;&#x2026; I note what you say of your good self, with more interest than I need to tell you much of; but I do not <hi rend="italic">think aloud</hi> to any one in what regards various relative points of your present position. I give the echo to your own words, &#x2018;Courage, Brother!&#x2019; But have you not courage? Aye! more than any man I ever yet called friend! Have I not seen you, say in Leith Walk, baited by a legion of atrabilliar Devils and their nameless auxiliaries? Courage indeed!! Somehow I think no living man knows you so well as I do. Speak of courage to <hi rend="italic">you!!</hi> In the few short years we have to sojourn hereabout, let it ever be remembered we have eaten <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> together, that the sacred rites of hospitality have passed between us, and that should we ever meet in the <hi rend="italic">melee</hi> of the Devil&#x2019;s raising, we instantly drop our points.&#x201D;</note> It is a most cheery &#x201C;Hurrah for our <pb id="pg-07-349" n="07-349"/>side!&#x201D; the like of which does one&#x2019;s heart good. I can assure you, the sound of it sent new life thro&#x2019; me, like a breath from old true Annandale in the middle of these Babylonian fogs. Surely friends should improve, on far better reason than wines, by long keeping! The very enemy that we might have for twenty years would almost become a friend. While Death thins our ranks, mows down our stateliest, oh surely, surely let the survivors rank themselves the <hi rend="italic">closer</hi>, and await what is appointed them not single but together!</p>
<p>I will send you the mournfullest New Year&#x2019;s Gift in a few days; but one that came from my heart, and will reach into yours: a funeral word on our departed Irving. The Magazine Fraser requested me to write such a thing; which in the feeling of the moment I could not refuse to do: he prints me half a dozen separate copies; and you shall have one. It is but two pages; put it into some blank space in one of Irving&#x2019;s Books, and let it stand there as a memorial for you of him and me. David Hope, who wrote also requesting such a thing gets a copy of this sent off to-night (the others are not yet ready till the new month); and will probably print it in some Glasgow Newspaper. I intend another for poor Mrs. Irving of Annan, whose fate in these vicissitudes seems the mournfullest of all. Widowed indeed! Stript bare and desolate; of husband, sons, and hope on this side the grave. Will you go and call for her when you are at Annan? I feel very sad to think of her household: the old feeling when I <hi rend="italic">last</hi> saw <pb id="pg-07-350" n="07-350"/>Edward there returns on me: he was stepping out to return to wild London; he hit his hat on the door lintel of the little snug cabinet you may remember of: <hi rend="italic">There</hi> was no rest or shelter and warm motherly wrappage for him any more; he must <hi rend="italic">forth;</hi> forth to toil, to confusion, to disappointment, and to death!</p>
<p>The news of that event, as you suppose, fell heavy on me; not unexpected (for I had heard worse news since I wrote to you); yet unexpected <hi rend="italic">so soon</hi>. D. Hope tells me he had no expectation of death himself; they had prophesied &#x26;c., &#x26;c. Alas! Alas! On the whole now when I think of it all, and consider him and his position, there was nothing for him to do but to die. Let us rejoice that he died the death of the just; and pray that our end may be like his.&#x2014; I was anew affected to-day to learn that he had been heard regretting (to Henry Drummond, who partly knew me) that he had been &#x201C;so estranged from his old friend Carlyle of late years&#x201D;! It was indeed a pity for him, a great loss for me, who like yourself owed him much; more, I may say, than man usually owes to man.&#x2014; It is a tragedy if you knew it all, that life of his. But the curtain has fallen now: he is gone, out of your sight; out of our memory never while we remain behind him.</p>
<p>You send me many kind criticisms of poor <hi rend="italic">Teufelsdr&#xF6;ckh;</hi> but none that pleases me more than that of &#x201C;the Mill shillin.&#x201D; Tell Mrs. Howatson<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Graham&#x2019;s sister; see <ref target="volume-01/lt-18200915-TC-WG-01"><sic>1:274</sic><corr>TC to WG, <date when="1820-09-15">15 Sept. 1820</date></corr></ref>, and <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340805-TC-WG-01">TC to WG, <date when="1834-08-05">5 Aug.</date></ref></note> (for I think, it must be she) that I am greatly honoured by having tempted her to reading me, which was not a thing I could expect. Cowie<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Spoken of elsewhere as Sandy Corrie. Carlyle and Jane later quote his comment on <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi> many times with amusement.</note> also speaks to the point, and I do believe as sincerely as any of you: &#x201C;What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> ta use on&#x2019;t?&#x201D; The happiest remains always that I have now done with it, be the &#x201C;use on&#x2019;t&#x201D; either something or nothing.</p>
<p>Thanks also, very hearty thanks for your sympathy and anxiety about me here. It is a confused warfare to venture on; however, I have ventured: &#x201C;<hi rend="italic">I could no other</hi>,&#x201D; as old Luther said in a far grander cause, &#x201C;I can no other; God be my help!&#x201D;<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-03/lt-18240307-TC-JBW-01"><sic>3:44</sic><corr>TC to JBW, <date when="1824-03-07">7 March 1824</date></corr></ref>.</note> And therewith in presence of principalities and powers, the man put on his hat, and stood waiting what might be allotted him. He had said before that: &#x201C;Were there as many Devils in that town as there are tiles on the roofs of it, I must on.&#x201D; Nay, what of Luther? Old John Smeal (oftener named Reckie) the Blacksmith of Ecclefechan, once answered, when a customer threatened to cast him off: &#x201C;Well then, we must just <hi rend="italic">do the best <pb id="pg-07-351" n="07-351"/>we can</hi> for a living, boy.&#x201D;<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-02/lt-18230603-TC-JJ-01"><sic>2:366</sic><corr>TC to JJ, <date when="1823-06-03">3 June 1823</date></corr></ref>.</note> And accordingly old Reckie did it, and succeeded too. Go ye and do likewise! The truth is, when I look abroad over these wonderful persons that drive on their existence here, and consider what <foreign><hi rend="italic">fecklen jenny-spinners</hi></foreign><note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >&#x201C;Weak daddy-long-legs.&#x201D; &#x201C;Fecklen&#x201D; is very probably a misreading for &#x201C;feckless,&#x201D; meaning &#x201C;spiritless&#x201D; or &#x201C;weak.&#x201D;</note> the most of them are, and yet how they live and digest, and get always something to digest, I could take shame to myself, and laugh at the whole business rather than shudder at it. Stout heart and open eye! It is my fixed creed in which I more and more confirm myself, that no true man <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be beaten down by the Devil or the world; alas, their false favour (as our poor Irving may teach us) is far more fatal than their frowns.&#x2014; So I toil along, as stiffly as I can, at this new Book of mine; and if I hope little from the future, fear it perhaps even less. Soon it is <hi rend="italic">over;</hi> so soon! and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> it is not asked, what <hi rend="italic">worth</hi> in Banknotes hadst thou? but quite another question. Forward! Forward!</p>
<p>My health is not so bad as sometimes in the hot dusty weather; I am now very generally what I call unusually well. The Fog-Babylon too does really rather interest me, were it only by its hugeness, and the stupid vitality it has; there are good souls in it too; and one&#x2019;s very sufferings and disappointments (including even the want of <foreign><hi rend="italic">bossness</hi></foreign> [hollowness]) are lessons for one. A great blessing we have here is the possibility to speak or listen to no word about <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi>. The very Radicals in general will hardly trouble you that way except in their public meetings; <hi rend="italic">there</hi> again, if you want it, you may hear enough about it. I went to one some weeks ago, where my old Pupil Buller was presiding: two thousand most grim looking fellows, in bitter earnest! To rule 10 millions of such by the drill sergeant scheme may be work for Wellington, such as he has not tried yet. Peace be with <hi rend="italic">him!</hi> If he want <hi rend="italic">war,</hi> I can promise him plenty of that too; and prettier men have lost their head ere now in such a cause.&#x2014; For me, I declare I can see nothing but <hi rend="italic">destruction to the whole concern;</hi> speedier or slower is of small moment to me.</p>
<p>It is the night before Christmas, Christmas-eve; there are chimes from our old Church of St. Lukes! A blessed night; full of holy remembrances to man. Good night, my friend; may all good be about you, and abide with you.</p>

<p><title>[<hi rend="small-caps">Thomas Carlyle&#x2019;s Notes</hi>]</title></p>
<p>[Carlyle was not, as Althaus had stated, Irving&#x2019;s colleague at Kirkcaldy.] No, I was his &#x201C;rival&#x201D; rather; had been as I found more plainly on arriving there, set up by a discontented opposition-party of his once unanimously admiring constituents; he was 3 or 4 years my senior, the <foreign><hi rend="italic">facile princeps</hi></foreign> [<hi rend="italic">indisputably first</hi>] for success &#x26; reputation among the then Edinburgh Student<supplied>[s]</supplied>; famed Mathematician, &#x26;c, famed teacher (first at Haddington, then here, and <hi rend="italic">paid</hi> beyond example, &#x201C;&#xa3;200 a-year,&#x201D; no less, with two &#x201C;Assistants&#x201D;<supplied>[)]</supplied>; a flourishing man, whom crossfortune (in the shape of myself) was beginning to nibble at! I had been rough to him, too, on the one occasion we had spoken together (had snubbed his grandiloquence to me, finding it a little <foreign><hi rend="italic">de haut en bas,</hi></foreign> in a surly sarcastic way, which raised the laugh against him &#x26; shut him up):&#x2014;in spite of all which, and of my own shy ways, Irving received me with open arms; and was a brother to me, and a friend, then and elsewhere afterwards, at heart <hi rend="italic">constant</hi> till he died. Such a friend as I never had again or before in the world. For these 3 Kirkcaldy years, [actually less than two] when we were continually together; and for the next 2? [&#x201C;3&#x201D; <hi rend="italic">crossed out</hi>] while he was in Glasgow, seen by me from time to time, writing to me often,&#x2014;he was as the sun in my firmament, where all else had become so wintry. His talk was so genial, cordial, free-flowing, hopeful &#x26; delightful to me; all my meetings with him stand out still as sunlit. A man of noble faculties &#x26; qualities; the noblest, largest and brotherliest man, I still say, whom I have met with in my Life-journey. The sad fate he had, &#x26; how it came on him, I have marked elsewhere. His Biography is not yet known; perhaps will never be. Mrs Oliphant&#x2019;s Book is ingenious, well-intentioned, and has a kindly, graceful and attractive quality; but her picture both of his Annan or Scottish and of his London life has little of real portraiture, and strictly speaking (except in the concluding part, where his Letters tell their own tragic, almost sacred story) is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be called <hi rend="italic">like</hi> anywhere. &#x201C;Why not write his Life, yourself?&#x201D; ask some. Alas, the element <pb id="pg-07-353" n="07-353"/>is <hi rend="italic">bottomless;</hi> the labour would be great; the readers mostly questionable, many of them <hi rend="italic">bad;</hi>&#x2014;besides the ground is, for the time, in a sort preoccupied.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Irving&#x2019;s influences on me were manifold; till after his removal to London, and engulfment in the mud-sea of Pulpit Popularity, we were in constant correspondence, &#x26; he knew all my secrets. Afterwards there came silence for most part, so occupied were his thoughts then; silence, but no estrangement, and broken by many a bright gleam in chance meetings. It is to him &#x26; his London journey that I owe my connexion with the Bullers, &#x26; Tutorage of the late Charles Buller; which, in all essentials, was altogether profitable &#x26; pleasant to me. Above all, it is to him, as primary occasion (<hi rend="italic">without</hi> which it had probably never been), that I owe <hi rend="italic">Her</hi> and all she was to me for the last 42 years: Oh Heavens; Oh Time, oh all-engulfing Time! Irving did &#x201C;introduce me to the house&#x201D; at Haddington, but not while Dr Welsh lived, nor in the manner Althaus thinks.&#x2014; But I must stop.<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" ><hi rend="italic">Two Reminiscences,</hi> pp. 37&#x2013;39.</note></p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Mother,</salute>
<p>I did intend writing to you one of these days; and here is Jack&#x2019;s Letter,<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Dated at Rome, <date when="1834-12-10">10 Dec.</date></note> which says plainly, Let it be tonight! My day&#x2019;s work is done, better or worse, and also my day&#x2019;s walking: we have a clear cinder-and-coal fire here, a room almost as quiet as the Scotsbrig one; Jane sits &#x201C;writing to her Mother&#x201D; on the one side of the table; I, on the other, sit writing to mine.</p>
<p>Jack you will find is still well; and has farther got that great enterprise of asking leave to practice happily transacted, nay is actually practising; which I am very glad to hear of. He seems to me to want nothing but <hi rend="italic">work:</hi> his whole life is in danger of becoming too <hi rend="italic">speculative;</hi> and those &#x201C;good advices&#x201D; (not mine but the Apostle Paul&#x2019;s, brethren<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 2 Cor. 8: 10&#x2013;11.</note>) will be much better when translated into good deeds. I am very thankful for poor Jack; as I know, you are, and as we all should be: if he is spared alive, and we with him, we may look <pb id="pg-07-354" n="07-354"/>for more and more comfort on his part. These are <hi rend="italic">great</hi> blessings; which how many want! Let us be grateful for them, and improve them<supplied>[.]</supplied><note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >John had also spoken encouragingly of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus:</hi> &#x201C;I have read &#x2018;Sartor&#x2019; twice over faithfully, and noted all the passages that pleased me especially. There are touches in it that go deeper I think than any thing I have seen of our times, streams of true light through that Serbonian bog lighting up the abysses of Despair. The first time I took it up my head had well nigh been split before I got through the first and second parts. The second time it was more instructive, and I was better able to seperate [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] the ore from the dross, to see the mystic significance beneath that perplexed jargon of half German half English which it has pleased &#x2018;The universal professor&#x2019; to clothe most of his ideas with; and to enjoy and appropriate the fragments of clear and deep Truth that here and there shines forth from amidst it. I think there are the seeds of higher things in that small book than I have found in any work of our times; yet I cannot much regret that it is published so. It is a document lying ready for use, as you observe, and cannot be annihilated. If it be God&#x2019;s will to spare you, you will speak out the truths it contains in a worthier fashion. They will grow in your heart, and in the hearts of those that love and know you. Teufelsdrech [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] has borne the toughest part of the battle with his earth-load, and there is stuff enough in him yet to gain a complete victory, and come forth in triumph, and tell the world the foes he has had and the weapons with which he has overcome them all! There is light on his path, he has escaped from those sulphurious regions of the nether abyss! Poor Teufelsdrech! his &#x2018;Time-case&#x2019; and Earthly Tabernacle has been sadly buffetted, and scathed, but the Light burns only the more purely and fervently within it! I shed hot tears when I think what thou hast come through in that internecine warfare with the Powers of Darkness ! Be of good cheer the time of triumph &#x26; freedom <supplied>[is]</supplied> not distant but at hand!&#x201D;</note></p>
<p>Poor Edward Irving, as you have heard, has ended his pilgrimage. I had been expecting that issue; but not so soon: the news of his death, which Fraser the Bookseller (once a hearer of his) communicated quite on a sudden, struck me deeply; and the <foreign><hi rend="italic">wae</hi></foreign> feeling of what it has all been, and what it has all ended in, kept increasing with me for the next ten days. O what a wild weltering mass of confusion is this world; how its softest flatterings are but bewitchments, and lead men down to the gates of Darkness! Nothing is clearer to me than that Irving was driven half mad and finally <hi rend="italic">killed</hi> simply by what once seemed his enviable fortune, and by the hold it took of him. Killed as certainly (only a little more slowly) as if it had been a draught of sweetened arsenic! I am very sad about him: ten years ago (when I was first here), what a rushing and running; his house never empty of idle or half-earnest wondering people with their carriages and equipments: and <hi rend="italic">now</hi>,&#x2014;alas, it is all <hi rend="italic">gone</hi>, marched on like a deceitful vision, and all is emptiness, desertion, and his place knows him no more! He was <hi rend="italic">a good man</hi> too; that I do heartily believe: <pb id="pg-07-355" n="07-355"/>his faults we may hope were abundantly expiated in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> life; and now his memory, as that of the just ought, shall be hallowed with us. One thing with another, I have not found another such man. I shall never forget these last times I saw him: I longed much to help him, to deliver him; but could not do it. My poor first Friend, my first and best!&#x2014;&#x2014; Bookseller Fraser applied to me to write a word about him; which I did, and after much hithering and thithering I ascertain today that it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> at last to be printed (in some tolerable neighbourhood, for we discorded about that) in his Magazine. I will send you a copy of it, and another for his Mother, which you may deliver her yourself. Go and see the poor old forsaken widow; it will do her good, and yourself: tell her that her son did not live for Time only but for Eternity too; that he has fought the good fight,<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7.</note> as we humbly trust, and is not <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> but sleepeth.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Mark 5:39; Luke 8:52.</note> There are few women whom I pity more than poor old Mrs Irving at this moment: few years ago all was prosperous with her; she had sons, a cheerful household; could say: <hi rend="italic">O Edward I&#x2019;m proud of ye:</hi> Now &#x201C;Ruin&#x2019;s ploughshare&#x201D;<note n="6" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Burns, &#x201C;To a Mountain Daisy,&#x201D; st. 9.</note> has passed over her, and it is all fled.&#x2014; I must mention that David Hope of Glasgow wrote to me; requesting something about the Deceased too, for a Glasgow Newspaper. I now (by bargain with Fraser) enclose him a <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> of that piece with liberty to print it anywhere; which somewhere he will likely do. It is only two Pages, and in the shape of a kind of funeral oration. Mr Johnstone (&#x201C;John Johnstone&#x201D;)<note n="7" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341219-TC-DH-01">TC to DH, <date when="1834-12-19">19 Dec.</date></ref></note> had agreed with Hope that I should be applied to for this end. I have written David&#x2019;s Letter this night, enclosing the thing in it; and now have no more to do.</p>
<p>Jean (or James rather) sent me a welcome little assurance about you one week; Grahame of Burnswark has since that written a most cheerful Letter, in which not the least cheerful thing was an account that you seemed to &#x201C;stand out admirably.&#x201D; Good Grahame, I know, paints in flattering colours, where he loves; but I may believe at least that you were in your ordinary way. When is another Letter coming? You must not let your talent sleep: you can now be independent of any of them. Mrs Welsh had seen Jean lately, and sent comfortable word: she is the punctuallest Correspondent we have, and gives a most faithful picture of everything. The great thing and the small thing are alike interesting at this distance: nay to know what you are <pb id="pg-07-356" n="07-356"/>daily doing, what kind of gown you are wearing, &#x26;c &#x26;c: that is precisely the most interesting of all.&#x2014; You never tell me whether your rooms are any way comfortable. That end one was always <hi rend="italic">damp</hi> since I knew it: I think you should really shift into the big one, and even shift your bed. Above all things, keep a good <hi rend="italic">fire</hi>, and plenty of <foreign><hi rend="italic">hap</hi></foreign> [warm clothing]. Shall I write to Ben Nelson about the Books? Or are you spinning; or what are you doing? Harry will be nearly useless in this hard weather: but you see we are round the corner again; and the day will lengthen, and give us light, if also cold, for</p>
<lg><l>&#x201C;As the day begins to lengthen</l>
<l>The cold begins to strengthen.&#x201D;<note n="8" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Proverbial.</note></l></lg>

This is really a fine spacious place; as broad as your Scotsbrig big room, and somewhat longer; all lined with wainscot, a curiously carved mantle-piece; quite a venerable looking old piece of <hi rend="italic">sufficiency</hi>, with three windows, looking to the South-west, over the street, into potherb gardens, then houses, and when (the wind is blowing) <hi rend="italic">clear</hi> blue sky. There are houses here, let at &#xa3;300 a-year, not intrinsically better than this; or so good, for they have all <hi rend="italic">bugs</hi> in them; and the very Duke of Wellington has to sleep in an iron bed!

<salute>My Dear Mrs. Austin,</salute>
<p>My date, you perceive, is the <date when="1834-03-20">20th</date>, and your letter did not reach us till late in the evening of the appointed <date when="1834-03-19">19th</date>.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >See <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340327-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:123</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-03-27">27 March 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note> We have at the utmost only two Post-days weekly here&#x2014;in general, only one (the Wednesday, which answers to your London Monday); and though last week, as it chanced, both Post-days did their duty, your Express unhappily fell between them; and so here we are. My whole soul grows sick in the business of house-seeking; I get to think, with a kind <pb id="pg-09-399" n="09:399"/>of comfort, of the grim house six feet by three which will need no seeking. In return, I ought to profess myself humble in my requisitions as to that matter. I must have air to breathe; I must have sleep also, for which latter object, <foreign><hi rend="italic">procul, O procul este</hi></foreign> [away, away with you],<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. Vergil, <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi>, VI, 258.</note> ye accursed tribes of Bugs, ye loud-bawling Watchmen, that awaken the world every half hour only to say what o&#x2019;clock it is! Other indispensable requisition I have none.</p>
<p>The house which Lucykin and you describe so hopefully seems as if it had been expressly built for us.<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >In Kensington, for a rent of &#xa3;32 (see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340327-TC-JAC-01"><sic>7:123</sic><corr>TC to JAC, <date when="1834-03-27">27 March 1834</date></corr></ref>).</note> Our answer is at once, secure it for Whit-Sunday, if it be still attainable. Till we hear otherwise, we will still have a kind of hope that it may. If you do so prosper, there will be various other inquiries to trouble you with, various minor arrangements to tax your kind discretion with. For example, what <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the fixtures, beyond grates? We have window-curtains, Venetian blinds, etc. etc., which will be useless here, which might chance to fit them. The measured dimensions of all the rooms and windows (if you can procure them) will bring the whole matter before us. The general outline of the Housekin I already have, by assurance of Imagination; a sunk story, three raised ones, the little bed-quilt of garden before the house or behind it, as it shall please the Fates. You must, on the whole, consent to consider us as a Brother and Sister in this matter; and pray lend us your head as well as your affection.</p>
<p>My Dame bids me say that as to carpets (since those here, not indeed of great value, will go waste if left) nothing can be decided till we know the sizes, and, according to your judgment, the quality and cheapness. The only thing that will be certain of that sort is, perhaps, a fixture already&#x2014;some sort of wax-cloth for a lobby.</p>
<p>I look to London with bodings of a huge, dim, most vexed character. Never shall, with my whole heart, have as much of the &#x201C;Hoping to do yourself&#x201D; as you can undertake. In me is little Hope, or only Hope of a kind that I call &#x201C;desperate&#x201D;&#x2014;a Hope that recognises all earthly things to be <foreign><hi rend="italic">Lug and Trug</hi></foreign> [Falsehood and Deceit]; and yet under them, and symbolically hid in them, are <foreign><hi rend="italic">Ewiges und Wahres</hi></foreign> [Eternity and Truth]; of this same desperate Hope I have for many years (God be thanked for it!) never been bereft, nay, on the whole, grown fuller and fuller of it. For the present, I lie quite becalmed. Not <hi rend="italic">calm</hi>, alas! that is a very different matter. I am doing, and can set at doing, nothing, or as good as that. No line have I written for <pb id="pg-09-400" n="09:400"/>months; only read whole heaps of Books, with little profit. In any case, befall what may, I see it to be the hest of the Unseen Guide that I should come to you, so I come <foreign><hi rend="italic">getrosten Muthes</hi></foreign> [sustained by Courage]. You, my dear Friend, and your kind, hopeful, and helpful words, fall like sunlight through the waste weltering chaos. May the Heavens bless you for it!</p>
<p>And so with all manner of good wishes, and as much of Hope, &#x201C;desperate&#x201D; and other, as may be,</p>
<closer><salute>Ever yours affectionately, /</salute></closer> <name>T. Carlyle.</name>
<ps><p>My wife, full of cares, tumults, and headaches, and I doubt also of indolence, bribes me to write this letter, not unwillingly, which you are to take as hers, and her love with it.</p></ps>

<salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
<p>I expected to have had the pleasure of seeing you again ere now. But I see by the Newspapers, you have been busy with profitable work.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Possibly a reference to H. F. Chorley&#x2019;s work on the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, whose staff he had joined in <date when="1834-01-00">January</date>.

<p>Will you tell your Brother<note n="2" place="bottom" type="gloss" >William Brownsword Chorley, MD, the eldest brother, had sent Carlyle his translation, <hi rend="italic">The Lyre and the Sword of C. T. K&#xF6;rner. With a life of the author and extracts from his letters</hi> (London, <date when="1834-00-00">1834</date>), with a letter, <date when="1834-09-14">14 Sept.</date>, expressing &#x201C;the strong desire to shew you some mark of respect in return for the pleasure and improvement I have received from your writings.&#x201D; John Rutter Chorley (?<date when="1807-00-00">1807</date>&#x2013;<date when="1867-00-00">67</date>) was the principal reviewer of German literature for the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi>, <date when="1846-00-00">1846</date>&#x2013;<date when="1854-00-00">54</date>. Therefore both had the familiarity with German to be working with Goethe&#x2019;s <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>.</note> that I looked thro&#x2019; his Manuscript with interest, that I heartily accede to his doctrine of there being <hi rend="italic">a meaning</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Second Part of Faust</hi>;<note n="3" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Cf. <ref target="volume-07/lt-18340428-TC-JSB-01"><sic>7:137</sic><corr>TC to JSB, <date when="1834-04-28">28 April 1834</date></corr></ref>, where Carlyle, in a letter of <date when="1834-04-00">April</date> to John Stuart Blackie on his translation of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, says: &#x201C;I find considerably <hi rend="italic">more</hi> meaning in the <hi rend="italic">Second</hi> Part.&#x201D;</note> that I sent his Papers to Fraser, the only Periodical Publisher they seemed in the least suited for; and received for answer the Note<note n="4" place="bottom" type="gloss" >Not found.</note> inclosed here,&#x2014;in which <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> seems not at any rate to have been obstructed by undue social <hi rend="italic">Polish</hi>. Other &#x201C;able Editors&#x201D; at this time I have no access to, that were of use.</p>
<p>If your Brother thought it worth his while to <hi rend="italic">compress</hi> what he has got to say on <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi> into the size and figure of a Review Article (say 20 pages), it might be plausibly offered to Cochrane of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Review</hi>.<note n="5" place="bottom" type="gloss" >The <date when="1834-12-00">December</date> issue of the <hi rend="italic">Foreign Quarterly Review</hi> was the last edited by Cochrane.

<salute>My dear Eliza</salute>
<p>What I heard from M<hi rend="italic">rs</hi> Page about the uncertainty of your continuance in your situation at Baker Street has made me very anxious to see Yourself and hear further from your own lips. I am sure you have no friend more sincerely desirous for your welfare in every sense of that word; and if I can find no counsel to give you befitting the perplexity of your circumstances; my true sympathy will not be wholly useless to a good heart like yours. Your loss is one which I know by experience to be the most heartbreaking that can befal any mortal; compared with which indeed the uncertainty thrown over your worldly prospects will seem trifling. And now you have sustained another loss in our poor friend which cannot be light to you who were so greatly attached to him.<note n="1" place="bottom" type="gloss" >For Mr. Miles&#x2019;s death in <date when="1834-11-00">Nov.</date>, see <ref target="volume-07/lt-18341121-JWC-MAC-01"><sic>7:337</sic><corr>JWC to MAC, <date when="1834-11-21">21 Nov. 1834</date></corr></ref>.</note></p>
